Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCorporation\u2014Promoters of\u2014Action against Company and promoters for fraudulent misrepresentation\u2014Action ex delicto for deceit\u2014Fraudulent concealment.\nA suit was brought against a joint stock company, and against four of the shareholders who had been the promoters of the company. The bill alleged that the defendants, other than the company, had been carrying on the lumber business as partners and had become embarrassed: that they then concocted a scheme of forming a joint stock company; that the sole object of the proposed company was to relieve the members of the firm from personal liability for debts incurred in the said business and induce the public to advance money to carry on the business; that application was made to the Government of Ontario for a charter, and at the same time a prospectus was issued which was set out in full in the bill; that such prospectus contained the following paragraphs among others, which the plaintiff alleged to be false:\n1. The timber limits of the company, inclusive of the recent purchase, consist of 222 1\/2 square miles, or 142,400 acres, and are estimated to yield 200 million feet of lumber.\n2. The interest of the proprietors of the old company in its assets, estimated at about $140,000 over liabilities, has been transferred to the new company at $105,000, all taken in paid up stock, and the whole of the proceeds of the preferential stock will be dues for the purposes of the new company.\n3. Preference stock not to exceed $75,000 will be issued by the company to guarantee 8 per cent. yearly thereon to the year 1880, and over that amount the net profits will be divided amongst all the shareholders pro rata.\n4. Should the holders of preference stock so desire, the company binds itself to take that stock back during the year 1880 at par, with 8 per cent. per annum, on receiving six months\u2019 notice in writing.\n5. Even with present low prices the company, owing to their superior facilities, will be able to pay a handsome dividend on the ordinary as well as on the preference stock, and when the lumber market improves, as it must soon do, the profits will be correspondingly increased.\nThe bill further alleged that the plaintiffs subscribed for stock in the company an the faith of the statements in the prospectus; that the assets of the old company were not transferred to the new in the condition that they were in at the time of issuing the prospectus; that the embarrassed condition of the old company was not made known to the persons taking stock in the new company, nor was the fact of a mortgage on the assets of the old company having been given to the Ontario Bank, after the prospectus was issued but before the stock certificates were granted; that the assets of the old company were not worth $140,000, or any sum, over liabilities, but were worthless; and; prayed for a rescission of the contract for taking stock, for re payment of the amount of such stock, and for damages against the directors and promoters for misrepresentation.\nThere was evidence to show that the promoters had reason to believe the prospects of the new company to be good, and that they had honestly valued their assets.\nOn the argument three grounds of relief were put forward:\n1. Rescission of the contract to subscribe for preference stock.\n2. Specific performance of the contract to take back the preference stock during the year 1880 at par.\n3. Damages against the directors and promoters for misrepresentation. The company having become insolvent the plaintiffs put their case principally on the third ground.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the plaintiffs could claim no relief against the company by way of rescission of the contract, because it appeared that they had acted as shareholders and affirmed their contract as owners of shares after becoming aware of the grounds of misrepresentation.\nHeld, also, as to the action against the defendants other than the company for deceit, that the evidence failed to establish such a case of fraudulent misrepresentation as to entitle plaintiffs to succeed as for deceit.\nHeld, also, as to the alleged concealment of the mortgage to the Ontario Bank, it having been given after the prospectus was issued it could not have been in the prospectus, and, moreover, that the shareholders were in no way damnified thereby, as the new company would have been equally liable for the debt if the mortgage had not been given; and as to the concealment of the embarrassed condition of the old company, the evidence showed that the old firm did not believe themselves to be insolvent; and in neither case were they liable in an action of this kind.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario[2] dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 bill.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the judgment in the Chancery Division and in the judgment of Gwynne J. hereinafter given.\nDalton McCarthy Q.C., for the appellants, referred to the following cases and authorities in addition to those relied on in the Chancery Division:\u2014Kerr on Frauds[3]; Smith v. Chadwick[4]; Smith v. Land and House Property Corporation[5]; Mackay v. Commercial Bank of New Brunswick[6]; Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[7]; Ex parte Whittaker, in re Shackelton[8]; Mathias v. Yelts[9].\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. and Walter Cassels Q.C., for the respondents, referred to Dickson v. Reuter Telegram Co.[10]; Jennings v. Broughton[11]; Wood v. Schultz[12].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by GWYNNE J.\u2014The learned counsel for the appellant in his argument before us and in the printed argument contained in the appellant\u2019s factum, thus summarizes the relief claimed:\nThe plaintiffs claim;\u2014\n1. Rescission of the contract to subscribe for preference stock on the ground of misrepresentation, their being no laches on their part, they having repudiated within one month after they became aware of the fraud.\n2. Specific performance of the contract contained in the prospectus should the holders of preference stock so desire, the company binds itself to take that stock back during the year 1880, with eight per cent. per annum on receiving six months notice in writing. The notice was given on the 26th September, 1879.\n3. Damages as against the directors and promoters for misrepresentation, or, as it is called at common law, deceit.\nAnd he adds,\nThe plaintiffs put their case upon the third or highest ground, and the argument is addressed to that and to that alone for two reasons:\u2014First, that it includes the other two, and, also affords the only substantial redress in the premises, the company being insolvent. Secondly, that if it fails it will suffice to the consideration of the other two, as to the success of which the plaintiffs are in little doubt, and will thereby afford them the somewhat thankless remedy in the premises of a set-off for costs. It is, therefore, intended to press all three of the above enumerated rights, but it is frankly admitted that this appeal substantially succeds or fails, except on the question of costs, upon the success or failure to establish the third right.\nIn view of these admissions the relief sought under the two first of the above heads might have been left out of the statement of claim altogether. That sought under the second head is quite inconsistent with that claimed under the first; for specific performance, or rather the fulfilment of a particular term contained in a contract, cannot be enforced if the contract be rescinded. The plaintiff cannot avoid the contract upon the ground of its having been procured by fraud, and at the same time rest upon it as good and valid, so as to entitle him to have the benefit of the company\u2019s contract contained, not in the prospectus which is but an invitation to take stock in the company and is signed by no one, but in the scrip certificate which is under the seal of the company and contains their contract to pay 8 per cent. up to the year 1880, and to take back the stock at par during that year if the holders should so desire, upon receiving six month\u2019s notice. As the plaintiff\u2019s case is that the company is now insolvent, he does not desire to have a decree against it founded upon this term in the contract; nor could he obtain such a decree without abandoning his claim for rescission of the contract, as to which, however, it is sufficient to say that the plaintiff, having been a party to the report made in August, 1879, containing the information upon which the charges contained in his statement of claim are based, and having subsequently acted as a shareholder in virtue of the stock which he says he was induced to subscribe for by the fraud and false representations of the defendants other than the company, and having voted at an election of directors with full knowledge of the several matters now relied upon as the acts of fraud and false representation, he cannot now claim to be relieved of his stock, even if such relief would be of any benefit to him. His sole remedy, therefore, if any he has under the circumstances appearing in evidence, consists in an action in form ex delicto against the defendants other than the company as for deceit, and upon the result of that action alone he must stand or fall, and in consideration of that claim we cannot lose sight of the fact that at the election of directors of the company, held after the report made in August, 1879, by the committee, of which the plaintiff (Petrie) was himself a member, as also was Inglis, he voted for all of the defendants except MacLean, while Inglis voted for all including MacLean, as directors of the company for the ensuing year. At the trial the plaintiff\u2019s case was rested chiefly upon his own evidence of statements which he alleged to have been made to him by MacLean alone, who brought the prospectus to him and asked him to take stock, but this case cannot be rested as against the other defendants upon any false and fraudulent representation, if any, made by MacLean to the plaintiff on that occasion, for three reasons\u2014\n1st. Because in an action of this kind, where the liability arises from wrongful acts of the defendants, although each is liable for all the consequences attending wrongful acts of which they are guilty, yet, the others of them cannot be made responsible for the consequences of a wrongful act of one of them to which the others are not parties. The case against each is distinct, depending upon the evidence against each[13]. MacLean, as a provisional director of the incorporated company, and as one of the partners of the old firm, may have had the authority of the other defendants to take the prospectus around and upon the strength of its statements to canvas for subscriptions of stock, but he was not the agent of the other defendants to make, and had no authority from them to make, any representations outside of the prospectus by which, if false and fraudulent, they could be made responsible for such false and fraudulent representations; if any were made by MacLean, he alone is responsible;\n2nd. As against MacLean himself, this evidence of the plaintiff cannot be relied upon as sufficient, because the evidence in respect of the matters complained of by the plaintiff is not only not corroborated by any other evidence, but is in most material particulars contradicted, not only by MacLean, but also by one Edgar, who was present, and who further gives a narrative of the circumstances under which Petrie signed the agreement to become a subscriber for stock at the foot of the prospectus in the books of the company, wholly different from that given by Petrie; and in an action of deceit it would be very unsafe to proceed upon the evidence of a plaintiff alone not only uncorroborated, but so contradicted by other evidence[14];\nAnd 3rd. Because the only case made by the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim is one of false and fraudulent misrepresentations contained in the prospectus itself. Whether there be in the prospectus itself such false and fraudulent misrepresentations as entitle the plaintiff to recover in this action ex delicto is then the sole question in the case. The preliminary facts may be stated to be, that these defendants, being engaged together as partners in the business of manufacturers of lumber, had acquired certain timber limits and rights to cut timber upon private property, and, in the year 1875, had erected, at considerable expense, a first class saw mill upon their property at Parry Sound, the machinery for which was furnished and put up in the mill by Inglis & Hunter, the plaintiffs in the second of the above actions; and in the year 1876, they had constructed docks at their mill for the convenient shipping of the lumber cut at the mill. In the spring of 1877, having a considerable stock of lumber on hand, and the lumber trade being then in a very depressed condition, and in consequence thereof the value of timber limits being very much reduced, MacLean, who was the manager of the partnership business in charge of the mill and of the sale of its produce, strongly urged upon his co\u2011partners the great benefit it would be to the business if they should take advantage of the low price of limits and acquire some which were in the market, and could be purchased at a low and very advantageous rate. This he persuaded them would be so much to the advantage of their business, that they came to the conclusion, as they had already invested largely in the business, to form a joint stock company of limited liability in order to raise the sum of $75,000 additional capital, which was thought necessary in order to acquire additional limits and to carry on the business on a large scale, so as to secure the benefit of an improved condition in the lumber trade which was looked forward to as likely, shortly, or at no distant day, to take place. Accordingly, upon the information furnished by their manager, in whose judgment they apper to have had implicit confidence, they made an estimate of their liabilities and of their assets, for the purpose of arriving at the amount at which their assets in excess of their liabilities might be estimated, with a view to their taking stock in the joint stock company to that amount, to be deferred to the 175,000.00 proposed to be raised as preference stock, and as a result of this estimate of their liabilities and assets they concluded to take steps for the formation of a joint stock company upon the basis of their taking stock to the amount of $105,000.00, as the estimated value of their interest in the partnership assets and to invite subscriptions for preference stock upon this basis. Accordingly, upon the 28th May, 1877, they entered into an agreement made and executed by all the partners in the firm consisting of the above defendants and one Symon, since deceased, whereby after reciting that the partnership firm, known as the Guelph Lumber Company, were possessed of a mill property, timber limits, timber and other property, and that for the purpose of purchasing additional limits and otherwise extending their business it was desirable to procure additional capital and to form a joint stock company to be incorporated under the name of The Guelph Lumber Company (limited), and that the members of the old company proposed to take paid up stock in the new company for their interest in the assets of the old, the same being estimated for the purpose at $105,000 00, and that the capital stock of the new company should be $300,000.00 divided into 800 shares of $1,000 each. It was mutually agreed as follows:\u2014\n1. That a new company be incorporated under the Joint Stock Companies Act for the purpose of taking over the business and assets of the old partnership firm known as The Guelph Lumber Company, such new company, when incorporated, to take the place of the old in respect of such business.\n2. That MacLean, Guthrie, Hogg, Ferguson and Symon, being the only persons interested in the old partnership agree to accept paid up stock in the aggregate for $105,000.00 in the new company, in the proportions set opposite to their respective signatures in full satisfaction of their interest in the business and assets of the old company when incorporated, and the said new company shall thereupon succeed to and assume all the business and assets of the old company.\n3. That the capital stock of the new company should be $300,000, divided as aforesaid, and the parties thereto agreed to take and subscribe for the number of shares thereof set opposite to their respective signatures.\n4. That the first directors of the new company should be John Hogg, George MacLean and Donald Guthrie, and that the said directors should take steps to procure the incorporation of the new company.\n5. That the said directors are authorized to purchase in trust for the new company any timber and timber limits offered for sale prior to the procuring of a charter.\n6. That the business of the old company should belong to the new company at the time of incorporation on the terms therein specified, notwithstanding any increase or change in the assets thereof, it being Understood that the members of the old company should not, in the meantime, receive any dividend or profit therefrom. The instrument was then subscribed\nBy the defendant Ferguson for 28 shares\n$ 28,000 00\nBy the defendant Hogg for 28 do\n28,000 00\nBy defendant MacLean for 24. do\n24,000 00\nBy defendant Guthrie for 23 do\n23,000 00\nAnd by Charles 3ymon for 2 do\n2,000 00\n$105,000 00\nIn pursuance of this agreement the steps necessary to procure letters patent of incorporation to be issued incorporating the new company under the provisions of the Joint Stock Companies\u2019 Act were taken, which letters patent issued as stated in the plaintiffs statement of claim, namely, upon the 20th of August, 1877.\nIn the meantime a contract having been entered into by Mr. Guthrie on behalf of the old firm with one Dodge for the purchase of certain limits, to be held in trust for the new company in the event of its being incorporated, and the sum of $5,000 having to be paid as a cash instalment of purchase money upon such purchase, the defendant Guthrie himself advanced $8,000, part thereof, and procured Inglis and Hunter to advance the residue, namely, $2,000, and thereupon an agreement was entered into between the old partnership firm, known as the Guelph Lumber Company, and the defendant Guthrie and Messrs. Inglis and Hunter, and signed by them respectively in the terms following: The Guelph Lumber Company having requested Messrs. Inglis and Hunter to make an advance of two thousand dollars and D. Guthrie of three thousand dollars to pay the cash payment required to be paid to secure purchase of 6th June, 1877, from W.E. Dodge of the following timber berths, namely, the Township of Spence, Berth number one, Township of Ferguson, Berth number one, Township of Hagerman, and Berth number three Township of McKillop, it is agreed as follows:\u2014The agreement or agreements for said purchase and said timber berths or the interest of MacLean, Ferguson, Hogg, and Guthrie therein (representing The Guelph Lumber Company) shall be assigned to Inglis and Hunter, in trust to secure them in the first place and said Guthrie in the next place, the repayment of the said respective advances and interest thereon at the rate of 9 per cent. per annum to be repaid in one year after the date, with power of sale of the said timber berths and interest therein in default of payment, interest to be paid yearly.\nIt is further agreed that a formal assignment of said agreement or agreements and said interest in said timber berths shall be made to said Inglis and Hunter, said Inglis and Hunter to hold Guthrie\u2019s interest therein, in trust for such person or corporation as may advance him the money, if any to pay such advance or any part thereof. It is further agreed that the said Inglis and Hunter shall have the option of acquiring an interest in the said company equal to two shares of one thousand dollars each therein, and also that said Guthrie shall have a similar option to acquire an additional interest equal to three shares of $1,000.00 each in said company, such shares to be in an incorporated company with limited liability, and to be preferred shares to those held at present by the old members, and such option to be exercised at any time within one year from the date hereof. It is further agreed that the arrangement witnessed hereby shall apply to the notes this day given to the manager of the said company to secure such advances, such notes, namely, one of two thousand dollars by Inglis and Hunter and one by Guthrie for three thousand dollars to be taken as cash, and before such notes mature the company shall execute the said formal assignment. The company agree that if Inglis and Hunter and Guthrie, or either of them, shall not take stocks as aforesaid to repay to them respectively the amount of such advances and interest thereon half yearly from this date at the rate aforesaid.\nThe stock subsequently accepted and taken by Inglis and Hunter was taken by them in lieu of the $2,000 by them advanced to purchase limits, and secured by the above agreement. Subsequently to the issue of the latters patent of incorporation of the defendants, and others who should become subscribers for stock as a company with limited liability, the provisional directors of the company, namely, Hogg, MacLean and Guthrie, issued the prospectus which contains the statements which are charged to be false and fraudulent, and in the preparation and issuing of that prospectus, the defendant Ferguson also took part, and it was in the month of September, 1877, that Petrie and the other plaintiffs agreed to become subscribers for the shares, which were subsequently, as is admitted, allotted to and accepted by them respectively. Petrie in his evidence seemed to convey that it was before the issue of the letters patent of incorporation, but I take the statement in his statement of claim upon this point, which alleges it to have been after the date of the letters patent, to be more correct, because it was not until the latter end of August or beginning of September, 1877, that Edgar says he went up to inspect the mill premises and its capacity, and it was after he came down that the subscriptions to the prospectus in a book opened by the company were obtained, and Inglis, whose name is on the list before that of Petrie, says that he subscribed his name there in the latter end of September or beginning of October.\nAs to the evidence necessary to support an action of this kind, in its nature ex delicto, there does not appear now to exist any conflict of judicial opinion.\nIn Taylor v. Ashton[15] the plaintiff brought an action ex delicto, against the directors of a bank for statements made by them in certain of their reports, upon the faith of which the plaintiff had purchased shares, and which he alleged to be false and fraudulent. The jury found a verdict for the defendants upon the ground that although the statements complained of were in fact untrue, the defendants had no knowledge of their being so; but they accompanied their verdict with the expression of opinion that the defendants had been guilty of gross and unpardonable negligence in publishing the report. \u00c0 motion was made for a new \u2022 trial upon the contention that the gross negligence so found accompanied with damage to the plaintiff, was sufficient to sustain the plaintiffs action, but Parke B., delivering the judgment of the court, says:\u2014\nFrom this proposition we wholly dissent, because we are of opinion that, independently of any contract between the parties, no one can be made responsible for a representation of this kind unless it be fraudulently made.\nIt was held, however, that in order to constitute actionable fraud, it was not necessary to show that the defendants knew a fact stated as being true to be untrue, if it was stated for a fraudulent purpose, they, at the same time, not believing it to be true.\nOrmrod v. Huth[16] was an action of deceit brought to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff, by reason of his having purchased cotton from the defendant upon the faith of a representation made by him that the bulk corresponded with the sample, which in truth it did not, but was very inferior.\nUpon the trial the learned judge directed the jury that, unless they could infer that the defendants or their brokers were acquainted with the fraud that had been practised in the packing, or had acted in the transaction against good faith or with some fraudulent purpose; the defendants were entitled to the verdict, and this was held by the Court of Exchequer and the Exchequer Chamber to be the proper direction; and the latter court held the rule upon the sale of goods to be that, in the absence of a warranty a purchaser cannot recover on a representation as to quality, unless he can show it to have been fraudulent; that if the representation was honestly made and believed at the time to be true by the party making it, though not true in point of fact, the representation does not furnish a ground of action. This case establishes the principle that in the case of a contract inter parties induced by the representation of one of them, unless the representation be embodied in the contract, it affords no ground of an action, if it be not false to the knowledge of the one making it.\nIn Childers v. Wooler[17] it is laid down as established by Collins v. Evans[18] in Error, and numerous other authorities, that to support an action for false representation, the representation must not only have been false in fact, but must also have been made fraudulently.\nThe case of the Western Bank of Scotland v. Addie[19] establishes that representations made by directors of a company relative to the affairs of the company, which they do not believe to be true, or have no reasonable grounds to believe to be true, will, if untrue, give a good cause of action in deceit to a person suffering damage from such representation. If the directors bon\u00e2 fide believe the representation to be true, the action will not lie, but then the bon\u00e2 fides of the belief is a fact which is to be tested and determined upon a consideration of the grounds of belief; but before we can arrive at the conclusion that the representations were made fraudulently and not under the influence of a bon\u00e2 fide belief in their truth, the insufficiency of the grounds to warrant such belief should be apparent beyond all controversy, for some persons may entertain a bon\u00e2 fide belief in the existence of a fact upon grounds which, in other minds, might not give birth to the same belief, and the question is not whether, in the opinion of the persons testing the bona fides of the belief of another in the existence of the fact, there were sufficient grounds to warrant the belief, but whether in point of fact the belief was bona fide entertained by the persons who assert that they entertained it. As said by Lord Cramworth in that case, persons who make statements which they bon\u00e2 fide believe to be true, cannot be said to be guilty of fraud because other persons think, or the court thinks, there was not sufficient grounds to warrant the opinion they had formed. In Venezuela Railway Company v. Kisch[20], which was a case in which a shareholder in a company sought relief from his contract as a shareholder upon the allegation that he was induced to subscribe for shares by false representations contained in a prospectus issued by the company, Lord Chancellor Chelmsford, adopting the decision of V.C. Kindersley in New Brunswick and Canada Ry. Co v. Muggeridge[21], as enunciating the rule applicable in such cases, says:\nThose who issue a prospectus holding out to the public the great advantages which will accrue to persons who will take shares in a proposed undertaking, and inviting them to take shares on the faith of the representations therein contained, are bound to state everything with strict and scrupulous accuracy, and not only to abstain from stating as fact that which is not so, but to omit no one fact within their knowledge, the existence of which might in any degree affect the nature or extent, or quality of the privileges and advantages which the prospectus holds out as inducements to take shares.\nIn Reese River Silver Mining Co. v. Smith[22], which was also the case for relief by a shareholder from his contract for subscription of shares induced by like false and fraudulent statements, etc., in a prospectus, Lord Cairns says:\nI hardly think it was gravely argued at the bar that in this case a fraud had been committed against the respondent\u2014when I say a \u201cfraud\u201d I do not enter into any question with regard to the imputation of what may be called fraud in the more invidious sense against the directors. I think it may be quite possible, as has been alleged, that they were ignorant of the untruth of the statements made in their prospectus; but I apprehend it to be the rule of law that if persons take upon themselves to make assertions as to which they are ignorant, whether they are true or untrue, they must, in a civil point of view, be held as responsible as if they had asserted that which they knew to be untrue.\nPeck v. Gurney[23] was, on the contrary, a bill against directors in form ex delicto to recover damages from them for the wilful suppression and concealment from their prospectus, for the formation of a company in which the plaintiff had become a shareholder upon the faith of the truth of the statements made in it, of a deed which, if mentioned in the prospectus, would have shown the statements which were made in it to be positively untrue. Lord Chelmsford there says:\nThis is a suit instituted to recover damages from the respondents for the injury the appellant has sustained, by having been deceived and misled by their misrepresentations and suppression of facts to become a shareholder in the proposed company of which they were promoters. It is precisely analogous to the common law action for deceit. There can be no doubt that equity exercises a concurrent jurisdiction in cases of this description, and the same principles applicable to them must prevail both at law and in equity. I am not aware (he adds) of any case in which an action at law has been maintained against a person for an alleged deceit, charging merely his concealment of a material fact which he was morally, but not legally, bound to disclose.\nAnd after quoting cases in support of this view he adds:\nAssuming that mere concealment will not be sufficient to give a right of action to a person who, if the real facts had been known to him, would never have entered into a contract, but that there must be something actively done to deceive him, and to draw him to deal with the person withholding the truth from him, it appears to me that this additional element appears in the present case. He then proceds to show how the matter, which was designedly suppressed so falsified what was stated as to constitute a positive and active misrepresentation of the truth.\nAnd Lord Cairns in that case shows that he also recognizes the distinction between the rule applicable in a case simply for rescission of a contract, and that applicable in an action for deceit.\nThis suit (he says) is in the nature of an action for damages for misrepresentation, it is in the nature of an action or proceeding ex delicto.\nAnd again:\nI entirely agree with what has been stated by my noble and learned friends before me, that mere silence could not, in my opinion, be a sufficient foundation for this proceeding. Their non-disclosure of material facts however, morally censurable, however the non\u2011disclosure might be a ground in a proper proceeding, at a proper time for setting aside an allotment or a purchase of shares, would, in my opinion, form no ground for an action in the nature of an action for misrepresentation. There must, in my opinion, be some action, misstatement of fact, or at all events, such a partial and fragmentary statement of fact as, that the withholding of that which is not stated, makes that which is stated, absolutely false.\nAnd he proceeds to show how the deed, the existence of which was designedly withheld, showed the statements which were made in the prospectus to be absolutely false.\nIn Eaglesfield v. Marquis of Londonderry[24] Lord Justice James says:\nThat in order to maintain a case of misrepresentation in an action of deceit the representation must be wilful and fraudulent.\nWhether the fraud, (he says) is supposed to be a fraud in this court as distinguished from moral fraud or not, there must be a wilful and fraudulent statement of that which is false to maintain an action of deceit.\nIn Arkwright v. Newbold[25], which was an action in form ex delicto to recover damages from the defend ants for injury sustained, as was alleged by the plaintiff, by reason of his haying been induced to subscribe for shares in a company of which the defendants were promoters and directors and secretary, upon the faith of statements contained in a prospectus issued by the defendants, Lords Justices James and Cotton recognize in the clearest language the difference existing between tie nature of the misrepresentation requisite to sustain an action for deceit and that which is sufficient for the rescission of a contract. Reversing the judgment of Fry J.,[26] Lord Justice James says:\nIt appears to me, with all deference to him, that there has been on his part a confusion, if I may use the expression, between two different wrongs and two different remedies\u2014between the question what mala praxis on the part of vendors and persons standing in a fiduciary position to a purchaser is sufficient to entitle the purchaser to rescind the contract, and the question what mala praxis is sufficient to enable him to maintain an action of deceit. There are a number of purely equitable considerations which arise when the courts are dealing with actions to set aside contracts or conveyances which have been obtained by means of misrepresentation of a fact, or by means of concealment or suppression of a fact which, in the opinion of the court, ought to have been stated. Those cases stand by themselves, and are entirely distinct from such a case as we have before us.\nAnd again:\nIt has been conceded throughout that there has been misconduct, that is to say, improper dealing between the vendors and the persons whom they procured to become directors\u2014a kind of transaction against which the courts always have, and I hope always will, very strongly set their faces. But we have to see whether there was, to use the language of Lord Cairns in Peck v. Gurney,[27] that which must be proved\u2014some active misstatement of fact, or at all events such a partial and fragmentary statement of fact as that the withholding of that which is not stated makes that which is stated absolutely false. The statement made must be either in terms, or by such an omission as I have stated, an untrue statement, and no mere silence will ground the action of deceit.\nAnd Lord Justice Cotton[28] says:\n1 think it is in this case essential to consider what the action is, and 1 say so because a great deal of the argument and a considerable portion of the learned judge\u2019s judgment does not, in my opinion, draw a sufficient distinction between an action of deceit and an action or proceeding to set aside a purchase, or to make the directors of a company answerable for money which they received by reason of their being in a fiduciary position. An action of deceit is a common law action, and must be decided on the same principles, whether it be brought in the Chancery Division or in any of the common law divisions; there being, in my opinion, no such thing as an equitable action for deceit. It is a common law action in which it is necessary to prove that a statement has been made, which, to the knowledge of the person making it, was false, or which was made by him with such recklessness as to make him liable, just as if he knew it to be false, and that the plaintiff acted on that statement to his prejudice or damage. Much has been said about omission\u2014of course I adopt what was said by Lord Cairns\u2014that the omission of something in a prospectus or any other document may make the statement contained in it false, as, for instance, if it contained the statement of a covenant and omitted to state the fact that the covenant had been released; but mere omission, even though such as would give reason for setting aside a contract, is not, in my opinion, if it does not make the substantive statements false, a sufficient ground for maintaining an action of deceit. It also must be borne in mind, that in an action for setting aside a contract which has been obtained by misrepresentation, the plaintiff may succeed although the misrepresentation was innocent; but in an action of deceit the representation to found the action must not be innocent, that is to say, it must be made either with knowledge of its being false, or with a reckless disregard as to whether it is or is not true. That difference is material in regard to the question whether or not the plaintiff in this action is entitled to succeed.\nRedgrave v. Hurd[29] was a case in which the plaintiff sought specific performance of a contract entered into by him with the defendant, who resisted the performance and claimed a return of his deposit of \u00a3100, upon the ground of misrepresentations made to him by the plaintiff in relation to the subject of the contract, and he, also, in his counter claim, claimed \u00a3300 for other damages sustained by him ultra the \u00a3100 recoverable upon the rescission of the contract, as having been incurred by the deceit of the plaintiff. The case of the respondent was two-fold\u2014first, for rescission of the contract, and as incident thereto, the return of his deposit, and second, for recovery of damages, by way of counter claim, in an action of deceit. Now, this case, although much pressed upon us by the learned counsel for the appellants in support of their right to recover in this action, in consequence of certain observations of Sir George Jessel M.R., set out below and upon which the learned counsel relied, seems to me to point out very clearly the distinction between an action of deceit and one for rescission of a contract, to which latter species of action the observations of the master of the rolls related.\nAs regards the defendant\u2019s counter claim (the learned master of the rolls says[30], we consider that it fails so far as damages are concerned, (that is to say, so far as it is in form ex delecto for deceit), because he has not pleaded knowledge on the part of the plaintiff that the allegations made by the plaintiff were untrue, nor has he pleaded the allegations themselves in sufficient detail to found an action for deceit.\nBut as to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for specific performance, and so much of the defendant\u2019s counter claim as asks for the rescission of the contract and, as involved therein, the return of his deposit, the learned master of the rolls said:\nBefore going into the details of the case I wish to say something about my views of the law applicable to it, because in the text books, and even in some observations of noble lords in the House of Lords, there are remarks which, I think, according to the course of modern decisions, are not well founded and do not accurately state the law. As regards the rescission of a contract there was no doubt a difference between the rules of the Courts of Equity and the rules of courts of common law\u2014a difference which, of course, has now disappeared by the operation of the Judicature Act, which makes the rule of equity prevail. According to the decision of courts of equity it was not necessary, in order to set aside a contract obtained by material false representation, to prove that the party who obtained it knew at the time when the representation was made that it was false. It was put in two ways, either of which was sufficient. One way of putting the case was: A man was not to be allowed to get a benefit from a statement which he now admits to be false. He is not to be allowed to say for the purpose of civil jurisdiction that when he made it he did not know it to be false\u2014he ought to have found that out before he made it. The other way of putting it was this: Even assuming that moral fraud must be shown in order to set aside a contract, you have it, where a man having obtained a beneficial contract by a statement which he now knows to be false, insists upon keeping the contract. To do so is a moral delinquency, no man ought to seek to take advantage of his own false statements. The rule in equity was settled, and it does not matter on which of the two grounds it was rested. As regards the rule of common law, there is no doubt it was not quite so wide. There were indeed cases in which, even at common law, a contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, although it; could not be shown that the person making it knew the representation to be false. They are variously stated, but I think according to the later decisions the statements must have been made recklessly, and without care whether it was true or false, and not with the belief that it was true. But, as I have said, the doctrine in equity was settled beyond controversy, and it is enough to refer to the doctrine of Lord Cairns in the Reese River Silver Mininy Company v. Smith[31], in which he lays it down in the way which I have stated.\nThen in Smith v. Chadwick, in the same vol.[32], which was an action for deceit in form ex delicto, the same learned judge says[33]:\nThis is an action, which used to be called an action of deceit, brought by a gentleman against a firm of financial agents for inducing him to take shares in an iron company by means of false and fraudulent representations\u2014that is, by means of representations which were material to induce him to take the shares, which were false in fact, false to the knowledge of the defendants, or as to which, at all events, they made statements, although they knew nothing about the facts\u2014that is, statements made so recklessly, that in a court of law they would be in the same position as if the statements were false to their knowledge. That is the case which the plaintiff has to make out, the real questions we have to try are, whether there were representations false m fact\u2014whether if any of these representations were false in fact they were false to the knowledge of the defendants, or recklessly made by them?\nAnd again he says:\nAgain, in an action of deceit, even though the statement may be untrue, yet if it was made in good faith, and the defendant had reasonable ground to believe it to be true, the defendant will succeed.\nIn this case in the House of Lords to which it was carried[34], Lord Blackburn expresses his entire concurrence with what was said by Cotton L.J., in Arkwright v. New bold, that an action of deceit is a common law action, and must be decided upon the same principles, whether it be brought in the Chancery Division, or any of the common law divisions, there being no such thing as an equitable action for deceit, and Lord Bramwell[35] says:\nI am not satisfied that these men did not believe the statement to be true; under these circumstances I am not dissatisfied that your lordship\u2019s should affirm the judgment that has been given in their favor. The question is not whether they should be in any way punished for most improvident and rash statements (more than one) in the prospectus, but whether we are satisfied that this particular statement was fraudulent as well as, what it was to my mind, an untrue statement. I am not satisfied of that\u2014let me not be misunderstood: an untrue statement, as to the truth or falsity of which the man who makes it has no belief, is fraudulent, for in making it he affirms that he believes it, which is false.\nThe learned Law Lord\u2019s judgment was in favor of the defendants, because, although he believed the statement in question to have been untrue, in fact, still he was not satisfied that the defendants did not believe it to be true; and upon the question of bona fides of the defendants\u2019 belief, he rested upon their own evidence on the cause and the fact that one of them gave convincing proof of his sincerity by taking \u00a3500 of stock in the company. The learned counsel for the appellant also strongly contended that the language of Lord Justice Knight Bruce in Rawlins v. Wickham[36] was in support of the maintenance of the present action, but that was not an action in its nature ex delicto for deceit, but in its nature ex contractu to set aside a contract of partnership into which the plaintiff had been induced to enter with Bailey, one of the defendants, and Mr. Wickham, since deceased (whose executors were the other defendants) by a positively false statement as to the liabilities of a banking firm, of which Bailey and Wickham were the sole members, furnished to the plaintiff to induce him to enter the partership firm, he having required to be furnished with a statement of such liabilities before he would consent to becoming a partner; and the plaintiff, by his bill, sought for reimbursement of the money paid by him on entering the firm, with interest to be made to him out of the estate of Wickham; Bailey, against whom he had recovered in an action at law, having become insolvent. If this action had been one in its nature ex delecto for deceit, the plaintiff must have failed, for, as said by Lord Chelmsford in Peck v. Gurney\u2014\nNo case can be found in which upon a claim against a testator ex delicto executors have been held liable in equity to answer in damages.\nIt is to the nature of the action as one to set aside a contract, and to obtain indemnity out of the estate of the testator who benefited by the false statement to which he was a party, that the observations of the lord justice relate. The false representation vitiated the contract of partnership, and therefore the plaintiff was entitled to obtain and obtained redress by a decree that it should be set aside, and that the plaintiff should be reimbursed out of the estate of Wickham for the money paid by him on his joining the firm. The contention of the learned counsel was that since the Judicature Act the same rule as governed courts of equity in cases like the above, for setting aside contracts and reimbursing to the plaintiff the amount paid by him on the contract being entered into, applies now to a claim in its nature ex delicto for deceit, but that is not so; if it were, then all the judgments in the cases above cited, laying down what is necessary to be established in a claim for damages for deceit, would be erroneous. With respect to such a claim the Judicature Act makes no difference whatever. The clause relied upon is that which makes provision that in all matters in which there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of common law with reference to the same matter the rules of equity shall prevail. This rule applies, doubtless, to the cases of actions brought upon a contract, the defence to which is that it was obtained by fraud, of which nature were Corafoot v. Fouke[37] and Evans v. Edwards[38], or to an action for money had and received to recover back money paid upon a contract procured to be entered into by defendant by the fraud of the plaintiff, of which nature was Clarke v. Gibbs[39]. In such cases the rule of equity, as stated by Sir George Jessel in Redgrave. v. Hurd, governs under the above provision in the Judicature Act; for in those matters, that is those relating to the rescission of contracts, there was a conflict between the rule of equity and the rule of common law with reference to the same matter. But an action to enforce a contract, the defence to which is that it was obtained by frauds or an action for specific performance of a contract which is resisted on the ground of fraud, or an action for rescission of a contract, which are all in their nature ex contractu, are matters wholly different from an action to recover damages for deceit, which is in its nature ex delicto, as to which matter there never was any of rule of equity other than the rule of common law, consequently in such a matter there can be no conflict between a rule of equity and a rule of common law, and the provision of the Judicature Act is not that a rule of law, which is applicable to one particular matter and to an action of one nature, shall give place to a rule of equity, which is applicable to a wholly different matter and to an action of a different nature. As to the paragraph in the statement of claim, alleging that the defendants other than the company by the prospectus promised to whomsoever should become an applicant for a share or shares, in the proposed preference stock, that they would fulfil the undertaking and make good the representations in the prospectus contained, &c., &c., &c., &c., there is no foundation for this contention. The prospectus is signed by no one, and does not in fact contain any such promise or warranty. For the representations made in it, if false and fraudulent, the defendants are responsible in an action ex delicto like the present, but not at all ex contractu, for there is no contract contained in it, it is merely an invitation to the parties to whom it is presented and to the public to take shares, but it contains no contract upon the part of the defendants issuing it. The signature of the plaintiff to the undertaking at the foot of the prospectus in the books of the company to take shares to the amount set opposite to his name, if allotted to him by the company, is an offer made to the company which, when the allotment takes place, matures into a contract with the company. In this case the plaintiff\u2019s contract became complete when he accepted the shares, which could not have been until some time in or after the month of March, 1878, inasmuch, as although the company was incorporated on the 20th August, 1877, they did not obtain power to issue the preference shares until an Act was passed by the Legislature of Ontario on the 7th March, 1878, 41 Vic., ch. 8, sec. 16 of which gave them the power, and the certificate of allotment subsequently issued to the plaintiff contains the terms of his contract, which is with the company and not with the defendants other than the company. Between these latter defendants and the plaintiff there is no contract. The learned judge before whom the case was tried was of opinion that the evidence wholly failed to establish the case made by the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, and he dismissed the claim; the learned counsel for the appellant, while admitting that the evidence failed to establish the wilful and deliberate conspiracy to defraud charged in the statement, still insisted that it displayed a reckless disregard, whether the statements contained in the prospectus were true or false, and a fraudulent concealment of material facts, if such facts were necessary to be established to entitle the plaintiff to recover; but all that was necessary to be established, as he contended, was such misrepresentation as upon the authority of Redgrave v. Hurd and Rawlins v. Wickham, and cases of that class, was sufficient to call for a rescission of his contract for shares, in a court of equity. I have already shown that such evidence, as is sufficient in cases for rescission of a contract, is not sufficient to support an action of the nature of the present which is for deceit, and arises ex delicto and not ex contractu. Now, having read with the greatest care every particle of the evidence, and having given the best consideration I could to the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant, as delivered orally before us, and as expanded at large in his printed factum, I feel compelled to say, that in my opinion, the defendants are not only free from any just imputation of the gross fraud with which they are charged in the statement of claim, but that they are equally free from any reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the statements made in the prospectus, and that they prepared that document with an honest intention of fairly representing, according to their knowledge, the condition of the business for the taking up which the company was proposed to be incorporated, and that they bon\u00e2 fide believed to be true every statement made in the prospectus, both as to the condition of the business in which they were engaged and as to the prospects of the proposed company, of which I think they have given, in addition to their evidence upon oath in the cause, the strongest possible proof by having taken among themselves $40,000, or more than 50 per cent. of the preference stock issued by the company; and I cannot but add, that the fact that the plaintiffs in these three suits voted for the defendants as directors of the company after they had made the investigation, in which they acquired all the information upon which they based these actions and caused them to be brought, seems to my mind to show that the plaintiffs themselves did not believe the defendants to be guilty of the frauds now imputed to them, the charges as to many of which as appears by the examination of the plaintiff, seem to owe their origin to the zeal of the pleader who prepared the statement of claim rather than to the plaintiff or any information derived from him. The defendants interrogated the plaintiff very precisely, requiring him, as to each of the allegations of misrepresentation contained in his statement of claim, and as to each paragraph of the prospectus, to state in what he considered the falsity charged to consist, and be resolved all into an objection as to the value of the mill and timber limits, and as to the amount of the assets. In the following paragraphs of the prospectus are involved all the grounds of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint:\n1. The timber limits of the company inclusive of the recent purchase consist of 222 1\/2 square miles, or 142,400 acres and are estimated to yield 200 million feet of lumber.\n2. The interest of the proprietors of the old company in its assets, (estimated at about $140,000 over liabilities has been transferred to the old company at $105,000 all taken in paid up stock, and the whole of the proceeds of the preferential stock will be used for the purposes of the new company.\n3. Preference stock not to exceed $75,000.00, will be issued by the company to guarantee 8 per cent. yearly thereon to the year 1880, and over that the net profits will be divided among all the shareholders pro rat\u00e2.\n4. Should the holders of preference stock so desire, the company binds itself to take that stock back during the year 1880 at par with 8 per cent. per annum on receiving six months\u2019 notice in writing.\n5. Even with present low prices the company, owing to their superior facilities, will be able to pay a handsome dividend on the ordinary as well as on the preference stock, and when the lumber market improves, as it must soon do, the profits will be correspondingly increased.\nNow, the sole objection to the first of the above paragraphs consists in the estimate of the yield of lumber from the limits which, as was contended, was grossly-excessive. In the opinion of one witness called by the defendants, an experienced government wood ranger an expert in such matters, the estimate of the defendants is under the mark. In the opinion of another, himself an owner of limits and a manufacturer of lumber, it was much below the mark; of two witnesses called by the plaintiff, who were also lumberers, one said that from the results of a careful investigation, taking the whole area of water, rock and timber in the region in which defendants limits are, he estimated one million feet per square mile, the fair average production, leaving one-third of that still remaining to be cut at a future period, but that in a well timbered limit it will often yield two or three million to the mile, and the other said, that one million feet per square mile is the fair average estimate in the original state, but he, with a view to making an offer for the defendants company\u2019s limits since the disaster which has befallen the company, deducted from the total product calculated upon that average, 30 million feet for losses by fire and taken away by settlers, which estimate of loss did not appear to be founded on any actual data, but was to all appearance quite conjectural. As to the evidence of the two other witnesses called by the plaintiff upon this point, it is only necessary to say that it was utterly unreliable in consequence of the partial inspection, which, by their own showing they made of the limits; their object apparently being, in the interest of their employers, who also contemplated purchasing since the failure of the defendant company, to depreciate the limits rather than to estimate them at their fair value. Upon this evidence the plaintiff has, in my opinion, wholly failed to establish that the estimate of the quantity of lumber on the limits stated in the prospectus was inaccurate, much less fraudulently so. As to the second of the above paragraphs, it has been treated in argument by the learned counsel for the appellant as if the defendants had in this paragraph made a positive assertion as matter of fact that the value of their assets exceeded their liabilities by $140,000, and that such statement was untrue in fact, as was the statement of liabilities made by Bailey and Wickham in Rawlins v. Wickham; but no such positive assertion is made in the paragraph. The defendant Guthrie explained that their object was, as I think the paragraph itself seems clearly enough to show, to ascertain at what rate in paid up stock of the incorporated company the interest of the partners in their assets might be fairly estimated, and that having, upon as careful a calculation as they could make of the value of property of the nature of that under consideration, came to the conclusion that the value of their assets in excess of their liabilities was about, or in the neighborhood of, $140,000. They, in order to make sure of arriving at a fair estimate, deducted 25 per cent. from that amount, and so arrived at the $105,000. Now, upon the recent investigation which has taken place in this suit, it appears that some liabilities escaped observation; I say \u201cescaped observation\u201d because the evidence fails, I think, wholly to establish any intentional suppression \u2022 of them; it is also sworn that some of the assets were under estimated in the calculation by which the sum of $105,000 was arrived at, and that the liabilities which escaped observation fell short of the 25 per cent. which was deducted from the $140,000. The evidence, therefore, in my opinion, fails to establish that the estimate of $105,000, as the amount for which the defendants should have paid up stock in the incorporated company, was arrived at by any reckless disregard of the truth or falsity, or of the accuracy or inaccuracy of such estimate. All that the plaintiff said when asked to explain his objection to this paragraph, and what he understood by it, and wherein its falsity consisted, was that he understood that the defendants, the old firm, would receive stock to this amount of $105,000 for the estimated $140,000, and that when the new company should be formed they would assume the business, and that there was a binding contract to that effect which would be carried into effect upon the company becoming incorporated. Well, that expectation does not seem to have been disappointed to the plaintiff\u2019s prejudice or at all. It was contended also that the proceeds of the preference stock was not applied to the uses of the new company, as. the paragraph had said that they should be, If not so applied that was a matter occurring after the prospectus had been issued, and could not make false any statement contained therein or make the defendants liable as for deceit for issuing it, whatever claim the company might have against its directors for misappropriation of the funds of the company. But the plaintiff in his examination admitted that he knew there were liabilities of the old firm, as to the amount of which he made no enquiries, but he knew that part of the proceeds of the new stock was to be applied towards the payment of these liabilities. He also knew that the business was to be transferred from the old firm to the new company as a going concern, and that it was to be continued right along until it should be transferred to the new company, and such was the nature of the business that to carry it on, new liabilities would naturally have to be incurred in carrying it on in 1877 and 1878; and there is no pretence that the proceeds of the preference stock were applied to any other purpose than towards payment of instalments upon the recent purchases of new limits, and of the liabilities of the old firm assumed by the company, and of the expenses incurred in carrying on the business for the benefit of the incorporated company under the terms of the agreement of the 28th May, 1877. The persons who received the proceeds of the preference stock were the directors of the incorporated company, and if they have misappropriated any of the funds of the company they may be made answerable for such breach of trust in an appropriate proceeding, but not in an action of the nature of the present.\nThe plaintiffs claim, in respect of the 3rd and 4th of the above paragraphs, is in its nature ex contractu and against the company, founded upon the contract as evidenced by his scrip certificate of stock held by him, and not one ex delicto against the defendants for deceit. However, in the 5th paragraph, the plaintiff contends that the defendants, in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the matter therein, stated fraudulently and represented the prospects of the company to be better than they could have believed them to be. As to this charge I have already said that I have come to the conclusion that the defendants bon\u00e2 fide entertained the expectations set forth in this paragraph. The question is not whether, in the opinion of the witnesses called in this cause or of the court, these expectations were well founded, but whether in point of fact the defendants bon\u00e2 fide entertained them, and that they did so entertain them they have, in my opinion, given the best possible proof by taking among themselves $40,000 of the stock which they invited others to take.\nSome of the evidence, given on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf, is sufficient to establish that the great disaster which has befallen the company within the short period of 2\u00bd years after its incorporation, may fairly be attributed to bad management, coupled with a continued depression in the timber trade, which, instead of improving as was expected in 1877, became worse and continued so until 1880 or 1881. In the timber business success is said to depend wholly on the management, which, according as it is good or bad, may readily make a difference of $2.00 on every 1,000 feet of lumber cut. Now MacLean\u2019s management has been condemned by the witness, who thus speaks of good management as the essential element of success in the lumber business, and it may well be that the disaster which has befallen the shareholders in this company, and from which the defendants themselves are the chief sufferers, is attributable to MacLean\u2019s bad management, but bad management and fraud are matters very different in their nature; moreover the evidence shows that there are those who entertain the belief that if the creditors of the company could have waited for another year when prosperity returned to the lumber trade, the expectations of the promoters would have at length been realized.\nThe only remaining point is that of the alleged fraudulent concealment.\nThe only matters relied upon as having been concealed are the execution of the mortgage to the Ontario Bank in January, 1878, and the fact that at the time the prospectus was issued, the old partnership firm were, as the plaintiff alleges the fact to be, in a state of hopeless insolvency. As to the former, as it was a matter which occurred long after the issuing of the prospectus, it could not be stated in the prospectus; but, in truth, the giving of this mortgage did not place the plaintiff in any different position from that in which he would have been if the mortgage had not been given. The plaintiff knew that the business was to be carried on as before until the incorporated company should be completely organized, but for and in the interest of the proposed company, and for this purpose, in order to carry on the business in the winter of 1877-78, it was necessary to get an advance from the Bank of Ontario, which they gave to the directors of the company which was incorporated by letters patent in the month of August, 1877, on the condition that security should be given to the bank by mortgage for the sum so advanced and the debt of the old partnership firm; and as the title to the property mortgaged still remained in the members of the old firm, they executed the mortgage; but the incorporated company would have been equally liable for the whole amount secured by this mortgage, if the mortgage never had been executed; so that, in point of fact, the mortgage made no difference whatever in the position in which the plaintiff, as a shareholder, would have been, if the mortgage had not been given.\nAs to the allegation that the prospectus was issued by the defendants when they knew that they were in a state of absolute insolvency, it is only necessary, in my opinion, to say that the defendants did not know or believe themselves to be, if they were in fact, in any such state. The term insolvency, as here applied, cannot be used in the strict sense in which that term was used in the Insolvent Act, when it was in force, namely, an inability to pay all their debts as they fell due. In the conduct of the lumber business a very large outlay is necessary before there is any return, and when the business is carried on, as it generally is by accommodation at a bank, a long and generous credit must be extended by the bank, and constant renewals granted, to ensure success to those engaged in the business. Now the defendants had, as they believed, completed the improvements at their mill necessary to enable them to carry on a large business. They had assets which, to a very considerable amount, constituted fixed capital in the business, that is, the property necessary to be retained for carrying on the business, and which, therefore, were not available for sale so long as the business should be carried on; they had, also, other assets to a considerable amount, which were the product of the business, and which were available for sale, but the market for which was, in a very depressed condition, which depression however was expected to pass away shortly. Now, it is not pretended that the property with all its recent improvements, was not in a good position to carry on business upon a large scale, although if the creditors of the owners of this property attempted to enforce immediate payment of their claims they might not have been able to continue the business. For the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeals in all three cases must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\nSolicitors for respondents other than George MacLean: Blake, Kerr, Lash & Cassels.\nSolicitors for respondent George MacLean: Moss, Falconbridge & Barwick.\n[1] 11 Ont.

Railway Act, 1879 (42 Vic. c. 9). A dealer in horses hired a car from the Grand Trunk Railway Company for the purpose of transporting his stock over their road and signed a shipping note by which he agreed to be bound by the following, among other, conditions:\u2014\n\u201c1. The owner of animals undertakes all risks of loss, injury, damage, and other contingencies, in loading, &c.\n\u201c3. When free passes are given to persons in charge of animals, it is only on the express condition that the railway company are not responsible for any negligence, default, or misconduct of any kind, on the part of the company or their servants, or of any other person or persons whomsoever, causing or tending to cause the death, injury or detention of any person or persons travelling upon any such free passes\u2014the person using any such pass takes all risks of every kind, no matter how caused.\u201d\nThe horses were carried over the Grand Trunk Railway in charge of a person employed by the owner, such person having a free pass for the trip; through the negligence of the company\u2019s servants a collision occurred by which the said horses were injured.\nHeld,\u2014Per Ritchie C.J. and Fournier and Henry JJ., that under the General Railway Act, 1868 (31 Vic. ch. 68) sec. 20 sub-sec. 4, as amended by 34 Vic. ch. 43 sec. 5, re-enacted by Consol Ry. Act, 1879 (42 Vic. ch. 9) sec. 25 sub-secs. 2, 3, 4, which prohibited railway companies from protecting themselves against liability for negligence by notice, condition or declaration, and which applies to the Grand Trunk Railway Company, the company could not avail themselves of the above stipulation that they should not be responsible for the negligence of themselves or their servants.\nPer Strong and Taschereau JJ., that the words \u201cnotice, condition or declaration,\u201d in the said statute, contemplate a public or general notice, and do not prevent a company from entering into a special contract to protect itself from liability.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court in favor of the plaintiffs[2].\nThere is no difference in these two cases as to the points in dispute between the parties, and the following statement of facts will suffice for both.\nIn Morton\u2019s case there were other goods shipped besides the horses. The plaintiff shipped a car load of horses by defendant\u2019s railway from Belleville to Prescott; the shipping note contained the following clauses:\u2014\n\u201c1 The owner of animals undertakes all risk of loss, injury, damage, and other contingencies, in loading, unloading, transportation, conveyance, or otherwise howsoever, no matter how caused.\n\u201c2. The railway company do not undertake to forward the animals by any particular train, or at any specified hour; neither shall they be responsible for the delivery of the animals within any certain time, or for any particular market.\n\u201c3. When free passes are given to persons in charge of animals, it is only on the express condition that the railway company are not responsible for any negligence, default or misconduct of any kind, on the part of the company or their servants, or of any other person or persons whomsoever, causing, or tending to cause, the death, injury or detention, of any person or persons travelling upon any such free passes, and whether such free passes are used in travelling on any regular passenger train, or on any other train whatsoever, the person using any such pass takes all risks of every kind, no matter how caused.\u201d\nThe train to which the car containing plaintiffs horses was attached collided with another train a few miles from the place of delivery, and the horses were injured; the plaintiff suffered loss from not being able to sell a number of his horses, and from delay and extra expense in getting them to Prescott.\nIt was not disputed that the servants of the railway company were guilty of negligence, and the measure of damages for which plaintiff, if defendants were liable at all, should have judgment, was agreed to at the trial.\nThe two causes were tried separately and resulted differently, in Vogel\u2019s case a verdict being entered for the defendant, which was reversed by the Divisional Court, and in Morton\u2019s case the verdict being entered for the plaintiff for the loss of the goods other than the horses and sustained by the Divisional Court; the judgment of the Divisional Court was, in both cases, sustained by the Court of Appeal, from whose decision the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nOsler Q.C. and McCarthy Q.C. for appellants:\nAfter the passing of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 (42 Vic., ch. 9, D.) the appellant\u2019s company were not subject to the provisions of the General Railway Act of the Dominion, and their statutory liabilities after this Act came into force were left as existing prior to the passing of the Act of 1875 (38 Vic., ch. 24).\nSection 100 of the Act of 1879, which has reference only to sub-section 4 of section 25 of that Act, and not to the whole section, even if intended to apply to the appellant\u2019s company is inoperative and ineffectual, as \u201cthe premises\u201d or subject-matter of its application are not in any way provided for or indicated so far as they relate to the appellants.\nSub-section 4, section 25, whenever applicable, imposes a burden upon the railway company and restricts the right to contract as theretofore enjoyed, and is therefore subject to the rule of strict construction and ought not to be held binding upon the appellants unless by clear and unambiguous enactment. Maxwell on Statutes[3].\nUnless \u201cthe premises\u201d in section 100 of the Act of 1879 are held to mean the provisions of sub-sections 2 and 3 of section 21 of the General Railway Act of 1851, or the corresponding section in subsequent Acts (for which position it is submitted that there is no foundation whatever) then there is no statutory provision limiting the appellant\u2019s right to contract against their own negligence.\nEven if the statute applies to this company, we contend that there is no liability cast upon them under the circumstances of this case.\nThe neglect or refusal for which a statutory remedy by action is given, has reference only to the statutory duty cast on the railways to start trains, to furnish sufficient accommodation to take, transport and discharge passengers and goods on due payment of tolls or fares legally authorized therefor.\nThis provision has no application, nor does it attempt to interfere with the ordinary liabilities and rights of the railway company as common carriers, but is a provision to enforce proper train service to prevent extortion by charge of illegal rates,\u2014that is, rates in excess of those authorized by any special or general act, ex. gr. by section 14 of the General Act of 1851, and to provide against undue preference being given to particular shippers.\nThe plaintiff in this action does not seek to recover by virtue of any such neglect or refusal. His right of action, if any, existed outside of the statute, and it is submitted that the provisions of sub-section 4 only apply to the strict statutory action referred to in \u201cthe premises.\u201d\nIn any event we contend that there is the clear right to make the special contract in question, and that upon its terms no liability is cast upon the appellants[4].\nLastly, the plaintiff is bound by the contract upon the answer of the jury to the third question (found at page 176 of the report). Upon this point counsel referred to Burke v. South E.R. Co.[5]; Watkins v. Rymill[6]. Dickson Q.C. for respondent Vogel, and Ermatinger for respondent Morton:\nThe defendants contention that the said shipping note constituted a special contract for the transportation of the said horses, and that the 17th condition thereof exempts them from responsibility, is not valid, because, a\u2014it is contrary to the declared duty of the defendant to take, transport and discharge upon payment of the freight or fare legally authorized, the condition being absolute, offering no alternative or option. \u201cA carrier cannot force a special contract on a customer.\u201d\u2014Ivatt on Carriers[7]; Allday v. Great Western Ry.[8]; Rooth v. North Eastern Ry.[9]; Manchester Ry. Co. v Brown[10]; Ruddy v. Midland Ry. Co.[11] b.\u2014The consignor did not know he was signing a special contract\u2014Simons v. Great Western Ry. Co.[12]; Parker v. The South Eastern Ry. Co.[13]; Lawson on Carriers[14].\nIn England the Carriers Act, 2 Geo 4 & 1 Will. 4th, c. 86 (1830) was passed for the more effectual protection of common carriers, and the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, 17 and 18 Vic. c. 31, was passed to make better provisions for regulating the traffic. These acts are not in force in Ontario, Hamilton v G.T. Ry.[15], but they had been interpreted by the courts in England before our Parliament passed the various provisions for working of railways, in language very similar, in many respects, to that used in the Imperial statute.\nCarr v; The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company[16], and Walker v. The York and Mialand Ry. Co.[17], immediately preceded the passage of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1854. The Dominion Act 34 Vic. cap. 43 sec. 5, was passed with the obvious intention of restricting the power of railway companies contracting themselves free from liability for loss however caused, which act the Ontario courts in Scott v. Great Western Ry.[18] and Allan v. Great Western Ry.[19] decided did not apply to railways incorporated before 1868; and the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in 1871, in Dodson v. The Grand Trunk Ry.[20], said that it might be advisable for Parliament to pass a law for the whole Dominion, founded on the Imperial Act of 1854. Similar sentiments have been expressed by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas in Ontario.\u2014Hamilton v. Grand Trunk Ry.[21]; Spettigue v. Great Western Ry.[22]; and Bates v. Great Western Ry.[23]; whereupon Parliament, in 1875, passed 38 Vic. cap. 24, with the apparent design of restricting all railway companies as aforesaid.\nIn 1863 the House of Lords decided in Peek v. The North Staffordshire Railway Co.[24]:\u2014a.\u2014That general notices and conditions were effectual only when they became in the particular case a contract or agreement and\u2014b.\u2014That a condition in a special contract exempting the company from all liability for loss caused by their own negligence was unjust and unreasonable.\nThe Dominion Parliament in the Act of 1868 (31 Vic. cap. 68 sec. 20), and the Act of 1871 (34 Vic. cap. 43 sec. 5), had enacted that goods should be taken, transported and discharged, and that any party aggrieved should have an action for damages against the company, from which action no notice, condition, or declaration, should relieve the company, if such damages arose from any negligence or omission of the company or its servants. Practically a re-enactment of the 1st clause of sec. 7 of the Imperial Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 17 and 18 Vic. cap. 31. \u201cNotice or condition\u201d had been judicially interpreted to mean contract and that unless it were assented to so as to form a contract it was inoperative.\u2014Brown on Carriers[25]; Peek v. North Staffordshire[26]; LaPointe v. Grand Trunk Ry.[27].\nThe Carrier\u2019s Act\u201411 Geo. 4th, and 1 Will. 4th, cap. 68\u2014in sec. 2 speaks of \u201csome notice to be affixed in some public and conspicuous part of the office.\u201d In sec. 2 instead of \u201cpublic notice or declaration,\u201d our Dominion Act says, \u201c any notice, condition or declaration.\u201d\nThe defendants are liable in any view for delay in delivering, and for non-delivery of all the horses, (3 valued at $332.50 never were delivered)\u2014Brown on Carriers[28] Robinson v. G.W. R. Co.[29].\nThe contract being compulsory by the defendants on the plaintiff, and in violation of their declared duty is a nudum pactum.\u2014See per Richards J. in Sutherland v. Great Western Ry.[30].\nIf the special contract has any effect it only relieves the defendants from their common law liability as insurers and not from loss occasioned by their negligence.\u2014Czech v. The General Steam Navigation Co.[31]; Martin v. The Great Indian Peninsular R. Co.[32]; Ohrloft v. Briscall[33]; Phillips v. Clark[34]; D\u2019Arc v. London and North-Western Ry. Co.[35]; Allan v. Great Western Ry Co.[36].\nThere can be no difference in principle or effect in a like contract for the carriage of 1 horse and one for 60, or for one or more car loads, and the form or request note shows that there is no difference in practice, it reading \u201call live stock shall be carried by special contract only,\u201d and \u201cwhen sent in quantities of less than one car load, stock will be charged at per head.\u201d\nAny condition assuming to discharge the carrier from all responsibility for negligence clearly proved, should be confined within the narrowest limit consistent with fair interpretation.\u2014Hately v. The Merchant\u2019s Dispatch Co.[37]\nThe whole of clause 17 in the request note must be read to ascertain its meaning and effect, and the plaintiff submits its true construction is:\u2014That animals are to be in charge of the owner or some one on his behalf, to whom a free pass will be given to feed and take care of them; the person accepting such free pass, taking, for his own person, all risks, and the company being exempted from all liability in respect to the feeding, and damages from the animals themselves such as kicking, etc., i.e.\u2014To take all the risks of the journey, except what the defendants natually undertake to provide the means of carriage, and use reasonable care in the transit.\u2014Rooth v. North-Eastern Ry. Co.[38]. If it be shown that there are two sets of terms in the course of dealing with a carrier, the law accepts the one least favorable to the carrier. Ivatt[39]; Phillips v. Edwards[40]; Ruddy v. Midland[41]. and the onus is on the carrier. [42] Kendall v. London and South-Western[43].\nReference was also made to\u2014Railway Co. v. Stevens[44]; Willis v. Commissioners E. & N. A. Ry.[45]. Sir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The question to be decided in these cases, is whether or not the defendants were at liberty to protect themselves from liability by the terms of the special contract.\nThe Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, sec. 25 sub-sec. 4 provides:\u2014\nThe party aggrieved by a neglect or refusal in the premises, shall have an action therefor against the company, from which action the company shall not be relieved by any notice, condition or declaration if the damage arises from any negligence or omission of the company or of its servants.\nSec. 2 sub-sec. 2 makes the above provision applicable to every railway constructed, or to be constructed, under the authority of any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada.\nThis Act repeals the Railway Act of 1875 (38 Vic. ch. 24) which has been held to apply to the Grand Trunk Railway, but enacts in the repealing clause that:\u2014\nAll things lawfully done, and all rights acquired under the Acts hereby repealed or any of them, shall remain valid and may be enforced\u2014under the corresponding provisions of this Act, which shall not be construed as a new law, but as a consolidation and continuation of the said repealed Acts.\nAt the trial, Wilson C.J. gave judgment for the defendants (in Vogel\u2019s case) after assessing the damages to enable the plaintiff to obtain a verdict without a new trial; the learned judge held that the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, did not apply to this company.\nThe Divisional Court reversed this judgment, and ordered a verdict to be entered for the plaintiff for the damages assessed.\nThe Court of Appeal were divided in their opinion and the verdict sustained; Burton and Patterson JJ., who dissented from the judgment of the Divisional Court, held, that even if the Consolidated Railway Act applied to the company, they were still not debarred from making a special contract to relieve them from liability. After a careful examination of all the statutes bearing upon this case, I agree with Mr. Justice Osler:\u2014\nThat these defendants are subject to the statutory law which takes away the defence in an action of this kind where the loss has been occasioned by the negligence of the company or its servants.\nThe statutory obligation imposed upon a railway company is:\u2014\nTo start trains at regular hours, and to furnish sufficient accommodation for the transport of all passengers and goods, &c., and any party aggrieved by any neglect or refusal in the premises shall have an action therefor against the company, from which action the company shall not be relieved by any notice, condition, or declaration, if the damage arises from the negligence or omission of the company or its servants.\nAny neglect or refusal in the premises. What are the premises? To take, transport and discharge, inter alia, such passengers and goods, upon payment of the freight or fare legally authorized therefor; if the goods then are not transported and discharged, by reason of any neglect or refusal, clearly an action lies; and is there any difference whether the neglect is in not providing sufficient accommodation, or in not sending the goods forward in the first instance, or having sent them forward in not transporting them to, and discharging them at, the place of destination, but so negligently dealing with them that such transport and discharge was prevented?\nI think the object of the legislation was to prevent railway companies from escaping liability by entering into contracts whereby they could free themselves from liability for the neglect of themselves or their servants, whether by way of notice or condition or declaration, be the same by way of contract or otherwise; in other words, to prevent them from contracting themselves out of liability for negligence. To limit the clause as contended for would, in my opinion, entirely frustrate the intention of the legislature, or enable the companies to do so with impunity.\nI think, therefore, the appeal in this case should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The first difficulty we have to deal with in deciding this appeal, is to ascertain the legislation actually in force; there have been so many alterations in the statutes, and these alterations have been effected in such a slovenly manner, that it requires frequent perusals and much comparison of the different enactments, before it is possible to say what has been repealed and what remains standing, all of which, with a little pains and care in the arrangement of the statutes, might have been ascertained at a glance.\nBy the General Railway Act of the Dominion, 31 Vic. ch. 68, passed in 1868, it was enacted by the 20th sec. as follows:\u2014\nSub-sec. 2. The trains shall be started and run at regular hours to be fixed by public notice, and shall furnish sufficient accommodation for the transportation of all such passengers and goods as are within a reasonable time previous thereto offered for transportation at the place of starting and at the junctions of the railways, and at usual stopping places established for receiving and discharging way passengers and goods from the trains.\nSub-sec. 3.\u2014Such passengers and goods shall be taken, transported and discharged, at, from and to, such places, on the due payment of the toll legally authorized therefor.\nSub-sec. 4\u2014The party aggrieved by any neglect or refusal in the premises, shall have an action therefor against the company.\nBy the fifth section of 34 Vic. ch. 43 (passed in 1871), the 4th sub-sec. of sec. 20 of the Act of 1868 was amended by adding the following provision:\u2014\nFrom which action the company shall not be relieved by any notice, condition or declaration, if the damage arises from any negligence or omission of the company or its servants.\nSo far, the enactments just set forth were not applicable to the Grand Trunk Railway Company, but by the 38 Vic. ch. 24, (passed in 1875) the General Railway Act was further amended, and by sec. 4 it was declared that:\u2014\nThis Act and the 50th sec. of the Railway Act, 1868, as hereby amended, and sec. 20 of the Railway Act of 1868 as amended by sec. 5 of the Act 34 Vic., cap. 43, shall apply to every railway company heretofore incorporated, or which may hereafter be incorporated, and which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Company was and is, beyond question, a railway subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, inasmuch as it is a railway excluded from the jurisdiction of Provincial Legislatures by sub-sec. 10, of sec. 92 of the British North America Act, as being a railway extending beyond the limits of any single Province.\nIn 1879 the Railway Act of 1868, as amended by the subsequent enactments before mentioned, was, by the statute of 42 Vic. ch. 9 sec. 102, repealed, but by the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sub-secs, of sec. 25, the foregoing provisions of the Act of 1868, as amended by the Act of 1871, were re-enacted; the whole Act was not made applicable to all railways subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, but only to such railways as had been, or should be, constructed under the authority of any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, by which expression I understand the Parliament of the Dominion. By the 100th sec, however, it was declared that sub-sec. 4 of sec. 25 should:\u2014\nApply to every railway company theretofore incorporated, or which might thereafter be incorporated, and subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada\na provision which manifestly included the Grand Trunk Railway Company. Therefore we have, as applicable to the present appellants, this sub-sec. 4 of sec. 25, standing alone, not preceded by the 2nd and 3rd sub-secs, which it had followed in the Act of 1868, as amended by the Act of 1871.\nAlthough this was undoubtedly a very clumsy and confused mode of expressing the intention of the legislature, it still appears to me that sub-sec. 4 can easily be construed in the same way the courts below have construed it, by reading into it, in substitution for the words \u201cthe premises,\u201d the provisions of the foregoing sub-sections of section 25 of the Act of 1879; and so read, its effect will be precisely the same as if sub-sec. 4 and all the sub-clauses of sec. 25 which precede it, were set forth in extenso. To say that a party shall have an action for any refusal or neglect to take, transport and discharge goods, is equivalent to saying that it shall be the duty of the railway company to take, transport and discharge goods, and that the party aggrieved by any neglect or refusal so to do shall have an action therefor. Sub-sec. 4 therefore, read alone but construed in the way suggested, imposes upon the railway company the duty of taking, transporting and discharging goods offered for carriage; the effect of this legislation must therefore be to make a railway company to which it applies common carriers of goods; or, at least, to impose upon them the same duties in regard to receiving, carrying and delivering as those to which, by the common law, common carriers are subject in respect of the carriage of goods.\nIf I did not think this appeal would be decided on other grounds, I should have had to consider whether the word \u201cgoods\u201d used in this statute included horses and cattle and other live stock, a point on which my first impression is altogether against the plaintiff; as it appears to me, however, that the case may be disposed of on other grounds, I need not enter upon this consideration.\nIt cannot be doubted that clause 17 of the special contract under which the horses were carried in both cases was, in its terms, quite sufficient to exempt the railway company from liability for \u201closs, injury, or damage\u201d happening to the animals in the course of transit, though such injury should be caused by the negligence of the appellants\u2019 servants, unless the statutory provision in question invalidates the stipulation for such exemption; the cases referred to in the judgment of Chief Justice Moss, in the case of Fitzgerald v. The Grank Trunk Ry. Co.[46], are cited by Mr. Justice Patterson as sufficient authorities for this proposition, in which I agree with him. It is equally clear from the decisions in the same case of Fitzgerald v. The Grand Trunk Ry Co.[47], that the document signed by the plaintiff in Morton\u2019s case having the caption of \u201cRelease and Guarantee,\u201d is insufficient for this purpose, and that the company are not thereby exonerated from the consequences of accidents happening through the negligence of their servants. That the injuries in both these cases did arise from the palpable neglect of the company\u2019s servants, is a fact which is not and could not have been disputed.\nWhat we have to determine then, in order to decide this appeal, may be included in two questions stated as follows:\u2014\nFirst. Does this statutory prohibition of exemption from liability apply at all to a case like the present where the goods were not received by the railway company in the ordinary way as common carriers, to be loaded by the company\u2019s servants, actually placed in their possession, and carried under their care and supervision, but under a special contract for the hire of a car, into which the plaintiff was to be at liberty to put as many or as few horses as he chose, which, during transit, were to remain in the possession, and to be under the exclusive care, of the plaintiff or his servants, thus differing from the ordinary contract impliedly entered into by a common carrier, who receives into his own possession goods tendered to him for carriage? Secondly, assuming that the statute does apply, and that we must consider these horses as having been tendered to, and received by, the appellants to be carried as common carriers, and subject to all the obligations and responsibilities which attach to such carriers, is there anything in the 4th sub-sec. of sec. 25 which invalidates a special contract expressly entered into, and signed by the consignor, restricting the ordinary common law or statutory liability of the carrier?\nFor the purpose of determining these questions, I of course assume that the horses are \u201cgoods\u201d within the meaning of the statute, though I repeat I do not intend so to decide.\nAlthough the order in which these questions are above propounded is the more natural and logical, yet it will be convenient first to consider that last stated. The solution of this, it is evident, must depend on the interpretation to be placed upon the latter part of the 4th sub\u2011sec, or rather, upon the meaning of the words \u201cnotice, condition or declaration\u201d there contained. The Queen\u2019s Bench Division and the Court of Appeal (the judges in the latter court being equally divided) have held that these words do comprise special contracts expressly entered into and signed by the consignors, as in the present instance. After giving the well considered judgments delivered by the learned Chief Justice in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, and by Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal, the most attentive and respectful consideration in my power, I am compelled to differ from the conclusion at which they arrived.\nAs before stated, the effect of sub-sections 3 and 4 of sec. 25, so far as regards the receipt, carrying and delivery of goods, imposes no other or greater obligations on the railway companies subject to it than it would be liable to at common law if it had been itself a common carrier of the particular goods in question. In the view which I take, it is not necessary to decide whether it sufficiently appears from the evidence that the Grand Trunk Ry. Co. had so generally dealt with the public, and held itself out, as to make it, at common law and independent of statutory enactments, a common carrier of horses and other live stock; I will, however, assume, for the present purpose that not only are horses \u201cgoods\u201d within the meaning of that word in the statute, but that the Grand Trunk Ry. Co. are proved to be common carriers of horses at common law. If it were necessary to decide this last point, I should, however, at least share the doubt expressed by Chief Justice Cameron.\nThen conceding that these horses were delivered into the possession of the railway company, and were actually received by them to be carried as common carriers upon the terms stipulated by the company contained in the 17th clause of the special contract, and that the 4th sub-section was applicable, I must still hold that the plaintiffs in these cases are not entitled to recover so far as respects the injuries to the horses. I have no doubt that the word \u201cneglect\u201d has reference to negligence in carrying as well as negligence in omitting to carry; this, indeed, is implied in what has been already said\u2014that the intention of the legislature was merely to impose on the railway company the liability of a common carrier. The grounds upon which I rest my judgment in this aspect of the case are that the words, \u201cnotice, condition or declaration,\u201d do not bear the construction that the court below has put upon them; that, on the contrary, they must be restricted in the way Mr. Justice Burton has pointed out; that they do not mean terms expressed in a special contract actually signed by the consignor, but in the language of Mr. Justice Burton, \u201cterms, published by the company,\u201d of their own act and will, on which they are \u201cwilling to carry goods.\u201d\nAllusion has been made in the judgments of some of the learned judges in the court below, to the history of the law in England as regards the restriction by carriers of their general common law liability by special contracts. At common law it was always within the powers of common carriers to relieve themselves by contract from the onerous responsibilities which the law, for reasons once practical, but long since become historical cast upon them. This freedom of contract was, however, found to be liable to abuse, inasmuch as carriers published general notices and conditions on which they announced they would alone accept goods to be carried, which notices and conditions, it was held, were, if so published that knowledge of them might reasonably be imputed to consignors, considered as imported into, and made part of, the contract for carriage; this was thought an unreasonable state of the law, not because it was considered unreasonable that carriers should be at liberty to relieve themselves from liability by contract, but because it was considered unfair that they should do so in this indirect way. To remedy this, the first Carriers Act, 11 Geo. 4th and 1 Will. 4th, ch. 28 was passed, which qualified this power of limiting liability by notice. In the 4th section of this Act we find the words \u201cpublic notice and declaration\u201d used in a proviso that such notices and declarations shall not, save in certain cases, have the effect of relieving from responsibility. I merely point this out as showing from whence the expression \u201cnotice, condition and declaration,\u201d used in this sub-section 4, now under consideration, is originally derived, and that it is, in this first Carriers\u2019 Act, used in connection with the word \u201cpublic.\u201d In the next legislative regulation of carriers\u2019 contracts which was applied in England, \u201cThe Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854,\u201d which was passed after the whole system of the inland carrying trade in England had been changed by the construction and use of railways, we find in the 7th section these same words now under consideration, \u201cnotice, condition or declaration.\u201d The first part of that section is as follows:\u2014\nEvery such company as aforesaid shall be liable for the loss of, or for injury done to, any horses, cattle or other animals, or to any articles, goods or things, in the receiving, forwarding, or delivery thereof, occasioned by the neglect or default of such company or its servants, notwithstanding any notice, condition or declaration made or given by such company contrary thereto or in any wise limiting such liability, every such notice, condition or declaration being hereby declared to be null and void.\nThe construction placed on these words by the English courts has been, that the words \u201cnotice, condition or declaration\u201d refer to general notices, and do not exclude the right to make special contracts. Thus Jarvis C.J., in Simons v The Great North-Western Railway Co.[48], referring to the effect of this part of the section, says:\u2014\nGeneral notices to limit liability shall be null and void, but the company may make special contracts with their customers provided they are just and reasonable.\nThis last observation, of course, refers to the latter part of the section 7 and has no application here. The purpose for which I refer to this section, and the construction which has been placed upon it in England, is to show in the first place, that these words which we find in our own statute, and which we are now called upon to construe, were borrowed from the English Act, and therefore we are entitled to presume that it was intended they should have the same meaning here, as was placed upon them there by the English courts, namely; that it was intended by the expression to exclude a limitation of liability by general notices, and that it was designed for this purpose only.\nIt is not necessary, however, to have recourse to the decisions of the English courts as establishing the proper construction of these words; taking these words \u201cnotice, condition, or declaration\u201d by themselves, without assistance from any authorities, it seems apparent that they are not sufficient to disentitle the railway companies to the benefit of special contracts limiting their liability, especially when it is considered that it had been the universal practice of carriers to endeavor to exonerate themselves by general public notices; the words \u201cnotice and declaration\u201d so read must, as I think every one will admit, clearly have reference to the general notices previously in use; the word \u201ccondition\u201d may be more ambiguous, but we are surely bound to interpret it on the principle noscilur a sociis, and when we find it associated with words which clearly have reference to general notices, the unilateral acts of the company, we must limit, or rather fix, its import accordingly. Upon the whole, my conclusion is that the legislature, desiring to do away with general notices, adopted the phraseology which had been deemed apt for that purpose in the 7th section of the English Act of 1854, but not intending to limit parties in making special contracts to such as the courts should deem just and reasonable, but intending to leave the railway company full freedom of contract in that respect, did not, as was done by the English Act, proceed to provide for such special contracts. I think that this construction is inevitable when we consider that it is a universal principle of statutory construction that every presumption must be made against an intention to interfere with the freedom of contract, and when we advert to the serious consequences which would follow if railway companies were not allowed to protect themselves, to some extent, against liability for loss. even from the negligence of their own servants, by fair and reasonable conditions applicable to the conveyance of property of extraordinary value, I cannot think that any such intention existed.\nBut I place my judgment not so much upon this consideration, as upon the utter inadequacy of the words of the Act of Parliament to warrant such an interpretation.\nI am therefore of opinion, that making all the assumptions in the plaintiff\u2019s favor which have been stated, and treating the appellants in these cases as common carriers, there was nothing in the statute law to preclude them from qualifying their liability in the way they have done by the stipulations contained in these contracts.\nNext we have to consider whether the appellants can be considered as coming within the provision contained in the 4th sub-section of section 25 of the statute of 1879. I venture to say that they cannot be so considered; in the first place, it is plain, upon the evidence taken in connection with the terms of the special contracts, signed by the parties, that the railway company never were in possession of the horses in question which always, whilst in the car provided by the company for their carriage, were in the possession of their respective owners. I take it to be essential to the liability of a common carrier that he should be entrusted with the possession of the property carried, and that when the possession is retained by the owner, the liability is so modified that it is no longer open to the owner to insist on any greater responsibility than that which in all cases attaches to acts of negligence, and which liability may therefore be excluded by contract without reference to any restriction on the liberty of contracting applicable to common carriers, Again, viewing this, as Mr. Justice Burton puts it, as an action on the statute, the liability to the action given by the 4th sub-section and the disability which is imposed as to escaping from such liability by \u201cnotice, condition or declaration\u201d (even if we interpret these words as including \u201ccontract\u201d) only applies to goods \u201ctaken\u201d by the railway company for transportation, the word \u201ctaken\u201d as here used, manifestly meaning taken into the possession of the railway company. The cases which have been decided as to passengers\u2019 luggage seem therefore not without application here. It has been held that railway companies are to be deemed common carriers of a passenger\u2019s luggage entrusted to the care of their servants, but that if the passenger chooses to retain control of the luggage himself, the company is not to be considered as common carriers of it, but is liable only for loss by actual negligence. This argument is not, I conceive, met in the present case by the terms of the contract which acknowledges the receipt of the horses, a receipt being always susceptible of explanation, and here the evidence shows, beyond all question, that the horses from the time they were shipped were under the care and control of the owner who was carried upon a free pass, expressly in order that he might have such care and control.\nThe true legal definition of the contracts entered into in these cases by the plaintiffs with the appellants, was, I conceive, that propounded by Mr. Justice Patterson, namely, that the company let to hire to the plaintiffs a railway car for the carriage of horses, leaving it to the plaintiffs to load such cars with as many horses as they might think fit, and further agreed to draw such cars in their trains. Such being the effect of the agreement between the parties, the railway company could no more be said to be in the possession of the horses than could the owners of a steam tug employed to tow a ship be said to be in possession of the cargo. A class of cases decided on charter parties may also be referred to, not, perhaps, as affording analogy from which it would be safe to reason, but as illustrating the nature of the relationship between the railway company and the owners of the property in the present case. It has been held that when, by a charter party, the owner retains control of a ship, the master and crew being in his employ he is to be deemed to be in possession of the cargo which, through his servants, is in such cases under his care and control, the contract only giving the charterer the right to the use of the ship for the carriage of his goods; but when the charter party amounts to a demise of the vessel, as it is held to be when the master and crew are employed by the charterer, the ship-owner is not considered as in possession of the cargo or liable in any way for it. It is no answer to this to say that no care of the owner could have prevented the injury in the present case; the argument based on the possession being retained by the owner, is only used to show that the property here was not carried by the defendants either as common carriers or under the statute, not as showing that the appellants would not have been liable for the negligence of their servants, if there had not been a contract exonerating them from such responsibility; in other words, the appellants liability depends on whether they carried as common carriers, either at common law or under the statute, and this they cannot be said to have done if they had not possession of the horses; so that possession becomes the test of the legal validity of the stipulation which they exacted, that they should not be so liable.\nIt is, in my opinion, sufficient to show that the case has not been brought within the terms of the statute literally construed, that is, construed as in any case we are bound to construe a statute, but more especially so bound when it is sought, as here, to impose legislative restrictions on the right of contracting freely; and therefore the consequences of such a construction would be of insufficient weight to authorize us to depart from the plain meaning of the words of the enactment. But no difficulty arises from the consideration that unreasonable or unjust consequences are likely to arise in the present case; if an owner wishes his horses carried by the railway company as common carriers, all he has to do is to tender them for transportation, and upon the payment of the proper charges the company will be bound to carry them if they are to be deemed generally common carriers, or if the statute applies to such property. On the other hand, by holding that under a contract like the present the railway company are unable to qualify their liability, we should go far towards invalidating the arrangements under which a most important branch of the inland carrying trade is now carried on; I allude to the arrangements between express companies and railway companies. If we held the appellants incapacitated from discharging themselves from liability by contracts like the present, upon what principle can it be said that railway companies, within the statute of 1879, can exempt themselves by contract, as. they always assume to do, from liability to express companies in respect of the goods and property carried by the latter; in the case of express companies the goods are under the care and control of their servants to no greater degree than the horses in the present case were under the care of their owners; in each case the car is the property of the railway company, and in both alike, the agreement between the parties is resolvable into a contract to let to hire a car and to haul it. This consideration, in my judgment, greatly strengthens the construction which the mere words of the Act seem to call for. Again, it is more for the convenience of the public that valuable property, such as horses and live stock, should be conveyed in this way, under the care and control of persons used to their management, than that it should be left to the servants of the railway company to attend to their wants in respect of food and water and their transhipment when called for.\nIt may be that an improvement in the law would be wrought by an amendment making it incumbent on the courts to determine whether special contracts are reasonable or not, as was done in England by the Act of 1854, but against the good policy of such enactments we have the high authority of some of the Lords who heard the late case of The Manchester Railway Company v. Brown[49], particularly that of Lord Bramwell. Upon the whole I do not see that any great public inconvenience will result from holding that the 4th sub-section of the statute of 1879 does not apply to special contracts, provided consignors will take the trouble to read the special contracts which are presented for their signatures. As the Chief Justice remarked at the trial, if people will not read these conditions, it is their own fault if they operate as a surprise upon them when a loss takes place.\nWhat is before said has, of course, reference only to the horses; as regards the other goods in Morton\u2019s case the appellants are liable for the loss in that respect upon the general ground of negligence, though they carried not as common carriers, nor under the statute, but under the special contract, inasmuch as the document headed \u201cRelease and Guarantee\u201d did not, as before pointed out, exonerate them from such liability. In Morton\u2019s case the verdict should therefore be entered for the plaintiff for $89. The learned judge who heard Morton\u2019s case, discharged the jury and found that the horses were carried under the special contract; in. Vogel\u2019s case however, the jury expressly found that the horses were not carried under the special contract, \u201cunless so far as that answer was qualified by their answer to the third question.\u201d The answer to the third question is that the plaintiff supposed the terms of the request note and shipping bill were of the like nature as those of other papers he had signed for the carriage of horses by the Grand Trunk.\nI suppose that, strictly speaking, the question should have been left to the jury, whether Fanning signed the request note as the agent for the plaintiff, but this fact was not disputed; nor was it disputed that the horses were carried under the contract, nor pretended that they were carried under any other contract than that contained in the request note and shipping bill. Under the Judicature Act we may, I think, supply this finding; rule 321 seems to authorize this, and the corresponding English rule has been so applied. It would appear, therefore, that notwithstanding the finding of the jury, effect may be given to the law as before stated applied to the facts in evidence, without going through the useless formality of another trial.\nMy conclusion is, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed with costs in both courts, and judgment entered for the plaintiff for $89 in Morton\u2019s case and for the defendants in Vogel\u2019s case.\nFOURNIER J. concurred in the judgment delivered by the Chief Justice.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed in the both cases. I think in one of the cases there was a reduction made for the carriage of the horses.\nMy opinion is that in both cases the party is entitled to recover the whole of the loss. I think the special agreement did not alter the liability, and that the party is entitled to recover not only for the other goods, but also for the horses.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would have allowed these appeals for the reasons given by Burton and Paterson JJ. in their dissenting opinions in the court below. I can see nothing in the statute to prevent this company from making special contracts for the carrying of goods. Why should parties desirous of making such contracts be deprived of their common law right to do so? If, for instance, a party wants a special train\u2014hires a special train\u2014to carry his goods, can he not make a special contract with the company about it? Has the legislature deprived him of that right? It would require express words to bring me to the conclusion that they have done so. I cannot find them in the statutes. Here it was a special car that the plaintiff hired. He made a special contract for it with the company. One of the conditions of that contract was that the company should not be liable for damage occasioned by accident. I can see nothing illegal in such a condition, as the statutes stand.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Messrs. Hoyles & Aylesworth.\nSolicitor for respondent Vogel: Geo. D.

In a suit to redeem the said lands brought by the heirs of the mortgagor some eighteen years after the sale and more than five years after some of the heirs had become of age.\nHeld,\u2014Reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the suit being one impeaching a purchase by a trustee for sale the statute of limitations had no application, and that, as the defendants and those under whom they claimed had never been in possession in the character of mortgagees, the plaintiffs were not barred by the provisions of R.S.O. ch. 108 sec. 19, and that the plaintiffs were consequently entitled to a lien upon the mortgage for purchase money given by L.\nHeld, also, that as it appeared that the plaintiffs were not aware of the fraudulent character of the sale until just before commencing their suit, they could not be said to acquiesce in the possession of the defendants. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Chancellor[2].\nThe facts of the case are fully stated in the previous reports and the following judgments of this court.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Waller Cassels Q.C. for appellants.\nStreet Q.C., for respondent.\nThe points of argument and cases relied on by counsel are fully given in the reports of the case in the court below.\nSTRONG J.\u2014In 1857 William Faulds purchased from his father, Andrew Faulds, one hundred acres of land in the Township of Malahide, for the price of \u00a3875 ($3,500), of which a sum of \u00a3400 ($1,600) was paid in cash, and the residue of the purchase money, amounting to \u00a3475 (or $1,900), was allowed to remain upon the security of a mortgage of the property. This mortgage, which was effected by a deed dated the 20th of April, 1857, was unpaid at the death of the mortgagor, which occurred on the first of July, 1858. Sometime in 1861, Andrew Faulds, the mortgagee, filed his bill for the foreclosure of the mortgaged property against the co-heirs of his son, the deceased mortgagor, who had died intestate; these co-heirs were the plaintiffs in the present cause, and Eliza Jane Faulds, who died intestate, unmarried, and under the age of twenty-one years, in April, 1868. The plaintiffs, at the date of their father\u2019s death, were all infants; the eldest, Elijah Washington Faulds, being then of the age of 14 years, having been born in the year 1844.\nBy a decree bearing date the 28th of June, 1861, made in the foreclosure suit before mentioned, the mortgaged lands were, in default of the payment at the appointed time of the amount which should be found due to the plaintiff, ordered to be gold. Pursuant to this decree, the lands were, upon the 12th of April, 1862, put up for sale by auction in two lots, when Joseph Harper, one of the defendants in this cause, pretended to become the purchaser of the same for the aggregate price of $1,600. The plaintiffs, in their bill, alleged that Andrew Faulds, the plaintiff in the foreclosure suit, and who, as such, had no right to purchase himself, employed Joseph Harper the ostensible purchaser, to purchase for his behoof, and that Joseph Harper was, in fact, the agent of Andrew Faulds in making the purchase and in carrying out the same; further, they allege that the lands were sold to Joseph Harper at a price greatly below their real value, on account of this combination between Joseph Harper and Andrew Faulds, which had the effect of \u201cdamping competition\u201d and was intended to have that effect. The allegations of the bill on this head are contained in the 13th and 14th paragraphs, which are as follows:\u2014\n13. Your complainants allege, and the fact is, that the plaintiff in the said foreclosure suit being mortgagee and having no right to purchase for himself at the said sale, employed the said Joseph Harper (the purchaser of the said lands as aforesaid) as his agent in and for and he was in fact the said Andrew Faulds\u2019 agent during the carrying out of the said sale.\n14. The said lands were sold to the said Joseph Harper at a price greatly below their real value on account of the combination between the said Joseph Harper and Andrew Faulds which had the effect of damping competition and was intended by them to have that effect.\nIt is not shown that Andrew Faulds, who, as the plaintiff in the cause, must, in the absence of any order to the contrary, be considered the vendor, and as such charged with the conduct of the sale, had leave to bid; nor do the defendants, in their answer, pretend that such leave was obtained.\nThis purchase by Joseph Harper was carried out by a deed of the 16th of June, 1862, whereby Andrew Faulds, as the mortgagee in whom the legal estate was vested, conveyed to Joseph Harper, and by a second deed dated the same day, Joseph Harper re-conveyed the same lands to Andrew Faulds in fee. On the 14th of June, two days before the execution of these conveyances, Andrew Faulds had exercised an act of ownership over the lands by executing a lease, whereby he demised them to one Bennett as his tenant for a year from April, 1862. From the date of the deeds before mentioned, Andrew Faulds assumed to be the absolute owner of the lands, and dealt with them as such up to the time of his death; by his will, he devised his property to his wife (who died before this bill was filed) for life, and directed that upon her death his executors should sell all his real and personal property, and out of the proceeds should pay his son, Thomas Faulds, $500, and divide the residue equally between the testator\u2019s son, Andrew Faulds the younger, and his daughters, the defendant Margaret Harper (the wife of Joseph Harper already mentioned) and Elizabeth Linda. The legacy to Thomas Faulds had been paid, and the interests of Andrew Faulds the younger and Elizabeth Linda had become vested by conveyance from the former, and by devise from, and by the death of, the latter, in the defendant Margaret Harper previously to the sale of the lands in question, to the defendant James C. Lane hereafter mentioned.\nThe testator, Andrew Faulds, appointed Peter Clayton and Walter E. Murray his executors, of whom the former died before the institution of this suit.\nThe defendant, Margaret Harper, having thus the sole beneficial interest in these lands vested in her, remained in the enjoyment of the property and in possession thereof by her tenants until the 29th of December, 1879, when, as she herself states in her factum filed for the purposes of this appeal, \u201cbeing the beneficial owner of the rights of the said lands, she sold and caused the lands to be conveyed to the defendant, James 0. Lane, a purchaser for value without notice, who conveyed the same by way of mortgage to her to secure the payment of $4,780.29, being the purchase money and interest, and the said James C. Lane immediately entered into possession as owner, and has ever since remained in such possession undisturbed, save by the proceedings in this action.\u2019\u2019 The defendant, Margaret Harper, being therefore the beneficial and absolute equitable owner of the lands at the time of the sale to Lane, and being, as regards the interest and shares of herself and Elizabeth Linda, a mere volunteer, and it not being alleged or pretended that either she or Elizabeth Linda were purchasers for value without notice in respect of the shares acquired from Andrew Faulds, the testator\u2019s son, it follows that the plaintiffs, not having been able to disprove Lane\u2019s plea of purchase for value without notice, upon establishing their case were entitled to have a personal decree against Margaret Harper, and also a lien giving effect to the same equities against the purchase money remaining unpaid by Lane, as they would have been entitled to enforce against the land which it represented if it had remained in the hands of Margaret Harper. The defendants, Margaret Harper and her husband, by their answers denied the alleged purchase by Joseph Harper on behalf of Andrew Faulds, and also pleaded the statute of limitations, and that the plaintiffs were bound by laches and acquiescence.\nThe only fact seriously disputed and upon which any conflicting evidence was given was that as to the real character of the purchase, in other words whether Andrew Faulds, the mortgagee, was in fact the real purchaser at the sale under the decree, through the agency of Joseph Harper. The evid- ence on this point was very strong, no less than seven witnesses having deposed to distinct admissions by either Andrew Faulds, or by Joseph Harper at a date anterior to his re\u2011conveyance to Andrew Faulds, that such was the fact. Against this evidence the defendant Harper and his wife opposed no testimony but their own, which was regarded by the learned judge before whom the cause was heard as unsatisfactory, a conclusion which is not found fault with by any of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, and which indeed a perusal of the depositions of the defendants will satisfy any one was the only result which could have been arrived at.\nThe cause having been heard before Vice Chancellor Blake on the 13th October, 1880, that learned judge on the same day made a decree declaring the sale to James C. Lane binding, and that the plaintiffs, Wesley Bell Faulds, were entitled each to one-fifth of the proceeds of the sale to James C. Lane by Margaret Harper, after deducting therefrom any balance remaining due upon the mortgage from William Faulds to Andrew Faulds, and further declaring the remaining plaintiffs, who had attained the age of 21 years more than five years before the filing of the bill of complaint herein, barred of their rights by the statute of limitations, and reserving costs and further directions until after the taking of the accounts.\nThis decree was re-heard at the instance of Margaret Harper, and on 22nd June, 1882, the Divisional Court (Proudfoot and Ferguson JJ.) pronounced a decree varying the decree by declaring each of the five plaintiffs entitled to one-fifth part of the proceeds of the sale to James C. Lane by Margaret Harper, after deducting therefrom any balance remaining due upon the mortgage from William Faulds to Andrew Faulds, and ordering the defendant, Margaret Harper, to pay the costs of the re-hearing.\nThe defendant, Margaret Harper, appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario against the judgment of the Divisional Court, and judgment was given by that court (Spragge C.J. dissenting), allowing the appeal and dismissing the action with costs. The plaintiffs now appeal to this court against the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe learned Vice Chancellor apparently founded his judgment on the applicability of the statute of limitations to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, treated simply as a bill to redeem, since he held the lapse of ten years a bar to the right of redemption of such of the plaintiffs whose disabilities of non-age ceased more than five years before the filing of the bill, and that those who had attained their age only within five years next before the filing of the bill were alone entitled to redeem, and that their right of redemption was confined to a redemption of their proportionate shares of the equity of redemption. The Divisional Court on the re-hearing proceeded on a different ground, holding that whilst the statute would have been applicable if the only persons entitled to redeem had been the plaintiffs who had attained full age more than five years before the filing of the bill, yet inasmuch as there were others (the plaintiffs, Wesley Bell Faulds and Matilda Elizabeth Faulds,) who had not attained the age of 21 years five years next before the filing of the bill, they were entitled to redeem the whole estate, which could not be redeemed piecemeal. The judgment of the Divisional Court in this last respect was founded on the authority of the case of Rakestraw v. Brewer[3]. The plaintiff\u2019s right to the benefit of the exception contained in the statute in favor of persons under disability was rested on the authority of the decision of the Upper Canada Court of Appeal in the case of Caldwell v. Hall[4], which the learned judges preferred to follow rather than to adopt the construction of the statute laid down in the English cases of Foster v. Patterson[5] and Kinsman v. Rouse[6]. The majority of the Court of Appeal proceeded upon the same ratio decidendi, but treated Caldwell v. Hall as having been overruled by the late English decisions, and on this ground held that the exception of disabilities did not apply in favor of a mortgagor or his representatives seeking to redeem, and therefore reversed the decree below and dismissed the bill. The late Chief Justice of Ontario, who dissented, founded his judgment upon a ground which, although it does not seem to have received consideration from the other learned judges in any of the courts below, appears to me to be entirely right and to be sustained both by principle and authority. The learned Chief Justice considered that the bill was substantially one impeaching a purchase by a trustee for sale, a case to which the statute of limitations had no application, and that there had been no possession attributable to the mortgage title; that this sale was one which, even at the distance of time at which it was impeached, could not upon the evidence be sustained, unless there was acquiescence, of which there was no proof; and that as the defendants and those under whom they claimed had never been in possession in the character of mortgagees, the plaintiffs were not barred by the enactment originally embodied in the 28th section of 3 and 4 W. 4, cap. 27, and now contained in the Ontario R.S., cap. 108, sec. 19.\nThe language of the learned Chief Justice on this last point is so very clear and satisfactory that I quote it here. He says: \u201cAndrew Faulds never was in possession in any other character than that of purchaser. Consistently with that character he could not receive any payment on account of the mortgage debt, for, according to his position, the debt was extinguished, the sum bid by Harper being the amount of it; and for the same reason he could not give such acknowledgment in writing as to the right of the mortgagor as is contemplated by the statute. It cannot therefore lie in his mouth to say that he was in possession as mortgagee, and he cannot invoke the statute of limitations as extinguishing the title of the plaintiffs by reason of his possession in that character.\u201d\nThe Chief Justice refers to no authority, but as I shall show hereafter his proposition is amply supported in that way. As regards the fact of the purchase by Harper having been as an agent or trustee for Andrew Faulds that was not, as indeed it could not have been in view of the evidence and of the finding of the Vice Chancellor, disputed by any of the judges below, and indeed the Chief Justice says that upon the hearing of the appeal even the counsel for the present respondent did not dispute the fact to be as the Vice Chacellor had found it. We may therefore assume that point to be conclusively settled. As regards the effect of such a purchase in a court of equity, more especially when brought about in the secret and covert way in which it was arranged between Andrew Faulds and Harper in the present case, there could be as little difference of opinion, and indeed it does not seem to have been denied that the plaintiffs were entitled to be relieved against the sale, provided they brought themselves within the saving clauses of the statutes of limitations.\nThat a purchase without leave of the court by a mortgagee at a sale under a decree in a suit instituted by him to realize his security, which sale it was his duty to conduct, is void in equity and will be so declared upon the same principle that a purchase by a trustee for sale will be set aside, is too clear and well established a proposition to call for any lengthened examination of authorities. The offending parties themselves were conscious of it in the present instance and, endeavored to disguise the real fact and their apprehensions were well founded. Authorities of the greatest weight show conclusively that the court will, always, at the option of the party standing in the position of cestui que trust, as the heirs of the mortgagee in this case did, set aside such a purchase as conflicting with the duty of the vendor to obtain the very best price attainable for the property to be sold, and as having a tendency, if done openly, to damp the sale.\nIn the case of Popham v. Exham[7] the Master of the Rolls in Ireland thus states the rule and the reasons for it. He says:\u2014\nIt is a well settled principle of courts of equity, that neither the plaintiff nor his solicitor can bid without the leave of the court. The rule more strongly applies in a case like the present, where the same party was the plaintiff, and in effect his own solicitor. It is said that the rule was first established in the case of Drought v. Jones[8], a few months after the sale in Popham v. Exham. The rule, however, is not a rule of practice or procedure; it is a rule of equity, founded on this well understood principle that the same person is not to be permitted to fill the double character of vendor and purchaser. A party who has the carriage of proceedings in a cause stands in a fiduciary position to all the parties and encumbrancers in the cause. The jurisdiction exercised by the court, of taking the carriage of the proceedings from a party who does not conduct the suit with due diligence, establishes that. The plaintiff\u2019s solicitor prepares conditions of sale. He is bound to see that these conditions are not of such a character as to deter parties from bidding. It is the duty of the plaintiff, acting through his solicitor, to see that the intended sale shall be duly advertised, and hand bills posted and circulated, so as to give publicity to the sale. The time when the sale should take place is often important. The plaintiff and his solicitor, in their character of vendors, have a duty imposed on them to sell for the best price that can be obtained. If the plaintiff or his solicitor purchase, their interest is in direct conflict with their duty, because in their character of purchasers they would or might be anxious to purchase at an under value. The court, therefore, when giving a plaintiff or his solicitor liberty to bid, makes it part of the order that the carriage of the proceedings should be given to some other party or encumbrancer. If no other person will take the carriage of the proceedings, the notice of motion has informed all persons interested of the fact that the plaintiff or his solicitor have obtained liberty to bid, and the proceedings connected with the sale can be narrowly watched. If a plaintiff or his solicitor was to bid openly in his own name, without the leave of the court, the sale would, in my opinion, be impeachable; at all events if it appears to be at an undervalue, and if the proceedings to impeach the sale are taken within a reasonable time. But the objection becomes much more serious if, as in the present case, the purchase is made through a trustee, and where the fact of the plaintiff or his solicitor being the real purchaser is kept concealed from the court, and the Master, and the parties in the cause. In such case, the authorities would appear to establish that the sale is not simply impeachable for undervalue but is actually void.\nThe bill in the case of Popham v. Exham, as in the present case, impeached a purchase by the plaintiff in a mortgage suit, made without leave of the court, through the intervention and name of a trustee whose agency was, as here concealed; and although the Master of the Rolls expressly disclaimed all imputation of moral fraud, and there was no evidence of undervalue, the sale was set aside after a lapse of some seventeen years. In the case of Browne v. McClintock[9], which was also a suit instituted under similar circumstances and for the same purpose as the present, we find Lord Chelmsford saying:\nMr. Browne stood in such a relation to the cause in which the sale was decreed, that he could only have bid for the property by leave of the court. He was plaintiff in the suit and solicitor; and if the biddings, though nominally in trust for Unsworth, were really on behalf of Browne, there was a fraud committed upon the court.\nIn addition to the foregoing authorities I refer to the cases of Atkins v. Delmage[10]; Drought v. Jones[11]; O\u2019Connor v. Richards[12]; Price v. Moxon[13]. That in the present case the arrangement come to actually had a prejudicial effect on the sale, and that the price was less than the fair value of the property, is fairly to be presumed from the fact that this farm, which had been purchased for $3,500 some five years before, and on account of which an instalment of $1,600 had actually been paid, only realised a price of $1,600 on this sale. The direct evidence as to value given at the hearing is also altogether in favor of the plaintiffs and shows that the property was sold for not more than about one-half its actual value. It was therefore almost of course that this sale should have been set aside, unless the lapse of time afforded sufficient protection to the defendants either as a defence under the statute of limitations or as coupled with acquiescence.\nThat the statute of limitations has no application to the case of a trustee or other fiduciary agent purchasing in fraud of the rights of his cestui que trust or principal is well established by authority. A suit in equity for this purpose has been held not to be, as it is apparent it is not, a suit for the recovery of land, but is considered one to be relieved against a breach of trust or a constructive equitable fraud and to have the purchaser, who, by these means, has obtained the legal estate, declared a trustee of it for the plaintiff. It does not, therefore, come within the 24th section of the 3 and 4 W. 4 cap. 27, re-enacted by the Ontario Revised Statutes, cap. 108 sec. 29, but is left as before the Statute to be dealt with by courts of equity upon the principle of acquiescence or laches[14].\nThe 24th section of the statute, which provides that suits in equity to recover land must be brought within the same time as an action at law could have been brought if the title of the party had been legal, has been held to apply only to cases where some equitable title is asserted which, if it had been a legal title, would have been within the statute, and it only bars equitable rights, so far as they would have been barred if they had been legal rights[15], and cases of breach of trust, and of constructive fraud are not within its terms.\nAny case of acquiescence or laches accompanied with that knowledge which is an indispensable ingredient in this defence when set up by a defendant against whom fraud or breach of trust is proved, is here out of the question. No point was made as to this in the court below. The Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal upon this head makes the following observations, which I think indicate a correct appreciation of the evidence:\u2014\nIn the case before us I do not find, upon looking over the evidence, that the plaintiffs knew, or that any of them knew, that the mortgagee was the real purchaser of the land. The fact was concealed, and the appellant and others claiming under the mortgagee appear always to have maintained that the fact was otherwise, and that Harper was the real as well as the nominal purchaser.\nFor all that appears the real facts as to the purchase were unknown to the plaintiffs until just before the filing of the Bill.\nI have read the evidence several times with a view to ascertain exactly what is proved as regards the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the fact which is the vital point in this case, that Joseph Harper purchased under a preconcerted arrangement with Andrew Faulds, the vendor, as a trustee for, the latter, and I find it impossible, consistent with the proofs, to impute such knowledge to the plaintiffs or any of them at an earlier time than that mentioned by the Chief Justice in the extract I have just read from his judgment. It is true that they all along thought they had some claim upon their aunts in respect of their father\u2019s estate, but whether this was regarded by them as a legal or moral claim it is not easy to make out. Now, in order to constitute equitable acquiescence it is incumbent on the party who relies on it to prove, not merely that there was some vague suspicion of wrong, but that actual knowledge of the facts were brought home to the party to be affected by it.\nIt is said by a text writer[16]:\u2014\nAcquiescence also imputes knowledge, or the means of knowledge, of the material facts alleged to have been acquiesced in, for a person cannot be said to have acquiesced in what he did not know, and as to claims which he did not know he could dispute.\nAnd this I adopt as a fair statement of the principles settled by the numerous cases which are referred to as authorities\u2014particularly the Marquis of Clanricarde v. Henning[17], and Charter v. Trevelyan[18]. In the last well known case the whole principle upon which courts of equity give effect to lapse of time as a defence is succinctly stated by Lord Cottenham, and his judgment has always been considered as remarkable, as well for a correct exposition of the law as for the felicity of the language in which it is expressed. In Randall v. Errington[19], Sir William Grant states the principle very distinctly as follows:\nTo fix acquiescence upon a party it should unequivocally appear that he knew the fact upon which the supposed acquiescence is founded and to which it refers.\nApplying these principles here it is quite out of the question to say that any such defence is made out. The plaintiffs\u2019 case impeaching this sale rests not upon the mere fact that Andrew Faulds purchased in breach of his duty as a trustee for sale, for if he had so bought in the property openly and in his own name, the fact being patent to all the world, notice of it might well have been ascribed to the plaintiffs or at least to some of them, at a time sufficiently distant to make their subsequent laches a bar; but this is not the case of such an open breach of trust. Here the fiduciary vendor not only betrays the confidence which the court and the guardians of the infant heirs reposed in him, but he accompanies this wrong by another, by concerting a scheme by which his improper conduct should be concealed, thus practising a fraud upon the court as well as upon the beneficiaries, and also rendering it almost impossible that the real nature of the transaction should ever be discovered, unless in the course of time some accident should reveal it to the parties who were wronged, and it is evident that if Harper and Andrew Faulds had not themselves talked of the matter the real truth never would have been discovered. Then the ages of the plaintiffs at the date of the sale are also to be considered as affording another strong argument against this defence. The oldest at that time was not 14 years of age; their mother was not a person who could be expected to discover this fraud; how then could it be expected that such persons were to arrive at a knowledge of this hidden transaction which a person of acuteness and experience could only have discovered. On the whole, then, in my opinion, the defence on this point of acquiescence wholly fails. And had the statute of limitations been directly applicable the same result must have been reached; for by the express terms of section 26 of the original English Act (3 and 4 W. 4 cap. 27), R.S.O. cap. 108 sec. 31, it is enacted:\nThat in the case of a concealed fraud the right to bring an action to recover land shall be deemed to have first accrued when such fraud actually was, or with reasonable diligence might have been, first discovered.\nI hold, therefore, that there was no impediment in the way of giving the plaintiffs the preliminary relief of setting aside the sale and reducing the defendant, Margaret Harper, to the position of a mere mortgagee, as her father, the testator, originally was before he made the purchase, which I hold to have been, in equity, utterly void. Before leaving this part of the case I will quote a very apposite passage from the judgment of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland in the case of[20] Atkins v. Delmage, already referred to. He says:\nAs to the plaintiff, she appears to have been in poverty and indigence throughout, and she was not as fully informed of the particulars of the case as she certainly should have been; but independent of her rights, even supposing she could be considered as acquiescing, the court itself has been deceived in the transaction. This was a sale by the court, conducted by the defendant as an officer of the court, and as such responsible to it for the manner in which that sale was conducted; and yet it is now proved that the facts under which that sale took place were not disclosed to the court. I cannot hold that the doctrine of acquiesce ace can be extended to a case such as this, where one of the most wholesome rules of the court has been infringed without its knowledge; and if high ground is needed for holding that this sale, even at this distance of time, cannot be supported, I am not afraid of taking that ground, and saying that the court has never been informed of the sale till the hearing of this cause, and has never acquiesced in it.\nIf this is a correct statement of the law, and I have found nothing in the books to indicate that it is not, there cannot be the slightest pretence for saying that the plaintiffs rights in the present case so far as the sale is concerned, are affected by lapse of time or acquiescence.\nNext we have to deal with the question of redemption. The right to this is clear and cannot be disputed unless the statute of limitations applies. That it does not apply was the opinion of the Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal which I have already said appears to me to be correct, and that on grounds so obvious that I hardly expected to be able to find distinct authority for it. I have, however, found such authority. In the work of one of the earliest and best commentators on the statutes of limitations, that of the late Mr. Hayes[21], a book which may be safely quoted and acted upon as authority if any text writer may be so trusted, in considering the 28th section of the statute that learned writer says:\nThe possession of the mortgagee must have been gained by him in that character; if, therefore, he purchase the equity of redemption, and enter into possession, he cannot set up that possession as the possession of a mortgagee, in answer to the claims of persons seeking to impeach his title as purchaser.\nAnd after citing cases he adds further on:\nIn order to constitute a case, within either the new enactment or the old equitable doctrine, there must be the diligence of a mortgagee on the one hand and the laches of a mortgagor on the other[22].\nIf this is a correct statement of the law, and I accept it as such, it is decisive in favor of the plaintiffs who, not having lost their right to set aside the sale either by laches or acquiescence cannot be barred from redeeming by the operation of the statute on a possession which was never taken or held by the defendants, or their authors in the character of mortgagees. It follows, therefore, that the decree pronounced by the Divisional Court on the re-hearing, although for reasons differing from that court was substantially right. I think it well, however, to add that if I had to choose between the decisions in Caldwell v. Hall and those in Kinsman v. Rouse and Foster v. Patterson, I should certainly have agreed with the learned judges of the Divisional Court; for the reason that since the two cases in 17 Chancery Division, were decided the House of Lords has held in Pugh v. Heath[23] that a foreclosure suit is an action for the recovery of land. This being so it follows a fortiori that a redemption suit is also an action or suit for the recovery of land. And it is impossible, without doing violence to the words of the statute, to hold that the saving of disabilities does not apply to any action or suit, as well in equity as at law, for the recovery of land.\nThe effect of this construction of the statute would, in my opinion, have been to have entitled the plaintiffs to redeem the entirety, for I do not see how justice can properly be done unless the mortgagee, receiving the whole amount of the mortgage money, is compelled to give back the whole estate. There is no principle on which the mortgage money could be apportioned in such a case, and the mortgagee compelled to receive a proportionate part according to the value of that part of the estate which the mortgagor retained in possession; and paying the whole sum secured, the mortgagor can only have justice done to him by having returned to him the whole security. I find nothing in the statute against this mode of working out the redemption which is that authorized by Rakestraw v. Brewer.\nI omitted to mention a point which was considered of some weight in the Court of Appeal. It was suggested that the case on which the Chief Justice rested his judgment was not sufficiently made by the pleadings. I feel compelled to hold that the whole case for setting aside the sale, which is comprised in the fact that Andrew Faulds really purchased in Harper\u2019s name, is fully and sufficiently made by the 13th and 14th paragraphs of the bill already set forth, and in such a way as to satisfy all the requirements of equity pleading according to the rules prevalent in the most technical times. It is true that the bill does not expressly pray that the sale so impeached should be set aside, but as this is a necessary preliminary to the relief by way of redemption specifically prayed, it is clear that the plaintiffs are entitled to avail themselves of the prayer for general relief as sufficient for this purpose. At all events this court would be bound under the statute 43 Vic. ch. 34 sec. 1, to amend the prayer, if it should be necessary to do so, it being apparent that no surprise was operated by the omission of a specific prayer.\nThe order of the Court of Appeal should be reversed and the decree of the Divisional Court restored, but it should be prefaced by a declaration that the purchase of the lands at the sale under the decree by the defendant, Joseph Harper, was for the benefit of and as a trustee for Andrew Faulds, and that it was fraudulent and void in equity as regards the said Andrew Faulds and all persons claiming under him, save the defendant, Joseph Lane, who, it should be declared, is a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, and as such entitled to retain the benefit of his purchase, subject to the mortgage made by him in the pleadings mentioned. And it should be ordered and decreed accordingly. Further, there should be added to the decree a direction that the mortgage should be deposited in court, and it should be declared that the plaintiffs have a lien upon it and the money secured thereby for the amount which may be found due to them; and Lane should be ordered to pay the mortgage money into court as it becomes due. As the decree was varied by the Divisional Court there appears to be some slight verbal errors in the 3rd paragraph of it which must be corrected.\nAs regards the costs, the plaintiffs are entitled to be paid their costs by the defendants, the Harpers, up to and inclusive of the hearing, and the appellants are entitled to be paid by the same defendants their costs of the re-hearing in the Divisional Court; and of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this court. Subsequent costs and further directions are properly reserved by the decree.\nLane, as a purchaser for value without notice, is of course entitled to his costs, which his co\u2011defendants, the Harpers, must be ordered to pay to him.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J. and FOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ., concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an action brought by the appellants to redeem certain real estate transferred by mortgage by William Faulds, their father, to Andrew Faulds, who Was his father, dated the 29th April, 1857, to secure $1,900 and interest.\nWilliam Faulds died 1st July, 1858, in possession of the mortgaged premises, intestate, leaving his widow, Matilda, who is still living, and six children. Elijah Washington, born in 1844; James Linda, in 1848; Eliza Jane, in 1850\u2014died unmarried in April, 1868; William Martin, born 23rd May, 1852; Wesley Bell, born 24th February, 1855, and Matilda Elizabeth, born 24th November, 1857.\nAfter the death of the mortgagor, Andrew Faulds, the mortgagee, filed a bill of foreclosure in chancery, and obtained a decree for the sale of the mortgaged premises the 26th June, 1861. The sale, of which the mortgagee had the conduct, took place on the 12th of April, 1862. At that sale Joseph Harper, a son-in-law of Andrew Faulds, became the purchaser for $1,600.\nAndrew Faulds conveyed the mortgaged premises to Harper on the 16th of June, 1862, and on the same day Harper reconveyed to Andrew Faulds,\nOn the 29th December, 1879, the surviving executor of Andrew Faulds, under a power of sale in his will, conveyed the mortgaged premises to James C. Lane, one of the defendants, and the latter on the same day executed a mortgage thereon to Margaret Harper, another of the defendants, to secure the payment of $4,780.29, she being then the only one interested in the estate of her late father.\nIn 1862, after the execution of the deed to Harper, and the reconveyance to him by the latter, Andrew Faulds took possession of the premises and continued to hold them till he died, and the defendant, Margaret Harper, and others with and under her, kept possession thereof until the sale to Lane took place, and the latter has held the possession since.\nThe appellants, as the surviving heirs of William Faulds, the mortgagee, contend that the sale of the mortgaged premises by Andrew Faulds to Harper was in fact no sale in law, and that Harper was merely the agent of Andrew Faulds to purchase the property for him. That such was the case was, I think, abundantly proved, and the six learned judges before whom this case has been heard have so decided. I think their decisions cannot be questioned by this court. The right of the appellants to redeem in the absence of a legal sale is not and cannot be questioned, and for reasons readily suggested to a legal mind no valid sale was made.\nThe defence of the statute of limitations and laches are pleaded as a defence, and it is therefore necessary to ascertain if the right of the appellants to recover was barred when this action was commenced, as it was by bill of complaint filed on the 27th February, 1880. The law in force as to the limitation of suits in 1862, when Andrew Faulds went into possession, is to be found in the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, passed in 1859, chap. 88. Sec. 21 limits the right of redemption, where the mortgagee has been in possession, to twenty years, and by section 16 the right is then extinguished. Other limitations are enacted in other sections of the Act before the 45th section, which provides that:\u2014\nIf at the time at which the right of any person to bring an action to recover any land shall have first accrued, as hereinbefore mentioned, such person shall have been an infant, then such person, or the person or persons claiming through him, may, notwithstanding the period of twenty years hereinbefore limited shall have expired, bring an action to recover such land at any time within ten years next after the time at which the person to whom such right shall have first accrued as aforesaid shall have ceased to be under any such disability or shall have died.\nThat section clearly and unmistakeably applied to the provisions of section 21.\nBy sec. 8 of chap. 1 of the Consolidated Statutes it is provided:\nThat the said Consolidated Statutes shall not be held to operate as new laws, but shall be constructed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the said Acts and parts of Acts so repealed, and for which the said Consolidated Statutes are substituted.\nSec. 9 of the last mentioned Act provides:\nBut if on any point the provisions of the Consolidated Statutes are not in effect the same as those of the repealed Acts, then as respects all transactions, matters and things subsequent to the time when the said Consolidated Statutes take effect, the provisions contained in them shall prevail.\nWe need not, therefore, as to this point refer to any of the repealed statutes, for the provisions of the Consolidated Statutes operated from the date they were passed. The provisions of section 45 are, no doubt, applicable to those of section 21, and that the words in the second line of the former of the two sections, \u201cto bring an action to recover any land\u201d includes an action for redemption of mortgaged premises. The authorities go to sustain that proposition, The law relating to disabilities operated until the Act of 1874 was passed., The object of that Act, as stated in the preamble, is to lessen the time for bringing certain actions\u2014in some cases from forty to twenty years, and in other cases from twenty to ten years, \u201cand also to lessen the time for redemption of mortgages,\u201d &c. No other object is stated, nor is it stated that the Act is to have any other effect.\nBy sec. 21 of the Consolidated Statutes the time for bringing an action for redemption was 20 years. By sec. 8 of the Act of 1874, the time was reduced to ten years\u2014so that the obvious intention of the Act as stated in the preamble was carried out. The words of the two sections are exactly alike with the exception of the substitution of the words \u201cshall have\u201d for the word \u201chas\u201d in the 21st section, and the word \u201cten\u201d for \u201ctwenty\u201d The principal difference between the two Acts arises from the fact that the disability clause, in the Act of 1874, forms section five, which precedes the provision in section 8, by which the right to redeem is limited to ten years.\nSection 5 provides:\nThat if at the time at which the right of any one \u201cto bring the action or suit to recover any land shall have first accrued,\u201d shall be under the disability of infancy, then such person or the person claiming through him, \u201cmay, notwithstanding the period of ten years or five years (as the case may be), hereinbefore limited, shall have expired,\u201d bring an action to recover such land at any time within five years after the disability ceased.\nSection 8 provides:\nThat where a mortgagee shall have obtained possession of any land comprised in his mortgage, the mortgagor shall not bring any action or suit to redeem, but within ten years next after the time the mortgagee obtained such possession, unless in the meantime an acknowledgment in writing of the title of the mortgagor or of his right of redemption signed by the mortgagee and given to the mortgagor or some person claiming the estate, &c.\nIt is contended on the part of the respondents that the provisions of section 5 must be limited to those cases referred to in the previous sections, and therefore that they cannot properly be extended or applied to the cases referred to in section 8, and that contention has been sustained by three out of the four learned judges of the Court of Appeal, but a different conclusion was arrived at by the learned Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal, by two other learned judges in the Division Court, and by the learned Vice-Chancellor. Indepen- dently of this diversity of opinion, it must be admitted that the question is not easy of solution.\nFrom a consideration of the object stated in the preamble to the Act and the position of the sections in the Consolidated Statutes, and in the absence of any good reason that I have been able to find for making the change by which ten years\u2019 possession by a mortgagee would absolutely bar the rights of infants incapable in the eye of the law of protecting their own rights, I can hardly arrive at the conclusion that it was so intended. To sustain that conclusion it is only necessary to give a case that is not unlikely to occur. A property is mortgaged for an amount equal to a small percentage of its value by a man who at his death leaves two or three infants, not one of whom are over five or six years of age at the time the mortgagee enters into a possession, as he is entitled to do\u2014he holds that possession for ten years and the right to redeem of the infants, not one of whom is then over sixteen or seventeen years, is forever barred. I cannot think that such was ever deliberately intended to be the result of the change of position of the sections in the Act of 1874 from that in the Consolidated Statutes, and the whole difficulty has been caused by that change. Previous to the Act of 1874 we may safely say that the policy was to protect the rights of infants in such cases by legislative enactments, and I have never heard that the soundness of that policy was questioned in any civilized country. Before the making of such a sweeping change of policy we would naturally expect to hear that the question of changing it had been urged and publicly debated and considered, and I think we are not going out of our way in a case like the present, to suggest, as the result of our knowledge of parliamentary procedure and the knowledge we, as part of the public, are in a position to obtain of the agitation of important public measures, to say that the propriety of making the change contended for in that policy was not publicly debated or agitated. From every consideration I have been enabled to give to the subject I cannot but feel, and say, that the change in the relative position of the sections was not intended to affect the rights of infants. I am quite aware of the decisions in England to which reference is made in the judgments of the two learned judges of the Court of Appeal, in which a different conclusion was arrived at, but which I consider it unnecessary in this case to criticise, as a decision on the point to determine it, is, in my opinion, unnecessary.\nIn order to lay a foundation for the defence of the statute of limitations, as pleaded in this case, or to obtain the aid of section 8 of the Act of 1874, it is necessary to establish the position that the possession taken of the mortgaged premises by the mortgagee, and subsequently held by him and those claiming through him, was that of a mortgagee. Looking at the defence let us see how it bears upon the point. It is that Andrew Faulds, the mortgagee, after the death of the mortgagor, obtained an order for foreclosure and sale\u2014that he, as authorized by the order and according to its terms, sold the mortgaged premises to the defendant Harper\u2014that the latter paid him the amount for which the same was sold, upon which he (a month or two after the sale) made the necessary conveyance to Harper\u2014that he subsequently on the same day purchased the same premises from Harper and obtained from him a conveyance in fee simple thereof, upon which he went into possession as such purchaser from Harper and retained that possession till he died, and that the possession of the same has been since held by his devisees, who claim under his last will and testament. That such was the nature and character of the possession proved and contended for on the trial, on the part of the defence, one has only to read the evidence of defendants, Harper and his wife. How, then, can the limitation in section 8 before referred to apply? Andrew Faulds clearly, by all the evidence on both sides, took possession, not as a mortgagee by virtue of the grant by mortgage to him, for by his own acts he relinquished that position as soon as he made the sale and conveyance to Harper, and how can he or those claiming under him be permitted for any purpose to assume it again. The object of the statute of limitations was to protect the interests of a mortgagee, who, acting on his right under the mortgage entered into possession as such mortgagee. Before, therefore, he or those claiming through him can evoke the aid of that statute, it must be shown that he entered as such mortgagee and held as such for the prescribed period. Where, then, in this case, is the evidence to sustain such a position? None that I can discover; but, on the contrary, abundant that he did not enter as such mortgagee.\nThe possession that Andrew Faulds took was that of a purchaser from Harper and those claiming through him are equally affected with him. There is a statute of limitation applicable to that kind of possession by which the rights of others may be barred in ten years. An action to redeem, where the mortgagee has not entered, as such, into possession of the mortgaged premises, is, as I before stated, covered by the general provision in regard to the bringing of actions to recover land as referred to in section 5 of the Act of 1874, which provides for the disability of infants. As to the plaintiffs, Wesley Bell Faulds and Matilda Elizabeth Faulds, the action was brought within the limitation of five years after the disability of infancy had expired.\nThere is also another important position to be considered. The alleged sale to Harper was fraudulent and void, and the nature and character of the possession was ab initio fraudulent. Andrew Faulds entered into possession as a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser from Harper, who, it was alleged, had become a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser from the former under a sale by which he, Harper, by the conveyance from Andrew Faulds to him, gave him a title in fee simple of the mortgaged premises, and by that sale and conveyance the equity of redemption of the heirs of William Faulds, including the appellants in this case, was forever barred. By the course adopted Andrew Faulds fraudulently got possession of the property, and he and the others holding under him managed to retain that possession. The statute well provides that where the possession of land is obtained by fraudulent means the operation of the statute of limitation commences to run only from the time of the discovery of the fraud by the party or parties interested or from the time when the same might have been discovered.\nThere is no evidence which shows that the fraud alluded to was discovered by, or known to, any of the appellants until about a year before the commencement of this action. It is not shown that either of the parties to it ever spoke of or admitted it, or that any one of the appellants had any knowledge of it up to the time I have stated, and how, and from whom, were they to learn the nature of the hidden and secret transactions between Andrew Faulds and Harper. It must be recollected that at the time of the sale the eldest of the appellants was but eighteen, and the youngest but five years old. None of them, much less the younger ones, would know at that time anything about property or their rights in regard to property, and would not be likely afterwards to know much more, or to suspect that anything was wrong or fraudulent as to the property in question; and in such a case, I think actual knowledge or something very much the same should be shown, and nothing of the kind has been shown. But how can such a position be claimed\u2014that is laches after knowledge of the fraud when the defence set up denies that any such fraud existed, and two of the defendants, Harper and his wife in their evidence, swear that the purchase by Harper was bon\u00e2 fide and not for Andrew Faulds? The statute of limitations therefore cannot be a bar to the recovery by the appellants. In that case all the appellants are entitled to redeem, and the question that was considered by the learned Vice Chancellor and the learned Judges of the Divisional Court as to shares or interests to be decreed to be redeemed will not arise.\nIf my views in regard to the matter lastly considered be not sustained, but that it should be adjudged that the younger ones of the appellants are entitled to redeem, then I concur in the views of the learned judges of the Divisional Court, and am of the opinion that a decree for the redemption of the whole of the mortgaged premises should be passed in the usual form with costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: T.H.

The said section does not constitute the individual judges of the Supreme Court of Canada separate and independent courts, nor confer on the judges a jurisdiction outside of and independent of the court, and obedience to a writ issued under said section cannot be enforced by the judge but by the court, which alone can issue an attachment for contempt in not obeying its process. (Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting.)\nPer Strong J.\u2014The words of section 51 expressly giving an appeal when the writ of habeas corpus has been refused or the prisoner remanded, must be attributed to the excessive caution of the legislature to provide all due protection to the subject in the matter of personal liberty, and not to an intention to deprive the court of the right to entertain appeals from and revise, rescind and vary orders made under this section. The right to issue a writ of habeas corpus being limited by section 51 to \" an enquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada, \" such writ cannot be issued in a case of murder, which is a case at common law. (Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting.)\nPer Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting.\u2014The restriction imposed by section 51 to \" an enquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada \" is merely intended to exclude any enquiry into the cause of commitment for the infraction of some provincial law ; and the words \" in any criminal case \" were inserted to exclude the habeas corpus in civil matters ; it is sufficient to give jurisdiction if the commitment be in virtue of an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nQuery\u2014Is section 51 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court ultra vires?\nSemble, that when a judge in a province has the right to issue a writ of habeas corpus returnable in term as well as in vacation, a judge of the Supreme Court might make the writ he authorizes returnable in said court in term as well as immediately. (Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting.)\nAn application to the court to quash a writ of habeas corpus as improvidently issued may be entertained in the absence of the prisoner. (Henry J. dissenting.)\nAfter a conviction for a felony by a court having general jurisdiction over the offence charged, a writ of habeas corpus is an inappropriate remedy.\nIf the record of a superior court, produced on an application for a writ of habeas corpus, contains the recital of facts requisite to confer jurisdiction it is conclusive and cannot be contradicted by \u00e5xtrinsic evidence. (Henry J. dissenting.)\nA return by the sheriff to the writ setting out such conviction and sentence and the affirmation thereof by the court of error is a good and sufficient return. If actually written by him or under his direction the return need not be signed by the sheriff. (Henry J. dissenting.)\nThe Supreme Court of British Columbia is clothed with all the powers and jurisdiction, civil and criminal, necessary or essential to the full and perfect administration of justice civil or criminal, in the province ; powers as full and ample as those known to the common law and possessed by the superior courts of England.\nThe various statutes of British Columbia providing for the holding of Courts of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery render unnecessary a commission to the presiding judge. Per Strong J.\u2014The power of issuing a commission, if necessary, belonged to the Lieutenant Governor of the province. (Henry J. contra.)\nAn order made pursuant to Dominion Statute 32 and 33 Vic. ch. 29 sec. 11, directing a change of venue, would be sufficient although containing no reference to any provision for expenses, when the indictment has been pleaded to and the trial proceeded with without objection, and even in a court of error there could be no valid objection to a conviction founded on such order.\nEven if the writ of habeas corpus in this case had been rightly issued, the prisoner on the materials before the Judge was not entitled to his discharge, but should have been remanded.\nMOTION to quash a writ of habeas corpus issued by Henry J. in chambers as being improvidently issued.\nThe material facts presented to the court on the motion are as follows :\nIn June, 1885, a murder was committed in the District of Kootenay, B.C., and Robert Evan Sproule was charged with the commission of the crime and committed for trial. On the application of the Attorney General of the province, an order was made by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the province to change the venue from Kootenay to the District of Victoria, which order was in the following words :\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\nTo wit :\nWhereas it appears to the satisfaction of me, Matthew Baillie Begbie, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, a judge who might hold or sit in the court at which Robert E. Sproule, a prisoner, now confined in New Westminster gaol, under a warrant of commitment given under the hand and seal of Arthur W. Howell, one of Her Majesty's justices of the peace in and for the Province of British Columbia, is liable to be indicted for that he, the said Robert E. Sproule, did on the first day of June, A. D. 1885, feloniously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought, kill and murder one Thomas Hammill ; that it is expedient that the trial of the said Robert E. Sproule should be held in the city of Victoria (being a place other than that in which the said offence is supposed to have been committed) ;\nI do order that the trial of the said Robert E Sproule shall be proceeded with at the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery, to be holden at the city of Victoria, and I do order the keeper of the New Westminster gaol to deliver the said Robert E Sproule to the keeper of the gaol at Victoria city, and I do order and command you the keeper of the said gaol at Victoria city, to receive the said Robert E. Sproule into your custody in the said gaol, and there safely keep him until he shall be thence delivered by due course of the law.\nDated at Victoria, this 13th October, 1885.\n(Signed) MATT. B. BEGBIE C.J.\nThe prisoner was then indicted and tried at Victoria, found guilty, and sentenced to death. A writ of error was subsequently granted and a return made to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In making up the record on the writ of error it appeared that the order to change the venue contained no provision for payment by the Crown of increased expenses to the prisoner in holding the trial at Victoria, and the Chief Justice thereupon signed the following order :\nCANADA,\nProvince of British Columbia.\nREGINA V. ROBERT E. SPROULE.\nAt the City of Victoria, Tuesday the thirteenth day of October, A.D 1885.\nUpon motion of Mr. P. E. Irving, of counsel for the Crown, in the presence and hearing of Robert E. Sproule, a person charged with and committed to stand his trial for having on the 1st day of June, A.D. 1885, at Kootenay Lake, in the bailiwick of the sheriff of Kootenay, in the Province of British Columbia, feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, killed and murdered one Thomas Hammill ;\nAnd upon hearing Mr. Theodore Davie, of counsel for the said Robert E. Sproule, and it appearing to my satisfaction that it is expedient to the ends of justice that the trial of the said Robert E. Sproule, for the alleged crime, should be held at the city of Victoria ;\nAnd Mr. Irving now undertaking on behalf of the Crown to abide by such order as the judge who may preside at the trial may think just to meet the equity of the eleventh section of 32-33 Vic. cap. 29, intituled : \" An Act respecting procedure in criminal cases, and other matters relating to criminal law,\" such being the conditions which I think proper to prescribe ;\nI, Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, Knight, Chief Justice of British Columbia, and being a judge who might hold or sit in the court at which the said Robert E. Sproule is liable to be indicted for the cause aforesaid, do hereby order that the trial of the said Robert E. Sproule shall be proceeded with at the city of Victoria, in the said province, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery, to be holden at the said city, on Monday the 23rd day of November, 1885, next.\nAnd I order that the said Robert E. Sproule be removed hence to the gaol at the City of Victoria, and that the keeper of the said gaol do receive the said Robert E. Sproule into his custody in the said gaol, and him safely keep until he shall thence be delivered by due course of law.\n(Signed) MATT. B. BEGBIE C.J.\nThis order was placed in the record as the order for change of venue. The counsel for the prisoner alleged diminution of the record on the ground that this order was not the true order made for change of venue, and was not in existence at the time of the trial ; and, also, that an application which he had made at the close of the trial for the polling of the jury should appear on the record. Both these points were overruled by the court.\nThe substantial matters of error assigned upon the record, and argued before the full court, were :\n1. That the indictment did not show the alleged offence to have been committed within the jurisdiction of the court, or within the realm at all, the only venue which appeared being \" British Columbia, to wit,\" which, since the province was divided into judicial districts, was no venue.\n2. That there was no valid order to change the venue, and the Court of Oyer and Terminer at Victoria had no authority to try the prisoner ; and\n3. That the court was held under a commission from the Lieutenant Governor of the province, and was not a properly constituted court, as the Governor General only could issue the commission.\nThese grounds of error were all overruled by the unanimous decision of the court, and the prisoner was remanded to gaol.\nThe counsel for the prisoner then applied to Mr. Justice Henry, of the Supreme Court of Canada, for a writ of habeas corpus, and the learned judge granted the following rule nisi :\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA.\nMonday the 3rd day of May, A.D. 1886.\nUpon hearing Mr. D'Alton McCarthy Q.C. as of counsel for Robert Evan Sproule, and upon reading the affidavits of Theodore Davie filed respectively on the 3rd May, 1886,\nI do order that the sheriff for Vancouver Island, James Eliphlet McMillan, Esquire, do show cause before me, at my chambers, at the Supreme Court house, in the city of Ottawa, on Saturday, the twenty-second day of May instant, why a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum should not issue to t\u00e8e said sheriff requiring him to bring before the court the body of the said Robert Evan Sproule-together with the day and cause of his detention, and why in the event of this order or rule being made absolute, or the writ being allowed the said Robert Evan Sproule should not be discharged without the writ of habeas corpus actually issuing and without the prisoner being personally brought before the court.\n(Signed) W. A. HENRY.\nA Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nOn the return of the rule nisi McCarthy Q.C. and Theodore Davie appeared for the prisoner, and Burbidge Q.C. and J. J. Gormully for the Crown, and the same grounds were taken and argued as had previously been urged before the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the writ of error, the counsel for the Crown contending, in addition to the points involved in the case itself, that as there was no appeal from the decision on the writ of error, the court being unanimous, the prisoner should not be allowed to take this proceeding, which was virtually an appeal, and so evade the statute.\nHis Lordship having heard the argument ordered the issue of the writ of habeas corpus delivering the following judgment :\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an order to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum should not issue to the sheriff of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to bring up the body of the above named Robert Evan Sproule, together with the day and cause of his detention in the custody of the said sheriff, and why, in the event of the allowance of the said writ, the said Robert Evan Sproule should not be discharged from the said custody without the actual issue of the said writ or the attendance of the said Robert Evan Sproule before me.\nThe order was duly served upon the sheriff of Vancouver Island and upon the Attorney General of British Columbia ; and on the argument before me, on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth days of May last past, cause was shown on behalf of the Crown against the discharge of the prisoner.\nThe argument on both sides was able and exhaustive, and my labor and inquiry much less than would otherwise have been necessary.\nHaving since been occupied, however, in the hearing of arg\u00f5ments in term or session of the court, and in delivering judgment in other cases in court, I have not been able to prepare my judgment at an earlier date.\nThe case is a novel one, particularly in the Dominion, and required, and has had, my best consideration.\nThe judges of the Supreme Court of Canada derive their authority in regard to writs of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum from the 51st section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act of the Dominion, passed in 1875, which is as follows :\nAny judge of the Supreme Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada * * *\nThe Supreme Court of British Columbia has complete cognizance of all pleas whatsoever, \" and has \" jurisdiction in all cases, civil as well as criminal, aris-\" ing within the said colony of British Columbia.\" That court has, and its judges have, full jurisdiction in respect of the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum and the judges of this court have, therefore, under the 51st section I have cited, the same jurisdiction.\nHaving then such jurisdiction the next inquiry is as to its applicability to the circumstances of this case.\nIt is not appellate but original, deriving its power and authority from the section before-mentioned.\nIn such a case we cannot, in any way, review the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, but must confine our consideration to the question of jurisdiction over the subject-matter in question, exercised by a court, and resulting in the conviction and sentence of a person charged with a criminal offence. If the court before whom the prisoner in this case was tried and convicted had the necessary jurisdiction I cannot interfere. This position was taken on the argument and well sustained by binding authorities.\nThe authorities go, however, as effectually to sustain the proposition that when ascertaining the cause of the commitment of a prisoner it is shown that the court had no jurisdiction to try and convict him he is entitled by law to his discharge. The law has provided the mode and manner for trying parties accused of crimes and the courts before whom they are to be tried ; and no one can be legally sentenced unless tried and convicted by competent authority and according to law. If any necessary link in the chain to constitute jurisdiction be wanting no one can be legally punished. If the judge who presides at a criminal trial be without proper authority in regard to such a trial the conviction is a nullity, and so in all other cases where, from any cause, there was not jurisdiction, and when such want of jurisdiction is made to appear, it must necessarily result in the discharge of the convicted party.\nNumerous authorities might be cited to sustain that proposition.\nI cannot in this connection do better than quote from the judgment of Chief Justice Cockburn in Martin v. Mackonochie[2].\nIt seems to me, I must say, a strange argument in a court of justice to say that when, as the law stands, formal proceedings are in strict law required, yet if no substantial injustice has been done by dealing summarily with a defendant, the proceedings should be upheld. In a court of law such an argument a convenienti is surely inadmissible. In a criminal proceeding the question is not alone whether substantial justice has been done but whether justice has been done according to law. All proceedings in poenam are, it need scarcely be observed, strictissimi juris ; nor should it be forgotten that the formalities of law, though here and there they may lead to the escape of an offender, are intended, on the whole, to insure the safe administration of justice and the protection of innocence, and must be observed.\nA party accused has the right to insist on them as a matter of right, of which he cannot be deprived against his will ; and the judge must see that they are followed. He cannot set himself above the law which he has to administer, or make or mould it to suit the exigencies of a particular occasion. Though a murderer should be taken red-handed in the act, if there is a flaw in the indictment the criminal must have the benefit of it. If the law is imperfect it is for the legislature to amend it. The judge must administer it as he finds it. And the procedure by which an offender is to be tried, though but ancillary to the application of the substantive law and to the ends of justice, is as much part of the law as the substantive law itself * * *. The law constitutes a given act an offence. As such it attaches to it a given punshisment. But it prescribes a plenary course of procedure by which, if at all, the offence is to be brought home to a party charged with having committed it. If a court having jurisdiction over the offence takes upon itself to substitute a different and more summary method of proceeding, surely this is to make the court, as it were, supersede the law.\nThe prisoner was indicted at Victoria and tried there under an indictment which is as follows :\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\nTo wit :\nThe jurors for our Lady the Queen upon their oath present that Robert E. Sproule, on the first day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five, feloniously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought, did kill and murder one Thomas Hammill, against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and dignity.\nThe homicide of Hammill took place at or near to Kootenay, in British Columbia, distant from Victoria about seven hundred miles. The province was, by several Acts of its legislature, the last of which was in 1885, divided into judicial districts or circuits ; and courts of assize and nisi prius, and of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery, were provided to be held at each of the undermentioned places, at the times mentioned in the Act, that is to say, at the city of Victoria, at the city of Nanaimo, at the city of New Westminster, and at other places, including the bailiwick of Kootenay.\nBefore the trial it is shown by affidavit that an order for a change of venue to Victoria was made, and signed by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia. That order was subsequently considered, and no doubt properly, defective, as it made no provision, as required by the statute, for such conditions as to the payment of any additional expenses thereby caused to the accused as the court or judge may think proper to prescribe. The prisoner, previous to the making of that order, was in custody for a crime alleged to have been committed by him within the bailiwick of the sheriff of Kootenay, but was taken by some process, the nature of which does not appear, before the learned Chief Justice ; and, by his order before referred to, committed for trial to the custody of the sheriff of Vancouver, where he was during the trial and now is. It has been satisfactorily shown by affidavit that the only order for a change of venue in existence at the time of the trial of the prisoner was the one before-mentioned. If that order is defective, then the trial of the prisoner was without authority.\nBy law, the trial should have been had in the bailiwick where the homicide took place, unless the venue for the trial was changed as by law prescribed and required. The right of the court or a judge to order a change of venue in a criminal case is upon the condition following : \" But such order shall be made upon such \" conditions as to the payment of any additional expense \" thereby caused to the accused as the court or judge \" may think proper to prescribe.\"\nWhen it may be the case that a prisoner charged with an offence is without means to provide for his defence at a place distant from the ordinary place of trial, to change the venue without at the same time making provision for the additional expense would practically prevent him from making any defence, and the order for doing so would be manifestly unjust.\nThe legislature has therefore properly and humanely provided that the court or a judge, meaning no doubt the court or judge making the order, shall consider all the circumstances in relation to the change of venue, and make the order conditional upon the payment of any additional expense thereby caused. The statute requires the court or a judge to decide in his discretion \" as to the payment of any additional expense. \" The trial in this case took place six or seven hundred miles from Kootenay, and the prisoner before being tried had the right to the opinion and decision of the judge as to the amount to be previously paid to him. I say previously paid, because, for good and palpable reasons, the statute has clearly made the decision of the judge and the payment of the additional expense as settled by him conditions precedent to the operation of the order. Those conditions not having been prescribed a peremptory order was made which I think was wholly unwarranted and void.\nI have considered this matter from the position shown in the affidavits read on behalf of the prisoner, made by Theodore Davie, Esquire, counsel of the prisoner, who, in one of them says : \" That the order in the above \" matter as drawn up and in existence at the time of \" the trial of the said Robert Evan Sproule, referred to \" in the affidavit of James E. McMillan filed herein on \" the 22nd of May instant, was in the words and \" figures of the document hereunto annexed and marked \" A, and not otherwise.\" Annexed to that affidavit is the copy of the order purporting to have been made on the 13th October, 1885, by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia ; and it contains no reference whatever to the matter of the additional expenses of the prisoner. In another affidavit, which is referred to in the order herein, the same deponent stated that on the 13th day of October, 1885, the said Robert Evan Sproule was brought in custody before His Lordship the Hon. Sir Matthew Baillie Begby, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, at the Supreme Court house at the city of Victoria aforesaid, whereupon an application was made on behalf of the Crown, the result of which was that an order was made by the said Chief Justice, and drawn up and signed by him, directing the trial to proceed at the city of Victoria, instead of at Kootenay, without imposing any terms or conditions. Accompanying the last-mentioned affidavit a verified copy of the record of the trial was produced, and in that affidavit the said Theodore Davie further says : The order for \" change of venue set out in the second and third pages \" of the said exhibited copy record, was not in existence \" at the time of the trial and sentence, but was drawn up \" and signed and issued subsequently. Before proceed-\" ing to assign errors upon the record, I alleged a diminu-\" tion of the record and applied for a certiorari upon my \" own affidavit, showing that the order for change of \" venue set out in the record was not the true one, or in \" existence at the time of the trial and judgment * \" * * The court after hearing argument \" overruled the same.\"\nHere then the error alleged was brought by affidavit to the notice of the court, but the allegations of error were overruled. Should they have been if the facts are truly stated in the affidavits referred to ? The court was asked to correct the record for the reasons alleged, but declined to do so without showing in its judgment why. I have, however, been furnished with the reasons of the learned judges in a report of the argument, and, strange to say, the allegation that the order for the change of venue as appearing in the record was made up after the trial and sentence of the prisoner is not referred to. The fact is neither admitted nor denied. The order purports to have been made and signed by the learned Chief Justice. If so made he was in a position to affirm or deny the allegation. It purports to have been made on the 13th of October, 1885, the same date with the order shown by the affidavit of Mr. Davie to have been made and signed on that day. If two orders were made on that day the fact could easily and should have been shown. When delivering judgment in the matter the learned Chief Justice said : \" We are all of opinion that the order of the 13th October, \" 1885, for the removal of the trial to Victoria was a \" good and proper order under sec. 11 of the Canadian \" Procedure Act, 1869, ch. 29, and that the condition as \" to costs was an expedient and sufficient condition. \" The learned Chief Justice then dealt with a contention of Mr. Davie, that the statute only applied to a case of change of venue after an indictment found, but made no reference to the allegation under oath of Mr. Davie, that although it appeared as if made on the 13th October, 1885, it was not in fact made or in existence till after the trial and sentence. I can hardly think any respectable counsel, or any other sane person, would have the temerity to make such a statement to the court, if unfounded, when he knew one of the learned judges must know that it was so, but the allegation having been made, and not in any way contradicted, the truth of it must be assumed. The reference of the Chief Justice is to the order appearing in the record, but he does not say that it was made before the trial, and therefore does not contradict the statement otherwise of Mr. Davie in regard to it. Whether the record must be received as conclusive is, however, another matter, and one I will hereafter deal with. If, then, the order as shown in the record was not made before the trial, some one is answerable for antedating it or the record assigned a wrong date to it. There can be no reasonable doubt that two orders were in fact made, the one last referred to, as I think, being intended to supply what was considered a fatal defect in the previous one. It would be absurd to say that an order, made after the trial held in a wrong place, could relate back and give jurisdiction where none existed when the trial took place. It would be like the case of an execution for murder without a conviction.\nI have already given it as my opinion that the order alleged to have been first made was defective, and, as I find that the other was not made till after the trial and sentence, I think the trial of the prisoner was improperly and illegally removed to Victoria ; but should I be wrong in my conclusion that the order set forth in the record was not made till after the trial, I will consider the question of its validity if made, as it purports to have been, on the 13th October, 1885. After setting out that it appeared to the satisfaction of the learned Chief Justice, who made it, that it was expedient to the ends of justice that the trial of the said Robert Evan Sproule for the alleged crime should be held at the city of Victoria, His Lordship ordered as follows :\nAnd Mr. Irving now undertaking on behalf of the crown to abide by such order as the judge who may preside at the trial may think just to meet the equity of the eleventh section of the 32 & 33 Vic. chap. 29, intituled \" An Act respecting procedure in criminal cases and other matters relating to Criminal Law \" : Such being the conditions which I think proper to prescribe, I, Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, Knight, Chief Justice of British Columbia, and being a judge who might hold or sit in the court at which the said Robert Evan Sproule is liable to be indicted for the cause aforesaid, do hereby order that the trial of the said Robert E. Sproule shall be proce\u00e5ded with at the city of Victoria, in the said province, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery, to be holden at the said city on Monday the 23rd day of November, 1885.\"\nIs that then a valid order within the terms of the statute that requires the court or the judge that makes the order to prescribe, and by which to settle, the conditions as to the payment of the additional expense? The statute gave no power of delegation to the court or a judge. The allowance of additional expenses might be to enable a prisoner to secure the attendance of witnesses for his defence, and a poor man would require provision to be made for their atten\u00e4ance by the judge who makes an order of the kind. To postpone the consideration until the trial would, in some cases, be a virtual denial of that which the statute has provided for. The wrong would be done, and if the prisoner should have been convicted what benefit, as to the trial, would be an order from the presiding judge for additional expenses ? The clear intention of the provision, was to put the prisoner in no worse pecuniary position as to his trial, in the case of a change of venue. The court or judge applied to for an order for that purpose should, on proper and necessary inquiry, decide as to the amount, if the inquiry satisfied him additional expense would be incurred, and insert it in the order ; and having done so, the payment should be considered a condition precedent to the operation of the order.\nIn no other way could the interests of a prisoner be sufficiently protected, for if once removed he would have no security that the additional expenses would be furnished to him in sufficient time before his trial, and he should not be left to depend on the undertaking of any irresponsible person. In this case the learned judge seems to have made no inquiry whatever before making the order. He decided nothing as to the matter, but made the order upon Mr. Irving's undertaking, on the part of the Crown, to abide by an order to be subsequently made by the judge who might preside at the trial.\nA judge's order of such a character is, I consider, void, and must be so considered in all cases where the terms upon which the statute allows it to be made are not fulfilled, and where the judge does not himself first do what the statute enjoins as necessary to give him jurisdiction over the subject-matter. A party accused of the committal of a crime is required, by the law, to be tried in the bailiwick where it is alleged to have been committed. The grand jury there are to find an indictment against him before he can be put on his trial, and twelve good and lawful men of that bailiwick form a necessary part of the tribunal. If the order for the change of venue is defective, as I in this case hold it is, the grand jury of no other place could find a bill of indictment against him, and no other petit jury could legally be empanelled to try him.\nChief Justice Cockburn, in his remarks in the case before-mentioned, and which I repeat, says :\nAnd the procedure by which an offender is to be tried, though but ancillary to the application of the substantive law, and to the end of justice, is as much part of the law as the substantive law itself.\nIt was when deciding upon a rule, calling on Lord Penzance, the official principal of the Arches Court of Canterbury, and J. Martin, to shew cause why a writ of prohibition should not issue to prohibit the said court from publishing, proceeding with, or enforcing a decree of suspension ab officio et beneficio made against the Rev. Alexander H. MacKonochie, clerk, in a suit Martin v. MacKonochie, such decree being one which was made without jurisdiction. It was contended, and admitted, that the Arches Court had jurisdiction over cases of the kind in question, but only at the request of the Diocesan Court, and that no such request was shown. The writ of prohibition was granted because of the want of jurisdiction in the Court of Arches.\nIn this case, I think, for the reasons I have given, there was no jurisdiction t\u00ef try the prisoner at Victoria.\nI will now consider whether or not it is permissible, in a case like the present, to contradict the record.\nIt is well understood that in a great variety of cases the record of a court of competent jurisdiction is not only conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein but in many cases the only proof ; still, where the jurisdiction is impeached it appears to me that the mere statements in a record, by which jurisdiction is shown, should not prevail where evidence by affidavit shows conclusively that the statements are erroneous. The question of jurisdiction in a proceeding like this being raised, I think, for the true and proper determination of that question, evidence should be admitted to show that there was really no jurisdiction. To state perhaps an extreme case ; should a man be hanged or punished when it could be shown by extrinsic evidence that the tribunal had no authority to try or convict him ? In Crepps v. Durden et alio [3] we find it stated :\nBut a question has occasionally arisen, whether in cases where the justices have proceeded without jurisdiction, and have, nevertheless, stated upon the face of the conviction matter showing a jurisdiction, it be competent to the defendant to prove the want of jurisdiction by affidavit.\nIt certainly appears desirable that the court should have the power to entertain the question of jurisdiction. Some cases might easily be suggested where not only great private but great public inconvenience might arise from leaving an invalid order or conviction unreversed, and great injustice might be caused by allowing justices, out of or in sessions, by making their order or conviction good upon the face of it, to give themselves a jurisdiction over matters not entrusted to them by law. At page 241 of the same book we find it said :\nSupposing that the court below cannot be compelled by mandamus to show the defect of jurisdiction upon the record, the next question is, will the court above allow evidence of such defect of jurisdiction to be laid before it by way of affidavit on the record being brought before it by a writ of certiorari ?\nIn R. v. St. James, Westminster[4] it was remarked by Mr. Justice Taunton (a judge whose obiter dicta are always worthy of the greatest attention) that this had been constantly done. In R. v. The Inhabitants of Great Marlow[5] an appointment of overseers, good on the face of it, was allowed to be questioned by affidavit on the ground of a defect of jurisdiction and was finally quashed.\nThe court in that case had taken time to consider as to the practice with regard to receiving the affidavit, and Mr. Justice Laurence mentioned several cases in which that course had been pursued. In the case of R. v. Justices of Cheshire[6] the question was a good deal discussed ; and it seems to have been admitted that affidavits might be looked at for the purpose of showing a defect of jurisdiction. It cannot be disputed \" said Mr. Justice Coleridge in the latter case \" that there are many cases in which affidavits may be looked at in order to ascertain whether there was jurisdiction or not ; for suppose an order made which was good on the face of it, but which was not made by a magistrate, it is clear that this fact may be shown to the court.\nAnd it seems to be settled by the later cases that a defect of jurisdiction may be shown by affidavit, though the proceeding is so drawn up as to appear valid on the face of it.\nSee the judgments in Regina v. Bolton[7] ; The Westbury Union Case [8] ; in re Penny[9] and other cases.\nAt page 743 Mr. Smith says :\nIt should seem that the Queen's Bench Division will on certiorari entertain affidavits where the conviction is good on the face of it,\u2014not only to show that preliminary matters required to give the justice jurisdiction to enter upon an enquiry into the merits of the case were wanting, see R. v. Bolto\u00ee [10] ; R. v. Badger [11] ; R. v. Wood [12] ; R. v. Justices of Totness [13] ; the judgments in R. v. St. Olave's District Board[14]; and in re Smith [15]\u2014or that circum- stances appeared in the course of the inquiry which ousted his jurisdiction, R. v. Nunneley[16]; R. v. Cridland[17]; R. v. Backhouse[18]; R. v. Stimpson [19]but also that there was no evidence to prove some fact, the existence of which was essential to establish the offence charged.\nIt seems also to be well settled by judgments in the United States that where it is shown that jurisdiction over the subject-matter did not exist the statements of facts in a record of the highest court might be inquired into by affidavit on the ground that if there was not jurisdiction there was no legal record. I will refer to a few out of a great many authorities that might be cited.\nIn Davis v. Packard [20] in the Court of Errors, the Chancellor speaking of domestic judgments, says :\nIf the jurisdiction of the court is general or unlimited both as to parties and subject\u2014matter it will be presumed to have had jurisdiction of the cause unless it appears affirmatively from the record, or by the showing of the party denying the jurisdiction of the court, that some special circumstances existed to oust the court of its jurisdiction in that particular case.\nIn Bloom v. Burdick [21] Bronson J. says :\nThe distinction between superior and inferior courts is not of much importance in this particular case, for whenever it appears that there was a want of jurisdiction, the judgment will be void in whatever court it was rendered.\nAnd in People v. Cassels [22] the same judge says :\nThat no court or officer can acquire jurisdiction by the mere assertion of it or by falsely alleging the existence of facts upon which jurisdiction depends.\nIn Harrington v. The People[23] Paige J. expresses the opinion that the jurisdiction of a court, whether of general or limited jurisdiction, may be inquired into, although the record of the judgment states facts giving it jurisdiction. He repeats the same view in Noyes v. Butler [24] and in Hard v. Shipman [25] where he says of inferior as well as superior courts, that :\nThe record is never conclusive as to the recital of a jurisdictional fact and that the defendant is always at liberty to show a want of jurisdiction although the record avers the contrary\u2014and that if the court had no jurisdiction it had no power to make a record.\nThe English cases which I have cited are those before justices ; but on principle I can see no difference between a judgment of an inferior and one of a superior court, when the question of jurisdiction is raised, nor can I see why, if the record of the former can be shown to be erroneous or false as touching the matter of jurisdiction the other cannot be ; for without jurisdiction the acts of one must be void as well as those of the other, and therefore the rule in the one case should be the same as in the other ; and in the cases I have consulted in the courts in the United States the rule is applied to their highest courts.\nI could suggest many cases in which serious wrong and injury might result if the jurisdiction of a court could not be attacked by evidence outside of the record, and in contradiction of it, showing the total want of jurisdiction. Suppose that there was no question that a commission of oyer and terminer and general goal delivery was necessary, and a judge undertook to try an accused person for high crime, and the record showed that he had a legal commission authorizing him in the premises but the fact was that no such commission was ever issued or held by him, and that the accused was convicted, and sentenced possibly (as in this case) to forfeit his life, would it not be a gross prostitution of the principles of common justice to shut out evidence tendered to show that the judge acted without a commission, and therefore without any jurisdiction. On the same principle, evidence to show that for any other reason he had not jurisdiction should not be rejected. It is proper to explain in this connection, that a copy of the record was submitted, and referred to in the affidavit on behalf of the prisoner, when the order nisi was applied for, and another copy was returned by the sheriff of Vancouver, and put in by the Crown when showing cause against the order. It was, therefore, by both parties, made a part of the case submitted for my decision, and although the proceedings were not removed by certiorari the consideration of it as to the question of jurisdiction was legitimately submitted.\nOther objections to the jurisdiction were raised and debated, to which I need not give the same amount of consideration that I would feel it necessary to do in case my decision depended on the correct solution of them.\nI will, however, deal with one of them, and refer to the others. The learned judge before whom the prisoner was tried acted by authority of a commission of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery, issued by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia and the commission is set out in the returns. The latter named high functionary was then acting under a commission from the Governor General, under the Imperial Confederation Act of 1867. That commission \" authorizes, \" empowers, requires and commands the Lieutenant \" Governor in due manner to do and execute all things \" that shall belong to his said command, and the trust \" reposed in him, according to the several powers and \" directions granted, or appointed him, by virtue of the \" present commission, and of the British North \" America Act, 1867, and according to such instructions \" as were therewith given to him, or which might, \" from time to time, be given him in respect of \" the said province of British Columbia, under the \" sign manual of the Governor General of Canada, or by \" order of the Privy Council of Canada\u00ac and according \" to such laws as were, or should be, in force within the \" province of British Columbia.\" The Governor General's commission authorizes him \" to constitute and appoint \" judges, and, in case requisite, commissioners of \" oyer and terminer, justices of the peace, and other \" necessary officers and ministers in our said colony.\" It is apparent that since the union of British Columbia with Canada, in 1876, its legislative power was largely restricted, and the powers and duties of the Lieutenant Governor proportionately restricted. In fact, the Lieutenant Governor, after the union, was no longer the Imperial officer a Lieutenant Governer had previously been. Under his commission from the Queen previous to the union, the Lieutenant Governor directly represented her, and only through that representation had he any power to issue commissions ; but we are not necessarily to inquire what the power of the Lie?tenant Governor was before the union, but simply to ascertain what power, if any, to issue commissions of the kind in question here has been given to a Lieutenant Governor by a commission from the Governer General under the Imperial Conferation Act, within its terms. The party so commissioned has no reserved power ; but the office and its powers and duties are limited to the subjects over which a Lieutenant Governor so commissioned and appointed would have jurisdiction. Any question as to a reserved power is not, I think, to be considered in the face of the provision of sec. 12 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, which provides \" that all the powers, \" authorities and functions vested in the Governor or \" Lieutenant Governor of the several provinces shall be \" vested in and exercisable by the Governor General, \" subject, nevertheless, to be abolished or altered by the \" Parliament of Canada.\" I cannot imagine how, then, the Lieutenant Governor of a province can be claimed to have any power whatever except what is given by the Act in question and his commission from the Governor General thereunder. Sec. 129 provides that, except as otherwise provided by that Act, all laws in force in the several provinces mentioned, and subsequently made applicable to British Columbia, all laws in force at the union, and all courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction, an\u00e4 all legal commissions, powers and authorities, and all officers, judicial, administrative and ministerial, existing at the union, shall continue in each of the said provinces respectively as if the union had not been made, subject, nevertheless, to be repealed, abolished or altered by the parliament of Canada, or by the legislature of the respective province, according to the authority of the parliament or of that legislature under that Act.\nBy sub-section 8 of section 91, the parliament of Canada has the authority and duty of making laws for \" the fixing of and providing for the salaries and allow-\" ances of civil and other officers of the government of \" Canada ;\" and by sub-section 27 : \" the criminal law, \" except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdic-\" tion, but including procedure in criminal matters,\" is within the exclusive jurisdiction of that parliament. In another section the salaries of the judges were expressly provided to be paid by the government of Canada.\nSub-section 14 of section 92 gives to the legislature of each province the right to make laws for \" the \" administration of justice in the province, including \" the constitution, maintenance and organization of \" provincial courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdic-\" tion, and including procedure in civil matters in \" those courts.\"\nIn regard, then, to jurisprudence in civil matters the legislatures of the provinces have the entire legislative authority, except that in relation to the fixing and providing for the salaries and allowance of the judges.\nThe authority and duty of legislation in regard to the administration of justice in criminal cases, including procedure in criminal matters, is given to the parliament of Canada, except (as provided in sub-sec. 27 of sec. 91 before recited) \" the constitution of courts \" of criminal jurisdiction.\"\nBy a comparison of sub-sec. 27 of sec. 91, and sub-sec. 14 of sec. 92, it will be observed that the latter, in addition to the word \" constitution,\" has the words?\" maintenance and organization.\" I do not, however, consider that the difference between the two sub-sections has any material bearing on the case under consideration ; but, if it has, I think that in view of the terms of the concluding clause of sec. 91 we should confine the operation of sub-sec. 14 of sec. 92 so as to make it harmonize with sub-sec. 27 of sec. 91.\nReading it in that way the parliament of Canada has the right to legislate in all matters of a criminal nature including procedure, and including the appointment and paying of judges, except the constitution of the courts.\nIt was clearly not intended that the word \" maintenance \" should include the payment of the judges' salaries, as they, as I have shown, are otherwise provided for. It may, however, have been intended to include the other expenses of the courts, and in otherwise maintaining them when constituted or organized. The words \" constitution \" and \" organization \" in this connection I consider synonymous as applicable to courts. To constitute a court means to form, make or establish it, and, necessarily, to prescribe the powers, jurisdiction and duties of those who are to operate it. It, however, does not, necessarily, in all cases include the power of appointment of the judges to preside in them, if the local legislatures had been given plenary power to provide for their appointment, but with the limited and prescribed powers of legislation awarded to the provinces by the Imperial Act such power does not exist. There is no award of deputed executive powers by the Act in relation to the exercise of any prerogative right of the sovereign by the Lieutenant Governors of the provinces, and their commissions do not contain any. How then can they have any ? The commissions to Lieutenant Governors before confederation included such powers, and it was only from them they derived the authority.\nWe must construe an Act by taking it altogether\nBy it (sec. 9) the executive government and authority over Canada is declared to continue and be vested in the Queen. Section 10 provides that \" the provisions \" of this Act referring to the governor extend and apply \" to the Governor General, for the time being, of Canada, \" or other the chief executive officer or administrator, \" for the time being, carrying on the government of \" Canada on behalf and in the name of the Queen, by \" whatever title he is designated.\"\nIn England the sovereign was and is the source of all judicial appointments to the higher courts of law. It is a prerogative right that, while existing, cannot be usurped, and until removed or cancelled by an Act of parliament, assented to by the sovereign, cannot be controlled or interfered with.\nWhen British Columbia became a part of Canada its courts were already established and constituted, and by the terms of the Confederation Act, sec. 129 before cited, were so continued\u2014and so also was the position of the judges. They then held and derived authority from commissions appointing them as judges of the Supreme Court or Court of Queen's Bench during good behavior, but none as permanent judges of the court of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery, for which com- missions pro re nata had been issued by the Lieutenant Governors from time to time. As in England, the judges appointed to this duty were styled and called commissioners, and the Acts in British Columbia, providing for the appointment of such commissioners, limited their selection by the Lieutenant Governors.\nThe judges of the Supreme Court or Court of Queen's Bench had no authority, without such commission, to hold a court of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery. In connection with this part of the subject I have considered the effect of the provision contained in sec. 14 of cap. 12 of the Acts of British Columbia, 1879, which is as follows : \" Courts of assize and nisi \" prius, or of oyer and terminer and general gaol \" delivery, may be held with or without commissions, at \" such times and places as the Lieutenant Governor may \" direct, and provided, when no commissions are issued \" the said courts, or either of them, shall be presided over \" by the chief justice or one of the other judges of the \" said Supreme Court \" It is doubtful if that Act, except sec. 17, ever came into operation, requiring as it does the Lieutenant Governor's proclamation for that purpose, and I understand that no such proclamation was issued. In Regina v. McLean & Hare, British Columbia, in 1880, reported by one of the judges, the learned Chief Justice alluding to the Supreme Court of that province, says :\nThose powers and authorities were and are no other than those possessed by the Queen's Bench in England. It would have been exceedingly important if one English case had been cited in which a judge of the Queen's Bench had sat and tried without commission, and without removal by certiorari or otherwise, a criminal committed by a justice of the peace to take his trial at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer. But no such case was produced from the records of several centuries, and it is believed none is producible.\nThe learned Chief Justice further said :\nIt is true one case was produced from the Ontario courts (Whelan v. The Queen)[26] in which an attempt was made to impeach such a trial unsuccessfully. The trial was actually impeached, although an extant enactment by a competent legislature had expressly declared that a court of oyer and terminer might be presided over by a judge of the Supreme Court without commission. It is impossible to read the arguments and judgments upon this point without perceiving what the result would have been in the absence of such a statute. And there is no statute in force here. It is true the Ontario provision has been copied into a local Act here, but being matter of criminal procedure it is extra vires of the local legislature ; and moreover it only purports to come into force from a day not yet named. All these Acts of Parliament are in effect statutory declarations that by the law of England and the provinces these commissions are necessary to confer jurisdiction, and that nothing less than an Act of parliament can render them unnecessary. The whole argument upon this point, based upon Whelan v. The Queen, which was referred to at great length by counsel for the Crown, is almost decisive in favor of the prisoners.\nThe learned Chief Justice concluded his judgment as follows:\u2014\nThe gaoler alleges two causes for detention. One the sentence of Mr. Justice Crease, the other a warrant of commitment by Mr. Senator Cornwall J. P. The rule nisi was obtained on the sole ground of the invalidity of the sentence and the various informalities at the late alleged trial. With these objections we agree, and we consider that the prisoners have never been tried at all. But as to the second cause of detention, the warrant of commitment, it has not been at all impeached, and we cannot at this stage allow it to be now impeached. I think, therefore, the proper order is to remand the prisoners to be held in custody according to the exigence and tenor of the last mentioned warrant.\nThe case of the prisoners had been brought before the court by a rule nisi for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for their discharge on account of the invalidity of the conviction, and they were discharged therefrom but remanded under the warrant for their commitment.\nThe \" Ontario \" statute referred to was passed before confederation by the legislature of the combined provinces, Upper and Lower Canada, and was therefore intra vires, but that of British Columbia was after its union with Canada, and therefore was, as the learned Chief Justice, I think properly, says, extra vires. Such being the case there is no parliamentary dispensation of commissions in criminal cases, and as, in my opinion, the Lieutenant Governor had no power to issue them, the learned judge who tried and sentenced the prisoner had, for these reasons, no jurisdiction.\nThere was another point of objection raised to the jurisdiction. The venue in the margin of the indictment is \" British Columbia to wit.\" No county, shire, division, district or place is mentioned ; and there is no venue stated in the body of it. The whole province was formerly one shrievalty, but for many years past it has been divided into several court districts, and shrievalties\u2014one of which is Kootenay. There is no sheriff of \" British Columbia,\" and the indictment did not indicate in what bailiwick it should be preferred to a grand jury, or from what bailiwick the petit jury should be summoned. The provisions of sections 32 and 33 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1869, are, however, very comprehensive, and, in my opinion, were intended to provide for such a case if, indeed, it be not covered by the provisions of section 21, in regard to which there might be some doubt.\nSection 32 enacts that :\nEvery objection to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof, must be taken by demurrer or motion to quash the indictment before the defendant has pleaded, and not afterwards, &c., and power to amend is given to the court.\nWhether the power could be exercised to relate back, so as to warrant the finding of the grand jury, is a question that would admit of a discussion which I consider unnecessary here. Section 33 provides that :\nIf any person being arraigned upon an indictment for any indictable offence pleads thereto a plea of \" not guilty,\" he shall by such plea, without further form, be deemed to have put himself upon the country for trial, and the court may, in the usual manner, order a jury for the trial of such person accordingly.\nThe provisions of the three sections would certainly seem to cover every possible objection, and I am inclined to the opinion that the objection being apparent on the face of the indictment the party might, under section 32, have demurred ; and if the venue was wrongly stated, the question as to the power of amendment could then have been raised. That course was not taken, and it is not now necessary to consider the matter. And as the result does not depend upon any decision I might arrive at, I think it unnecessary to refer further to that objection.\nAnother as to the polling of the jury was submitted ; but it would be of no practical service were I to consider it, as my doing so will not affect the decision. I may say, however, that I consider such?an objection is altogether for a court of error to decide. It does not, in my opinion, affect the jurisdiction, and therefore is not in my province to consider.\nFor the reasons I have given as to the first point referred to, I think there was no jurisdiction to try the prisoner at Victoria ; and that the learned judge who presided had no jurisdiction to try the prisoner in the absence of any legislative authority, or a commission from the Governor General, and, therefore, that the trial was a nullity, and as if the prisoner had never been tried. The prisoner is shown by the return and certificate of the sheriff to be detained solely on the calendar of the Assize Court containing the sentence of death, and the formal sentence, and a remand dated the 27th of February last, the prisoner having been brought before the court sitting in error, and the sentence having been unrevoked. No warrant of commitment or other cause of detention was produced or shown in this case. And, as in my opinion the trial was a nullity, and the sentence therefore illegal, no other course is, I think, open to me but to order the discharge of the prisoner, and to adopt the necessary proceedings therefor. It is the bounden duty of a judge to declare the law as he finds it, and believes it to be, regardless of consequences and all other considerations.\nPursuant to the order of the learned judge a writ of habeas corpus was issued out and served upon the sheriff. Such writ was in the form following :\u2014\nCANADA,\nTo wit:\nVICTORIA, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith.\nTo the Sheriff of Vancouver Island, in the Province of British Columbia.\nGREETING :\nWe command you that you have the body of Robert Evan Sproule detained in our prison, under your custody (as it is said) under safe and sure conduct, together with the day and cause of his being taken, by whatsoever name he may be called in the same, before the Honorable Mr. Justice Henry, one of the judges of our Supreme Court of Canada, at his chambers at the city of Ottawa immediately after the receipt of this writ, to do and receive those things which our said judge shall then and there consider of him in this behalf ; and have you then there this writ.\nWitness, the Honorable Sir William Johnstone Ritchie, Knight, Chief Justice of our said Supreme Court of Canada, this twenty-fifth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-six.\n(Signed) ROBERT CASSELS,\nRegistrar of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nPer statutem tricesimo primo Caroli secundi regis ; and under the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act of the Parliament of Canada, thirty-eight Victoria, chapter eleven ; and the Act of the Parliament of Canada, thirty-nine Victoria, chapter twenty-six.\n(Signed) W. A. HENRY,\nA Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nTo this writ the sheriff made the following return :\n\" The within named Robert Evan Sproule was convicted and sentenced to death at the last Victoria assizes for the crime of wilful murder, and the conviction and sentence was afterwards unanimously affirmed on writ of error by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in full bench.\n\" I hold the prisoner accordingly, and humbly submit that such affirmed conviction and sentence is paramount to the within writ.\n\" I have not received or been tendered any expenses of the conveyance of the prisoner.\n\" For the above reasons I respectfully decline to produce the prisoner.\n\" The answer of James Eliphalet McMillan, the sheriff for Vancouver Island, to the within writ.\n\" Victoria B.C., 19th July, 1886.\"\nThe prisoner's counsel then applied to His Lordship for an order for the prisoner's discharge, which order, after argument, was granted. His Lordship delivered the following judgment on this application .\nHENRY J.\u2014This matter came before me under an order made by me in May last on a petition of Sproule, setting forth that he had been illegally convicted of murder at British Columbia, and was under sentence of execution. The order was returnable on the twenty\u2014fifth day of May last, and was directed to the sheriff of Vancouver Island, in whose custody, under the conviction and sentence, the prisoner then was. It called upon him to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not issue to bring up the body of the prisoner, and why, in the event of the order being made absolute, he should not be discharged without the writ being absolutely issued, and without the prisoner being personally brought before me. The order was duly served on the sheriff of Vancouver Island, and on the attorney-general of British Columbia. The sheriff returned the whole of the proceedings in the prosecution, including a copy of the conviction and sentence. The proceedings having been returned before me, and the Crown having been represented by Messrs. Burbidge and Gormully, and the prisoner by Messrs. McCarthy and Davie, at the hearing objections were raised on the part of the prisoner to the jurisdiction of the tribunal by which he was tried and convicted. The objections were argued, and answered on behalf of the Crown, and upon two of them I decided and gave judgment in favor of the prisoner, holding that the tribunal had not jurisdiction, and that the \u00f0risoner was entitled to his discharge. The argument was confined to the objections so raised on the part of the prisoner.\nAfter my decision, I heard counsel on the part of the Crown and the prisoner, as to \u00f4he proper course to be pursued for giving effect to my judgment, the counsel for the prisoner claiming that as the order to show cause was in the alternative, and as counsel appeared, were heard, and showed cause, and took no exception to the terms of the order on the argument, the prisoner was entitled to an order absolute for his discharge. This course was objected to by the counsel for the Crown, and after deliberation I decided to grant an order for a writ of habeas corpus to bring the prisoner before me, so that he could be by me discharged. I gave no opinion or decision as to the right of a judge, under the circumstances, to make an order absolute for the discharge of the prisoner, but rather yielded to the desire of the counsel for the Crown to have the prisoner brought before me.\nAn order for the issue of the writ was therefore made by me on the 25th of June last past, and the writ, E directed to the sheriff of Vancouver Island, was duly issued on the same day.\nThe writ was served on the sheriff in the early part of July last past, but not returned until the 19th of that month. In fact, it is not returned at all, for although sent back to the registrar of this court, and purporting to be a return of the sheriff, the endorsement thereon bears no signature. Neither does it appear to be in the handwriting of the sheriff. I have compared the writing with h\u00e9s signature to some of the authenticated documents on file in this case, and I have found little difficulty in concluding the indorsement in ques-not to be of his proper handwriting, and there is no affidavit verifying it to be his return, or that it was made by his authority. The endorsement is dated the 19th of July, 1886. Whoever wrote that endorsement seems to be of opinion that a sheriff\u2014a Queen's officer \u2014can refuse to execute the Queen's writ, and usurp judicial authority to decide as to the validity of the writ. Such an assumption by a sheriff is a contempt of legal authority and cannot be permitted. I am, therefore, strongly inclined to the opinion that the endorsement is not that of the subordinate officer, to whom the writ was directed, and if proceeded against for contempt he would, in all probability, be found to deny that he authorized it. It was his duty, under any circumstances, to execute the writ and make a proper return of and to it. At present I will only add, that hereafter it may be found that subordinate officers, such as sheriffs, cannot treat the writ of habeas corpus duly issued with contempt. The writ required the sheriff to produce the body of the prisoner and he has failed to obey it and must bear the consequences.\nOn the second instant, pursuant to notice to the attorney general, an order absolute was again moved for by Mr McIntyre, counsel for the prisoner, and Mr. Burbidge Q. C. and Mr. Sinclair were heard for the Crown in opposition. It was contended by the latter gentlemen that inasmuch as a writ of habeas corpus was issued the order could not be made, and that further proceedings can be taken only by means to enforce its execution, and that as that course, that is by the issue of the habeas corpus, had been adopted, no other was available.\nI have carefully reviewed the authorities furnished by the counsel on each side and shall briefly give my views.\nIt is said in Addison on Torts[27] that :\nThe validity of the commitment may be tried on moving for a rule to show cause why a habeas corpus should not issue and why, in the event of the rule being made absolute, the prisoner should not be discharged without the writ actually issuing or the prisoner being personally brought before the court.\nAnd the case of Eggington[28] is cited.\nThe counsel who showed cause in that case said : \" It \" may be questioned whether the rule in this form can \" be made in invitos\u2014there has been no consent. \" To which Lord Campbell C.J. replied : \" I have repeatedly \" granted it in vacation in this form without consent, \" in order to avoid the necessity of bringing up the \" party.\" Other authorities sustain the same course.\nThe constitution of the Supreme Court in British Columbia is founded on a proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor, under a statute, and his commission. The proclamation provides :\nThat the Supreme Court of civil justice of British Columbia shall have complete cognizance of all pleas whatsoever, and shall have jurisdiction in all cases, civil as well as criminal, arising within the colony of British Columbia.\nThe unlimited jurisdiction thus given to the court includes the issuing of writs of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum and the discharge of prisoners illegally imprisoned, and in the performance of that part of their official duty the judges of the court have authority to pursue the practice of the courts and judges in England ; and if the judges in the latter country have established the practice of ordering the discharge of a prisoner without requiring him to be brought personally before them, the judges of British Columbia are, in my opinion, at liberty to pursue the same course ; and the same power is given to a judge of this court.\nI have considered the objection, that having ordered the issue of the habeas corpus I have no power to adopt the other means now sought for the discharge of the prisoner ; but no case has been cited or argument advanced in favor of that proposition ; and I can see no reason why, if one alternative course has failed through the negligence or improper conduct of the sheriff, the other should not be adopted.\nI have, therefore, decided to make an order for the discharge of the prisoner.\nThe Attorney General of British Columbia then applied to the Supreme Court of Canada to have the writ of habeas corpus, and all proceedings thereunder, quashed as having been issued improvidently.\nA special session of the court was called to hear the application.\nRobinson Q.C. and the Attorney General of British Columbia (Gormully with them) supported the motion, and McCarthy Q.C. and Theodore Davie (A. F. McIntyre with them) appeared for the prisoner.\nA preliminary objection was taken by the counsel for the prisoner that the application should not be heard in his absence.\nRobinson Q.C. on this point.\u2014I always understood the rule to be that the presence of the prisoner was only necessary when the court was about to deal with the conviction or with the record. In cases before the Privy Council the prisoner is never present. See The Queen v. Murphy [29] and The Queen v. Coote[30].\nMcCarthy Q.C.\u2014The court is bound to protect the prisoner, and will not hear an adverse motion behind his back. If the court has power to hear the application it must have power to bring the prisoner here. The prisoner has a right to be present in every matter affecting his discharge. See Re Boucher[31]; Ex parte Martins [32] ; Eggington's case[33]\nThe court having overruled the objection, the counsel for the prisoner asked for an adjournment until the next morning that they might consult as to whether or not they should appear under the circumstances. The argument was, however, allowed to proceed, counsel for the prisoner to be considered as only watching the case for the present.\nRobinson Q.C. and the Attorney General of British Columbia for the Crown.\u2014The first question to be argued is : What authority is there for this writ to issue ? Section 51 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act confers the jurisdiction in habeas corpus on the j\u00f5dges of this court, and we contend that that section constitutes a court of criminal jurisdiction, and is, therefore, ultra vires of the Dominion. See The Queen v. St. Denis[34], where this question is incidentally considered by Chief Justice Cameron.\nThen, what is the \" concurrent \" jurisdiction that is conferred by this section ? When the act was passed there was, practically, no communication between the capital of the Dominion and the province of British Columbia. Then, was it intended to do more than to give this jurisdiction to the judges of the Exchequer Court, and that only when they were in the province in which the writ was required ? \" Concurrent \" means concurrent in territory. It cannot mean concurrent in jurisdiction because that is different in the different provinces.\nAgain, we say that there was no jurisdiction to issue the writ in this case, because it can only issue to inquire into the cause of commitment in a criminal case under an act of the Parliament of Canada. In this case the prisoner was convicted of the crime of murder, an offence under the common law, and not an offence under an act of the Parliament of Canada.\nIf then as we contend, this writ should not have been issued, is there any authority in this court to quash it ?\nThe writ has been issued under the seal of the court and tested in the name of the Chief Justice, and was, therefore, the process of the court, and there is an inherent right in this court, in common with all courts, to exercise control over its own process. See Abbott's National Dig.[35]; Robinson v. Burbidge[36] citing the remarks of Parke B. in Witham v. Lynch [37]\nThis explains why no appeal is given when the writ is granted. When the writ is refused the appeal must be expressly given, but when it is granted the power of the court over its own process renders an appeal unnecessary.\nThe following authorities were cited on this point, Dawkins v. Prince Edward of Saxe Weimar[38] ; Sea- ton v. Grant [39] ; Edmunds v. The Atty. Gen. [40]; and 5 Fisher's Dig. [41], where most of the cases are collected.\nIt is clear that the learned judge had no power to order the prisoner's discharge. If the return to the writ was insufficient, he should have left the prisoner to his remedy by attachment against the sheriff, in which case the matter would have come before the full court.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Theodore Davie for the prisoner.\nThis is, in effect, an appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Henry granting the writ, and the court has no jurisdiction to hear it.\nIt is argued that section 51 is unconstitutional, but we think it cannot be denied that the Parliament of Canada can create courts for the administration of criminal law. See The Picton Case [42].\nThe jurisdiction in habeas corpus matters is this\u2014the power is given to the judge, and he is thereby constituted a court altogether distinct from the Supreme Court of Canada, just as he was under the Election Act. Valin v. Langlois [43]. The effect of this may be th?t the judge should not have used the writ of the court, but the order of discharge is valid.\nThe argument that this power is only to be exercised by the judges of the Exchequer Court would support the proposition just advanced, because, if a judge is out of Ottawa, he cannot issue the writ under the seal of the court. But we do not concur in this view. The writ of habeas corpus should be open to everybody in Canada, but if it can only be issued when the Exchequer Court is sitting, it will, practically, be open only to the people of Ottawa.\nThe contention that the jurisdiction can be exercised only in case of an offence created by an act of the Par- liament of Canada is untenable. It is a commitment under an act of the Parliament of Canada that forms the basis of the inquiry, and the case is within it. All the proceedings here were under the \" Indictable Offences Act.\"\nEven if we are wrong in this, section 129 of the British North America Act makes all common law offences offences under the laws of Canada.\nThe judges of this court would have jurisdiction in habeas corpus matters without express authority. See ex parte Bollman[44].\nBut no matter how erroneous the action of the learned judge in granting this writ may have been, this court has no power to interfere. No authority can be produced to show that an order to discharge a prisoner on habeas corpus can be reversed. On the contrary The Queen v. Weil [45] ; The Mayor, &c. v. Brown[46], and The Attorney General v. Sillem[47], are all authorities to show that this proceeding is unwarranted. See also, Carus Wilson's Case[48] ; The Canadian Prisoner's Case[49], and In re Padstow Total Loss Association[50].\nRobinson Q. C. in reply cited Bishop on Criminal Procedure[51] ; Ex parte Tom Tong[52] ; Re Stretton[53].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The first ques\u00f4ion to be determined in this case is as to the right of this court to inquire into the propriety of the issue of the writ of habeas corpus and its power to quash the writ if improvidently issued.\nThis writ having been issued out of this court, under the seal of the court, and tested in the name of the Chief Justice (and I know of no other way in which the writ of habeas corpus could be issued on the fiat of a judge of this court), was a proceeding in this court, and every superior court, which this court unquestionably is, has incident to its jurisdiction an inherent right to inquire into and judge of the regularity or abuse of its process.\nIn Witham v. Lynch [54] Parke B: remarks :\nWhenever a jurisdiction is conferred by statute on a judge of the superior courts it is subject to appeal to the court unless there is something in the context leading to a contrary conclusion.\nAnd in Robinson v. Burbidge[55] Maule J. cited the above remarks of Parke B. with approval.\nThat this is a matter pertaining to the court, and one with which it can deal, and not a jurisdiction conferred on a judge of the court outside of and independent of the court, and that the judge has no independent jurisdiction unconnected therewith, is, I think, very obvious from the fact that he can only act as a judge of this court through the instrumentality of the writ of this court, obedience to which could not be enforced by authority of the judge but by the court, which alone could issue an attachment for contempt of the court in not obeying its process, the contempt being contempt of the process of the court, not of the fiat of the judge authorizing its issue, and therefore the impossibility of enforcing obedience to the process of the court without the assistance of the court seems to me to prove, conclusively, that the matter is within the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe learned judge, by indorsement on this writ, declares that the writ was issued, \" per statutem tricesimo primo Caroli Secundi Regis,\" and under the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act of the Parliament of Canada 38 Vic. ch. 11, and the act of the Parliament of Canada, 39 Vic. ch. 26. Now this was certainly wrong, because it is clear beyond question that the 31st of Car. 2 has nothing to do with a case like the present and does not authorize the issue of a habeas corpus in such a case as this. The statute of 31 Car. 2 was to provide that persons committed for criminal, or supposed criminal, matters in such cases where by law they were bailable should be left to bail speedily. Abbott C. J., in 6 D. & R. 209, says the object of the habeas corpus Act, 31 Car. 2 cap. 2, was to provide against delays in bringing to trial such subjects of the king as were committed to custody for criminal or supposed criminal matters, and therefore if this writ could be issued out at all it must be issued at common law.\nNow the sixth question proposed to the judges by the House of Lords, see Bacon's Ab. habeas corpus, vol. 4, p. 493, and Wilmot's Opinions and Judgments p. 777, and the answers thereto, show conclusively that a judge in vacation has no power to enforce obedience to writs of habeas corpus issued at common law, and I think it may be taken to be equally clear that there is no such power in cases within 31 Car. 2. The writ of habeas corpus is not the writ of a judge on whose fiat it issues. It is a high prerogative writ which issues out of the Queen's superior courts, and, in my opinion, is necessarily subject to the control of those courts, not necessarily by way of appeal, but by virtue of the power possessed by the court over the process of the court. The course of proceeding to be observed in obtaining an attachment, shows that it is matter with which the court alone can deal ; it is thus laid down. The course of proceeding to obtain an attachment which issues to punish disobedience to the Queen's writ is by motion to the court for a rule for an attachment ; on being granted a writ of attachment issues. On the sheriff returning cepi corpus, a motion is of course for a habeas corpus to produce the defendant in court ; it is then moved that the defendant be sworn to answer interrogatories ; if he does not give bail he is returned to prison ; interrogatories which contain the charge against the prisoner are filed, and the defendant is examined on them before a master, and it said in the English books of practice the examination is referred to the Queen's coroner and attorney, on whose report the court sentences the defendant to fine or imprisonm\u00e5nt or discharges him.\nIt has been urged, however, that by section 51 of the Supreme Court Act, the individual judges of this court were thereby created so many separate and independent courts and could, and it was said should, issue writs of habeas corpus, not out of the court, but in their individual names, and for disobedience to which the judge issuing the writ had power to issue an attachment in his own name. There is not, in my opinion, the slightest pretence for this contention. There is nothing whatever in the statute to indicate that the legislature contemplated the erection of six additional courts, and the power conferred is entirely inconsistent with any such contention. In such a case the judge of this court would not have equal and concurrent jurisdiction with the judges of British Columbia, but a larger and more extensive jurisdiction, and would be capable of doing, under this equal and concurrent jurisdiction, what no judge in British Columbia could do, namely, issue or direct the issue of a writ uncontrollable by any court, and would have the right to issue an attachment which no single judge could do in British Columbia. The power conferred on the judges of this court in cases where they are entitled to order the issue of a writ of habeas corpus is the same, in my opinion, that the judges in British Columbia have, that is to say, as the judges there direct the issue of the writ out of the Supreme Court, tested in the name of the Chief Justice of that court, under the seal of the court and subject to the con- trol of the court if improvidently issued, and for disobedience to which the remedy would be in the court by reason of the disobedience being a contempt of court out of which the writ issues, so the judge of this court granting his fiat for th\u00e5 issue of a writ out of this court, as was done in this case, such writ is necessarily subject to the like control of this court if improvidently issued.\nIt was stated on the argument of this case that no case could be found where the writ of habeas corpus, issued in vacation, having been improvidently issued, was for that reason quashed, but it will be found in the matter of John Crawford[56] that a habeas corpus having issued directed to the keeper of Her Majesty's jail at Castle Ruchen, in the Isle of Man, and his deputy, commanding him to have the body of John Crawford before this court, at Westminster, to undergo and receive, &c. Peacock at this term obtained a rule calling upon the prosecutor to show cause why the writ should not be quashed on the ground that the same had issued improvidently. Patteson J. observed, just what is applicable to this case, \" then the question here being in effect whether the writ, if it had never issued, ought to go, we must make the rule absolute for setting aside the writ.\" So in this case, if we think the writ ought never to have been issued, then we should quash it. And I may remark, inasmuch as a judge in British Columbia has no doubt the right to issue a writ returnable in term as well as in vacation, as at present advised, I cannot see any reason whatever why the judges of this court, having concurrent and equal jurisdiction with the judges of British Columbia, might not make the writs they authorize to be issued, returnable in this court in term as well as immediately, but it is not necessary for the purposes of this case to determine that point.\nAssuming then that we have the power to entertain this application an objection has been taken that we should not do so in the absence of the prisoner. I do not view this as an appeal, in the ordinary sense, from the decision of the judge on the return to the writ of habeas corpus, but simply as an application to set aside the writ on the ground that it never should have issued by reason of the want of power or jurisdiction in the learned judge to interfere by habeas corpus at all in a case such as this, with the judgment and sentence of a superior court of competent criminal jurisdiction.\nWe are not called upon to say whether the facts submitted to the learned judge justified the issue of the writ and subsequent proceedings thereon. If they did not then the learned judge should have refused the application for the writ. We are, therefore, now dealing with the question as on the application for the writ as suggested by Patteson J., and are called upon to determine, in effect, if the writ had never issued whether it ought to go, and in this view the question of the right of the prisoner to be present could not arise, for on such application, or until the writ was actually issued and returned, the prisoner could not be present, and he does not appear to have been present in the case of Crawford, nor, so far as I am aware, is he ever present before the Privy Council on appeals.\nIt has also been contended that the 51st section is ultra vires. On this point I express no opinion, as in the view I take of the case it is unnecessary for the determination of this case to do so.\nIt is also contended that, assuming the judges of this court have power to issue writs of habeas corpus, the right to do so is limited to an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any act of the Parliament of Canada, and that this being a case of murder it is a case at common law and not a criminal case under any act of the Parliament of Canada. Why this limitation was imposed, and why the same language was not used as in the 101st section of the British North America Act, which gives power to establish this court of appeal and other courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada, is not very apparent, but the legislature having limited the jurisdiction we are bound to give effect to that limitation, and, as at present advised, I think the objection must prevail and therefore my learned brother had no authority to issue this writ. If so, then most certainly the writ of this court was improvidently issued.\nBut supposing I should not be right in this view, I am then brought face to face with the real, serious substantial question, and it is a most serious substantial question, namely : Was my learned brother, on the materials before him, justified in issuing the writ and making the order discharging this prisoner, or, on the other hand, did the materials before him clearly show that the writ ought never to have been issued and the order for discharge should not have been made, and therefore that the writ was improvidently issued and, as a consequence, should, with the proceedings thereon, be quashed ? The two grounds on which the learned judge granted the writ and subsequently made an order discharging the prisoner were : First, that the order changing the place of trial was void and therefore there was no jurisdiction to try the prisoner at Victoria ; and secondly, that the court of oyer and terminer could only sit under and by virtue of a commission which the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia had no power to issue. Such a commission never having been issued by the Governor General there was no authority for holding the court. The learned judge says :\nFor the reasons I have given as to the first point (that is the order to change the place of trial) referred to, I think there was no jurisdiction to try the prisoner at Victoria ; and that the learned judge who presided had no jurisdiction to try the prisoner in the absence of any legislative authority or a commission from the Governor General, and, therefore, that the trial was a nullity and as if the prisoner had never been tried. The prisoner is shown by the return and certificate of the sheriff to be detained solely on the calendar of the assize court containing the sentence of death and the formal sentence and a remand dated the 27th of February last, the prisoner having been brought before the court sitting in error, and the sentence having been unrevoked.\nNo warrant of commitment or other cause of detention was produced or shown in this case. And, as in my opinion the trial was a nullity and the sentence therefore illegal, no other course is, I think, open to me but to order the discharge of the prisoner and to adopt(the necessary proceedings therefor.\nIn considering this case it must be borne in mind that the writ of habeas corpus does not issue as a matter of course upon application in the first instance, but must be founded upon an affidavit upon which the court is to exercise a discretion in issuing it or not, that is, a legal discretion justified by the facts presented.\nThe first inquiry must be as to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and the Court of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery. The Supreme Court of British Columbia is established under a proclamation having the force of law in Her Majesty's colony of British Columbia, whereby it is declared that \" the said court shall be a court of record by the \" name or style of the Supreme Court of civil justice in \" British Columbia.\" The proclamation designates the seal the court shall use, and declares that :\nThe said Supreme Court of civil justice of British Columbia shall have complete cognizance of all pleas whatsoever, and shall have jurisdiction in all cases, civil as well as criminal, arising within the said colony of British Columbia.\nHere then we have a superior criminal court established, of the highest character, clothed with all the powers and jurisdiction civil and criminal, necessary or essential to the full and perfect administration of justice, civil or criminal, within the colony, without limitation or stint, powers as full and ample as those known to the common law, and possessed by the superior courts of England, and to which court, as necessary and essential part of the jurisdiction, belongs the right to supervise inferior courts, and entertain writs of error from the courts of oyer and terminer and general goal delivery when duly allowed by Her Majesty's attorney general. As to the courts of assize, nisi prius, oyer and terminer and general goal delivery, I am of opinion that these courts are superior courts of record, and, as clearly established by the case of ex parte Fernandez[57], courts of very high degree, dignity and importance. By 42 Vic cap. 12, 1879 (B. C.), it is enacted that courts of assize and nisi prius, oyer and terminer and general goal delivery, may be held with or without commissions, at such time and place as the Lieutenant Governor may direct, and when no commissions are issued the said courts, or either of them, shall be presided over by the chief justice or one of the judges of the said Supreme Court. This Act was to come into force on any day named in a proclamation named by the Lieutenant Governor to that effect published in the Royal Gazette. The act was brought into force by authority of a proclamation in the British Columbia Gazette on the 24th July, 1880, and was therefore in force long before the trial in this case. By 46 Vic. cap. 15 (B. C.), the jury district from which jurors are to be selected and summoned for the trial of civil and criminal cases at the towns and places where courts of assize, nisi prius, oyer and terminer and general jail delivery may be held, the following sections of the province and electoral districts and polling divisions established at the time of the passing of this act shall be districts, inter alia. Victoria district, the limits of which are set out in the Act, and grand and petit jurors required for or by the order of any court or judge thereof shall be summoned only from the district as established by this act wherein the said court is to be held. On the 9th March, 1885, an act of British Columbia was passed, which was in force at the time of this trial, to fix the times for holding courts of assize and nisi prius and oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery, inter alia, at the city of Victoria, on the first Monday in the month of April, and the fourth Monday in the month of November in each year, with a proviso that it should be lawful for the Lieutenant Governor in council to appoint times for holding additional and other courts of assize and nisi prius, oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery at any of the places aforesaid, and at other places when and so often as he should deem it expedient to do so ; so that it is abundantly clear that a court of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery could be held without a commission at the time fixed by law for holding the same, and that the fixing of the time by the Lieutenant Governor in council was for the holding only of additional and other courts of assize and nisi prius, oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery at any of the places named in the Act, and at other places when and so often as he should deem it expedient so to do. And this court at which the trial took place was held at the time and place fixed by the statute. There being then no necessity for a commission in this case, the issuing of a commission by the Lieutenant Governor, if unnecessary, could not in any way interfere with the right to hold the court at the time and place named in the statute. It might possibly have helped the jurisdiction of the court, it could not possibly have interfered with it. All this, however, as to which I humbly conceive there can be no doubt, renders it wholly unnecessary to discuss or determine whether the power to issue a commission such as that issued by the Lieu- tenant Governor belongs to the Lieutenant Governor of the province or to the Governor General of the Dominion exclusively. I will not discuss this question as it is wholly unnecessary to the determination of this case, but I wish it to be distinctly understood that my not discussing and determining it is not to be construed as throwing any, even the slightest, \u00e4oubt on the validity of a commission so issued. I simply express no opinion on the question as not being necessary to the determination of this case.\nHere then we have a supreme court and courts of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery having general, full, and ample power and jurisdiction of the largest character for the administration of the criminal jurisprudence of and in the Province of British Columbia. It is only necessary now to refer to one other statute, namely, the Dominion Act 32 and 33 Vic. cap. 29, by which it is provided :\nSec. II.\u2014Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the court or judge hereinafter mentioned, that it is expedient to the ends of justice that the trial of any person charged with felony or misdemeanor should be held in some district, county or place other than that in which the offence is supposed to have been committed, or would otherwise be triable, the court at which such person is, or is liable to be, indicted may at any term or sitting thereof, and any judge who might hold or sit in such court may at any other time order, either before or after the presentation of a bill of indictment, that the trial shall be proceeded with in some other district, county or place within the same province, to be named by the court or judge in such order ; but such order shall be made upon such conditions as to the payment of any additional expense thereby caused to the accused as the court or judge may think proper to prescribe.\nThe record of the proceedings in the courts of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery and of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in error was brought before the learned judge both on the part of the prisoner and on the part of the Crown and the sheriff. The learned judge says : It is proper to explain that a copy of the record was submitted and referred to in the affidavit on behalf of the prisoner when the order nisi was applied for, and another copy was returned by the sheriff of Vancouver and put in by the Crown when showing cause against the order. It was, therefore, by both parties made a part of the case submitted for my decision.\nAnd the cause of the prisoner's detention under the sentence and judgment of those courts was also shown to the learned judge by the affidavit of the sheriff, and also by his return to the writ of habeas corpus, and the learned judge, it is true, thinks there was no return, because the document returned with the writ by the sheriff, though purporting to be the sheriff's return, was not signed by him, and, the learned judge thinks, was not in his handwriting, he having compared the writing with the sheriff's writing in another document before him which he thinks it does not resemble. The return does not appear on the proceedings to have been in any way challenged or impugned, or any contention made that it was not transmitted by the sheriff, or by his authority, as and for a regular and proper return, and, in my opinion, it was a good and sufficient return ; but whether so or not is wholly immaterial, inasmuch as the learned judge had before him the record of the trial, conviction and sentence of a criminal court of competent jurisdiction, with the record of the Superior Court in error affirming and sustaining such conviction and sentence, and the affidavit of the sheriff which showed that the prisoner was held in custody under and by virtue of such conviction and sentence. With these materials before him should this writ have issued ? I think not ; when it appeared by the records of courts of competent criminal jurisdiction, courts having jurisdiction over the person and over the offence with which he was charged, that he had been tried, convicted and sentenced, and was held under such sentence, the learned judge should have refused to grant the writ. But the learned judge has held that the court which tried the prisoner was no court at all. I have shown, I think conclusively, that it was a properly constituted court.\nHe also held that he could go outside the record to show that the case was not triable in Victoria. I venture to propound without fear of successful contradiction, that by the law of England and of this Dominion, where the principles of the common law prevail, that if the records of a superior court contains the recital of facts requisite to confer jurisdiction, which the records in this case did, it is conclusive and cannot be contradicted by extrinsic evidence ; and if the superior courts have jurisdiction over the subject-matter and the person, as the court of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery and the Supreme Court of British Columbia had in this case, the records of their judgments and sentences are final and conclusive, unerring verity, and the law will not, in such a case, allow the record to be contradicted.\nIt is said there were two orders for changing the venue ; that the first order made no reference to any provision for expenses, and which it was alleged by reason thereof was void ; on the other hand, it is said the order originally made, orally, in the presence of the prisoner and his counsel, made such provision, and that this is the order which appears on the face of the record ; with this discussion I think the court has nothing to do, as I think we can only look at the record and are bound by what it contains, and this record sets out that on application of the Crown made in the presence and hearing of Sproule charged with and committed to stand his trial for having, on the 1st of June, 1885, at Kootenay Lake, in the bailiwick of the sheriff of Kootenay, in the Province of British Columbia, feloniously, wilfully and of his malice aforethought, killed and murdered one Thomas Hammill, the Chief Justice on hearing the counsel for Sproule, and it appearing to his satisfaction that it was expedient to the ends of justice that the trial of the said Sproule for the alleged crime should be held in the city of Victoria, and Mr. Irving undertaking on behalf of the Crown to abide by such order as the judge who may preside at the trial might think just to meet the eleventh section of 32 and 33 Vic. ch. 29, such being the condition which he thought proper to prescribe, ordered in these words :\nI, Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie, Knight, Chief Justice of Bri\u00f4ish Columbia, and being a judge who might hold or sit in the court at which the said Robert E. Sproule is liable to be indicted for the cause aforesaid, do hereby order that the trial of the said Robert E. Sproule shall be proceeded with at the city of Victoria, in the said province, at the court of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery, to be holden at the said city on Monday, the 23rd day of November, 1885, and I order that the said Robert E. Sproule be removed hence to the gaol at the city of Victoria and that the keeper of the said gaol do receive the said Robert E. Sproule into his custody in the said gaol and him safely keep until he shall thence be delivered by due course of law.\n(Signed) MATT. B. BEGBIE C.J.\nThe record then goes on to show the record of the trial, conviction and sentence, the writ of error and the errors assigned, the hearing of the parties, deliberation and the judgment of the court which was \" that \" there is no error either on the record or proceedings or \" in the giving of the judgment on which the writ of \" error was brought, therefore it is considered and \" adjudged by the said court here that the judgment \" aforesaid be in all things affirmed and stand in full \" force and effect.\"\nI may say, however, that the judge having power before indictment to change the place of trial he did so, and the order said to have been signed in the first instance was a good and sufficient order for that purpose, as was the order which appears on the record. The indictment was found in the place assigned for the trial ; no objection was made to the change before or after the finding of the indictment, no application was made to set aside, add to or alter the order or to quash the indictment. The indictment was pleaded to and the trial proceeded without any objection being made to the court or place or manner of the trial ; no application to postpone the trial, nor any complaint made at the trial that any wrong was being done the prisoner. The court then had full jurisdiction over the prisoner and the subject-matter tried. After the trial the prisoner obtained a writ of error and assigned the alleged errors which included the very matters now alleged as grounds entitling him to a discharge under this writ of habeas corpus. He was heard and the court adjudged that there was no error and affirmed the judgment and sentence of the court of assize and general gaol delivery.\nIn this case my learned brother has cited numerous authorities to show that he had the right to go behind the record, but he frankly admits that the cases he has relied on all have reference to the records and proceedings of inferior courts. He has not been able to find a case of the record of a superior court contradicted, or its validity impugned, by extrinsic evidence. And I venture humbly, and with all respect, to suggest that the difficulty in this case has arisen from a misapprehension of what can, and what cannot, be done under a writ of habeas corpus, but more especially from not duly appreciating the distinction between the validity and force of records of courts of inferior, and of courts of superior, jurisdiction, but treating records of superior and inferior courts as being of the same force and effect. That this was done in this case is very obvious, for the learned judge says :\nThe English cases which I have cited are those before justices ; but on principle I can see no difference between a judgment of an inferior and one of a superior court, when the question of jurisdiction is raised ; nor can I see why, if the record of the former can be shown to be erroneous or false as touching the matter of jurisdiction, the other cannot be ; for without jurisdiction the acts of the one must be void as well as those of the other, and therefore the rule in the one case should be the same as in the other.\nFrom this doctrine I am constrained to dissent. I certainly did not expect to hear it contended that the record of a superior court was not to be treated as absolute verity so long as it stood unreversed. The following from Coke on Littlet\u00efn, 260, I have always been taught was good law at the time it was written, and ever has been since :\nLegally records are restrained to the rolls of such only as are courts of record and not the rolls of inferior, nor of any other courts, which proceed secundum legem et consuetudinem angliam. And the rolls being the records and memorials of the judges of the courts of record import in them such uncontrollable credit and verity as they admi? no averment, plea or proof to the contrary ; and if such record be alleged, and it be pleaded that there is no such record, it shall be tried only by itself. And the reason hereof is apparent, for otherwise (as our old authors say and that truly) there should never be any end of controversies, which should be inconvenient. Of courts of record, you may read in my reports, but yet during the term wherein the judicial act is done the record remaineth in the breast of the judges of the court and in their remembrance, and therefore the roll is alterable during that term as the judges shall direct, but when that term is past then the record is the roll and admitteth no alteration, averment or proof to the contrary.\nThe cases which establish that in a case like the present the writ of habeas corpus is inapplicable are numerous. I will refer to a few only of them.\nIn the Queen v. Lees[58] Lord Campbell C.J. says :\nA writ of habeas corpus, to the expediency of granting which we have also directed our attention, is not grantable in general where the party is in execution on a criminal charge after judgment, on an indictment according to the course of the common law, and even supposing it could run to St. Helena, it could only be useful as ancillary to, or accompanying, a writ of error, as it is only by writ of error that such judgment, according to the course of the common law, can properly be reversed ; until the judgment be reversed the prisoner ought not to be discharged. For these reasons we think that we ought not to interfere.\nIt is alleged, on the part of the prisoner, that the proceedings were upon a repealed statute, and that there were errors in the judgment, and hardships and irregularities in the proceedings. If such allegations are well founded, and obstacles are found to prevent any remedy by appeal to the Privy Council, or by writ of error to this court, we apprehend that the advisers of the Crown will take the matter into their consideration, and form their judgment with respect to any alleged error, wrong or hardship, which may be brought before them ; and if any such should be established to their satisfaction, will advise the Crown to give the relief to which they may think the applicant entitled, by pardon, or mitigation of punishment. We have no authority to interfere.\nApplication refused.\nIn ex parte Fernandez[59] Erle C.J. says :\nNow, the presumption is that all has been rightly done, and that the imprisonment has taken place in due course of law. The commitment being the act of a lawful court acting within its competency, there can be no invasion of the liberty of the subject in the sense in which the phrase is used. To issue a habeas corpus for the purpose of reviewing the decision of the judge, would be to my mind a gross abuse of the process. The writ would, I think, be most perniciously applied, if sought for on that ground ; witness the numerous applications, for writs of habeas corpus to bring into question the validity of judgments and other proceedings, which have invariably failed. That principle ought to be adhered to, unless there is reasonable ground for thinking that the commitment was void for want of setting forth in the warrant the facts which would show the offence and the jurisdiction of the judge to deal with it. I am clearly of opinion that no foundation is laid for this motion.\nWilles J.:\nThe result is that, historically, the courts of assize, as being courts of general jurisdiction in all criminal cases, and having power to try all issues of fact of whatever importance arising in the several counties on their circuits, to which, therefore, every man is indebted in a greater or less degree for the protection of his property, his liberty and his life, do stand in the place of the ancient iters of the judges itinerant, and are a superior court, so to speak, by succession ; whilst, practically, regard being had to the powers which they exercise, they are, as to criminal matters, courts of the most extensive jurisdiction, and, as to civil causes, periodical sittings of the judges of the superior courts, or, in their necessary absence, of others thought worthy to be associated with them for trying in the country those issues of fact which can be more conveniently disposed of there than in London or Middlesex.\nIn ex parte Partington[60] Lord Denman C. J. says :\nThere still remains the question whether the commissioner has rightly decided that the prisoner's case was not within the act ; but this was a question which he had jurisdiction to enquire into and decide ; he has done so, and we are not authorized to review his decision. We by no means intimate a doubt of the propriety of that decision ; we simply express no opinion upon it. It may be that there may be no court competent to review it ; or it may be that by the chief judge or the Lord Chancellor the merits of the decision may be reviewed. It is clear only that we have not that power. The prisoner, therefore, must be remanded.\nIn Regina v. Newton[61] Lord Denman C.J. says :\nThe prisoner was convicted at the Central Criminal Court of unlawful wounding at the Beulah Spa, which place was stated in the indictment to be in the Parish of Lambeth, within the jurisdiction of the central criminal court. The Beulah Spa is really out of the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court. Affidavit being made, showing this last fact, in support of a motion for a writ of habeas corpus to bring up the body of the prisoner, the court, on the motion being made, refused the writ, the affidavit being in contradiction of a record.\nJarvis C.J. says :\nIt is sought to impeach this record. This is not the remedy to be taken. There is a record which you cannot impeach. The proper application is to the Attorney General for a writ coram nobis. The Attorney General has a discretion on that matter, and is not the mere slave of the publi. I looked, when Attorney General, with anxiety to this part of my duty. I refused a writ of error in the case of the Mannings. The application here has been made and refused. The record stands, and the prisoner is convicted of an offence committed within this jurisdiction.\nCresswell J.:\nI am of the same opinion. A record is of so high a nature that, if error in fact be assigned which contradicts it, it is ill assigned.\nCrowder J.:\nAs long as the record stands it is quite impossible to grant a habeas corpus on a motion of this kind. Brenan's Case[62] Lord Denman C.J.:\nWe think, however, that, the court having competent jurisdiction to try and punish the offence, and the sentence being unreversed, we cannot assume that it is invalid or not warranted by law, or require the authority of the court to pass the sentence to be set out, by the gaoler upon the return. We are bound to assum e, prima facie, that the unreversed sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction is correct ; otherwise we should, in effect, be constituting ourselves a court of appeal without power to reverse the judgment.\nNo words could have more clearly intimated that the fact of a sentence having been passed by such court founds the right to detain, and that the validity or regularity of the sentence is not to be called in question. Even if that sentence is erroneous, this court cannot set it aside or inquire into its propriety or deny the effect which the law assigns to any sentence.\nIn the matter of Clarke, a case of a magistrate's order[63], Lord Denman C.J. says :\nThe adjudication of any competent authority deciding on facts which are necessary to give it jurisdiction is sufficient. It would be different if the affidavits tended to show that the magistrate's order was obtained by fraud, or that he was not really exercising the functions which he professed to exercise.\nPatteson J.:\nThe only real question now is, whether affidavits are admissible to show that the statements in the order are not true. There is no case in which a party has been allowed in this way directly to contradict facts set forth in an order. All that the courts have permitted has been to allege a collateral extrinsic fact, confessing and avoiding, as it were, the disputed order. Here the object proposed is to contradict it ; and there is no instance of such an attempt having been yielded to. Brittain v. Kinnaird [64] shows that a fact directly stated on a conviction is not to be controverted. Every order must show facts sufficient to give a jurisdiction ; but the facts, if so shown, are not to be contested.\nWightman J.:\nI think, for the reasons which have been given, that the prisoner must be remanded. No case is cited in which parties have been allowed to controvert a fact directly decided by a court of competent jurisdiction\nPrisoner remanded.\nDime's Case[65] shows the distinction between proceedings before a superior court and those of an inferior court.\nIn Carus Wilson's case[66] Lord Denman C.J says :\nWe may decide the question before us by considering the principle of the exception that runs through the whole law of habeas corpus, whether under common law or statute, namely, that our form of writ does not apply where a party is in execution under the judgment of a competent court. When it appears that the party has been before a court of competent jurisdiction, which court has committed him for contempt or any other cause, I think it is no longer open to this court to enter at all into the subject-matter.\n******\nSuppose a party were convicted of murder, and ordered to be executed in three weeks, could we, while he was awaiting the execution of his sentence, receive a statement that he was improperly convicted, that evidence was improperly admitted, or that the offence was not murder ? The security which the public has against the impunity of offenders is, that the court which tries must be considered competent to convict. We would not interfere in this way without incurring the danger of setting at large persons committed for the worst offences.\nIn the case of the Sheriff of Middlesex[67] Lord Denman C.J. says :\nOn the motion for a habeas corpus there must be an affidavit from the party applying, but the return, if it discloses a sufficient answ?r, puts an end to the case, and I think the production of a good warrant is a sufficient answer.\nOn a writ of habeas corpus per Littledale J.:\nIf the warrant returned be good on the face of it we can inquire no further.\nI have not deemed it necessary to refer to the American cases cited, which though entitled to every respect are not binding on this court, and should not be followed if at variance with the English authorities by which we are bound when they are consistent, but I find, in a case in Massachusetts decided by an eminent jurist, formerly chief justice of Massachusetts and now a distinguished judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, a principle propounded as I believe the law to be in these words.\nPer Gray J. in Fleming v. Clarke[68].\nThe general rule is well established that a person imprisoned under the sentence of a court having general jurisdiction of the case is not to be discharged by habeas corpus, but should be left to his remedy by appeal, exceptions or writ of error,\nFor which he cites a number of authorities.\nThese authorities are, to my mind, conclusive that if the prisoner has any just cause of complaint against the proceedings in this case his remedy, if any exists, cannot be obtained through the instrumentality of a writ of habeas corpus, for I have no hesitation in saying that a judgment of conviction and sentence of the court of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery of British Columbia on an indictment for murder, confirmed on error by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and standing unreversed by the Privy Council, is conclusive as to the prisoner being a convicted felon. Such a decision as this on which we are called to pass raises a conflict of authority, between the established superior courts of the country and individual judges, of a most extraordinary character ; places the officer in whose custody the prisoner is, in this most anomalous and trying position, compelling him to elect to hold the prisoner under the judgment and sentence of a court of unquestionably competent criminal jurisdiction, confirmed by the unanimous decision of the full bench of the Supreme Court of the province having unrestricted jurisdiction in criminal cases, or to discharge him under the order of a single judge at chambers, it may be even of a single judge of the very court that unanimously affirmed his judgment and sentence, or a single judge of this court, in direct opposition to, and defiance of, such a conviction and sentence.\nA good deal has been said as to the sheriff not obeying the writ and not bringing up the prisoner.\nIn Comyn's Dig. hab. cor. b. it is said :\nIf a man is in prison for any cause, except upon a conviction for any crime, or in execution, he may have an habeas corpus cum caus\u00e2 detentionis.\nBut where the commitment is for treason or felony plainly expressed in the warrant the officer is not obliged by stat. 31 Car. 2 cap. 2, to make a return as directed by that statute and, per LeBlanc J.[69]:\nIt is sufficient for the officer having him in his custody to return to a writ of habeas corpus that a court having competent jurisdiction had inflicted such a sentence as they had authority to do and that he holds him in his custody under that sentence.\nChief Justice Robinson deals with that phase of the case in Regina v. Crabbe,[70] where he says, delivering the judgment of the court :\nWe cannot properly grant the habeas corpus to bring up a prisoner who is under sentence upon a conviction for larceny at the Quarter Sessions ; and if we should grant the writ the sheriff or gaoler would do right to return that the prisoner is in his custody in execution of a sentence upon conviction before the Quarter Sessions, and not bring up the prisoner. If there has been anything wrong in the proceeding below, still there can be no certiorari after judgment ; the only course is by writ of error.\nFrom these views of the law I am not prepared to dissent. So soon then as it appeared by the record of a superior court of general criminal jurisdiction that the prisoner had been tried, convicted of a felony and sentenced by such a court, the jurisdiction of the judge, that is to say, the right of the judge to issue the writ, or discharge the prisoner, ceased.\nIf in the administration of the criminal jurisprudence of the Dominion the judgments of the superior courts of the provinces, and of this the Supreme Court of the Dominion, can be paralysed by a single judge of either of those courts in chambers, the practical effect of what is now contended for, and if, as contended, there is no redress in this or any other court of the Dominion of Canada, is it too much to say that to allow single judges by virtue of the writ of habeas corpus so to review, control, and, in effect, nullify the judgments of these high courts of criminal jurisdiction is subversive of all law and order ? For if this writ and order could stand, it is clear that every sentence pronounced, not only by the Supreme Court of British Columbia but by all the supreme courts of criminal ju\u00f2isdiction in the other provinces, would be subject to be, practically, review\u00e5d summarily and their judgments and sentences declared invalid and of no effect, by a judge in chambers not only of this court but by a judge in chambers of the courts of the province in which the proceedings were had and the judgments and sentences pronounced.\nAs the judges of this court, in matters of habeas corpus for the purpose of inquiry into the cause of commitments in criminal cases under any Act of the Parliament of Canada, have only concurrent jurisdiction with the judges of British Columbia, if a judge of this court has jurisdiction in this matter, a single judge in British Columbia can, on habeas corpus, not only review the proceedings of the court of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery and of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and discharge a prisoner convicted and sentenced by those courts, but, if on error there had been a difference of opinion in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and an appeal had been taken to this court, and this court had affirmed the judgment and sentence of the courts in British Columbia, on the grounds acted on by my learned brother, the dissentient judge in British Columbia could, on habeas corpus, have treated the whole proceedings as a nullity,and, notwithstanding the unreserved jzudgments of all these courts, prevented these judgments from having any effect, although they stood on the records of the court unreversed, by simply ordering the prisoner to be discharged out of custody. Nor indeed, if the judgment of this court was carried to the Privy Council and there affirmed, can I see any reason why, on the principles acted on in this case, a single judge in British Columbia or of this court should not go behind the record, and by extrinsic evidence, pronounce the proceedings without jurisdiction. It seems to me only necessary to state the logical result and effect of the exercise of such a jurisdiction, either by the individual judges of British Columbia or of this court, to produce the conviction that the principles of the common law under which this writ issued could never be found to sanction such a proceeding. At any rate, I have an abiding confidence that the laws of this Dominion have not entrusted to any single judge, however high his legal status, a jurisdiction fraught with such dreadful consequences. Much as I appreciate the value of the writ of habeas corpus, and no man can do so more than I do, if by its instrumentality such an exercise of jurisdiction can be accomplished, I should feel that instead of its being a blessing, as I verily think it is, it would be the exact opposite. And I can only add in conclusion that if the proceeding of issuing this writ and the order discharging the prisoner from the judgment and sentence of the court of oyer and terminer in British Columbia, affirmed on a writ of error by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and which writ, if a judge of this court could issue it, might have been issued by a judge of the court of British Columbia (thereby, in effect, reversing the judgment of both those courts and that, too, on the very same point now in controversy) is so final and conclusive that such writ and order cannot be dealt with by this or any other court in the Dominion of Canada, would it be too much to say that the administration of justice in this Dominion of Canada is in a truly deplorable condition ?\nThe record and materials before the learned judge having not only shown a proper legal trial, conviction, and sentence by a court of general criminal jurisdiction, but disclosed a valid ground of detention, the ap\u00f0lication for a writ, therefore, should have been refused. As the writ should not have issued, then, as in Crawford's case, it was improvidently issued and should be quashed, and it follows as a necessary consequence that if my learned brother ought not to have issued the writ clearly the order for the prisoner's discharge should not have been made.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The presence in court of the prisoner for the purposes of this motion was, I consider, for the reasons which have been stated, unnecessary. And the other preliminary objection that the court has no jurisdiction to control its own process by quashing a writ of habeas corpus issued under section 51 of the Supreme and Exchequer Act of 1875, is, in my opinion for reasons which I will state hereafter, wholly untenable. That the writ was improvidently issued, the matter upon which it was granted having been in law insufficient, is also a conclusion which I have arrived at for reasons and upon authorities which I will now proceed to state.\nIn the first place there was no jurisdiction to issue the writ under section 51, the prisoner not having been committed in a \" criminal case \" under any Act of the Parliament of Canada. The offence of murder is not a statutory but a common law crime, in as much as the first section of the statute 32 and 33 Vic. ch. 20, does not apply to the offence but to its punishment. In the case of Potvin who had been been committed on a charge of murder under a coroner's warrant, and for whose discharge an application for a writ of habeas corpus, was made to me, I had to consider this identical question, and I then formed and acted upon the same opinion as that just enunciated.\nIf any proposition is conclusively established by authorities having the support of the soundest reasons, it is that, after a conviction for felony by a court having general jurisdiction of the offence charged, a habeas corpus is an inappropriate remedy, the proper course to be adopted is such a case, being that to which the prisoner in the present case first had recourse, viz. : a writ of error. The anomalous character of such an interference with the due course of justice, in intercepting the execution of the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and by which a single judge in chambers might reduce to a dead letter the considered judgment of the highest court of error, would to my mind be itself sufficient even without authority to induce a strong presumption that such a state of the law could not possibly exist.\nThe authorities are however abundant, and decisive against such a contention. The strong language used by Williams, J. in Regina v. Newton [71] seems well warranted, and without attempting any minute examination of the authorities, it is sufficient to say that the case of Regina v. Newton is entirely in accordance with other well considered cases particularly with those of Regina v. Suddis[72] ; ex parte Lees[73] ; Bethell's Case[74] ; Re Carlile[75] ; Re Crabbe [76] ; and ex parte Watkins[77], (a case in the Supreme Court of the United States). When there has been a conviction for a criminal offence by a superior court of record having general jurisdiction over that offence the objection that the court ought not in that particular case to have exercised its jurisdiction or that there was some fatal defect in its proceedings is one conclusively for a court of error, in other words the judgment of the court is res judicata as to questions of jurisdiction as well as to all other objections. If a court having no jurisdiction over the offence charged should so far exceed its authority as to entertain a criminal prosection, there the proceeding, being one beyond its general jurisdiction, is wholly void and the prisoner so illegally dealt with may be entitled to be discharged on a writ of habeas corpus.This distinction, may, I think, be well illustrated by a case which I put during the argument, of a recorder's court or a court of quarter sessions having no jurisdiction either at common law or by statute to try a prisoner for murder, trying and sentencing one on such a charge, for such a proceeding would be beyond the general jurisdiction of the court. Applying this here, there can be no doubt or question that the court of oyer and terminer in British Columbia had jurisdiction to try prisoners for murder, and that being so it is, in my judgment, decisive of the question upon which we are called upon to pronounce.\nAs to the objection that the court was not properly constituted for want of a commission from the Governor General of the Dominion that was a proper question for the court of error and is concluded by the judgment in error, or if the Supreme Court of British Columbia did not possess the jurisdiction in error which it assumed to exercise (as to which however I have no doubt) then this point was equally concluded by the sentence of the court of oyer and terminer itself, as is shown very clearly by the cases already cited of re Carlile and Regina v. Newton and re Crabbe, in all of which cases the objections were to the jurisdiction of the convicting court.\nWhilst I hold that the record is conclusive here and that that is sufficient to show that the writ was improvidently issued, I am also prepared to agree with the Chief Justice in holding, as he has, that the objections to the conviction of the prisoner were, even viewed as matters of error, all untenable. Without intending to enter upon any consideration in detail of these objections, I may say, that as regards the objection that there was no proper commission of oyer and terminer, it appears to me entirely covered by the statute of 1885, which, as well as that of 1879, was in force when the prisoner was tried and applied to his case. These acts were, under sub-section 14 of section 92 of the British North America Act authorizing the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts of criminal jurisdiction, clearly within the competence of the provincial legislature, and if no regular commission was issued there was jurisdiction to hold the courts of oyer and terminer and general delivery without commission. I am, however, of opinion that under the provisions of sections 64 and 65 of the British North \u00c1merica Act and the provisio\u00ees of the order in council for the admission of British Columbia into the confederation, the power of issuing such commissions was conserved to the Lieutenant Governor who before the union clearly possessed that power.\nAs regards the objection to the order changing the venue I also agree that there could be no valid objection to the conviction, which the prisoner could avail himself of upon a writ of habeas corpus, so long as the record was regular and sufficient upon its face. We are bound to consider the record as importing absolute verity, and the order must, therefore, be assumed to have been actually made on the day it bears date. Moreover, the decision of the Court of Error would, as already shewn, be conclusive as to this objection.\nNext it is said that the Supreme Court of British Columbia had no jurisdiction to entertain a writ of error. The terms on which that court was originally established giving it a general jurisdiction in criminal cases are said to be insufficient to confer jurisdiction in error. The court was originally established not by legislative enactment, but by the authority of the Crown given to the Lieutenant Governor by his commission, and by a proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor following the terms of the commission. A court to exercise jurisdiction according to the course of the common law, (but common law courts only) can, as is well known, be legally established in this way. The only question therefore which can be raised is as to the extent of the jurisdiction implied in the words used. And this, I think, must be answered by holding that the powers of the court in criminal cases were to be the same as those of the Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster as it existed at the da\u00f4e of the proclamation. That court, being the great criminal court of original jurisdiction known to the common law, is the type which all criminal courts of general jurisdiction established in this way, must, in the absence of some words expressly restricting jurisdiction, be assumed to follow, and on this principle I have no doubt as to the jurisdiction in error in criminal cases of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. It would, however, make no difference if this were not so, for granting that the Supreme Court of British Columbia had no jurisdiction to issue the writ of error and that the judgment in error was wholly void, still we have before us the record of the Court of Oyer and Terminer which shows a good conviction and a conclusive sentence, and, in the cases already quoted of Regina v. Newton, Regina v. Carlile and Regina v. Lees, there was no writ of error, but conclusive effect in these cases was attributed to the judgments of courts of first instance.\nSo far I have refrained from writing fully either for the purposes of discussing arguments or examining authorities, all of which has been done by the chief justice.\nThere are however two or three points which were raised in the argument by the learned counsel for the Crown on which I desire, speaking only for myself, to say a few additional words. In the first place it was contended that the 51st section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, 1875, was not within the powers of the Parliament of the Dominion. Acting upon the well established and salutary rule that a question of constitutional validity is one which courts never deal with, if the case is susceptible of a decision in favor of the party raising the objection on other grounds, it has been considered advisable not to enter upon any discussion of this point, and I only mention it expressly to reserve the right to consider it fully if it should be raised hereafter.\nNext, with reference to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the present motion, I desire to say that I have formed an opinion on that point even stronger than that already expressed by the Chief Justice. This court has, in my view, in exercise either of an inherent jurisdiction to control its own process and writs, or referentially under the words of the 51st section conferring on the judges of the court a jurisdiction not in terms unlimited but only concurrent and therefore co-extensive, with that of the judges of the Supreme Court of British Columbia who are subject to the control of their own court, power to set aside this writ as having been issued improvidently. Some of my learned brothers, I believe, hold that the words of the 51st section expressly conferring a right of appeal in case the writ should be refused have the effect, upon the principle of the argument \" e contrario,\" of excluding an appeal to or a right of review by the court in all other cases under the clause in question. Differing I admit, very widely from them, I am of opinion that there is nothing in the words just referred to which ought to have the effect of so excluding the ordinary jurisdiction of this court to review th\u00e5 decision of one of its judges who, sitting in chambers, exercises the power of the court. If the concluding words of the section giving the appeal in case of the refusal of the writ had been omitted and the section had concluded with the words \" any Act of the Parliament of Canada \" (the provision relating to extradition was repealed in 1876,) there could, I apprehend, be no possible doubt that, on the general principle that when jurisdiction is conferred on a judge in chambers a right to revise his decision is impliedly conferred on the court, there would be in every case, as well in those in which the writ might be granted as in those in which it might be refused, a right in the court to revise the decision and rescind the order of a judge made under this section. The cases of Robinson v. Burbidge[78], and Witham v. Lynch[79], are sufficient authorities to establish this proposition, though no doubt other cases to the same effect could easily be produced, but the proposition in this general form is so universally admitted and acted on in practice that a search for additional authorities may have been thought superfluous. The question is then reduced to this : Do the latter words of the section, giving the right of appeal in the one particular case of the writ having been refused, take it away in all others, upon the principle of the often quoted maxim, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, or are we to consider this provision as introduced either by way of extreme caution in regard of the right of personal liberty, or from a misapprehension of the general law, which without such words would have conferred an appeal or right of review ? No reason can be suggested why the right of appeal should be withheld when the writ is granted, and I am of opinion, therefore, that we must attribute these words expressly giving an appeal to the excessive caution of the legislature to provide all due protection to the subject in the matter of personal liberty, and not to an intention to disarm the court of the almost essential right of controlling writs and process issued under its seal and running in its name. The provision under consideration is therefore to be construed not upon the principle of the maxim referred to, but upon the application of another equally recognized, viz., expressio eorum quae taciti insunt nihil operalur, and a right to entertain appeals from, and revise, rescind and vary orders made, under this section must be recognized as existing in the court to the fullest extent or, in the present case at least, to as full an extent as the Supreme Court of British Columbia possesses jurisdiction to revise and rescind the orders of its judges made at chambers in matters connected with the granting of the writ of habeas corpus and proceedings incidental to it.\nNext, it is to be observed that the notice of motion asks not merely that the writ of habeas corpus be set aside, but also that the order for the prisoner's discharge consequent upon the return may be rescinded. That the return was a perfectly good one in form, in my opinion, cannot be doubted. It follows the precedent of a return to such writs given in Archbolds Crown Practice[80] ; and I cannot think that there is any ground for the objection that the return should in addition to the form used be signed by the sheriff in his own hand. The sheriff is a ministerial officer and such officers may in law always act by deputy, and we know that in practice the returns to all writs directed to the sheriff are usually signed by the deputy or under sheriff in the name of the sheriff. That the return is good in substance appears not only as a necessary consequence of what has been already said that the sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction is not to be interfered with by a writ of habeas corpus, but also by the high authority of a case directly in point. In the Queen v. Crabbe[81], already referred to, where such a writ was moved for to bring up a prisoner under sentence of a court of quarter sessions on a conviction for larceny, upon the ground that the court which tried him was not properly constituted, Robinson C.J. says :\u2014\nWe cannot properly grant the habeas corpus, to bring up a prisoner who is under sentence upon a conviction for larceny at the quarter sessions, and if we should grant the writ the sheriff or gaoler would do right to return that the prisoner is in his custody in execution of a sentence upon conviction before the quarter sessions and not bring up the prisoner.\nThis is a decision of peculiar weight as being the judgment of a great crown lawyer and of a Chief Justice little disposed to excuse any laxity in obedience to the process of his court. Having thus upon the files of this court a return good in form and in substance, a return which is nothing less than a record of the court, what, I ask, is there in the statute to prevent this court acting on such a return to its own writ ? The utmost effect which can be given to the words already referred to, is that they apply in case the writ is granted to exclude an appeal from that decision, but here the writ having been granted and obeyed so far that a good return has been made to it, how can these words, which do not refer to the proceedings ulterior to the granting of the writ, that is, to the return and subsequent proceedings, take away that obvious jurisdiction which this court must, in common with the most humble tribunal of the land, possess over its own records and its own officers ? I can see no reason against exercising jurisdiction on this head and even therefore if I was convinced that we had no power to inquire into the circumstances connected with the granting of the writ, I should still be prepared to hold that there was on the files of the court a good return to the writ of the court upon which we are bound to act by relieving the sheriff, an officer at once of this court and of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, from the embarrassing position in which he is placed between the conflicting orders of the two jurisdictions, by rescinding the order for the prisoner's discharge from custody made on the return.\nIt is laid down in Bacon's Ab. Tit. Habeas Corpus, that a writ to bring up a criminal prisoner should be directed to the gaoler and not to the sheriff, as in the case of a civil prisoner, but here it appears from the proceedings before us that the prisoner, although originally in the custody of the gaoler, was remanded by the court of oyer and terminer and also by the Supreme Court in error to the custody of the sheriff in whose custody he must therefore be now considered to be.\nLastly I must observe that had I thought the learned judge right in all other respects I should still have thought he erred in discharging the prisoner instead of remanding him as he had by statute express authority to do. There were, in my opinion, materials before the judge amply sufficient to warrant a remand.\nFor the foregoing reasons I am of opinion that this motion must be granted to the fullest extent asked for. FOURNIER J.\u2014Oette cause est soumise \u00e0 la cour sur une motion de la part de la Couronne demandant l'annulation d'un bref d'habeas corpus \u00e9mis sur l'ordre de l'honorable juge Henry, ordonnant au sh\u00e9rif de l'lle de Vancouver de produire devant l'honorable juge, \u00e0 Ottawa, la personne de Robert E. Sproule. L'annulation des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s subs\u00e9quents au dit bref, y compris l'ordre de mise en libert\u00e9 du dit Sproule sont aussi demand\u00e9s par la m\u00eame motion. Les raisons donn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'appui de cette demande sont : 1\u00b0 Que l'honorable juge n'avait pas le pouvoir d'ordonner l'\u00e9mission du dit bref d'habeas corpus. 2\u00b0 Que son jugement ordonnant la mise en libert\u00e9 du dit Sproule est erron\u00e9 parce que le dit Sproule avait l\u00e9galement subi, devant une cour comp\u00e9tente son proc\u00e8s pour meurtre, et en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable et convaincu, et que la conviction avait ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e sur un bref d'erreur.\nLe meurtre pour lequelle prisonnier a subi son proc\u00e8s en d\u00e9cembre 1885, \u00e0 Victoria, dans la Colombie Britannique, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis le ler juin, \u00e0 Kootenay dans la m\u00eame province. Un verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 fut rendu (avec recommandation \u00e0 la elemenc\u00e9 royale), mais une sentence de mort n'en f\u00fbt pas moins prononc\u00e9e contre le prisonnier, le 5 janvier 1886.\nLe condamn\u00e9 ayant obtenu un bref d'erreur, la cour Supr\u00eame de la Colombie, corapos\u00e9e de cinq juges, \u00e9tant au complet, rejeta, apr\u00e8s audition, le bref d'erreur et confirma la sentence prononc\u00e9e.\nLe trois mai suivant une demande d'habeas corpus fur pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'honorable juge Henry, lequel, apr\u00e8s audition et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, ordonna l'\u00e9mission du bref d'habeas corpus dont l'annulation est demand\u00e9e. Sur ce bref le sh\u00e9rif de l'Ile de Vancouver ayant fait rapport qu'il d\u00e9tenait Sproule en vertu d'une sentence de mort, prononc\u00e9e contre lui aux derni\u00e8res assises de Victoria, pour meurtre, sentence qui avait ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision unanime de la cour Supr\u00eame de la Colombie Britannique, sur un bref d'erreur, il soumettait respectueusement qu'en consequence il n'\u00e9tait pas tenu de se conformer aux injonctions de ce bref. A pr\u00e8s la production de ce rapport, une demande de mise en libert\u00e9 du condamn\u00e9 fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'honorable juge qui apr\u00e8s audition, accorda cette demande.\nLes questions debattu\u00e9s devant l'honorable juge Henry furent les m\u00eames que celles qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9es devant les cinq juges de la cour \u015aupr\u00eame de la Colombie, savoir : 1\u00b0 qu'un changement de venue avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 ; 2\u00b0 que la commission du lieutenant-gouverneur de la Colombie-Britannique, en date du 23 novembre 1885, \u00e9tablissant une cour d'Oyer et Terminer et de d\u00e9livrance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, en la cit\u00e9 de Victoria, et les assises tenues en vertu de cette commission emise sous le grand sceau de la province de la Colombie, \u00e9taient ill\u00e9gales.\nL'honorable juge par un jugement dans lequel il a fait un examen approfondi des importantes questions qui lui \u00e9taient soumises, a ordonn\u00e9 d'abord l'\u00e9mission du bref d'habeas corpus et plus tard, la mise en libert\u00e9 du condamn\u00e9.\nLes m\u00eames questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 de nouveau d\u00e9battues devant cette cour sur la motion demandant l'annulation des ordres rendus par l'honorable juge Henry tant pour l'\u00e9mission du bref d'habeas corpus que pour la mise en libert\u00e9 du prisonnier.\nCes questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es par les habiles conseils entendus tant de la part de la Couronne que de celle du condamn\u00e9, avec tous les d\u00e9veloppements dont elles \u00e9taient susceptibles. Ma\u00e9s avant de les aborder, les savants conseils du condamn\u00e9 ont tout d'abord soulev\u00e9 contre la juridiction de cette cour, une objection qui, si elle est maintenue, nous interdit le droit d'entrer dans 'examen des questions d\u00e9cidees par l'honorable juge Henry. Cette question doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e avant que l'on puisse proceder ulterieurement.\nLa cour Supr\u00eame, disent les savants conseils du prisonnier, n'a qu'une juridiction limit\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d'habeas corpus. Elle ne peut ni ordonner l'\u00e9mission du bref en pr\u00e8miere instance, ni si\u00e9ger en appel pour reviser l'ordre rendu par un seul juge, s'il n'a pas refus\u00e9 le bref demand\u00e9.\nBien que la section 15 de l'Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame d\u00e9clare d'une mani\u00e8re generate que la cour Supr\u00eame exercera une juridiction d'appel en mati\u00e8re civile et criminelle, dans tout le Canada, cette juridiction est d\u00e9finie et limit\u00e9e par les sections qui suivent cette d\u00e9claration. L'appel est limit\u00e9 tant au civil qu'au criminel.\nEn mati\u00e8re d'habeas corpus ad subjiciendum dans les affaires criminelles la juridiction est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la section 51 de l'Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame \u00e0 tout juge de cette cour, mais elle n'est pas \u00e9tendue \u00e0 la cour m\u00eame qui n'a \u00e0 cet \u00e8gard aucun pouvoir, comme le font voir clairement les termes de cette section :\n\" Any Judge of the Supreme Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the Courts or Judges of the several Provinces, to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada * * * \"\nD'apr\u00e9s ces termes c'est au juge individuellement de la Cour Supr\u00eame que des pouvoirs concurrents avec ceux des cours et des juges des provinces sont donn\u00e9s au sujet de l'habeas corpus et non pas \u00e0 la cour Supr\u00eame ; il n'y a pas entre cette derni\u00e8re et les cours et les juges des provinces, concurrence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nLe pouvoir que pouvait exercer l'honorable juge Henry quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission du bref d'habeas corpus est exactement le m\u00eame que celui poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par la cour Supr\u00eame de la Colombie et par les juges de cette cour individuellement. Or le pouvoir d'ordonner l'\u00e9mission du bref habeas corpus appartient incontestablement \u00e0 la cour Supr\u00eame de la Colombie et \u00e0 chacun de ses juges individuellement. Cette clause lui donnait clairement le pouvoir qu'il a exerc\u00e9 de s'enquerir des causes du commitment du condamn\u00e9.\nOn a paru trouver singulier que la section 51 n'ait pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame, en mati\u00e8re d'habeas corpus, comme c'est le cas dans les autres tribunaux superi\u00e9urs, les m\u00eames pouvoirs que la loi donne\u00e0 ces cours et aux juges individuellement. La raison en est sans doute que la juridiction donn\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque juge \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e suffisante pour l'exp\u00e9dition de ces sortes d'affaires.\nUne autre raison bien forte pour faire voir que tous les pouvoirs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 un seul juge, c'est qu'il est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e9tabli comme une cour de premi\u00e8re instance en mati\u00e8re d'habeas corpus. Le parlement du Canada poss\u00e8de incontestablement par la section 101 de l'Acte de conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration le pouvoir de cr\u00e9er des tribunaux additionnels. C'est ce pouvoir qu'il a exerc\u00e9 en concentrant tous les pouvoirs sur un seul juge. Ce pouvoir de cr\u00e9er des tribunaux additionnels a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 plusieurs fois, entre autres dans la cr\u00e9ation d'une cour d'\u00e9lection et d'une cour maritime, o\u00f9 dans chacun de ces tribunaux un seul juge forme la cour.\nCe qui rend encore plus \u00e9vident l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur qui, par la section 15, cr\u00e9ait une cour d'appel en mati\u00e8re civile et criminelle, c'est qu'il accorde le droit d'appeler de la d\u00e9cision d'un seul juge \u00e0 toute la cour, lorsque le juge a refus\u00e9 la demande d'habeas corpus, ou renvoy\u00e9 l'accus\u00e9 en prison.\nD'ailleurs, quelles qu'aient \u00e9t\u00e9 les raisons du l\u00e9gislateur pour en agir ainsi, il est \u00e9vident que son intention n'\u00e9tait pas de donner \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame une juridiction de premi\u00e8re instance. Toute la juridiction qu 'il lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9e se borne \u00e0 un appel dans le seul cas o\u00f9 un juge a refus\u00e9 le bref d'habeas corpus. Il n'y a que dans ce cas que la Cour Supreme puisse exercer une juridiction d'appel en mati\u00e8re d'habeas corpus. Si ce n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l'intention de limiter ainsi l'appel sur l'habeas corpus en mati\u00e8re criminelle, le legislateur, comme il l'a fait pour l'habeas corpus en mati\u00e8re civile, section 23, ne l'aurait-il pas accord\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 chaque partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. L'intention de limiter les appels en mati\u00e8re criminelle appara\u00eet encore par la section 49, o\u00f9 cet appel est refus\u00e9 lorsque la cour qui a confirm\u00e9 la conviction, a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime. Ceci doit suffire pour faire voir que l'appel accord\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re criminelle est limit\u00e9 et qu'il ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 que dans le cas o\u00f9 il est sp\u00e9cialement accord\u00e9. Il l'est \u00e9videmment d\u00e9ni\u00e9 dans le cas qui nous occupe, par les termes de la section 51\u2014qui ne l'accorde que lorsquele bref a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9\u2014dans ce cas, le bref a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par l'honorable juge. Cette cour est donc sans juridiction.\nPour combattre le texte formel de l'acte de la cour Supr\u00eame refusant l'appel, on s'est attach\u00e9 \u00e0 des subtilit\u00e9s techniques pour en conclure que la cour a tout de m\u00eame un droit de surveillance et de contr\u00f4le sur les brefs d'habeas corpus \u00e9mis par un juge. Tout bref\u00e9manant de la cour Supr\u00eame, dit-on, doit, en vertu de la sec. 66, \u00eatre attest\u00e9 au nom du juge en chef, et de cette attestation, au nom de la cour on en conclur que celle-ci peut s'enqu\u00e9rir de la mani\u00e8re dont le bref a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis,\u2014et l'annuler si elle trouve qu'il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Il est vrai que le bref sign\u00e9 par l'honorable juge Henry est intitul\u00e9 comme \u00e9mis de la cour Supr\u00eame et porte l'attestation du juge en chef. Il faut remarquer que la sec. 66 ne s'applique qu'aux brefs de la cour Supr\u00eame, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 ceux qu'elle a le pouvoir d'\u00e9mettre en vertu du statut. Cette formalit\u00e9 de l'attestation doit sans doute \u00eatre observ\u00e9e pour ces brefs. Mais en est-il de m\u00eame pour un bref qu'elle n'a pas droit de faire \u00e9mettre ? Je ne le crois pas. Le bref d'habeas corpus aurait pu \u00eatre valablement \u00e9mis sur l'ordre du juge seul, sans l'attestation de la cour, et il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant, car la principale et presque la seule formalit\u00e9 requise par le stat. 31, ch 2, [82]est la signature du juge, et le bref dont il s'agit porte celle de l'honorable juge Henry. L'officier sur lequel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 ce bref, sans la signature d'un juge n'e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de s'y conformer, bien que ce bref f\u00fbt attest\u00e9 par le juge en chef et port\u00e2t le sceau de la cour La formalit\u00e9 indispensable \u00e9tait la signature du juge ordonnant l'\u00e9mission du bref et non l'attestation. Il serait donc valable sans l'attestation. Mais le fait d'y avoir ajout\u00e9 cette pure formalit\u00e9 peut-il donner \u00e0 la cour une juridiction que le statut lui refuse en termes formels. C'est \u00e9vident que non, car ce serait un moyen indirect de violer la loi en s'attribuant au moyen d'une simple formalit\u00e9 sans valeur, une juridiction importante que la l\u00e9gislature a refus\u00e9e. Si cette formalit\u00e9, ce dont je doute fort, doit \u00eatre remplie dans un bref que le juge seul a droit d'\u00e9mettre, il faut en conclure que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu autoriser le juge, qui seul a le pouvoir de faire \u00e9mettre le bref, \u00e0 se servir de l'attestation du juge en chef et du sceau de la cour.\nDans tous les cas le fait d'avoir rempli cette formalit\u00e9 ne peut pas plus vicier le bref, qu'il ne peut donner juridiction \u00e0 la cour. Il est de principe d'ailleurs que le bref d'habeas corpus ad subjiciendum ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u00f5l pour simple d\u00e9fault de forme.\nOn nous a dit aussi pour nous persuader que la cour Supr\u00eame doit avoir le droit de contr\u00f4ler ou de reviser la d\u00e9cision de l'honorable juge Henry, que la cour du Banc de la Reine a un droit de surveillance sur les cours inf\u00e9rieures de record et qu'elle peut au moyen soit du bref de prohibition ou d'erreur, ou de certiorari reviser leurs jugements ou les contraindre \u00e0 se renfermer dans les limites de leurs juridictions respectives. Elle a aussi le m\u00eame pouvoir sur les tribunaux inferi\u00e9urs qui ne sont pas des cours de record, au moyen d'un bref appel\u00e9 writ of false judgment. On peut encore au moyen du bref d'habeas corpus \u00e9man\u00e9 de l'une ou l'autre des cours de juridiction sup\u00e9rieure mettre en question la validit\u00e9 des jugements des tribunaux inf\u00e9ri\u00e9urs. Enfin les pouvoirs de surveillance de la cour du Banc de la Reine sur les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs sont tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendus et d'un caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nOn nous dit en outre que cette cour peut exercer, en certains cas, le pouvoir d'annuler des brefs qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement ou irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e9mis, et qu'elle tire son autorit\u00e9 pour en agir ainsi d'un pouvoir inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 sa constitution.\nTout cela est sans doute vrai de la cour du Banc de la Reine ; mais ne l'est pas de la cour Supr\u00eame. Si elle a ces pouvoirs o\u00f9 est le texte de loi qui les lui conf\u00e8re. Il n'y en a certainement pas. Ce n'est pas en supposant une analogie qui n'existe pas entre ces deux cours, que l'on peut en tirer la conclusion, que les pouvoirs de l'une peuvent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s par l'autre.\nDe ce que la cour du Banc de la Reine peut avoir un certain contr\u00f4le sur les brefs qui en sont \u00e9man\u00e9s, doit-on en conclure que ce pouvoir existe aussi dans notre cour ? Peut-on dire encore que ce pouvoir r\u00e9sulte de l'ensemble des dispositions de l'acte de la cour Supr\u00eame et de la volont\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur, de ne pas laisser \u00e0 un seul juge, sans aucun contr\u00f4le de la part de la cour, le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider finalement les questions importantes qui peuvent \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es sur habeas corpus.\nCe raisonnement ne repose sur aucune base s\u00e9rieuse. Ce n'est pas par des analogies et des pr\u00e9somptions que l'on peut s'attribuer une juridiction\u2014il est de principe qu'elle n'est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e que par des termes pr\u00e9cis et une volont\u00e9 formellement exprim\u00e9e par le l\u00e9gislateur. Ici le l\u00e9gislateur a dit, de la mani\u00e8re la plus pr\u00e9cise, tout le contraire de ce que l'on veut lui faire dire. Dans tous les cas ce qui peut \u00eatre vrai du pouvoir reconn\u00f9 \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine d'annuler (quash) son propre writ, ne s'applique pas au bref d'habeas corpus \u00e9mis par un juge de cette cour dans l'exercice de sa juridiction en cette mati\u00e8re. Sa juridiction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est concurrente avec celle des cours provinciales et de leurs juges. Il la poss\u00e8de toute enti\u00e8re lorsqu'il l'exerce seul, et elle est aussi \u00e9tendue et compl\u00e8te dans sa personne que lorsqu'elle est exerc\u00e9e par une de ces cours ou un de leurs juges. Ses d\u00e9cisions ne sont nullement sujettes au contr\u00f4le et \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de la cour dont il fait partie pas plus que celles des juges des cours provinciales. Bien que la pretention contraire ait \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9e par les savants conseils de la couronne, ils n'ont pu l'\u00e9tablir par aucune d\u00e9cision judiciaire ni par aucun texte de loi. La decision cit\u00e9e Queen vs. Crawford,[83] sur laquelle ils ont fortement insist\u00e9 comme \u00e9tablissant leur proposition, prouve pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment tout le contraire de leur avanc\u00e9. Car dans cette affaire, l'ordre du juge avait fait le bref rapportable devant la cour, de sorte qu'elle exer\u00e7ait ses pouvoirs en premi\u00e8re instance et non comme tribunal de r\u00e9vision. La d\u00e9cision d'un juge ordonnant l'\u00e9mission du bref et la mise en libert\u00e9 d'un prisonnier est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme finale, du moins le contraire n'a pu \u00eatre \u00e9tabli.\nLe pouvoir donn\u00e9 au juge de la Cour Supr\u00eame au sujet de l'habeas corpus est en ces termes\n\" For the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment, in any criminal case under any act of Parliament of Canada.\" Ces termes ont, dit-on, l'effet de restreindre le pouvoir du juge \u00e0 la cat\u00e9gorie des cas designes par ces expressions. En cons\u00e9quence un habeas corpus demand\u00e9 en vertu de la loi commune ne pourrait pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9. parce que, pour le Canada (Dominion), il n'existe pas de loi commune. Toutefois cette interpr\u00e9tation me para\u00eet fort douteuse, parce que la premi\u00e8re partie de la clause assimile le pouvoir des juges de la Cour Supr\u00eame \u00e0 ceux des cours provinciales et de leurs juges. Malgr\u00e9 cela, je ne crois pas que pour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause il soit n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question, car cette cause est \u00e9videmment r\u00e9gie par les statuts du Canada. Mais une demande d'habeas corpus qui serait fond\u00e9e sur un commitment pour infraction \u00e0 quelque loi provincial serait sans donte refus\u00e9e parce qu'elle ne tomberait pas dans la cat\u00e9gorie d\u00e9sign\u00e9e. C'est \u00e0 cela seulement, dans mon opinion, que se borne la restriction impos\u00e9e par le statut\nLes savants conseils de la Couronne ont pr\u00e9tendu que la condamn\u00e9 n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable sur un indictement pour violation d'un statut du Canada, l'honorable juge Henry n'avait en consequ\u00e9nce aucune juridiction ; mais la section 51 ne lui donne-t\u00adelle pas clairement le pouvoir de s'enqu\u00e9rir des causes du commitment en vertu des statuts du Canada ?\nLes mots \" dans une cause criminelle \" que l'on trouve dans cette phrase n'y sont sans doute ins\u00e9r\u00e9s que pour exclure I'habeas corpus en mati\u00e8re civile. Le mot case, n'est pas mis l\u00e0 pour signifier offense ou crime ; cette phrase ne veut pas dire que l'offense ou le crime doit etre d\u00e9fini par une loi du Canada, comme on le pr\u00e9tend, pour qu'il y ait juridiction ; elle dit au contraire qu'il suffit que le commitment soit en vertu d'un acte du parlement du Canada pour qu'il y ait lieu d'exercer la juridiction ; pourvu que ce soit dans une cause criminelle. Cela me para\u00eet d'autant plus certain que le juge n'a que le pouvoir de s'enqu\u00e9rir de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du commitment et qu'il n'a pas le droit de faire le process du p\u00e9titionnaire dans un habeas corpus, pour le crime ou l'offense qui a amen\u00e9 son incarc\u00e9ration. Evidemment cette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite d'apr\u00e8s les statuts du Canada.\nL'indictement port\u00e9 contre le condamn\u00e9 est dans les termes du statut 32\u201433 Vict, ch. 29, ainsi qu'il suit :\nBritish Columbia.\nTo wit :\nThe Jurors for Our Lady the Queen upon their oath present that Robert E. Sproule on the first day of June in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five feloniously wilfully and of his malice aforethought did kill and murder one Thomas Hammill against the peace of Our Lady the Queen, her Crown and dignity.\nLes seules differences entre cette forme et celle donn\u00e9e par le statut, sont 1\u00b0 qu'on a ajout\u00e9 les mots \" contre la paix de Notre Souveraine Dame la Reine, sa couronne et sa dignit\u00e9,\" qui ne se trouvent pas dans celle du statut ; la deuxi\u00e8me, qui est plus grave, est qu'on a omis d'indiquer le comt\u00e9, ou le district o\u00f9 l'offense a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. Quoiqu'il soit encore d'usage, de conclure les indictements d'apr\u00e8s la loi commune par les mots \" contre la paix de Notre Souveraine Dame la Reine, sa couronne et sa dignite,\" et de conclure les indictements pour offenses contre les statuts par la formule \" contre la forme du statut en tel cas fait et pourvu et contre la paix de Notre Souveraine Dame la Reine, sa couronne et sa dignit\u00e9,\" cela n'est cependant pas reconnu n\u00e9cessaire depuis la passation du statut 14 et 15 Vict. ch. 100 sec. 24. L'addition des mots \" contre la paix,\" etc., n'indique pas une intention de proc\u00e9der conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi commune puisque la forme de l'indictement est celle donn\u00e9e par le statut en vertu de la section 27 du ch. 29, 32-33 Vict.\nLe changement de venue, qui est un des principaux moyens sur lesquels s'est appuy\u00e9 l'honorable juge pour accorder 1'habeas corpus, a eu lieu en vertu du m\u00eame statut, sec 11, comme le fait voir le record de la cour Supr\u00eame de la Colombie. Ce n'est qu'en vertu de cette section que la cour si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Victoria a pu acqu\u00e9rir juridiction pour faire le proc\u00e8s du condamn\u00e9, qui sans cela e\u00fbt d\u00fb le subir dans le District de Kootenay o\u00f9 l'offense a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise. C'est uniquement en vertu de ce statut que la cour a pu acqu\u00e9rir la juridiction n\u00e9cessaire pour faire le proc\u00e8s du condamn\u00e9.\nLe ch\u00e2timent inflig\u00e9 par les sec. 1 et 2, de la 32-33 Vic. ch. 20, est celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 contre le condamn\u00e9. Comment peut-on dire apr\u00e8s cela que cette cause n'est pas \" criminal case under an Act of Parliament of Canada \" quand tout le proc\u00e8s a eu lieu en vertu du c. 29, de 32-33 Vic ?\nL'honorable juge avait certainement le droit de s'enqu\u00e9rir si le condamn\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu en vertu d'un ordre l\u00e9gal d'une cour comp\u00e9tente. Il n'a en cela assum\u00e9 aucune juridiction, mais n'a fait qu'exercer celle que lui conf\u00e8re le statut. Je n'examinerai pas le m\u00e9rite des questions qu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par ses deux ordres, car je suis persuad\u00e9 que je n'ai aucun droit de si\u00e9ger en r\u00e9vision ou en appel de ces ordres. Il est vrai que par ses jugements, l'honorable juge se trouve avoir pratiquemment renvers\u00e9 la sentence prononc\u00e9e contre le condamn\u00e9, ainsi que le jugement de la cour d'erreur conf\u00e9rmant unanimement cette sentence. Cette cons\u00e9quence, quoi que grave, n'est pas comme on l'a repres\u00e9ntee, une anomalie qui renverserait l'ordre judiciaire, si cette cour ne mettait pas \u00e0 n\u00e9ant les ordres de l'honorable juge. Ce serait suivant moi une bien plus grande anomalie et un danger beaucoup plus grand, si dans une cause o\u00f9 un malheureux lutte pour sauver sa vie on voyait une cour exercer une juridiction qui ne lui appartient pas.\nLe jugement de l'honorable juge Henry doit subsister tant qu'il n'aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par une cour comp\u00e9tente, et celle-ci suivant moi ne l'est pas, comme je crois l'avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9. Si cette cour n'a pas le pouvoir d'intervenir, il y en a une autre qui a une juridiction incontestable dans cette affaire, c'est le Conseil priv\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9. C'est l\u00e0 qu'on eut d\u00fb s'adresser de suite au lieu de venir devant une cour dont les avocats de la couronne eux-m\u00eame ont contest\u00e9 la juridiction. Chose extraordinaire, tout en nous demandant d'annuler les ordres en question, les savants conseils de la couronne ont en m\u00eame temps essay\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que la clause 51 \u00e9tait inconstitutionnelle ; mais cette pr\u00e9tention n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux \u00e9tablie que celle du droit de la cour de si\u00e9ger en appel des ordres en question.\nJe ne crois pas devoir entrer dans l'examen de la question de constitutionalit\u00e9 de la section 51 ; car la Cour Supr\u00eame a plusieurs fois d\u00e9j\u00e0 exprim\u00e9 l'opinion qu'elle ne d\u00e9ciderait pas des questions de ce genre, si le litige pouvait \u00eatre jug\u00e9 sans cela. Comme je suis d'opinion que la cour n'a aucun droit de reviser les jugements de l'honorable juge Henry, je m'abstiendrai pour cette raison de consid\u00e9rer la question de constitutionalit\u00e9.\nJ'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer que les savants conseils de la couronne n'ont pu \u00e9tablir la proposition que la mise en libert\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e par un juge sur habeas corpus est sujette \u00e0 un appel \u00e0 la cour dont ce juge forme partie. Il s'en suit que les ordres en question doivent subsister tant qu'ils n'auront pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par une cour comp\u00e9tente. Il en est de m\u00eame en mati\u00e8re civile, et le principe doit, je crois, \u00eatre observ\u00e9 pour les ordres sur habeas corpus comme il l'est dans les causes civiles. Je citerai \u00e0 l'appui de cette proposition une cause civile dans laquelle ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenu par l'opinion de juges \u00e9minents. Ex parte Bryant, in re Padstow, Total Loss and Collision. Ass. Co.[84].\nIf a court in assumed exercise of a jurisdiction belonging to it makes an order which, under the particular circumstances of the case, is beyond that jurisdiction, the order must, until it be discharged, be treated as a subsisting order, and can only be discharged upon an appeal.\nLe juge Brett fait \u00e0 ce sujet les observations suivantes qui sont parfaitement applicables \u00e0 cette cause.[85]\nThat order was the order of a superior court which superior court has jurisdiction, under a certain given state of fact, to make a winding up order, and if there has been a mistake made in the particular case, and not the assumption of a jurisdiction which the court has not, I should be inclined to say that this order could never have been treated, as long as it existed, either by the court that made it or by any other court, as a nullity, and that the only way of getting rid of it was by appeal. The case, therefore, is one of appeal, rather than of jurisdiction. It is an erroneous judgment if erroneous at all.\"\nD'apr\u00e8s cette autorit\u00e9, si l'honorable juge Henry a fait une erreur en ordonnant la mise en libert\u00e9 du condamn\u00e9, en exer\u00e7ant une juridiction qui lui appartenait clairement \u2014celle de s'enqu\u00e9rir des causes du commitment\u2014pourvu qu'il n'ait pas assum\u00e9 une juridiction qui ne lui appartenait pas, son ordre ne peut \u00eatre traite comme une nullit\u00e9 absolue, ni par lui-meme ni par aucune autre cour L'appel priv\u00e9 est le seul moyen de faire annuler cet ordre. Jessell, M. R, a exprim\u00e9 la m\u00eame opinion dans cette cause[86].\nAssuming for the present that the association was an unlawful one, and that the court had no jurisdiction to make the order, is the proper mode of getting rid of that order to appeal against it ? I think it is. I think an order by a Court of competent jurisdiction, which has authority to decide as to its own competency when that order is made, must be taken to be a decision by the Court that it has jurisdiction to make the order, and consequently you may appeal from it on the ground that there is error in the order, the Court having in fact no jurisdiction to make it.\nCes autorit\u00e9 me confirment dans l'opinion que les ordres de l'honorable juge Henry doivent subsister jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9s sur un appel \u00e0 une cour compet\u00e9nte. Celle qui a ce pouvoir est l'honorable Conseil priv\u00e9 de Sa Majest\u00e9 et non la cour Supr\u00eame qui n'a aucune juridiction dans le cas actuel. La motion devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nHENRY J.\u2014This matter came before the court in special session convened by our learned Chief Justice on an application made by the attorney general of British Columbia to consider a motion to be made on the part of the Crown to quash a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, directed to the sheriff of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to bring before me the body of the prisoner with the cause of his detention, and, also, to set aside an order by me for his discharge subsequently made.\nI think it very doubtful if the learned Chief Justice had any jurisdiction to convene the court, as the power to call a special session of this court is, I think, only for the purpose of exercising jurisdiction as prescribed by the Act. When the matter came before me under the alternative order nisi made by me, I arrived at the conclusion that on two grounds there was an absence of jurisdiction in the tribunal by which the prisoner was tried, and that he was therefore entitled to be discharged. I adopted one of two alternative means that I considered available for that purpose and caused a writ of habeas corpus to be issued to bring the prisoner before me. This not having been obeyed for several weeks or, in my opinion, properly returned, I made the order for the discharge of the prisoner which is now sought to be set aside.\nA copy of the record was annexed to the affidavits read on behalf of the prisoner when the original order was applied for, and an authenticated copy of it was returned by the sheriff in whose custody the prisoner then was, and still is. By the record so produced it was shown that the trial of the prisoner was conducted by one of the learned judges of the Court of Queen's Bench of British Columbia, authorized, as it appeared by the record, only by a commission of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery issued by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, and it appeared also by affidavits, uncontradicted, that the order for the change of venue set out in the record was made after the trial and conviction of the prisoner. In my judgment on the hearing for the reasons given in it, I stated that, in my opinion, there was no jurisdiction to try the prisoner at Victoria, and that the Lieutenant Governor had not the right to issue such a commission.\nIt is contended that under the circumstances as shown by the record I had no jurisdiction to make the original order or the subsequent one, or to allow the issue of the writ. If I was wrong as to all, another important question necessarily arises : Has this court the power to deal at all with the subject matter ? It is not contended that the court has any appellate jurisdiction, but it is contended that inasmuch as the writ was technically that of the court, the court therefore can quash it as improvident on the ground of my want of jurisdiction. On the argument of the first order before me my jurisdiction to deal with the subject-matter was referred to on behalf of the crown, but was not in fact objected to, and no question as to it was taken or argued, but the whole argument took place on the objections raised to the jurisdiction of the court before which the prisoner was tried and convicted. The case then before me was argued for two days and determined upon points which did not involve a question as to my jurisdiction, and is it not now too late to question it ? It is, however, now contended on the part of the crown that the court has the right to quash the writ as having been improvidently issued because of the want of jurisdiction on my part.\nIt should not be forgotten that the matter was before me under the first order, and that had I then made an order for the discharge, as by the practice of the Queen's Bench, in England, I might have done, no one has so far said that this court has any jurisdiction to question the validity of it, but it is claimed that as the writ of habeas corpus intervened the court has the right not only to deal with that but also the final order for the discharge of the prisoner. I am quite ready to admit that if the last mentioned order was founded on the writ, and that the writ was necessary to sustain the order, the latter must fail if its source fails, but here the order was quite independent of the writ, and if valid, cannot be affected by any jurisdiction this court might undertake to assert as to the writ. To affect the final order for discharge, the mere assumption of power to deal with the writ does not, in my opinion, confer authority to deal with the order. I have searched in vain to find a case or authority that will sustain the proposition that where a judge has a general authority to issue a writ of habeas corpus, and having considered and dealt with the question of the commitment and detention of a prisoner, the court has quashed the writ as improvident. Crawford's Case[87] has been referred to but in that case the habeas corpus required the prisoner to be brought before the court and cause to be shown before it. In that case the prisoner was committed by the Court of Chancery, in the Isle of Mann, for contempt, and the court held the committal valid, and being so the cause shown was therefore sufficient, Erle J. said :\nTaking this, then, as an ordinary case of an application for a habeas corpus, we are to see whether there has been a lawful order of a competent tribunal. I may say that when considering the matter of cause shown against my first order, I felt it to be my duty to see whether there has been \" a lawful order of a competent tribunal.\" In Crawford's Case the court had in itself original jurisdiction and also by the writ. This court has no original jurisdiction and the writ, if it had commanded the prisoner to be brought before it, would have been void.\nThe right to legislate in respect of this court is given to the Parliament of Canada by section 101 of the British North America Act, 1867 :\u2014\nThe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in the Act, from time to time provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general court of appeal for Canada and for the establishment of any additional court for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nThe Supreme and Exchequer Court Act of Canada, 1875, section 15, provides that :\nThe Supreme Court shall have, hold and exercise an appellate, civil and criminal jurisdiction within and without the Dominion of Canada.\nSec. 23 provides :\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus not arising out of a criminal charge. * * *\nSec. 51:\nAny judge of the Supreme Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any act of the Parliament of Canada. * * * And if the judge shall refuse the writ or remand the prisoner, an appeal shall lie to the court.\nBy the latter section the appeal is only given to the prisoner, and by the 23rd section an appeal in a matter arising out of a criminal charge is excepted. Considering together those two sections the conclusion is irresistible that there is no appeal on the part of th? crown in a criminal case, and still an opposite opinion has been expressed. It will be seen that the jurisdic- tion given by section 51 to the individual judges of this court is concurrent, not only with the jurisdiction of the individual judges of the several provinces, but concurrent with the jurisdiction of the courts. If the judge has the jurisdiction of the courts in the several provinces, why should he not have power to issue an attachment for contempt. I conclude therefore that the jurisdiction of a judge of this court is wholly unconnected with his position as a member of the appeal court of the Dominion. It is a jurisdiction given to the judge to be exercised as in a matter wholly unconnected with the functions of the appeal court. To the judge who acts in a habeas corpus case is given a jurisdiction which gives him the power of a court in any of the provinces, and unless an appeal is specially provided for to this court I fail to see how it can interfere with the judicial acts of the judge, any more than it could with the decision of one of the courts in the provinces. Our statutes provide that the cases of contested elections shall be tried by a judge of one of the superior courts in the provinces. The writ under the seal of the court is issued. There is no appeal to the court of which the judge is a member, but to this court. Suppose in a case decided by the judge, the court of which he was a member was moved to quash the writ and reverse the judgment given by him, could it be successfully contended that the court would have power to do so ? The judge is authorized to use the process of the court in the exercise of a special jurisdiction. The writ was tested in the usual way and has the seal of the court affixed to it, but it is in connection with a matter beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The court as such has no jurisdiction and none is given by statute. How, then, can the mere use of the writ give any jurisdiction to the court to reverse what the judge may decree ? It is a writ giving a jurisdiction to a judge that the court as such could not exercise. The court has not the power to order the issue of the writ or prevent its issue. The law gives the judge the whole jurisdiction and enables him and him only to deal with it. In Valin v. Langlois[88] the Privy Council held that :\nThe Parliament of the Dominion of Canada has power to impose new duties upon existing provincial courts, and give them power as to matters coming within the classes of subjects over which the Dominion Parliament has jurisdiction.\nIn addition to the appellate jurisdiction of the court, the statute provides that any one of the judges may use Her Majesty's writ of habeas corpus when in his judgment\u2014not that of the court\u2014a proper occasion is presented. It is true, the writ in this case is issued as the writ of the court and bearing its seal, but it was so issued on my part and specially allowed by and signed by me. The statute gave me the right to do that which the court could not do or prevent, and whence then comes the right of the court to say that I exceeded my jurisdiction ? It may have been wrong for me to issue the writ, but in doing so I respectfully submit that the court has not the right to say so or to reverse my judgment. It has been excitedly said that it would be monstrous that one judge, by means of a habeas corpus, should control the final decision of a capital case by a court. The consequences, we were told, would be most serious. My answer to that is that if the power exists in regard to the jurisdiction to make use of the writ of habeas corpus, to inquire into the existence of jurisdiction, to try and convict a prisoner, it has existed for centuries in England and for a great many years in the United States of America, and we have yet to hear a reason to induce the conclusion that the power is a dangerous one. We have to assume that, when Parliament intrusted the exercise of the power of dealing with cases of habeas corpus to the judges of the highest court in the Dominion, it was not ignorant of the power of the courts and judges in England and in this country, and fully expected that the judges of this court would deal as properly with such cases as, at all events, the judges of subordinate courts. If, however, I, or any of my learned colleagues, should happen to err in any case we cannot found the jurisdiction of this court upon the regrets or fears of some of its members. In a case of doubtful jurisdiction, in the humanity of the law, it might be by some, and I trust the larger number, considered better that the jurisdiction should be assumed than that a life of a human being should be sacrificed when there was no doubt in the mind of the judge that he had been illegally convicted. Better than, I think, for this court to assume a jurisdiction to prevent that being done. I don't, however, intend to convey the impression that I felt any doubt of my jurisdiction over the subject matter or of the conclusions at which I arrived. It was established satisfactorily before me, and admitted by the counsel for the Crown, that the order for the change of venue set out in the record was not made until after the trial and conviction of the prisoner, and that the learned judge, who presided at the trial, had so presided solely by the authority of a commission from the Lieutenant Governor. Since the argument before me a proclamation to bring into operation a statute of British Columbia dispensing with the necessity for commissions of oyer and terminer and general gaol delivery by which the statute was in force, at and before the trial of the prisoner, has been brought to our notice. Had it been notified to me I would then have had to consider the question of the right of the legislature of British Columbia to pass such an act since the incorporation of that Province as a part of Canada, affecting as it did, a prerogative right of the crown. If it had not then the case was not altered. The question of jurisdiction to pass that statute would admit of an important and exhaustive argument. That argument must have been had before me and should I have, improperly even, decided that the act was ultra vires, and that a majority of this court should think that my decision was wrong, would that be sufficient to authorize the court to assume jurisdiction and to decide that because of an error of judgment on my part I had improperly exercised jurisdiction ? In a case of habeas corpus before the court in British Columbia, referred to in my first judgment, the Chief Justice of that court decided that the act was ultra vires. I must contend that if it was at all a question legitimately before me for decision the writ cannot be dealt with at all, much less quashed by this court. On the face of the return the defect of jurisdiction appeared and how can the question of my jurisdiction be affected when exercised in May last by something now for the first time shown. The court should now say to the crown \" according to the showing before the judge he had \" jurisdiction when he decided the case and his decision \" cannot be affected by new matters shown before this \" court.\" I differ then with the conclusion of one or more of my learned colleagues, when assuming the right of this court to decide as to my jurisdiction to issue the writ, upon evidence for the first time given at the present argument. The question as to my jurisdiction, as far as that question affects our decision, must, I submit, be determined on the facts and evidence before me, and not upon any new facts shown. Were it a case of appeal with permission to adduce further evidence the case would be very different. The affidavit upon which the motion before us was made show the fact of the introduction of the further evidence in question.\nIt has been asserted that a judge of this court has no more power in a habeas corpus case than a judge of a provincial court, and that as the last named court has jurisdiction to deal with its own writ, this court has the same power. To that I answer, first, that under the provisions of the statute a judge of this court has the full power of a provincial court, and the two cases are not in that respect parallel ; and, secondly, that a provincial court has original jurisdiction over the subject-matter which this court has not. We are told again that the statute is ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament\u2014if it be so, it must be so pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the mere fact of its being so cannot give power to any court otherwise without jurisdiction to so declare it\u2014and how can a mere court of appeal, constituted as this court is, go out of and beyond the jurisdiction prescribed by the statutes creating it.\nAgain it is said that the power given to a judge of this court being limited to \" an inquiry into the cause \" of commitment in any criminal case under any act of \" the Parliament of Canada,\" I had no jurisdiction. This provision may read two ways, that is, it may have been meant to apply to the commitment only in a criminal case\u2014the commitment being \" under any act of the Parliament of Canada,\" or it may also be construed to apply only to cases where the offence was created by an act of the Parliament of Canada. The latter construction has been asserted to be the correct one, but I cannot so read the provision. The true grammatical, and, as I think, the sensible and proper construction is, that it applies solely to the commitment under an act\u2014the inquiry is to be in reference to the commitment, and the true construction, I think, may by a slight change in the position of the words be given thus, \" for the purpose of an inquiry, in any criminal case, into the cause of commitment under any act of the Parliament of Canada,\" or the provision may be construed by reading the words \" in any criminal case \" as if found at the end of the provision. The inquiry is certainly to be as to the commitment, and I think the words \" in any criminal case \" were inserted to limit it to criminal cases as distinguished from civil. I am the more ready to adopt that construction, not being able to find or imagine any reason for attributing to Parliament the intention to limit the jurisdiction of a judge of this court, as the construction contended for would do, when the jurisdiction of the judges of the provincial courts is not so limited. No such reason has been advanced and I do not think any can be found, more especially when we reflect that the power otherwise given to a judge of this court transcends that of the judges of the provincial courts. That the commitment of the prisoner was under the acts of the Parliament of Canada will scarcely be denied, and it has not been. The arrest and commitment of persons charged with crime are provided for by statute, as well as the venue and all proceedings on indictments. The form of the indictment is given, and sec. 27 of cap. 27, 32 and 33 Vic. provides for the sufficiency of indictments, when according to the form given in the schedule to the act. Admitting, however, that my construction when dealing with the case was wrong, how can my judgment be reversed by any court not having original or other jurisdiction, or the writ issued by me quashed by any such court ? The fearful consequences that we have been told likely to arise from the exercise of the jurisdiction by judges, such as has been done by me in this case, if not prevented, has been alleged as a reason why this court should interpose, and not only should interpose but give it authority to do so, if none previously existed. I cannot subscribe to any such doctrine. If the administration of the law is defective it is for the legislature, who imposed the duties on judges of this court and gave them jurisdiction, to interpose. I am of the opinion that it is the duty of the court to declare the law such as it is. If it be defective we may sincerely regret it, but because we do so we cannot alter it whatever the results may be. I know of no jurisdiction that can be assumed under any circumstances from what has been called a necessity arising in the minds of those using it for what they may deem the proper decision of any case civil or criminal. This court is the creature of legislative enactments giving it a limited jurisdiction, and specially providing for the cases over which jurisdiction is given to it, and it cannot go beyond it. We must assume that the parliament when giving power in habeas corpus cases to the judges of this court, was of the opinion that they might possibly exercise the jurisdiction properly, and therefore, not only did not provide for an appeal on the part of the Crown, but expressly provided against any. For this court to assume jurisdiction in any way is, in my opinion, going in the face of the statute. Besides, parliament in its wisdom, by an amendment to the act, withdrew from the court the original and appellate jurisdiction conferred upon it and the judges in habeas corpus cases in matters arising out of any claim for extradition, but in doing so did not change or limit the powers of the judges in other matters. In reference then to the claim to exercise jurisdiction by this court from necessity, I may remind those who make that claim that the decision of the judge is not final, but may be controlled by Her Majesty the Queen by judgment of Her Privy Council.\nAs touching the right of this court to interfere in this case by a summary proceeding to set aside my orders I will refer to the case in re the Padstow Total Loss and Collision Association (Limited) ex parte Bryant[89]. The court in that case decided on an appeal to discharge an order for winding up the association made by Malins V. C., 1880, that :\nIf a court acting in assumed jurisdiction belonging to it makes an order which, under the particular circumstances of the case, is beyond that jurisdiction, the order must, until it be discharged, be treated as a subsisting order and can only be discharged upon an appeal.\nIn that case Jessel M.R. said :\nAssuming for the present that the association was an unlawful one and that the court has no jurisdiction to make the order, is the proper mode of getting rid of that order to appeal against it ? I think it is. I think an order by a court of competent jurisdiction, which has authority to decide as to its own competency when that order was made must be taken to be a decision by the court that it had jurisdiction to make the order and consequently you may appeal from it on the ground that there is error in the order, the court having in fact no jurisdiction to make it.\nBrett L.J. said :\nThat order was the order of a superior court, which superior court has jurisdiction, under a given state of facts, to make a winding up order ; and if there has been a mistake made in the particular case and not in the assumption of a jurisdiction which the court had not, I should be inclined to say that the order could never have been treated, as long as it existed either by the court that made it or by any other court, as a nullity, and that the only way of getting rid of it was by appeal. The case, therefore is one of appeal rather than jurisdiction. It is an erroneous judgment, if erroneous at all.\nIn the case now under consideration, I, as one of the judges of the highest court in the Dominion, was clothed with the jurisdiction in cases of habeas corpus, possessed not only by the judges individually, but of the courts in several provinces. I had therefore a general power to deal with all cases in which application was made to me to inquire into the commitment of prisoners and my first inquiry would be as to my jurisdiction. If I found I had none I would refuse the writ or an order to show cause why the prisoner should not be discharged. If, on the contrary, I decided in favor of my jurisdiction the prisoner would obtain by the proper legal means the benefit of that decision. If I improperly refused to issue the writ or to discharge the prisoner the statute provided for an appeal by the prisoner to this court. Was not, therefore, the position I occupied precisely similar to that of the court in the case just referred to, in which it was expressly decided that the order could not be treated as a nullity either by the court that made it or any other court, and that the only way to get rid of it was by appeal ? I can discover no distinction between that case and this one, nor do I think that any can be found by any one else who has a sound legal mind and judgment. If such a doctrine be sound as respects a court of unquestioned jurisdiction over the subject-matter, it cannot be unsound as respects a court which has it not. I don't wish it to be thought by any one that I have any objection to a controlling power in this court in cases like the present, but I have felt under the obligation of ascertaining and deciding upon the contention that it has. I have endeavored, and I trust successfully, to consider the matter before us in the same way I would have considered it my duty to do had the circumstances arisen before any other judge of this court, and in that spirit have arrived at the conclusion that this cour thas not, and was not intended by Parliament to have, any such right or power as that contended for, and cannot aid those who are ready to assume a jurisdiction that does not exist, unless, indeed, revealed by some mysterious nebulous agency invisible to the eyes of ordinary mortals.\nFor my reasons as to other points taken and debated during the argument I must refer to my two previous judgments in this case.\nThe argument before the court in this case took place in the absence of the prisoner. He was served with a notice to show cause why the writ should not be quashed and my order for his discharge set aside. He had the decision of a judge of this court that he was entitled to his discharge and an order to give effect to it. The crown seeks, while he is confined in gaol at Victoria, to quash the writ of habeas corpus and set aside the order, which if valid, which I claim it to have been till legally set aside, entitled him to his discharge. He is required by the notice to show cause when it is physically impossible for him to do in his own proper person. If a prisoner so confined is in poverty and unable to employ counsel the question of his life or death must be considered and determined ex parte. If the same motion was made without notice to the prisoner I should think no court would hear it, and is it not substantially the same thing and the giving of the notice a mere form if the prisoner cannot do what the notice is intended to prepare him for doing ? I think every principle of justice that requires that every one shall be heard when his rights civil or criminal are to be effected should govern in such cases. His counsel objected to appeal until the court decided upon the objection raised as to the absence of the prisoner. It was subsequently arranged that the argument should proceed subject to the objection to be dealt with by the court. In answer to the objection the want of jurisdiction of the court to issue a writ of habeas corpus is suggested and the want of that jurisdiction is another reason why the court should not take upon itself the right to entertain the motion made. I think that under no circumstances should such a motion be entertained in the absence of the prisoner, unless by his own consent. For the reasons I have now given and those to be found in my previous judgments, before referred to, I am of opinion the motion should be refused. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014On the constitutionality of section 51 of the Supreme Court Act, which confers on the judges of this court the power to issue writs of habeas corpus, I have always entertained grave doubts. I will refrain, however, from determining this question in the present case, as, in the view I take of it, the writ now under our consideration cannot be held to have issued under that section of the Act. This said section enacts that any judge of this court has concurrent jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus, for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of commitment, in any criminal case under any act of the Parliament of Canada. Now, murder is not a crime nor a criminal case, under or in virtue of any act of the Parliament of Canada. It is clear that parliament did not intend to confer on the judges of this court power to issue the writ of habeas corpus in all criminal cases whatsoever, otherwise they would not have added the words \" under any act of the Parliament of Canada.\" These words constitute a restriction, a limitation of the right to issue the writ, which we cannot overlook without grasping at a jurisdiction not intended to be conferred by the statute. It has been argued that because the proceedings in all criminal cases are taken under the Procedure Act of 1869, this makes any criminal case, according to the terms of this section 51, a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament of Canada, but this contention, it seems to me, is against the very words of the section The procedure in all criminal cases must be under the Procedure Act of 1869, so that the words \" under any act of the Parliament of Canada,\" would be a surplusage and would have no meaning, if they were so interpreted. This interpretation would strike out these words, and this cannot be done. It would be legislation under the guise of interpretation. Then, how can murder be said to be a criminal case under the Procedure Act of 1869 ? We say a crime or a criminal case, for instance, under the Forgery Act, or under the Malicious Injuries to Property Act, or the Larceny Act, or a crime or a criminal case under the common law, but how can it be said that murder is a crime, or that the trial for murder is a criminal case under the Procedure Act of 1869 ? Neither can it be contended, as has been attempted, that if a prisoner is committed by a magistrate, under 32 and 33 Vic. ch. 30 (D), this constitutes a case which under this section 51 gives us the right to issue a writ of habeas corpus. This would be reading the section as saying \" into the cause of commitment under any act of the Parliament of Canada,\" omitting the words \" in any criminal case,\" or it would be contending that murder is a criminal case under the act respecting Justices of the Peace as regards indictable offences.\nWe must consequently hold that the writ in this case did not issue under this section 51 of the Supreme Court Act. There was then under that Act no power, no jurisdiction whatever, to issue it. The judges of this court, and this court itself, have no other powers than those expressly conferred upon them by the statute. Their powers are exclusively statutory, and that this court is constituted a court of common law and equity must, in conjunction with the British North America Act, be held to apply only to the appellate jurisdiction of the court, not to any original jurisdiction which parliament did not, and could not, confer upon it. It has been contended that this section 51 should be interpreted as constituting each of the judges a separate court, established with original jurisdiction in virtue of section 101 of the British North America Act for the better administration of the laws of Canada, or in other words that six courts have been so established. This contention seems to me untenable. By its very first section only two courts are established by the act, \" The Supreme Court and the Exchequer Court,\" not eight as this proposition would assert.\nIt being clear then that the writ of this court has been issued without authority, it must necessarily follow that we have jurisdiction to quash it. It would be an extraordinary state of things if this court had not the power of supervision over its own writs. It is not a case of appeal. Where, as here, a judge having a limited jurisdiction exercises a jurisdiction which does not belong to him, his decision, or his acts, amount to nothing and do not create any necessity for an appeal. Attorney General v. Hotham[90]. A proceeding so taken is a complete nullity, a nullity of non esse. As we say in civil law, defectus potestatis nullitas nullitatum, and a writ so issued without jurisdiction should not be obeyed.\nOn the merits of the case I have very little to add to what has been said by his Lordship the Chief Justice, with whom I entirely concur on all points. First, as to the presence of the prisoner. In the view I take of the case it is evident that we would have no jurisdiction to order the prisoner to be brought here. To do so would be in direct contravention of the principle I hold to rule the case. As to the injustice and hardship that the absence of a prisoner, as it has been argued, might entail in such cases, we must take it for granted that each court, in each particular case, will always see that a prisoner suffers no injustice. Then it must be borne in mind that on criminal appeals to the Privy Council the prisoner is never present. On criminal appeals before the Court of Crown cases reserved, likewise, the prisoner is never present. And the court hears the case whether the prisoner is defended by counsel or not. Reg. v. Child (2)[91] ; Reg. v. Daynes [92] ; Reg. v. Reeve [93] ; Reg. v. Rendall [94] ; Reg. v. Farrell[95] ; Reg. v. Greathead [96] ; Reg. v. Brown[97].\nIn this court also the presence of the prisoner has never been required in criminal appeals. Laliberte v. The Queen [98] ; Reg. v. Cunningham[99].\nOn the question of the change of venue the record shows a perfectly valid and legal order. That this record could be contradicted by affidavits is to me an untenable proposition. The records of a court are of such high and supereminent authority that, as I read in 4 Stephen's Comm. 260, their truth is not to be called into question. For it is a settled maxim that nothing shall be averred against a record, nor shall any plea or even proof be admitted to the contrary. I refer also to Hawkin's Pleas of the Crown [100] and Rex. v. Carlile[101], and to Chief Justice Wilson's remarks and cases cited in re McKinnon[102].\nThen if the plea of not guilty puts the order in question for a change of venue in issue, as a matter of fact, the verdict of the jury is conclusive, and the order must be taken as having been duly proved. If not guilty did not put it in issue, the question, in the absence of a plea to the jurisdiction, is at an end. For the jurisdiction in question here, it must not be lost sight of, is a jurisdiction ratione personae only, not ratione materiae. The court at Victoria had, in law, jurisdiction, not only to try the crimes committed within its district, but also all those the trial of which, under sec. 11 of the Procedure Act, had been transferred to it from any other part of British Columbia. To say that a prisoner cannot confer jurisdiction on a Court is true, when the court is incompetent ratione materiae, but is not true when the incompetency is ratione personae. The prisoner, for instance, can himself ask the change of venue, and then surely he submits to another jurisdiction than his own. In fact, in the present case, all the objections taken hereby the prisoner as to the jurisdiction would be open to him, if he is right in his contentions, even if the order changing the venue to Victoria had been made at his own request and upon his own application.\nThere are, besides, many other cases which the court of Victoria has jurisdiction to try though the offence has been committed outside its territorial jurisdiction. I allude to those crimes which can by statute be tried at any place where the prisoner is apprehended or in custody, as forgery, bigamy, perjury and various others. Rex v. James [103] ; Reg. v. Smythies [104] Reg. v. Whiley[105].\nThis section 11 of our Procedure Act is a new enactment, so that no English cases absolutely in point can be found. But its terms are so clear that there can be no difficulty in working it. Paragraph two thereof enacts in so many words that upon the order for the change of venue being made all proceedings in the case shall be had in the district where the venue has been transferred as \" if the case had arisen or the offence been committed therein.\" These words alone settle the question raised by the prisoner.\nI observe that, by the Act 37 Vic. ch. 42 sec. 5, it is enacted that the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and any court thereafter to be constituted by the legislature of the said province and having the powers now exercised by the said court, shall have power to hear, try and determine, all treasons, felonies and indictable offences whatsoever mentioned in any of the said acts (the Criminal Acts of 1869) which may be committed in any part of the said province.\nHowever, as this clause has not been mentioned before us I refrain from inquiring here how far it affects or applies to this case.\nComing to another point, I hold that it was a sufficient answer to the rule to show cause, and, a fortiori, a sufficient return to this writ that the prisoner was in custody under the sentence of the court of oyer and terminer. Bethel's case [106] ; Gosset v. Howard [107] ; re Suddis [108] ; Eight Report Criminal Law Commissioners[109]. A contrary doctrine would entitle every convict in any of our penitentiaries to be brought to Ottawa on an affidavit that the court which tried him had no jurisdiction[110]. The court of oyer and terminer of Victoria was the court competent, in this case, not only to try the prisoner but also to determine its own jurisdiction and power to try him. It determined it by assuming it. If it erred the only remedy the prisoner had, after moving in arrest of judgment if he chose to do so, there being no court of Crown cases reserved, was a writ of error. Rex v. Seton [111] ; Rex v. Justices of Yorkshire[112]. Rightly or wrongly, there is no appeal in criminal cases. The conviction before a court of superior jurisdiction and its decision on its own jurisdiction is, unless reversed on a writ of error, or by the court of Crown cases reserved if any exist, res judicata, and as such pro veritate accepitur, as said by Lord Tenterden in Rex. v. Carlile[113]. The judge presiding at the trial may refuse to reserve a case. The Attorney General may refuse his fiat for a writ of error. But hard as this may seem to be, the law is that in such a case the prisoner has no way of avoiding either the rulings of the court or the verdict of the jury, or the sentence of the court, but by applying to the Crown. And I venture to say that if parliament ever attempts to change the law on this matter and seeks to give a defendant in a criminal case the right to have a conviction against him reviewed, it is not to a judge in chambers that this power will be given.\nWhat would be the consequences if the proposition enunciated in this case on the part of the prisoner were sustained ? Purely and simply, it seems to me, that any judge, whether of this court or of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, would have the right to liberate a prisoner on the ground of want of jurisdiction in the court that tried him even after his conviction has been affirmed either in the court of error, or in this court, or in the Privy Council. Or that when, as in Reg. v. Goldsmith [114] for instance, the prisoner has contended that the indictment disclosed no crime, and consequently gave no jurisdiction to the court, a judge in chambers who would adopt that view might discharge the prisoner even after, not only the judge at the trial but even the court of crown cases reserved, has held the contrary. Or that when, as in Reg. v. Carr[115], the very question reserved was as to the jurisdiction of the court to try the prisoners, a judge on habeas corpus might have liberated the prisoner, if the judge presiding at the trial had not reserved a case, or even after the conviction was affirmed on a case reserved. But I need not go out of the case now under consideration to illustrate how untenable is the position taken here on the part of the prisoner. A writ of error was by him taken, and after argument the conviction was affirmed by the full court of British Columbia, the judges being unanimous. If the judges had not been unanimous the prisoner would have had an appeal to this court. But that not being so the judgment of the full court of British Columbia was final. Yet the prisoner would contend that though this court, on this very question of jurisdiction, cannot review the decision of the court of British Columbia, yet a judge, either of this court or of British Columbia, sitting in chambers has the power to reverse that judgment on the very question of jurisdiction and to liberate the prisoner. I say \" either of this court or of the British Columbia court \" for the powers of the judges of this court under section 51 of this Act, or under the common law, if any exist, under one or the other, are concurrent with the powers of any of the judges of British Columbia. That means, as I read it, that if a judge of this court had the power to issue this writ any judge in British Columbia had the same power.\nTo these cases already cited may be added one from the Province of Quebec, ex parte Plante[116]. In that case the prisoner had been sentenced to the penitentiary for life, although fourteen years was the maximum fixed by the statute ; he applied for a writ of habeas corpus to Chief Justice Bowen, but the learned judge refused to discharge him on the ground that he could not, on a writ of habeas corpus, act as a court of error and revise the sentence of the criminal court. I would also add Reg. v. Smith[117], where Burns J. says : \" That after sentence pronounced, no remedy but the writ of error is left to the prisoner ;\" and also Reg. v. Powell[118], where it was held that the proper proceeding to reverse a judgment of the Court of Quarter Sessions is by writ of error, not by habeas corpus ; also to the American case of Grignon v. Astor[119].\nOn the question of whether an order to discharge the prisoner can issue without a writ being issued, or without the prisoner being brought up, I have only to say that if such a practice has ever existed it is, it seems to me, a loose and illegal one, and one which we should not sanction. Under sections 53, 61 and 62 of 32 and 33 Vic. ch. 30, a prisoner may be admitted to bail without a writ of habeas corpus, but that cannot be extended to a discharge sine die.\nI have only one more remark to make It is as to the well established rule that if a corpus delicti appears by the depositions against a prisoner the judge should not set him at liberty, however defective or irregular the commitment might be. In the present case I may take it for granted, after the verdict of the jury, that the depositions against the prisoner charged him with one of the most heinous crimes known to the law. Yet were he to have the benefit of this order given by the learned judge in chambers he would be set at large. This was a necessary consequence of the granting of this writ, as a certiorari to return the deposition could not, under our statute, have been issued by the learned judge, according to the decision of this court in the Trepanier case. But this, it is evident, demonstrates what serious consequences would follow the exercise of the power, if it existed, by a single judge sitting in chambers to assume the the functions of a court of error and review the decisions of the superior courts of the country even on a question of jurisdiction. The court of oyer and terminer's judgment in the case on the question of its own jurisdiction, had it been distinctly raised before it, would have been final and conclusive until reversed by the court of error. The fact that the prisoner did not raise any such objection before the court itself at any time during or after the trial can surely not give him the right to raise it afterward before a judge in chambers. Different other grounds of error have been assigned by the prisoner before the British Columbia court. But we do not sit here in appeal from the decision of that court, and the objections there taken by the prisoner to the proceedings of the court of oyer and terminer were not grounds for a habeas corpus and are not now before us. I may, however, notice the objection that no venue whatsoever, as contended by the prisoner, is laid in the indictment. Now, in fact, a venue is laid in the margin thereof, according to section 15 of the Procedure Act. If not a proper one, section 23 of the Procedure Act covers that defect. Reg. v. O'Connor [120]and that class of cases cannot now be followed. But moreover this is a defect apparent on the face of the indictment, and one which clearly could have been amended Reg. v. Ashburton[121]. So that by section 32 of the same act, the prisoner cannot now avail himself of that defect. The analogous English clause says, \" Every formal defect.\" But ours says \" Every defect.\" The section is as follows :\nSection 32. Every objection to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof must be taken by demurrer or motion to quash the indictment, before the defendant has pleaded and not afterwards ; and every court before which any such objection is taken may, if it be thought necessary, cause the indictment to be forthwith amended in such particular by some officer of the court or other person, and thereupon the trial shall proceed as if no such defect had appeared ; and no motion in arrest of judgment shall be allowed for any defect in the indictment which might have been taken advantage of by demurrer, or amended under the authority of this Act.\nSee 3 Burns Justices of the Peace 33 (30th ed).\nOn the question of the proper constitution of the court of oyer and terminer, and of the court of error, I entirely agree with the Chief Justice, and for the reasons by him given, that here also the prisoner's contentions are entirely unfounded.\nI am of opinion that this application should be allowed and that the writ of habeas corpus and the order to discharge the prisoner should be quashed and set aside.\nI am not sorry (I may say in fine) to have been able to reach this conclusion, perfectly satisfied, as I am, that the prisoner in this case has had a fair and legal trial. I duly appreciate the highly beneficial character of the writ of habeas corpus as one of the most effective safeguards of the liberty of the subject, but I cannot forget that society has also its rights, and that the courts of the country are bound to see that the writ is not taken advantage of for the protection of felons and convicts.\nMotion allowed. Writ of habeas corpus quashed and the order and proceedings consequent thereon also set aside.\nSolicitor for the Crown: Attorney General of British Columbia.\nSolicitor for the prisoner: Theodore Davie.\n[1] Section 51 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act provides that \u201cany judge of the Supreme Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, for the purpose of an enquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada , * * * and if the judge shall refuse the writ or remand the prisoner an appeal shall lie to the court.\u201d\n[2] 3 Q.

Non seulement Jes immeubles appartenant a des protestants no sent pas sujess \u00e0 cette contribution, mais Je prig m\u00e9me qui en repr\u00e9sente la valeur, comme dans le cas nctuel, d\u00fb avec privil\u00e8ge de bailleur de fonds, doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 en pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence a toute taxe impos\u00e9e pour cet objet affectant un immeuble acquis d'un protestant. Ce droit est garanti par l'article 2011 C C, en ces termes\nThe assessments and rates which are privileged upon immoveables are: 1. Assessment for building or repairing, churches parsonages or church yards: but in. cases, where, an immoveable has been purchased from a person who does not, profess the Roman Catholic religion, before it was assessed for such purposes, the privilege for such assessment must rank after the vendor's claim, and all privileges and. hypothecs anterior to such purchase.\"\nAussi toute contestation \u00e0 ce sujet est-elle abandonn\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e qui reconnait positivement dans son factum s'en tenir \u00e0. l'obligation personnelle que l'Appelante aurait contract\u00e9e par l'acte d'abandon quo lui consenti Girard, de payer le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9. Cette admission qui nous exempte de la consid\u00e9ration de toutes autres questions, soulev\u00e9es par les plaidoiries, est en ces termes :\u2014\nThe principal or rather, only, legal question really before this: honorable court, is whether the Appellants contracted by their deed of cession and transfer of the 1st of \u00abJune 1880 with Henri Girard a personal obligation to pay the amount for which the property of their assignor was hypothecated towards the building, of a catholic church under the control of the Respondents.\nToutefois, comme l'action est hypoth\u00e9caire avec l\u00e0 conclusion alternative de payer $165.82 on do d\u00e9laisser un immeuble valant beaucoup au-del\u00e0 de $2,009.00, ii n'est pas hors de propos de faire remarquer que.la valeur de l\u2019immeuble dansce cas ne peut pas affecter le droit d\u2019apr\u00e8s-bien quo la juridiction soit, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la section cit\u00e9e ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par la somme ou la valeur. de la mati\u00e9re en litige. L'alternative donn\u00e9e fixe a la somme due $ 165.82, la valeur de lint\u00e9r\u00e9t de l'intim\u00e9 dans l'immeuble hypotheque. Pour l'exercice de ses droits 1st valeur de limmeuble (la matiere en litige) ne d\u00e9passe pas pour lui la somme qu'il r\u00e9clame. C'estle principe suivi en France pour decider la question de comp\u00e9tence du tribunal d'appel dans les actions hypoth\u00e9cates. Ii y a lieu d'en faire application au cas actuel. L'auoorite suivante est positive a. cet esard Bioche ([1]).\nQuand la demjinde contient des conclusions alternatives il suffit que l'une des deux choses r\u00e9cllamees soit d'une valeur inferieure 1,500 francs pour que le tribunal prononce en dernier ressort. Henrion, chap. 16; Carre, No. 311 ; Benech, 1, p. 46: Boncenee, 1, 336: Carou, Nos. 114 et J15.\nMais limit\u00e9e comme elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 par les d\u00e9clarations des parties, la demande n\u2019a plus pour but que le paiement de la somme de $165.82 1\/2, r\u00e9clam\u00e9e en vertu d'une obligation personnelle. Avons-nous jurisdiction pour entretenir un appel dans une action personnelle dont le montant est au dessous de $2,000.00? Il est \u00e9vident que non, d'apr\u00e9s le proviso de la section 17 de l'acte 35 Vie ch. 11 qui d\u00e9clare qu'il n'y pas d'appel dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, a moins que la somme ou la valeur de l'objet en litige no se monte a la somme de $2000, Dans les causes ou il s'asfit d'une somme ou d'une valeur moindre, il n'y a pas d'appel, a moins que dans ce cas la demande ne soit de la natuee de celle mentionn\u00e9e dans la section 8 de Ia 42 Vic. ch. 39 amendant la section 17 ci-desuss citee. Mais la cause actuelle ne tombe dans aucune des categories mentionn\u00e9es dans cette derniere section.\nIl ne s'agit ici que de l'obiigaiion personnelle de l\u2019intime de payer $165.82 1\/2.\nLa section 8, apr\u00e9s avoir d\u00e9ciar\u00e9 qu'il y aui appel dans les cas ou il s'agtt de la validit\u00e9 d\u2019actes l\u00e9gislatifs, ajouto qu'il v aura aussi appel dans les causes au-dessous de $2,000, lorsque la demande se rapportera a des honoraires d'ofiice droits, rente, revenu, on a quelque somme d'argent payabee a Sa Majeste, on a aucuu titre a des terres on tenements rentes annuelles ou titres sem blables ou choses, dans lesquelles les. droits a venir peutent \u00e9tre lies, \"bound\" .\nDans le cas actuel il ne s'agit que du paiement (Tune somme de $165.82 1\/2 pour taxe d'eglise, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par la r\u00e9partition d'une somme d\u00e9termin\u00e9e dont Je paiemeit devatt se faire en. deux versements annuels. Cette taxe quoique portant hypotheque et privilege sur les immeubles, n'a aucunement le caractere dune charge permanente, elle n'est qu\u00e9 temporaire et ne peut pas se r\u00e9p\u00e9ter d'annee en ann\u00bae comme des rentes ou comme des droits et revenus dus a Sa Maieste qui ont un caractere permanent. Cette taxe n'est pas un droit (duty) car cette expression ne pent s'appiiquer qu'a des droits dus a Sa Majeste, tandis que le montant de cette taxe est du et payable a la corporation intimee. La demande de la somme en question n'a non plus aucun rapport a des titres concerntnt des terres et tenements heritages, et de plus, comme la taxe dont il s'agtt etatt payable en deux ans,il est evident que la condamnation au paiement de cette taxe ne compromet en aucune maniere les droits futurs\nLa demande eni cette cause ne rentre dans aucune des categories de causes ou l'on peut appeler en vertu de Ia sec. 8, lors m\u00eame que Ta demande est moindre quo $2000.\nCette questonn de juridiction aurait du. \u00eatre soueev\u00e9e pr\u00e9liminarrement, mais an lien de cela les deux parties semblent s'\u00eatre entendues pour la passer sous silence, ou plutot paraissent avoir et\u00e9 toutes deux sous l,impression ayec l'honorable juge qui permis l'appel, que la cause \u00e9tait appelable. L'erreur \u00e9tant commune aux deux parties, il ne peut etre accord\u00e9 de frais.\nHENRY J\u2014I concur in the views taken by my learned brethren. I regret it, however, because I think it but right to express my opinion that the action was not maintainable, but such a judgment the court has no right to give because we have no jurisdiction.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is a case from the province of Quebec, what we call an hypothecary action for church rates for an amount of $165, and I am sorry to say we have to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction. I do not see that we have any jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. From the Province of Quebec four classes of cases only are appealable under 42 \"Vic. ch. 29 sec. 8 :\u20141st, any case wherein the matter in controversy amounts to the sum or value of $2,000 ; 2nd, any case wherein the matter in controversy involves the question of the validity of an act of par ligament, or of any of the local legislatures ; 3rd, any Case wherein the matter in controversy relates to any feet of office or any duty or rent or revenue payable to Her Majesty, or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, where the rights in future might be bound. These last words must be read as qualifying all this third class as well as the next. If for instance a fee of office is claimed, bat the right to it is denied by the defendant the case is appealable but if in an action for a fee of office, the defendant pleads payment, the case is not appealable if under $2,000. 4th, any case wherein the matter in controversy relates to any title to lands or tenements, or title to annual rents or such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound. It is evident that this case does not fall within any of the first three classes. Though the value of the immovable in question may be over $2,000, it is the amount claimed in an hypothecary action which is in controversy, and here it is clearly below the appealable amount. The only class under which it could at all be argued that this case falls would be the fourth one. But it is impossible to bring it within it terms. The title to this land here in disputed nor in controversy. Nor do the words \"such like matters or things where the rights in future might be bound,\" support the appeal. The right of the plaintiffs to tax this property is not disputed here. Nor is its liability to future taxation in contestation. And the fact \"that the taxes claimed are payable by instalments some of which may not yet be due, cannot render the case appealable. The present liability of the bank or rather the lien of this property is the only matter of controversy. It is debitum in praesnli Solvendum in futuro. The case of Sauvageau v. Gauthier ([2]) in the Privy Council is in that Sense.\nSir W.J RITCHIE C J. and GWYNNE J. concurred.\nAppeal quashed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Lcflamee Hlufitiitgdon, Laflamee & Richard.\nSolicitors for respondents: Mousseau, Aveichambaull & Lafonaine.\n[1] Vo.

Municipal Corporation\u2014Construction of subway by\u2014Authorized by special statute\u201446 Vic. ch. 45 (Ont.)\u2014Agreement with Railway Companies\u2014Order in Council under 46 Vic. ch. 24 (D.)\u2014Work done as agent of companies or as principal\u2014Injury to property by construction of subway\u2014Corporation a wrongdoer.\nA special statute in Ontario (46 Vic. ch. 45) authorized the municipalities of the city of Toronto and the village of Parkdale, jointly or separately, and the railway companies whose lines of railway ran into the city of Toronto, to agree together for the construction of railway subways; provision was made in the Act for the issue of debentures to provide for the cost of the work, and the by-law for the issue of such debentures was not required to be submitted to the ratepayers; there was also provision for compensation to the owners of property injuriously affected by such work, such compensation to be determined by arbitration under the Municipal Act if not mutually agreed upon. The municipalities not being able to agree, Parkdale and the railway companies entered into an agreement to have a subway constructed at their joint expense, but under the direction of the municipality and its engineer, and on the application of Parkdale and the railway companies to the Privy Council of Canada, purporting to be made under 46 Vic. ch. 24 (D.), an order of the Privy Council was obtained authorizing the work to be done according to the terms of such agreement. The municipality of Parkdale then contracted with one G. for the construction of the subway, and a by-law providing for the raising of Parkdale\u2019s share of the cost of construction was submitted to, and approved of by, the ratepayers of that municipality. In an action by the owner of property injured by the work:\nHeld,\u2014Per Ritchie C.J, Fournier and Henry JJ., that the work was not done by the municipality under the special Act, nor merely as agent of the railway companies, and the municipality was therefore liable as a wrongdoer.\nPer Gwynne J\u2014That the work should be considered as having been done under the special Act, and the plaintiffs were entitled to compensation thereunder.\nPer Taschereau J\u2014That the work was done by the municipality as agent of the railway companies and it was therefore not liable.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1]; reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2]; and of Wilson C.J.[3]. The material facts of the case are as follows.\nBy a special statute of the Ontario Legislature, 46 Vic. cap 45, authority was given to the councils of the city of Toronto and the village of Parkdale, jointly or separately, to construct certain railway subways, to enter into agreements with any or all of the railway companies whose tracks crossed the public streets lying within the limits of the said city and village for the construction of such subways, and to pass such by-laws and make all such agreements as might be necessary for the performance of the work; provision was made for compensation to any person whose lands might be injuriously affected by such construction, to be determined by arbitration under the Municipal Act if not mutually agreed upon; and the respective councils were authorized to issue debentures to provide for the cost of the proposed subways and were not required to submit to the ratepayers any by-law ordering said debentures to issue.\nThe two councils not being able to agree as to the mode of doing the work Parkdale and the said railway companies entered into an agreement for the construction of a subway partly in Parkdale and partly in Toronto, and obtained an order of the Privy Council of Canada, under 46 Vic. cap. 24, based on a report of the railway committee, authorizing the construction of such subway under the said agreement.\nThe by-law of the council of Parkdale approving of this agreement and providing for the issue of debentures was submitted to; and ratified by, the ratepayers, and a contract was entered into by the council with one G. who proceeded to construct such subway.\nSeparate actions were brought by West and wife and by Carroll and Dunspaugh against the corporations of Parkdale and Toronto for injury to their respective properties by the lowering of the street under which such subway was made. The statement of claim in each case alleged that the work was done under the special Act and that the defendants had not passed by-laws as thereby required, in consequence of which the plaintiffs could not obtain compensation under the Municipal Act.\nThe defence raised by Parkdale was, that the work was not done under the special statute, but was done by the municipality as the agents of the railway companies.\nOn the trial it was agreed that if the court should find the defendants liable a reference might be had to determine the amount of compensation.\nThe two suits were carried on and argued together, and on the hearing before Wilson C.J., judgment was given for the plaintiffs and an order for reference made. Parkdale being ordered to pay the costs of the defendants, the city of Toronto. This judgment was affirmed by the Divisional Court but reversed by the Court of Appeal. The defendants in both suits then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and an order was made consolidating the two appeals.\nS.H. Blake QC. and Lash Q.C. for the appellants the Wests, and R. Snelling for the appellants Carroll and Dunspaugh, contended that Parkdale could not be considered agents of the companies; that they entered into the agreement with the contractor for the construction of the subway; they agreed to bear an equal share with each company of the cost of the work; and they acted through as principals and not as agents. It was also argued that the Privy Council could not authorize this work, which would be an interference with provincial rights, and that there was no recourse against the railways as no land had been taken.\nThe following authorities were cited in addition to those mentioned in the previous reports.

Wilson delivered his judgment in this case, which is reported at 7 O.R. 270, and the formal judgment entered thereupon is in the words following:\u2014\n(1) This action coming on for trial before this court at Toronto, at the special sittings appointed for the trial of actions in the Chancery Division, on the sixth day of May last past, in the presence of counsel for all parties, upon hearing read the pleadings, and upon hearing the evidence adduced and what was alleged by counsel aforesaid, and upon motion of Mr. Osler Q.C, of counsel for the defendants the corporation of the village of Parkdale, it was ordered that the said trial should stand adjourned until the 12th day of the said month of May, and that the said defendants should be at liberty to deliver an amended statement of defence, and that the plaintiffs should have liberty thereupon to deliver an amended statement of claim; and this action having again come on for trial on the said 12th day of May last past, in presence of counsel for all parties, upon hearing read the said amended pleadings, and upon hearing the further evidence adduced, and what was alleged by counsel aforesaid, this court was pleased to direct that this action should stand over for judgment; and the same coming on this day for judgment: (2) This court doth declare that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendants, the corporation of the village of Parkdale, compensation for the damages (if any) sustained by them by reason of the wrongful acts of the said defendants, complained of in the statement of claim herein, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\n(3) And this court doth further order and adjudge that it be referred to his honor the junior judge of the county of York, an official referee, to take an account of the damage (if any) sustained by the plaintiffs, or either of them, by reason of said wrongful acts, and to fix the compensation proper to be paid to them, or either of them, in respect thereof.\n(4) And this court doth further order and adjudge that the defendants, the corporation of the village of Parkdale, do pay to the plaintiffs and to the defendants, the city of Toronto, their costs of this action up to and inclusive of this judgment, and including the costs of the motion for an injunction herein, forthwith after taxation thereof.\n(5) And this court doth further order and adjudge that the defendants, the corporation of the village of Parkdale, do pay to the plaintiffs the amount which the said referee may find proper to be paid to them, or either of them, for compensation for damages as aforesaid, together with their subsequent costs, to be taxed as aforesaid forthwith after the said referee shall have made his report.\nThe contention of the defendants, as clearly set forth in their factum, is that the Parkdale council had no power under the Ontario act, 46 Vic. cap. 45, to do this work, and that they did not do it under the Act, That they assumed to act only under the agreement with the railway and the order in council of the 27th of March, 1883. In the words of their factum \u201cthey wholly deny having acted under the Ontario act,\u201d and they further say: \u201cin any view of the effect of the act the fact was, and it was clearly established, that the respondents did not do, or purpose to do, the work under its provisions, but that the work was done under the railway act and the order of the Privy Council made thereunder,\u2019\u2019 and which justified what they did. That if the act was wrongful it was contended that it was ultra vires on the part of the Parkdale council to construct the subway, and on this ground the corporation of Parkdale is not liable.\nAll the judges of the courts below have concurred in the opinion that the work was not done under the Ontario act, 46 Vic, and I have been unable to arrive at the conclusion that on this point they were wrong.\nIt cannot be denied that the plaintiffs have been seriously damnified and ought to recover compensation therefor, and the real question in this case is: Are the defendants, the village of Parkdale, liable to the plaintiffs for such damage?\nThe village of Parkdale having entered into an agreement with the four railway companies for the performance of this work, and having taken the control of the work, and having contracted with Mr. Godwin for the execution of the work, how can they escape liability to make compensation to the parties who have been iujured by such work, either under the statute or as wrongdoers?\nChief Justice Wilson was of opinion that the work was not being done under the special act; that the village had not observed its terms and had not assumed to act under it, but only under the order in council; that they had exceeded their powers as to all the work done in the city of Toronto; and that applied to the action of \u201cWest and his wife whose property is situate in Toronto; and also that the village is not authorized by the order in council to do the work, and could not be so authorized, as the order could have no binding effect in law. But if the order could confer such a power the village would not be liable, because a liability arises under it only in those cases in which lands have been taken and none have been taken here; and as the village has not proceeded under the special act, it cannot be compelled to go to arbitration; that they are, in effect, wrongdoers, and answerable as such for the damage they have caused to the plaintiffs and others by reason of these works; and he found that the village of Parkdale is doing the work in question unauthorizedly, and on that ground, wrongfully, and that they are bound to make compensation to the parties injured, and referred the question of compensation to the master.\nHad the municipality proceeded to do this work under the provisions of the Ontario statute 46 Vic. cap. 45, as in my opinion it should have done, the compensation now claimed would have been provided for. The corporation did not do this, but, on the contrary, by works carried on under their control, and by their contractor, unquestionably injuriously affected the lands of the plaintiffs; and not having proceeded under the Ontario statute the plaintiffs cannot obtain compensation in the manner provided for by that act. Are they therefore to be remediless? I think not. They are, to the injured parties, in my opinion, immediately primarily liable. In doing this work I think the municipality of Parkdale acted as, and must be treated as, principals and not as agents, the construction of the subway being, as recited in the Parkdale by-law, essential to the interests of the village. The work performed being just what the act authorized to be done, I think they cannot escape liability by alleging that they did not do, or assume to do it, under the act, or that having power to do the work, they did it in a manner not authorized by the act and without complying with the conditions required by the act.\nThe Ontario act 46 Vic. cap. 45, authorized the councils of Toronto and Parkdale, jointly or separately, to do work of the kind in question, and provided that the councils should make to the owners or occupiers or other persons interested in the real property entered upon, taken or used by them or either of them in the exercise of any of the powers conferred upon them or either of them by the act, or injuriously affected by the exercise of such powers, due compensation for any damage resulting from the exercise of such powers beyond any advantage derived from the works. Is it not, then, clear that the doing of this description of work is not a matter ultra vires the corporation of Parkdale; in other words, not beyond the scope of their corporate powers? They should have proceeded under the Ontario statute; they did not do so, but undertook to do the same work in a different, and unauthorized, manner, and now seek to escape from making due compensation to parties injuriously affected thereby; in other words, because they did not choose to act strictly in accordance with the law they can, by acting contrary to it, and so making themselves wrongdoers, obtain the same benefit they would have done if their proceedings had been regular and proper and at the same time injuriously affected real property, and through the instrumentality of their irregular and improper proceedings escape the responsibility of making compensation. This, I humbly think, law, reason and common sense alike repudiate. The village is the only contracting party and pays by funds raised from the property holders within the municipality, and I cannot see how the railway companies agreeing with the municipality of Parkdale to pay a part of the expense of the work can relieve Parkdale from making compensation by paying for the damage they have caused the plaintiff and others by reason of these works. The order in council imposed no obligation on the village of Parkdale to execute this work or to do anything whatever in connection therewith. The order in council required the railway companies to do the work and pay the expense and damage resulting therefrom. I think this appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of Chief Justice Wilson and of the Divisional Court should be restored.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of allowing these appeals for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice, and also for those given by Chief Justice Wilson, whose judgment, I think, should be restored.\nHENRY J.\u2014These actions were brought by the respective plaintiffs for an alleged damage to their property by certain public works, and I think the evidence shows very clearly that the plaintiffs have been injured by the work done. The law as to public nuisances is very plain, and where one is committed, and a party has suffered special damage thereby, he can bring an action. Now it is evident that the parties here did sustain serious damages by the work done. The defendants justify under an order in council, and claim that they were merely the servants of a railway company, or certain railway companies, in doing the work. But in order to sustain that position they would require to show that the railway companies were authorized to do this work. In that I think they have wholly failed. The evidence does not show any such agency. They were, in fact, principals, and contributed a portion of the cost of the work.\nThe evidence is very clear that this corporation authorized the doing of the wrong complained of. By-laws were passed under the seal of the corporation, and the whole of the work which caused the injury complained of was done under the authority of the corporate seal. They are therefore primarily liable to the parties to whom the wrong was done.\nIn looking over the statutes I have come to the conclusion that there was no justification for this injury. I think the law is very plain and very easy of applica- tion to a case of this kind. I agree with the reasons given by His Lordship the Chief Justice and with the, conclusion at which he has arrived; and also in the conclusion arrived at by Chief Justice Wilson in the court below.\nI think the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. If Parkdale was to be considered as having acted under the Ontario statute no action would lie, but the plaintiffs only remedy would be by arbitration. But Parkdale did not act under the Ontario statute. That is clear, it seems to me, and was so found, as a matter of fact, by Chief Justice Wilson, and, if I mistake not, by all the judges in the courts below who have had the case before them. The debentures issued were certainly not those authorized by that statute, and the submitting of the by-law to the votes of the ratepayers in the face of a clause which says that any by-law under the act need not be so submitted is conclusive evidence that Parkdale did not purpose to build this subway under the act. I cannot see that, such being the case, the appellants can say to Parkdale as they do in this case: \u201cYou, in fact, did not act under the statute, but you ought to have done so. You have acted so as not to be liable, but you ought to have acted so as to be liable, and, therefore, you are liable.\u201d Then, if not acting under the order of the railway committee Parkdale was a wrong-doer, acting clearly without the scope of its powers, and in West\u2019s case even outside of its territorial limits, this action consequently does not lie against the corporation[18]. But if, as undoubtedly is the case, Parkdale built this subway for the railroad companies, it cannot be denied that these companies had the right to build it. Then they were at liberty to build it themselves, or to employ Parkdale to do it as their agent. If Parkdale had not the power to so act as agent, their doing so was ultra vires of such a character that no action lies against them. And if they had the power to act as agents of the companies, then the order of the Privy Council protects them from the action of the plaintiffs. And could they possibly be held liable for the companies, the only remedy to the plaintiffs under the railway act is again by arbitration.\nFor the reasons given by Burton, Paterson and Osler JJ., in the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 action. Their only recourse is against the companies.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014That a most serious injury, indeed one of the very greatest magnitude, has been inflicted on the plaintiffs by the work performed by Godson under a contract executed by the corporation of the village of Parkdale under their corporate seal cannot admit of a doubt, but the corporation contend that they are not responsible to the plaintiffs for this injury, for the reason that, as is alleged, they only entered into that contract as agents of certain railway companies who, as is also alleged, were under a legal obligation to do the work, while on the part of the plaintiffs it is suggested that the corporation having power and authority to do the work, subject to a liability to the plaintiffs to indemnify them, now pretend that in executing the contract with Godson they were acting only as agents of the railway companies, under the impression that the work could thus be performed by them without their being liable to indemnify the plaintiff. If the law not only authorizes but, as is contended, requires the railway companies to do the work and exempts them from all responsibility to the plaintiffs for the injury done to them, and if upon a proper understanding of the facts of the case the cor- poration of Parkdale are to be regarded in the transaction merely as the agents of the railway companies in doing an act lawful for them to do the result will be that the plaintiffs will be deprived of all means of obtaining redress for a most egregious wrong; but before arriving at this conclusion it will be necessary to examine with critical acumen two acts of parliament, the one an act of the Legislature of Ontario and the other of the Dominion Parliament.\nOn the 1st of February, 1883, an act respecting the city of Toronto and the village of Parkdale was passed by the legislature of the province of Ontario 46th Vic. ch. 45.\nThe preamble of that act recites as follows:\u2014\n(His Lordship here read the preamble and first section of the act.)\nIt is to be observed that the corporations of the city of Toronto and the village of Parkdale are the promoters of the act; it is passed upon the petitions of those corporations, respectively, as the parties having a peculiar interest in procuring the construction of the works authorized by the act; and by this first clause power is given, first, to the two corporations to enter into an agreement with each other as to the construction and future maintenance of the, works; but lest they should be unable to agree provision is made, secondly, that the several railway companies, whose tracks cross any of the public streets within the limits of the city of Toronto and village of Parkdale, may all jointly, or any of them separately, enter into such agreement with the city of Toronto and the village of Parkdale jointly, or with either of those corporations separately, for the construction and future maintenance of the works authorised by the act as they may deem necessary for the safety and protection of the persons and property of all persons concerned. By the 2nd section it is enacted that:\n(His Lordship here read the second section).\nThe object of this section primarily seems to be to make provision that either of the said municipalities, in case they should not be able to agree upon such a plan of the proposed works as should be undertaken jointly by them, might separately undertake the whole work to be executed within the limits of both municipalities, and might enter into a contract for such work according to a plan to be suggested by their own engineer and approved by themselves, a provision which, under the circumstances appearing in the case, seems to me to have been a very prudent one; for we find that the authorities of the municipality of Parkdale at an early period conceived an idea, to which they appear ever since to have persistently adhered, that in lowering the grades of Queen street so as to carry that street under the railways crossing it the width of that street might be considerably diminished, and as early as 1881 they procured an engineer to make a plan for such a work by which it was proposed that Queen street should be narrowed in the subway and its approaches to less than two-thirds of its original width, while we find that the difficulty which stood in the way of the city of Toronto coming to an agreement with Parkdale, upon the plan of the work, arose from the fact that the city of Toronto insisted that the original width of Queen street, (which was a great thoroughfare, namely, 66 feet,) should be maintained throughout, while the authorities of the village of Parkdale adhered to the plan as prepared by their engineer. This section then appears to me to be so framed as to enable either municipality alone (if mutually they should be unable to agree upon a plan) to construct the whole of the authorized work as of necessity, one undivided work, according to a plan prepared under its own direc- tion and approved by itself, and, in so doing, to close, break up and otherwise alter, improve and change the streets, or any of them, within the limits of both municipalities to such extent and in such manner as the engineer of the corporation undertaking the work might think fit and necessary for the purpose of the said work; the legislature, as it appears, not unreasonably thinking, that if the two municipalities could not agree upon a plan for executing the work jointly, and one alone should be willing to undertake the work, the mode in which the streets which were common to both should be interfered with might safely be entrusted to the municipality which should, if either should, alone undertake the work; but this section, as it appears to me, was intended to have operation equally in case the railway companies, or any of them, whose railways cross the streets should unite with the two municipalities, or with either of them, in procuring the authorized works to be constructed; in that case, the municipalities, being the parties interested in the question as to the manner in which their streets were to be interfered with by the construction of the works, were the parties whose assent to the plan of operations, whatever it might be, was absolutely necessary, and for this reason, whether the municipalities were jointly, or one of them alone was, undertaking the work, or both, or either of them, were, or was, acting in concert with the railway companies, or any of them, any contract for the actual work of construction must be entered into and executed by the municipalities, or one of them, if both are acting, or by the one which is, if one only is, acting in concert with the railway companies or any of them; just as if the two municipalities together were, or one of them alone was, undertaking the work, one or other of the two municipalities by reason of their peculiar interest in the streets to \u2018 be affected by the authorized works being a necessary party to any contract to be entered into for the actual construction of the works authorized by the act.\nBy the third section it is enacted that (His lordship read the section.)\nThe object of this section, or the necessity for it, is not very apparent. If the city of Toronto and the village of Parkdale should agree jointly to execute the works authorized by the act, it would seem to be a necessity, not requiring a special clause like this to secure its fulfilment, that they should in the agreement contemplated by the 1st section for \u201cconstruction, erection and future maintenance\u201d of the works, agree upon the proportions they should respectively bear in the cost and maintenance of the works and all incidental expenses. Yet it is apparently to the case of their having agreed to execute the work jointly under the authority vested in them by the 1st section that this 3rd section points. It does not provide for the possible case of the municipalities being unable to come to an agreement between themselves and of one of them, in consequence, entering into an agreement with the railway companies, or some or one of them, for the construction, erection and maintenance of such work, as they might deem sufficient and necessary, which is also authorized by the first section. In case the city of Toronto and village of Parkdale should jointly proceed with the construction of the works, or should execute a contract with any person for that purpose without first mutually agreeing upon the proportions they should respectively bear in the cost thereof, including compensation for damages, and future maintenance, this section might, perhaps, in such case, give to any person whose property might be injuriously affected by the proposed work, a right to restrain the municipalities from proceeding with the work as in dis- obedience of this section, although how such persons could be affected injuriously in any way by the municipalities proceeding with the work before they should mutually agree among themselves upon their proportionate cost of the work and its maintenance, is not, to my mind, very apparent. I cannot think that the default of the municipalities to comply with the provisions of this section before proceeding with the works would deprive the parties injured of their right to force an arbitration under the provisions of the Municipal Act, The section appears to me to be simply directory, not a condition precedent in the sense of making the work done to be ultra vires, if done before such agreement should be entered into. But however this may be, the section does not appear to apply to the case of an agreement for the construction of the authorized work being entered into between one of the municipalities only and the railway companies, or any of them, which is also authorized by the first section By the fourth section it is enacted that:\u2014\nHis Lordship read the fourth section of the Act:\u2014\nThe clauses of the municipal acts here referred to are the following sections of 46 Vic. ch. 18 Ont.\nSection 387 provides that the appointment of all arbitrators shall be in writing under the hands of the appointers, and in the case of a corporation, under the corporate seal and authenticated in the same manner as a by-law.\nSection 888 that the arbitrators on behalf of a municipal corporation shall be appointed by the council thereof or by the head thereof if authorized by a by-law of the council.\nSection 389 that in cases where arbitration is directed by the act either party may appoint an arbitrator and give notice thereof in writing to the other party calling upon such party to appoint an abitrator on behalf of the party to whom such notice is given. A notice to a corporation shall be given to the head of the corporation.\nSection 390 that the two arbitrators appointed by or tor the parties shall within seven days from the appointment of the lastly named of the two arbitrators appoint in writing a third arbitrator.\nBy section S93 it is enacted that (His Lordship read the section):\nThen by section 396 it is enacted that (His Lordship read this section):\u2014\nThe other Act which is relied upon as having a bearing upon the matter in question is the Dominion Statute 46 Vic. ch. 24, passed upon the 25th of May, 1883, whereby the 48th section of the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, is repealed and the following substituted therefor.\n(His Lordship reads section four of 46 Vic. ch. 24).\nInto the question whether this section provides for compensation being paid by railway companies, acting in obedience to the order of the railway committee made under the authority of this section, to persons whose property is injuriously affected as is that of the plaintiffs here, although no land is taken from them, we need not now enter, as the railway companies are not parties before the court in this suit. What effect the section has upon the question involved in this suit may have to be considered by-and-by when the manner in which it is relied upon by the municipality of Parkdale as a defence to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim to make that municipality liable comes under consideration.\nThe above being the statutes bearing on the case, the facts so far as we can gather them from the evidence furnished to us appear to be that the city of Toronto refused to come to any agreement with the municipality of the village of Parkdale under the provisions of the Ontario statute 46 Vic ch. 45, because the city insisted upon the full width of Queen street being maintained throughout, while Parkdale adhered to the plan it had procured to be made by its engineer in 1881, which made a considerable diminution in the width of the street. What step the village first took in consequence of being unable to effect an agreement with the city of Toronto does not appear, nor what was its nature, namely, whether any attempt was made by the village authorities to procure the railway companies to enter into an agreement with Parkdale under the provisions of the Ontario statute before application was made to procure the interference of the railway committee of the Privy Council under the provisions of the Dominion Act, but that Parkdale did make some application to the railway committee to procure its interference appears from a recital contained in an agreement which the railway companies and Parkdale did voluntarily enter into while the matter of such application was under the consideration of the committee, and before they had arrived at any conclusion thereon, which agreement was, in fact, laid before the committee and constituted the basis of their subsequent action in the premises. A report of the committee of works of the city of Toronto of the date of the 27th August, 1883, which was put in evidence with an admission that it also was laid before the railway committee, throws some light on the matter.\n(His Lordship here read the report as set out in 7 O.R. 278).\nThe agreement between the railway companies and the village of Parkdale, which was laid before the committee and formed the basis of their report made in relation to the subject matter thereof, is as follows. It has no date affixed to it but was executed before the 21st of September, 1883, the date of the report of the committee of council.\nMemo of heads of an agreement respecting the Queen street crossing in Toronto:\u2014\nThe Northern Railway.\nThe Grand Trunk Railway.\nThe Credit Valley Railway.\nThe Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway.\nThe Village of Parkdale.\nThe above named parties agree as follows:\u2014\nThe subway shall be made upon plans and specifications which shall be agreed on, and on failing agreement, as shall be fixed by Mr. Schreiber.\nThe village of Parkdale, at the request of said railroads, but without varying and without prejudice to the legal position of any of the parties under the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, and the amendments thereto, shall take the control of the said work with power to let contracts and compel the carrying out of the same, but it shall be done under the direction of the engineer, who shall be named by the railway companies, but all to be done to the satisfaction of the inspector or engineer of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council. The work shall be put in hand at once and pushed as quickly as reasonably can be, the railway companies giving every facility for carrying out the same.\nThe cost is estimated at $35,000. Each of the parties named above will at once put up one-fifth of the said sum and will be liable for one-fifth of any extra cost of constructing the same.\nParkdale not to be liable for any expenditure incurred by any of the said railways in altering grades of tracks or other incidental expenses, but only for one-fifth of the actual cost of constructing subway, including altering grades of Queen and Dufferin streets, building retaining walls and abutments and overhead work, save as hereinafter excepted.\nThe money which shall be deposited in the Bank of Montreal to the credit of this work to be chequed out by the Reeve of Parkdale on the certificate of the engineer appointed by the Railway Companies as the work progresses, who is to certify monthly according to the value of work done, the said certificate to state the gross amount to be paid in each case, the certificate to be attached to the cheque.\nThe contract with the contractors to provide for a percentage being held back as security for the due performance of the work. The contract to be approved by John Bell and Mr. White, General Superintendent of the Credit Valley R.R., on behalf of the Com- panies, and J.E. Rose on behalf of the village.\nDufferin street to be closed between the points shown on the plan annexed hereto in red. Any legislation required to be had to legalise this agreement or any thing thereunder the parties hereto agree to use all legal means to obtain.\nThe parliamentary expenses, exclusive of counsel fees, to be shared equally between the parties, each to pay its own agents and counsel fees.\nIf deemed necessary the sanction of both the Local and Dominion Parliaments will be asked for.\nAll the parties will use their best exertions and influence to have the acts passed. The railway committee to be asked to sanction this arrangement and order accordingly, and the said work to be done as in compliance with the order of the said committee, and nothing in said agreement contained shall be taken to limit the power of said committee or to remove the work from their jurisdiction or control, or to prevent the said village of Parkdale from applying to said committee to enforce the performance of said work by said railways, in case of failure on the part of them or any one or more of them, and the fact of the said village having control of said work shall be without prejudice, as above stated, until the work shall be fully completed as hereby agreed.\nThe width of the opening to be forty feet. The streets to be maintained hereafter by the municipalities in which they are; the wall and crossings of the railway overhead by the railways. The municipal authorities take a 1 risk of the sufficiency of the drainage of the subway. It is also agreed that the parties hereto will join in asking, in the acts above proposed, power to collect from the corporation of the city of Toronto one-sixth of the cost of doing the above mentioned work.\nEach company at its own costs will provide the iron girders for carrying its railway tracks across the opening. The municipality of Parkdale to contribute $1,500 to cost of such girders as its full proportion thereof.\nThe division of the costs contemplated by this agreement is a division of the cost less the said iron griders as above set out.\nAll matters in dispute to be settled by the Government Engineer.\nIn accordance with the provision contained in this memorandum of agreement that the railway committee \u201cshould be asked to sanction this agreement and order \u201caccordingly\u201d the memorandum was laid before the committee which, upon the basis of it, on the 21st Sept., 1883, made a report addressed to the Minister of Railways and Canals to be submitted to His Excellency the Governor General in Council for his approval, in which the committee states that (His Lordship read the report set out in 7 O.R. 279.):\u2014\nWe have it on the evidence of Mr. Stokes, the engineer who prepared the plan for the municipality of Parkdale in 1881, that the plan approved by the Railway Committee was that plan so prepared by him with two trifling alterations only, which had been suggested by the Government Engineer and concurred in by the parties, namely, that the descent in the approaches of the subway should be one foot in twenty instead of one in eighteen, and that the total width of the subway should be 42 feet instead of 40 as originally designed.\nThe above report of the railway committee was submitted to His Excellency for approval by him in council on the 24th day of September, 1883, upon which day, as the sanction of His Excellency the Governor General in Council was by the Statute 46 Vic. ch. 24 made requisite to the recommendation of the railway committee acquiring any validity, the report acquired whatever legal force or effect it had and assumed the character of an order in council. Upon the 18th of October, 1883, the council of the municipality of Parkdale gave a first and second reading to a by-law introduced into that council and framed so as to give effect to the agreement contained in the above memorandum of agreement entered into by and between the railway companies and the village. This by-law as the same appears in the printed case, is as follows (Here His Lordship read the by-law.):\nThe by-law having been approved by the ratepayers the agreement which had been entered into between the companies and the municipality reduced into perfect form was upon the 24th November, 1883, executed under the corporate seals of the parties and is as follows (See 7 O.R. 280 where the agreement is set out in full);\nNow it is to be observed that in this instrument the parties declare that it was while the proceedings instituted by the municipality of Parkdale before the Railway Committee were still pending, and before that committee had arrived at any conclusion upon such proceedings, that the railway companies and the village of Parkdale of their own free will came to an agreement upon the several particulars as they are contained in the above instrument formally executed under seal on the 24th November, 1883.\nA memorandum of the heads of that agreement had been, in pursuance of a provision to that effect contained therein, submitted to the Railway Committee accompanied with a request made by the parties to the agreement that the committee would sanction the agreement and order accordingly. The alterations suggested by the Government Engineer having been concurred in by the parties, the committee made their report in which the memorandum of agreement is recited and containing a recommendation which conforms with the terms of the agreement previously entered into between the parties; and to verify all this the instrument executed on the 24th November, 1883, declares that it was while the proceedings before the Railway Committee were pending that the agreement as set out in the instrument of the 24th November was concluded between the parties, and in the 14th paragraph of this instrument we find the railway companies declaring that, except for the purposes of this agreement, they do not admit the jurisdiction of the Railway Committee in the premises, and in the 15th paragraph we find that it is only by agreement between the parties that the decision of the Engineer of the Railway Committee is to be accepted as binding. In short, by the terms of the agreement the railway companies only recognize the Railway Committee\u2019s action in the premises as sanctioning the agreement while the municipality of the village reserves to itself the right, in case of failure by the railway companies or any of them to fulfil their part of the agreement, to fall back upon the authority vested in the Railway Committee of the Privy Council by the Dominion Statute, 46 Vic. ch. 24. Whether under the provisions of that act which provides that \u201cthe Railway Committee, if it appears to them necessary for the public safety, may from time to time, with the sanction of the Governor in Council, authorize and require the company to whom such railway belongs,\u201d (that is a railway crossing a street) \u201cto carry such street either over or under the said railway by means of a bridge or arch,\u201d the Railway Committee would have had any power to authorize or require such an alteration of Queen and Dufferin streets, wholly closing up part of the latter and narrowing the former to less than two-thirds of its established width in the city of Toronto and the village of Parkdale as is authorized by the agreement between the railway companies and the village of Parkdale, is a point which I do not think at present calls for a judicial opinion, because I think that the true construction of the action of the Railway Committee in the premises is merely that the committee adopted the agreement of the parties, and, so far as they could, gave their sanction to the work thereby agreed to be done by the railway companies and the village of Parkdale acting in concert as sufficient in the opinion of the committee to give that security to the public which by the 46 Vic. ch. 24, the committee was empowered to secure. If I had not formed this opinion it would be impos- sible to avoid determining a very grave point which, as it appears to me, is involved in this question, for if the terms of the Dominion statute do not empower the Railway Committee of the Privy Council to authorize the railway companies whose railways cross Queen street to reduce the width of that great thoroughfare in the city of Toronto and the municipality of Parkdale to less than two-thirds of its original established width, then the work which has been done under the contract entered into by the municipality of Parkdale with Godson is an indictable nuisance unless it can be maintained and justified under the provisions of the Ontario Statute. And if the work can be justified only under the provisions of this latter statute the municipality of Parkdale cannot, in my opinion, be heard to say that the work which they have caused to be done was not caused to be done, or done, under the only statute which authorized it to be done.\nThe terms of the agreement ignore the idea that the municipality of Parkdale was entering into it, if it was competent for it to do so, merely as agents of the railway companies who were the only principals in the matter and who were acting merely under the authority and control of the Railway Committee. On the contrary, the municipality of Parkdale is in the agreement treated as a principal equally as are the railway companies. The clause that all parties to the agreement shall combine to endeavour to procure legislation to compel the city of Toronto to become a party contributing to the expense of the work, as also the clause whereby the railway companies provide that they will incur no responsibility as to the draining of the subway into the Queen street sewer, and indeed all the clauses of the instrument, are quite inconsistent with the idea of the municipality of Parkdale being in any other position than a principal equally with the railway companies; and, in short, the agreement in all its substantial parts is, as it seems to me, precisely such an one as the parties thereto might have entered into under the provisions of the Ontario statute 46 Vic. Ch 45.\nThen we find that on the 26th November, 1883, a contract for construction of the subway in the shape of an indenture between Arthur William Godson, of the city of Toronto, contractor, of the first part, and the corporation of the village of Parkdale of the second part, was laid before the council of the municipality of the village, when the following by-law was passed:\nBY-LAW OF PARKDALE.\nBe it enacted a by-law of this municipality that the Reeve and Clerk be authorised to execute the agreement between the municipality and A.W. Godson providing for the building of the Queen street subway, and to affix the corporate seal thereto.\nAccordingly the contract under which the work has been done was executed as directed by this by-law, and the work commenced by Godson under that contract.\nThereupon the plaintiffs instituted proceedings in the High Court of Justice for Ontario against the city of Toronto and the village of Parkdale. The case made by their statement of claim was that the defendants, acting together under the authority of the Ontario statute, 46 Vic. ch. 45, had entered into a contract with Godson to execute works which injuriously affected the plaintiffs\u2019 property, and that by reason of their having, as was alleged, done so without having passed by-laws as required by the statute, it was impossible for the plaintiffs to obtain compensation under the Municipal Acts as provided by the statute; that the plaintiffs had suffered damage to a large amount by Godson\u2019s acts under his contract with the defendants, and the plaintiffs claimed an injunction restraining the continuance of such wrongful acts and an order compelling the defendants to place the road in the same state as it was in before the said works were commenced, and for pay- ment of said damages and costs.\nThe defendants severally filed defences to the said, claim of the plaintiffs, in which they severally denied that the wrongful acts complained of had been done by them respectively or that they were, severally, in any way liable in respect thereof. On a motion for an interim injunction the consideration of it was deferred to the hearing of issues joined on the above defences. It being apparent at the trial upon the facts appearing as above detailed that the city of Toronto had in fact taken no part in committing or causing to be committed the acts complained of, and that the defence set out in the statement of defence of the village of Parkdale could not be sustained, and that the actual defence which was offered on behalf of that municipality was that in acting as it did it was merely acting as the agent of the railway companies above named who, as was contended, were acting under the control of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council under the authority of the Dominion statute, 46 Vic. chap. 24, and therefore had a right to cause the works which were complained of to be done, could not be entered into on the record as it stood, and the plaintiffs insisting upon their right to recover damages against the municipality of Parkdale upon the record as it stood, and offering evidence to show the extent of such damages, a discussion took place before the court between counsel for both parties in which counsel for the municipality of Parkdale contended that His Lordship before whom the case was being tried should not assess the damages; that if it was found that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages, the principles upon which such damages should be assessed, should be laid down in any judgment His Lordship might deliver, and a reference should be had to ascertain the amount; that the parties were before His Lordship to test the question, whether the plaintiffs were, or not, entitled to recover any damages, and if they were, the rule under which compensation should be made; and he submitted that what was necessary to get at on the trial was the legal points and the construction of the statutes and the cases, as the facts were few and might be conceded, and he suggested that the reasonable course to pursue would be shortly to get at the facts and that then the question of law should be disposed of, and that the amount of compensation, if the plaintiffs should be held to be entitled to compensation, should be the subject of a reference. This suggestion was concurred in by counsel for the plaintiffs who accordingly requested His Lordship to take a note that in case His Lordship should adjudicate in favor of the plaintiffs upon the right to compensation there should be a reference to the Master as to the amount. This arrangement having been made, both parties amended their pleadings and the cases were proceeded with. The amended statement of claim alleges that the plaintiffs claim no relief as against the city of Toronto, but submit that the other defendants should be ordered to pay their costs. It then alleged that the defendants, the village of Parkdale, allege that the new subway (in the original statement of claim mentioned) is being constructed by certain railway companies under the alleged authority of and pursuant to the requirements of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council in pursuance of the Dominion statute 46 Vic. ch. 24, and that the railway companies and the corporation have entered into an agreement dated 24th November, 1883, which has been confirmed by a by-law of the village, and that the subway is being constructed pursuant to said agreement with the railway companies and under a contract entered into by Parkdale and pursuant to the authority and agreement of the said Railway Committee, and that the said village of Parkdale claim that they are not liable for any damages or injury to the plaintiffs by reason thereof, whereas the plaintiffs contend that the true effect of the said agreement between the railway companies and the village of Parkdale and of the contract entered into by them for the construction of the said subway is that the said subway is being constructed by the last named defendants and not by the railway companies, and that the said defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, are liable to the plaintiffs for the injuries and wrongs complained of. And the plaintiffs further allege that even if the said Railway Committee required or authorized the construction of the said subway, which the plaintiffs deny, the said committee had no power to do so; and that the railway companies did not take the necessary steps under the statute in that behalf prior to the commencement of the work, and did not file in the proper office in that behalf the necessary plans and book of reference, and the plaintiffs submit that the said defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, cannot shield themselves from their responsibility in the premises by any order or requirements of the said Railway Committee or by any rights which may be possessed by said railway companies. And the plaintiffs submit that the only authority under which the defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, can legally construct said subway is the Statute of Ontario above referred to, 46 Vic. ch. 45, and if it should be held by the court that the defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, are authorized by said statute to construct the subway, and that their action in the premises is legal, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to compensation to be fixed by arbitration pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal acts, then the plaintiffs submit that the defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, should be ordered to pass the necessary by-laws and take the necessary proceedings connected with such arbitration, the plaintiffs offering on their part to take such proceedings, and the plaintiffs claim a mandamus ordering the defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, to proceed to arbitration in the above event, and the plaintiffs claim such further relief as the nature of the case may require. To this amended statement of claim the defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, filed an amended statement of defence wherein they allege that the subway is being constructed by the above named railway companies under the authority and pursuant to the requirements of the railway committee of the Privy Council in pursuance of the provisions of the Dominion statute 46 Vic. ch. 24. That the corporation of the village entered into the agreement of the 24th November, 1883, with the railway companies to which they crave leave to refer; that a by-law of the village confirming the said agreement was passed on the 3rd December, 1883; that the municipality, pursuant to the said agreement and on behalf of the said railways, entered into a contract for the construction of the said works which are being constructed under the said contract and pursuant to the said authority and requirements of the said Railway Committee and under the direction of an engineer appointed by the railway companies. That save as aforesaid the defendants, the corporation of the village of Parkdale, have taken no part in the construction of the said subway, and the same is not being constructed by them, and they claim that they are not liable in respect of any damages or injury which may be sustained by the plaintiffs by reason or on account thereof, and that no action has been taken by the city of Toronto or the village of Parkdale under the statute of Ontario, 46 Vic. ch. 45.\nUpon the above amended pleadings and the evidence given in the cause the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario was of opinion that the defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, were not constructing the works under the provisions of the Ontario statute and that they were not acting, and in point of law could not act, as the agents of the railway companies. That in entering into the contract with Godson, under the by-law of the municipality in that behalf, the work was done under the authority of the corporation who, not having proceeded in the manner directed by the statute which authorized them and the city of Toronto to do the work, were liable as wrongdoers to the plaintiffs, and he made a decree accordingly as follows[19]:\u2014\nThe defendants Parkdale appealed from this decree to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, which court affirmed the judgment, whereupon the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, a majority of which court, the Chief Justice dissenting, allowed the appeal and ordered the actions of the plaintiffs against the defendants to be dismissed with costs. On appeal from this judgment the case comes before us.\nIt has been well held, in my opinion, by the learned Chief Justice who tried the case and by the divisional court, that the municipality of Parkdale could not in point of law act in the premises, or justify the acts complained of, as agents of the railway companies; but it is, in my opinion, equally clear that in point of fact it was not as agents of the railway companies that the municipality were acting, if in point of law they could have so acted, but as principals jointly with the companies and as the chief and moving principals in whose interest and at whose instance and for whose benefit the work complained of was done. In 1881, as appears by the evidence of their engineer, Mr. Stokes, they devised the plan which was eventually in sub- stance carried out. They petitioned for and procured the passing of the Ontario statute which authorized them to enter into an agreement with the railway companies to procure the performance of the work. Before the Railway Committee made the order, now interposed by way of defence, and wholly independently of that committee who had no authority whatever over them, they entered into an agreement with the railway companies in which they mutually undertook to ask, and they accordingly did ask, the Railway Committee to sanction their agreement and to make an order in compliance with its terms. By this agreement, when reduced to perfect form and executed under the corporate seals of the railway companies and the municipality, the former covenant with the latter that they will by all means in their power afford to the municipality every facility for carrying out and completing the work, and except for the purpose of that agreement, that is, as I understand it, except for the purpose of sanctioning that agreement, the companies repudiate all jurisdiction of the railway committee in the premises. The municipality then pass a by-law affirming this agreement and providing means to give effect to it, wherein they recite that the by-law is passed because it was deemed essential to the interests of the village that the subway should be constructed, and that it was upon the strength of the agreement that the railway committee made the report which was subsequently approved by His Excellency the the Governor General in Council. This by-law is submitted to the ratepayers and approved by them who thereby authorise the levying on them a rate sufficient to raise their contribution as provided by the agreement towards the performance of the work. Thereupon a contract between the municipality and Godson, for the actual performance of the work, is prepared which is approved by a by-law of the municipality directing its execution, and which is accordingly executed under the corporate seal, and the work carried on to completion thereunder. It is impossible under these circumstances to say that the municipality were not acting as principals throughout in the transaction, or that the agreement with the railway companies or the contract with Godson were not acts of the corporation, and being acts of the corporation it would be a reproach upon the administration of justice if the corporation should not be liable. In Mill v. Hawker[20] the point did not directly arise, for there the action was against an individual who acted under the authority of a corporation in doing an act ultra vires of the corporation, but the language of Kelly C.B. is very strong as to the liability of the corporation, and is appropriate in the present case. He there says, p. 322:\u2014\nIt was indeed once imagined, though on very technical grounds, that trespass would not lie against a corporation, and it is so stated in Comyn\u2019s Digest Franchises, F. 19. But besides that many authorities are to be found in the Year Books to the contrary, the law is now well settled that upon any tortious act committed by a corporation, or under its authority or by its direction, trover or trespass in maintainable.\nAmong the authorities cited by him is that of Yarborough v. The Bank of England[21], which has much learning on the subject and wherein Lord Ellenborough shows that a corporation may be made liable as disseisors; and many other instances are there cited of corporations being made liable for torts by writing under their seal. The Chief Baron then adds, p. 323:\nIt was argued that no action could be maintained against the board on the ground that the resolution and the order to the surveyor were ultra vires. But I apprehend that this is a misapplication of the term ultra vires. If the board, by resolution or otherwise, had accepted a bill of exchange, directing their clerk or other officer to write their corporate name or title across the bill drawn upon them for a debt, this would have been ultra vires and no holder of the acceptance could have recovered the amount against them. It would have been void on the face of it, and it is immaterial to consider whether the individuals who had written or authorized the acceptance would have been liable to any, and if any, to what, action at the suit of a holder for value. But it is otherwise with an act merely unlawful or unauthorized as a trespass or the conversion of a chattel. If such an act is to be deemed ultra vires, and therefore no action would lie against the corporate body by whom it has been authorized, it is clear that a corporation would not be liable for any tort at all committed or authorized by them.\nThen referring to Poulton v. London and South Western Railway Company[22], \u201cthat case,\u201d he says.\nShows that there is no implied authority by a railway company to their servants to do an illegal act. Here no question arises upon an implied authority, for this board have expressly authorized and commanded the surveyor to do the act complained of.\nNow in the case before us the acts complained of are not ultra vires in the sense of being altogether beyond the scope of the power of the corporation, but are only wrongful, if wrongful, in the sense of their not having been done in the manner in which, if done, they were within the corporate powers of the municipality. They were corporate acts. And in the case of Bissell v. The Michigan Southern Ry. Co.[23] the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, in a very learned judgment, have held that for corporate acts, although they may be ultra vires, corporations may be held responsible in tort. If the acts here complained of were not within the powers conferred upon the municipality by the Ontario statute, 46 Vic. ch. 45, and for that reason were wrongful, we must, nevertheless, hold that, as done, they were done by and under the authority of the corporation so as to make the municipality liable to the plaintiffs. But in my opinion, as I have already pointed out, the contract entered into between the municipality and the railway companies, and that between the municipality and Godson, authorising these contracts, were all acts within the power conferred by 46 Vic. ch. 45, and being acts capable of being supported on the authority of that statute, which is the only statute in virtue of which the municipality of Parkdale could have done the acts, they cannot, for the purpose of evading liability to the plaintiffs, be heard to say that they did not intend to act under the authority of the only statute which authorised them to do, and justified them in doing, the acts complained of. Whatever may have been the effect, if any, which the order in council had on the railway companies as enabling them to interfere with, close up, and alter the streets of the municipalities, as to which it is, for the reason I have already given, unnecessary in this action to express any opinion, it had no effect whatever so as in any manner to affect the construction of the agreement entered into between the municipality and the railway companies, which must be construed, according to its terms, as a voluntary agreement entered into between the respective parties thereto. In virtue of the above contracts and by-laws the plaintiffs might, in my opinion, have appointed an arbitrator and have called upon the village municipality to have appointed one on their behalf under the statute. It was competent for either party to initiate proceedings by arbitration. There was no necessity, however, for such arbitration being had before the works should be proceeded with, as no lands of the plaintiffs were taken. Their complaint only being that their property would be injuriously affected by the works it might be that in the exercise of prudence the plaintiffs should prefer postponing the arbitration until the whole of their injury should be made apparent by the completion of the works. We see now that in this case there was no question as to the fact of the injury, and that the sole matter in contestation was the liability of the defendants to indem- nify the plaintiffs for this injury, whatever its amount might be, so that at some time, and in some shape, the question of liability would have to be raised and determined before the plaintiffs could reap the fruits of any arbitration. It might be, had the plaintiffs proceeded to call on the judge of the county court to appoint an arbitrator for the municipality in default of their appointing one themselves, that the judge would have suggested that it would be more convenient that the question of liability should be first determined. It is quite reasonable, as it appears to me, that it should be; and such question might be raised at the choice of the plaintiffs by a motion for a mandamus or by an action for a mandamus of which nature the present proceeding is. The Queen v. Wallasey Board of Health[24]; Fotherby v. Metropolitan Ry. Co.[25]; Jones v. Stanstead, Shefford & chambly Ry. Co.[26]; Pearsall v. Brierley Hill Local Board[27].\nIn my opinion the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration being made in their favor of their right to recover compensation from the defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, under the provisions of the Ontario statute 46 Vic. ch. 45, and that upon the plaintiffs appointing an arbitrator on their behalf a mandamus should go commanding the municipality to appoint one on their behalf, but for the arrangement made at the trial upon the municipality being allowed to amend their statement of defence so as to raise upon the record the question of their liability, which arrangement I think dispenses with the necessity for a mandamus. By that arrangement it was agreed that in case the court should be of opinion that the defendants, the municipality of Parkdale, were liable to compensate the plaintiffs for the injury sustained by them, a reference to ascertain the amount should be directed to a referee by the judgment and decree of the court in this suit. Very slight alterations in the decree made in the cause will, as it appears to me, be sufficient to make it applicable whether the liability of the defendants arises under the provisions of the Ontario Statute or as wrongdoers. Such alterations are:\n1. Expunge the word \u201cwrongful\u201d before the word \u201cacts\u201d where it occurs in the second and third paragraphs of the decree as made.\n2. In the third paragraph between the first and second words insert the following: \u201cit having been agreed, upon an order being made at the trial for liberty to the defendants, the corporation of the village of Parkdale, to deliver an amended statement of defence for the purpose of raising on the record their substantial defence, namely, the question of their liability in the premises, that in case the court should be of opinion that the corporation were liable to make compensation to the plaintiffs for the injury sustained by them, the question of the amount of such compensation should be submitted to a referee under the direction of the judgment and decree of the court in this suit.\u201d\n3. Strike out the words \u201cand to the defendants, the city of Toronto\u201d from the 4th paragraph of the said decree.\n4. Insert after the 5th paragraph a 6th paragraph, dismissing the plaintiffs claim as against the defendants the city of Toronto with costs.\nAs so varied the decree as made by Chief Justice Wilson to stand. I cannot see that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover these costs over against the corporation of Parkdale, for, as appears by the evidence and the amended statement of claim, the city of Toronto were not parties to the injury inflicted on the plaintiffs by the corporation of Parkdale and were not necessary parties to this suit.\nThe order will be that the appeal be allowed with costs to be paid to the plaintiffs by the corporation of Parkdale in all the courts, and the decree as varied be ordered to be made in the court below.\nIn West et al.\nv.\nThe Village of Parkdale\nand\nThe City of Toronto.\nThe only difference between this case and the last is that the property of the plaintiffs, which is injuriously affected, J is situate within the limits of\nthe city of Toronto, but as the work done is one and indivisible, and as all the damage which has been inflicted on property in the city of Toronto, equally as in the village of Parkdale, has been occasioned by the work done under the contract entered into by the corporation of Parkdale for the construction of the work, which contract it was competent for that corporation by the 2nd clause of the Ontario statute to enter into separately from the city of Toronto, the corporation causing the injury must compensate the parties suffering all the injury resulting from their act. The orders on this appeal and the decree in the court below in both cases will be the same.\nWhether the compensation to be paid for injuries caused by the work is to be treated as part of the cost of construction of the work, and whether as such the corporation of Parkdale can compel the railway companies to contribute their share of such compensation as part of the cost of construction under their agreement to contribute to such further sum as might be necessary to complete the work, is a question with which the plaintiffs are not concerned.\nAppeals allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant West: Blake, Kerr, Lash & Cassels.

On the day that the arbitrators met the company executed an agreement for a crossing over the said land, in addition to the money payment, and it appeared that the arbitrators took the matter of the crossing into consideration in making their award. The amount of the award was less than the sum offered by the company, and both parties claimed to be entitled to the costs of the arbitration, the company because the award was less than their offer, and the owner because the value of the crossing was included in the sum awarded which would make it greater than the offer.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that under the circumstances neither party was entitled to costs.\nAppeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of Galt J. in the Divisional Court[1], refusing a mandamus to compel the County Court Judge to tax appellants' costs.\nThe respondent's land having been taken for purposes of appellants' railway, notice was given with offer of payment as follows:\u2014\nNOTICE.\nTo C. J. Philbrick, M.D., of Toronto.\nTake notice that the lands required by and to be taken by the said The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company from you for the purposes of their railway, may be described as follows: All and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises being composed of parts of lots Nos 47, 49 and 51, as shown, on lot 17, concession 2, from the bay, township and county of York, and being a strip of land 66 feet wide, lying 33 feet on each side of, and measured at right angles to the centre line located for The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company, which said centre line may be more particularly known and described as follows, that is to say: Commencing at a point on the west limit of lot 47 aforesaid, distant 35 feet 10 inches, measured northerly along said limit, from the south-west angle of the said lot; thence north-easterly along a curve to the left of 2,865 feet radius, 1,021 feet to the intersection of the east limit of lot 51 aforesaid, as shown on the sketch attached hereto, and containing 1 54\/100 acres to the same, more or less, and is set out on the plan hereto annexed.\nThat the powers intended to be exercised by the said The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company with regard to the lands above described are the acquiring of the said lands for the purpose of constructing and thereafter of operating their railway thereon.\nThat the said The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company are ready and willing and hereby offer to pay the sum of thirty-six hundred and thirty-five dollars as a compensation for the lands above described, and as a compensation for such damages as you may sustain by reason or in consequence of the exercise of the powers above mentioned; and that in event of your not accepting this offer, His Honor Judge Kingsmill is to be appointed as and will be the arbitrator of the said The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company.\nH. Lockhart Gordon,\nSolicitor for The Ontario and Quebec Railway Company.\nDated at Toronto, this 23rd day of November, 1883.\nThe offer of payment contained in the above notice was not accepted, and an arbitration was had, which resulted in a money award $119 less than the sum offered by the company. The respondent, however claimed that he was entitled to a crossing which the company had agreed to make, and that the arbitrators had considered the value of the crossing in making up the award Shortly before the arbitrators met an agreement was drawn up by the company for construction of the crossing, but was not executed; it was claimed, however, that it formed a feature of the evidence before the arbitrators, and was drawn up for that purpose. Under these circumstances the railway company claimed costs which the county court judge refused to allow, and he finally, some time after these proceedings commenced, taxed costs against them. The statute under which the claim for costs is made is sec. 9, sub-sec. 19 of the Consolidated Railway Act. It provides as follows: \"If, in any case, when three arbitrators have been \"appointed, the sum awarded is not greater than that \"offered, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by \"the opposite party, and be deducted from the compensation; \"but if otherwise they shall be borne by \"the company, and, in either case, they may, if not \"agreed upon, be taxed by the judge.\"\nApplication was made to Mr. Justice Galt for a mandamus to compel the judge to tax the company costs, and also for a writ of prohibition to restrain him from taxing costs against them.\nThe learned judge held that the agreement or offer for the crossing was made by the company before the arbitration, and was included in the sum awarded for damages, and he refused both applications.\nThe Court of Appeal sustained this judgment, holding, as to the mandamus, that as the notice by the company contained no mention of a crossing, and the award did, the latter was not made upon the basis of the matter contained in the notice; and as to the writ of prohibition, that if the costs against the company were taxed the writ was useless, and if the judge had no power to tax the taxation would be futile.\nG T. Blackstock for the appellants.\nThere is only one case in which the land owner is entitled to costs, namely, where the award exceeds the amount offered. The judge had no authority to decide on crossing, nor to send matter back to arbitrators. The company put in agreement with reference to crossing. Respondent went on himself, claiming that the amount offered was not enough. They may have taken crossing into consideration. He was entitled to crossing without any agreement. Act 1884, ch. 11, sec. 9, provides for a crossing in cases of this kind. Brown v. Nipissing[2] decides that the word \"at\" should be read \"and\" and the railway companies were compellable to provide crossings. The meaning of the legislature there is clearly shown by the statute of 1884, sec. 9. If the land owner did not wish to have the subject taken into consideration he should have objected before the arbitrators. It is not competent for the county court judge to do anything but compare the sum given with the sum agreed and tax or not tax accordingly And if you find that the arbitrators did take the crossing into consideration, then I submit that the respondent was entitled to that any way, and it is no part of this case. To say that the company are not entitled to costs, is a decision that the crossing is worth $119. The court say this was not an arbitration under the statute at all. But the award purports to be an award under the Railway Act of 1879. We claim under the express provisions of the statute of 1883, ch. 24 sec. 8. The judges of the Court of Appeal proceed upon sec. 9, act of 1884.\nIn order to make out a title to costs at all, land owner must show the court that the amount awarded is greater than the sum offered. Here there is no pretence that it is greater. But the court says that this, in effect; is not an award under the statute at all. I say the county court judge had nothing to give him jurisdiction except the statute. There was no consent to arbitration outside of the statute. Cites Wheeldon v. Burrows[3]; Pinnington v. Galland[4]; Gale on Easements[5]; Davies v. Sear[6].\nAll the judges have decided that the land owner was not entitled to his costs but the county court judge taxed them all the same. We showed in Court of Appeal that he did carry out his threat and tax costs against us, and we wish to prevent him paying money to the party.\nDr. McMichael Q.C. and Shepley for the respondent.\nFirst as to the right of the land owner to the crossing. He never had any such right. When the statute empowers a company to take land which they never would have had otherwise, unless specifically provided in the statute, no one has the right to cross that land. The case was discussed in many Great Western cases, and never was any such right set up. By the original statute the company had to make crossings, but this has been amended by substituting the word \"at\" for \"and.\" Brown v. Nipissing[7] decides that they had to make the crossings before they could make the gates. The former statute compelled them to make crossings. The alteration is only that if they are bound to furnish crossings they shall make them. The agreement is one by which they agree to make crossing. We never accepted it. The court has held that having made it they are bound.\nThe question here is not so much on the statute as on the reference to arbitration. They have express powers which they intend to exercise. If the effect of that is that they propose to take the land and effect a complete severance of those lands, the damage that would result to respondent would be very great.\nWhen a company indicate to a man that they will take his land from him it is prim\u00e2 facie that they will take it without putting him to any cost. That is the rule in England unless the party is deprived of costs by express provision of a statute. In this case we should not be visited with costs unless we have violated the law. The statute provides a penalty; that is when the award is not greater than the offer. My learned friend puts great stress upon the word \"sum\" as if it only meant sum of money, but other matters may come in to make up a sum.\nInstead of saying we will take the land and simply assume the value of the land and damages, they have said \"we will make a crossing.\"\nThat was in consequence of the case Baby v. Great Western Ry. Co.[8]. They only offered a sum of money, and thinking over the circumstances afterwards they gave evidence to show how much the damages were diminished by giving the crossing.\nWhat I contend is, that the state of facts contemplated by the statute in which the land owner should be compelled to pay costs has not arisen.\nCites Fitzharding v. Gloucester and Berkeley Canal Co.[9]; Pearson v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[10]; Gray v. North Eastern Ry. Co.[11].\nIf they had included the crossing in their notice we would have been able to consider whether or not we would accept that offer.\nQueen v. Brown[12].\nThe question we had to consider was whether the sum offered was sufficient to compensate for what they contemplated doing under their notice.\nCites Morse, petitioner, &c.[13]; High on Extraordinary Legal Remedies[14].\nG. T. Blackstock was heard in reply.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think there was no proper arbitration under the statute, the arbitrators not having adjudicated upon the offer made by the company, the only basis upon which they had a right to proceed, but on that offer coupled with a crossing, not contemplated in the offer but matter in addition to it, which, obviously, materially affected the estimate of damages the property would sustain, and consequently the amount to be awarded for compensation, it being abundantly clear that such amount without an open crossing would be much greater than would be awarded for a severance with an open crossing.\nUnder such circumstances I agree with the court below that the company are not entitled to costs. On the other hand, it is quite clear that the land owner is not entitled to costs, inasmuch as he has not brought himself within the terms of the statute entitling him to costs. If the costs have been taxed to him, as alleged, I can only say, in the language of the court below, that it is a perfectly futile proceeding; he can only recover them by action, and it is clear that if he is not entitled to them the mere taxation cannot establish a liability on the company to pay them. FOURNIER J.:\u2014Dans cette cause il s'agit d'une demande de la part de l'Appelante, d'un bref de mandamus pour faire ordonner au juge de comt\u00e9 de taxer les frais faits sur un arbitrage pour expropriation en vertu de la section 9, ss. 19 de l'Acte des Chemins de fer, 1879; en m\u00eame temps que d'une demande d'un bref de prohibition pour faire ordonner au m\u00eame juge de s'abstenir de taxer les frais faits par l'Intim\u00e9 sur le m\u00eame arbitrage.\nUne offre de la somme de $3,635.00 comme compensation pour le terrain requis par l'Appelante, ainsi que pour les dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'expropriation et de la mise en op\u00e9ration du chemin de fer fut r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faite \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9.\nCette offre ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, des arbitres furent nomm\u00e9s. Au jour fix\u00e9 pour leur r\u00e9union, le 27 d\u00e9cembre 1883, mais avant de commencer la preuve, le conseil de l'Appelante produisit un acte de d\u00e9claration (deed poll) par lequel la compagnie s'engageait \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 un passage sur le chemin de fer dont la construction allait s\u00e9parer son terrain en deux parties et le laisser sans moyen de communication entre les deux. Le passage ainsi offert n'\u00e9tait pas indiqu\u00e9 dans le plan qui accompagnait les offres. Apr\u00e8s une longue enqu\u00eate, les arbitres en vinrent \u00e0 la conclusion, que la somme de $3,516 serait une compensation suffisante pour le terrain et les dommages. Ainsi une somme moindre que celle offerte fut accord\u00e9e. Sans l'offre post\u00e9rieure d'un passage, la compagnie aurait eu indubitablement droit \u00e0 ses frais. La r\u00e8gle \u00e0 ce sujet est \u00e9tablie comme suit par la ss. 19, sec. 9 de l'acte ci-dessus cit\u00e9:\nIf in any case when the arbitrators have been appointed, the sum awarded is not greater than that offered, the cost of the arbitration shall be borne by the opposite party, and be deducted from the compensation, but if otherwise they shall be borne by the company, and in either case they may, if not agreed upon, be taxed by the judge.\nMais le fait d'avoir ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 ses offres en argent, l'offre d'un passage a chang\u00e9 la position des parties; elles ne se trouvent plus dans les conditions d'un arbitrage d'apr\u00e8s le statut qui exige que l'on ne puisse proc\u00e9der qu'apr\u00e8s un avis de dix jours contenant, \u00e0 part de la description du terrain requis, la description des pouvoirs que la compagnie entend exercer sur le terrain\nLa ss. 15 de sec. 19 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que si dans les dix jours apr\u00e8s le service de tel avis, le propri\u00e9taire n'a pas fait conna\u00eetre le nom de son arbitre, alors le juge pourra nommer un arpenteur provincial comme seul arbitre pour faire l'\u00e9valuation de la compensation; et la ss. 16 dit que si dans le m\u00eame d\u00e9lai de dix jours, le propri\u00e9taire fait conna\u00eetre le nom de son arbitre, alors les deux arbitres nomm\u00e9s en choisiront un troisi\u00e8me. Dans les deux cas le propri\u00e9taire a droit \u00e0 un d\u00e9lai de dix jours pour consid\u00e9rer s'il acceptera ou refusera l'offre qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Dans ce cas la compagnie n'ayant point donn\u00e9 avis \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 de son intention de lui accorder un passage et ne lui ayant fait cette offre qu'au moment du proc\u00e8s, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi priv\u00e9 de l'avantage du d\u00e9lai que lui accordait la loi pour consid\u00e9rer s'il devait accepter ou refuser cette nouvelle offre. En introduisant la question du passage offert, l'arbitrage a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sur une offre diff\u00e9rente de celle que les arbitres \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9cider. L'offre d'un passage para\u00eet, d'apr\u00e8s les termes de la sentence arbitrale, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en consid\u00e9ration par les arbitres qui d\u00e9clarent que \"even with the open crossing,\" la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9e d'un tiers par la construction du chemin et l'obstacle qu'il met \u00e0 son acc\u00e8s. Bien qu'ils n'aient pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9 la valeur de ce passage, on ne peut pas dire qu'ils accordent moins que les offres puisque, par leur sentence, ils accordent \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 un passage qui ne lui avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offert suivant la loi. Les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s des arbitres n'\u00e9tant pas en conformit\u00e9 du statut, il s'ensuit que la r\u00e8gle qu'il \u00e9tablit pour la taxe des frais ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e au cas actuel, et qu'il n'y a pas lieu \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de mandamus pour faire proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la taxe des frais.\nLa demande d'un bref de prohibition est maintenant sans objet, car il para\u00eet par un document au dossier, que le juge, en pr\u00e9sence des deux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la taxe des frais. Quoi qu'il en soit, cette taxe n'affectant en aucune mani\u00e8re le droit que peuvent avoir les parties de demander ou refuser le paiement des frais de l'arbitrage en question, elles auront \u00e0 se pourvoir autrement.\nEn cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. The party here applies to have his costs taxed. When these lands were taken for the purposes of the railway company an offer was made of the amount fixed by the party who valued it, which the owner thought insufficient. After that had been done the company gratuitously made a conveyance of a crossing at a particular place over the railway to the part of the respondent's land which had been cut off. The respondent having rejected the offer made to him, in the first place the matter went to arbitration, as I take it, on the submission which preceded the conveyance of the company. The arbitrators, no doubt considering that the respondent was to have the benefit of the crossing mentioned in the conveyance, reduced the amount to be given for damages, and in consequence the amount awarded by the arbitrators was less, by a small sum, than that tendered. Now the question here is as to costs. Where the amount tendered is found to be insufficient, the railway company is liable to pay the costs of the arbitration, otherwise the costs are to be paid by the owner of the land. The latter has not shown this, but from the evidence it would have been otherwise if the conveyance of the crossing had not been considered by the arbitrators and the amount of the damages consequently reduced. The award, for that reason, I think, was not a good one, embracing the subject of the crossing conveyed subsequent to the submission.\nUnder these circumstances, I take it that the award, being contrary to the submission; is invalid. Where parties disagree the law provides a mode of settling the disagreement, but it must be on the terms of the statutory requirements.\nUnder these circumstances then, the company is not entitled to the costs in question. I do not think it necessary to decide anything in regard to the costs of the other party. I should think, however, that neither party is entitled to costs. In my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that, upon the facts appearing in this case, the appellants were entitled to their costs under the peremptory provision of the statute in that behalf, and that the rule nisi for a mandamus to the county judge of the county of York, commanding him to tax those costs, should have been made absolute, and that therefore this appeal should be allowed with costs and a rule absolute for the mandamus be ordered to be issued from the court below.\nThe appellants, having been unable to agree with the respondent upon the amount of compensation to be paid to him for certain land of the respondent required for the road-bed of the appellants' railway, served upon the respondent a notice, as required by the Consolidated Railway Act, in the following terms:\u2014[See p. 289.]\nThis notice was accompanied with the certificate of a sworn surveyor for the Province of Ontario to the effect that the lands mentioned in the notice, as intended to be taken by the railway company, were required for the Ontario and Quebec railway; that he knows the said lands so required and the amount of damage likely to arise from the exercise by the railway company of the powers mentioned in the notice; and that the sum of thirty-six hundred and thirty-five dollars offered by the said the Ontario and Quebec Railway Company in the notice mentioned was, in his opinion, a fair compensation for the lands in the notice described and for the damages that may be sustained by reason, or in consequence, of the exercise of the powers in the notice mentioned. A sketch of the manner in which the railway was intended to pass through the land, along the whole front thereof, but not showing where the appellants contemplated that the respondents should have a crossing, was annexed to the notice. This notice and certificate conformed with the requirements of the statute in that behalf, and accordingly the respondent appointed his arbitrator who, with the company's arbitrator, appointed a third arbitrator to act with them under the provisions of the statute for the purpose of ascertaining and determining, by the award of any two of them, the amount of said compensation to be paid to the respondent by the said railway company, and evidence was duly entered into for that purpose. It is unnecessary to refer to the fact that Judge McDougall, junior judge of the county court of the County of York, was subsequently appointed and substituted as third arbitrator in the place of the person first appointed to that position, for such substitution took place by agreement between the parties for that purpose made. Two of the three arbitrators made their award in writing signed by them and annexed the same to the notice of arbitration, above set out, served upon the respondent, and they did, by such their award, adjudge and award that the said Ontario and Quebec Railway Company do pay the sum of three thousand five hundred and sixteen dollars as compensation for the lands thereinafter described; and after giving a description of the land precisely as it is decribed in the notice of arbitration annexed to the award, the award declared that the arbitrators so making the award, awarded:\nThe said above mentioned sum as compensation for such damages as the said C. J. Philbrick may sustain by reason or in consequence of the exercise of the powers of the said railway company with regard to said lands as set forth in their notice herein.\nAnd they thereby further certified, in accordance with a provision to this effect in the statute, that in deciding on such compensation they had taken into consideration the increased value that would be given to the lands or grounds of the said C. J. Philbrick, through or over which the said railway will pass, by reason of the passage of said railway through or over the same, or by reason of the construction of the said railway, and that they had set off the increased value that would attach to the said lands or grounds against the inconvenience, loss or damage that might be suffered or sustained by reason of the said company taking possession of, or using, the said lands; and by a memorandum at the foot of their award they declare that the above amount of $3,516.00 was made up as follows, namely:\nFor area of land taken 1 54\/100 acres\n$ 924 00\nFor depreciation of balance of property by reason of construction of road through property, interfering with access, &c., even with open crossing\n2,592 00\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nIn all\n$3,516 00\nThe amount so awarded is less than the sum which had been tendered by the company to the respondent by the sum of $119.00.\nNow by the Consolidated Railway Act it is enacted that: If by any award of arbitrators made under this act the sum awarded exceeds the sum offered by the company, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the company, but if otherwise they shall be borne by the opposite party, and be deducted from the compensation, and in either case the amount of such costs if not agreed upon may be taxed by the judge.\nThe amount awarded having been less than the sum offered by the company they claimed to be peremptorily entitled to their costs under this clause, and the judge of the county court having refused to tax them, alleging as his reason that, in his opinion, the respondent, and not the appellants, was entitled to the costs of the arbitration, the appellants applied to the Divisional Court of Common Pleas for a rule nisi for a mandamus addressed to the judge of the county court of the county of York, commanding him to tax to the appellants their costs, and for a prohibition forbidding him to tax any costs to the respondent. Upon argument this rule nisi was discharged with costs, and the rule discharging such rule nisi has been upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. These judgments proceeded upon the assumption that what the company, by the terms of their notice served on the respondent, offered him $3,635 for was the right of constructing their railway upon the slip of 1 54\/100 acres along the whole front of the respondent's land, consisting of 15 acres, in such a manner as to cut off all possible access for the respondent to his land, consisting of 12 acres, lying to the north of the railway which separated such part from the only highway by which the respondent could have any access thereto, without giving to the respondent, or allowing him to have, any means of access whatever across the railway, and so in effect to render wholly valueless all the respondent's land not taken by the company for the road-bed of their railway; and upon the further assumption that the law enabled the company thus, at their arbitrary will and pleasure, so to injure the defendant's property not taken, and that upon an arbitration had under the statute upon a notice framed in the terms of the notice in this case the arbitrators would have been bound to estimate the amount of compensation to be paid to the respondent upon the basis that by the terms of their notice and offer of compensation the appellants claimed to have, and had, the right of utterly excluding the respondent from all access from the highway in front of his land across the railway to the 12 acres lying to the north thereof; and that the appellants having, immediately before the opening of the arbitration, left with the arbitrators, for the benefit of the respondent, an obligation duly executed under their seal whereby they bound themselves, their successors and assigns, to make and maintain, at their own costs and charges, an ordinary roadway crossing, with cattle guards on each side thereof, over the railway upon the division between lot 45 and said lot No. 47, which said roadway crossing should be of the width of 66 feet; 33 feet of such roadway being upon lot 45 and 33 feet being on lot 47, this was a wholly new offer from that contained in the notice and was made too late; and that the effect of the appellants lodging such obligation with the arbitrators was to make the award made thereafter to be an award not within the statute so far as the question of costs was concerned, and that to entitle the appellants to costs the arbitration must be one proceeding strictly upon the footing of the terms of the notice, which it was held that the award in this case was not; for that the arbitrators must have attached some value, although how much did not appear, to the railway crossing which the appellants had bound themselves to make and maintain. If this contention be well founded it must rest wholly upon the ground that (as an incontrovertible proposition of law) the terms in which the notice is framed require the construction which has been put upon it, for the evidence, I think, establishes beyond all question that the appellants never entertained the idea of excluding, or thought that by appropriating for the road bed of their railway a strip of 1 54\/100 acres extending along the whole front of the respondents land, they had any right to exclude, the respondent from all access across the railway from the highway in front, to that portion of the respondents land on the other side of the railway which was not taken or required by the company for the purposes of their railway. The evidence shows that the invariable practice of the company has been to make crossings in all cases of severance. The gentleman who valued the land and damages for the company, with a view to negotiating with the respondent for the amount of compensation to be paid to him, if possible without going to arbitration, says that he had several interviews with a Mr. Wickson, acting as attorney for the respondent, and with a Mr. Turner, engineer and surveyor, deputed by the respondent to negotiate with him as the company's valuator for a settlement, and that in all these conversations it was agreed by the witness, upon behalf of the company, and was perfectly understood that the respondent was to have a crossing or crossings; that it was known to all interested that a proper crossing would be provided; and he says that it was not supposed to be necessary that it should be mentioned in a notice of arbitration that such was to be provided. Another gentleman, one of the firm of the appellant's solicitors, says that he endeavored to effect a settlement without an arbitration with a Mr. Hoskin, acting as the respondent's solicitor, and that in his negotiations for that purpose he informed Mr. Hoskin that the company would provide a proper crossing, or proper crossings, and that, in fact, if the respondent wished it they would provide three crossings for him, one on each of his lots which consisted of five acres each. That the respondent was aware of these offers would appear from the fact that he himself gave evidence that before the arbitration he spoke with this gentleman with reference to crossings, and that he asked him to put into writing what the company would do with reference to crossings; and the gentleman who acted as valuator for the company said that when it was found that no settlement could be made by agreement with the respondent he advised the preparation of the obligation which was subsequently executed under the company's seal to prevent any misunderstanding about the matter, locating the crossing where it is located by that obligation as the place where it would be most beneficial to the respondent.\nNow does the notice indicate any intention of the appellants to exclude (assuming them to have the right to exclude) the respondent from all access between the highway and his lands north of the railway, which are severed from the highway by the railway? It certainly does not in express terms, nor can it, in my opinion, be said to do so by implication. The notice expressly says that the sum of $3,615 is offered as compensation for the land described therein as taken, being 1 54\/100 acres for the road-bed of the railway, and as compensation for such damages as the respondent might sustain by reason or in consequence of the appellants constructing, and thereafter operating, their railway thereon. If, then, the notice served by the appellants for arbitration with the respondent is susceptible of the construction which has been put upon it, it must be because the law imperatively requires such a construction, notwithstanding that the appellants never intended to exclude, and never supposed they had a right to exclude, the respondent from all access from the highway, across the railway to his land not taken by the company, and in my judgment the law does not require, or indeed admit of, any such construction. Doubtless in an arbitration of this nature it is a matter of great importance that the parties should before the arbitration, or at least during its continuance, come to an understanding as to the number and the sites and the nature of the crossings to be given by the company to a land owner whose lands are severed by the railway, whether the severance be of one part of his land from other parts or from a highway; for the compensation to be given to the land owner for the inconvenience which the severance may occasion to him may be increased or diminished accordingly as the number and the sites and the nature of the crossings to be given may afford more or less convenience. Thus in the case before us it appears upon the evidence of the respondent's own engineer and surveyor that a crossing at any other place than at the west limit of lot 47 (precisely where the appellants have by their obligation under seal located it), would be utterly useless, and that having it even at this westerly limit of lot No. 47, a road which must needs be made on the respondent's land to reach the table land which rises upwards of 50 feet at a very short distance from the railway will cost $200 more starting from the crossing on the railway than it would cost if made from the highway in front of the land before the railway was located. This was evidence proper to be considered by the arbitrators in determining whether the offer made by the appellants and mentioned in their notice of arbitration was sufficient compensation, but it is one thing to say that in estimating damages sustained by a land owner by reason of severance of his land it is proper that the arbitrators should be shown where and what number and what nature of crossings the railway company propose to give, assuming them to be bound to give all reasonable crossings in the absence of a special agreement with the land owner dispensing therewith, and quite a different thing to say that this information must be inserted in the notice of arbitratration under the statute, and in default thereof that the notice must be construed as indicating the intention of the company that the land owner shall have no crossings and as an offer of compensation to be paid to him upon the basis that he shall not have any right whatever to cross the railway to or from his land. An award made on such a basis could not, in my opinion, be sustained. In a case like the present a land owner cannot, in my opinion, be deprived of his right to cross the railway somewhere unless by an express agreement voluntarily executed by him divesting himself of such right which for the reasons given by me in Clouse v. The Southern Ry. Co.,[15] I conceive to be a right vested in him by law as of necessity, of which he is not divested by the Consolidated Railway Act or by any other Act. Now the arbitrators by their award have declared that the sum of $3,516 by them awarded is given as compensation for the land taken by the company and for such damages as the said C. J. Philbrick may sustain by reason, or in consequence of, the exercise of the powers of the said railway company with regard to the said lands as set forth in their notice, which is annexed to the award; in other words, as it appears to me, that for what the company had offered the respondent, $3,635, the arbitrators award $3,516. The recital in the award of the company's execution of the obligation as to the crossing makes no difference in this respect, in my opinion. It is, therefore, in my opinion, quite a mistake to say that the execution by the company of that obligation after the service of the notice of arbitration and its deposit with the arbitrators constituted the arbitration which was had thereafter to be one not within the statute, so as to entitle the appellants to their costs under the provisions of the statute in that behalf.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Wells, Gordon & Sampson.\nSolicitors for respondents: McMichael, Hoskin & Ogden.\n[1] 5 O.

Ritchie C. J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne J J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE )\nInsolvent Act 1875\u2014Secs. 28, 29, 30\u2014Sureties liability of.\nHeld where an official assignee under the Insolvent Act of 1875 has taken possession of an insolvent estate in that capacity and subsequently the creditors have, by a resolution passed at a meeting of the creditors, continued him as assignee to the estate without exacting any further security, and while acting as such assignee he makes default to account for moneys of the estate that the creditors have recourse upon the bond given for the due performance of his duties as official assignee.\nAPPEAL and cross appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the appellant,\nThis was a proceeding instituted by respondent es qualit\u00e9, 30th September, 1879, under sec. 69, Insolvent Act of 1875, which provides that any one may obtain an order of a judge authorizing him to take proceedings when assignee refuses. One Felix Rieutord is the creditor in this case, suing in the name of the present assignee.\nIn the year 1875 one Olivier Lecours was appointed official assignee under Insolvent Act, 1875.\nOn 26th August, 1875, the appellant and one Joseph Brunet became sureties to Her Majesty for the benefit of all interested to the extent of $6,000 for due performance of Lecours in the duties of his office as official assignee as required by 28th section of this Act. That section is as follows:\u2014\n28. Each person so appointed assignee or joint assignee, shall hold office during pleasure, and before acting as such shall give security for the due fulfillment and discharge of his duties in a sum of two thousand dollars, if the population of the county or district for which he is appointed does not exceed one hundred thousand inhabitants and in the sum of six thousand dollars if the population exceeds one hundred thousand such security to be given to Her Majesty for her benefit and for the benefit of the creditors of any estate which may come into his possession under this Act; and in case any such assignee fails to pay over the moneys received by him or to account for the estate, or any part thereof, the amount for which such assignee may be in default, may be recovered from his sureties, by Her Majesty or by the creditors or subsequent assignee entitled to the same, by adopting in the several provinces, such proceedings as are required to recover from the sureties of a sheriff or other public officer.\na. The official assignee may also be required to give in any case of insolvency such further security as, on petition of a creditor, the court or judge may order, such additional security being for the special benefit of the creditors of the estate for which the same shall have been given.\nb. The official assignee shall be an officer of the court, having jurisdiction in the county or district for which he is appointed; he shall as such be subject to its summary jurisdiction and to the summary jurisdiction of a judge thereof, and be accountable for the moneys, property and estates coming into his possession as such assignee in the same manner as sheriffs and other officers of the court are.\ne. If it appears to the court or judge that an official assignee has been guilty of any fraud, breach of duty, or willful violation of any of the previsions of the Insolvent Act of 1875 or the amending Acts or has inserted any improper charge in any account or claim preferred by him against the estate, the court or judge shall forthwith make report of the facts to the Secretary of State of Canada, for the information of the Governor.\nThe bond is as follows: \u2014\nEXHIBIT No. 2.\nNo. 1501.\nKnow all men by these presents, that we, Olivier Lecours, trades? of the city of Montreal, in the District of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec in the Dominion of Canada (hereinafter called the principal), Joseph Brunet, trader, of the city of Montreal, in the District of Montreal in the Province of Quebec, and Charles Henri L\u00e9tourneux, merchant, of the city of Montreal, in the District of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, (hereinafter called \"the sureties,\") are held and firmly bound unto our Sovereign Lady the Queen, her heirs and successors, in the sum of six thousand dollars of lawful money of Canada, to be paid to our Sovereign Lady the Queen, her heirs and successors, for which payment, well and faithfully to be made, we find ourselves, and each of us, and the heirs, executors and administrators of us and each of us, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents, sealed with our respective seals.\nDated this twenty-sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five.\nWhereas \"the principal\" having been appointed to the office or employment of an official assignee in and for the city and district of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, is required by the law to give security to the Crown for the performance, fulfilment and discharge of the duties appertaining thereto; and the sureties,\" Joseph Brunet and Charles Henri L\u00e9tourneux have consented to become his sureties for such performance of the said duties, and this bond is given in pursuance of \" An Act further to amend an Act respecting the security to be given by the officers of Canada.\"\nAnd whereas this bond is also given in pursuance of \"The Insolvent Act of 1875\" to Her Majesty, for her benefit and for the benefit of the creditors of any estate which may come into the possession of the principal under the last mentioned Act.\nNow the condition of this obligation is such that if \u201cthe principal\" faithfully discharges the duties of the said office and duly accounts for all moneys and property which may come into his custody by virtue of the said office this obligation shall be void.\nAnd also that in case the principal\" as such assignee, fails to pay over the moneys received by him or to account for the estate or any part thereof, the amount for which \"the principal\" as such assignee may be in default may be recovered from the sureties by Her Majesty or by the creditor or subsequent assignee entitled to the same, by adopting in the said province such proceedings as are required to recover from the sureties of a sheriff or other public officer\n(Signed) OLIVIER LECOURS, [L.S.]\n\"JOSEPH BRUNET, [L.S.]\n\"CHARLES HENRI LETOURNEUX, [L.S.]\nSigned, sealed and delivered in presence or (Signed) H. F. RAINVILLE,\n\" WILLIAM F. BROWN.\n(True copy.) HUBERT, HONEY & GENDRON,\nP.S. C\nOn 26th February, 1876, Lecours as official assignee received from Houle & Co., of Montreal, insolvents, and came into possession of, immovable properties belonging to said firm.\nOn 22nd March., 1876, at a meeting of creditors of insolvents Lecours was, appellant alleges, appointed by them assignee to the estate under section 29 of Insolvent Act.\n29. The creditors at their first meeting or at any subsequent meeting called for that purpose, may appoint an assignee who shall give security to her Majesty in manner form and effect, as provided in the next preceding section, for the due performance of his duties to such an amount as may be fixed by the creditors at such meeting. In default of such appointment the official assignee shall remain the assignee of the estate, and shall have and exercise ails the powers vested by this Act in the assignee.\n30. As soon as the security required from the assignee appointed by the creditors shall have been furnished by him it shall be the duty of the official assignee to account to him for all the estate and property of the insolvent which has come into his possession, and to pay over and deliver to him all such estate and property, including all sums of money, books, bills, notes and documents whatsoever, belonging to the estate, and to execute in his favor a deed of assignment in the form H\nSubsequently Lecours sold by adjudication to Augustin Robert a certain real estate part of the insolvent estate. On 11th June 1876 by a deed Lecours to Robert, Lecours acknowledged to have received purchase price, $8,355.\nOn 29th March 1879 Rieutord attained from court an order commanding Lecours, the assignee, to deposit with a chartered bank the said purchase price.\nLecours did not obey this order and on 10th April 1879, respondent Dansereau was appointed assignee to the estate of Houle & Co. in place of Lecours.\nOn 16th September 1879 Rieutord obtained from the court permission to institute this action against the appellant for the whole amount of his surety ship, $6,000 which he alleged to be due to the creditors on account of Lecours' embezzlement. Action was taken in name of the newly appointed assignee.\nRieutord became a creditor of the insolvent firm, of Houle & Co. in the following manner. Phileas Racette was a creditor of said estate for $4,500 secured by builder's privilege. This claim was first transferred to one Joseph Brunet, and the latter having become insolvent, it was sold by his assignee to L. W. Sicotte, who in his turn transferred it to said Rieutord on the 29th October 1878, who paid $1,000 for it.\nThe defendant (now appellant) pleaded by demurrer that the facts alleged in the declaration were insufficient in law to justify his conclusions, inasmuch as it did not appear that the claims against the insolvent's estate amounted to $6,000, nor that Rieutord was a creditor for that sum; and also because it did not appear that Rieutord had the right to make use of the assignee's name to take the action\nThe defendant also pleaded six exceptions seeking the dismissal of plaintiff's action and on the present appeal relied on the\n1st Exception.\u2014That Lecours, when he made the sale to Robert was not acting in his quality of official assignee, but as an assignee named by the creditors, and that the security was given only for acts done by Lecours in his quality of official assignee ;\nAnd 2nd Exception.\u2014That Rieuoord is not creditor of the insolvent, his claim being only a pretended right of Brunet's, which had been irregularly sold and transferred by the assignee Lajoie to Sicotte, and by the latter to Rieutord.\nThe plaintiff replied generally to said please, denying all the allegations both of the demurrer and of the exceptions. The demurrer was dismissed and judgment was rendered in the Superior Court maintaining defendant's first exception, and dismissing plaintiff's action.\nOn appeal the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and condemned the appellant to pay the respondent the sum of $1,000, the amount he had paid for the debt due to Sicotte, Rieutord\u2019s claim being for the purchase of a litigious right.\nB. Globensky Q.C., for appellant.\nThe surety ship upon which this action is based covers only the acts performed by the official assignee, and when Lecours sold the property in question, he was not acting as an official assignee, but as an assignee to the estate appointed by the creditors.\nThe fact is admitted, but the legal proposition which we uphold is denied by our adversaries,\nThe jurisprudence upon this point is yet uncertain. In a case of Delisle et oil,. v. Letourneux ([2]) Mr. Justice Johnson has condemned the surety and in another of McNichols, es qualite, v. The Canada Guarntee Company ([3]) Mr. Justice Torrance has rendered a judgment in the same sense, but declaring that if this case had come before him previous to the judgment rendered in the case of Delisle et al. v. Letoumeux, he might have come to another conclusion. This last judgment was taken L to appeal and confirmed by three judges out of five, who were composing the court.\nIn Ontario, Mr. Justice Haggarty has decided the contrary in the case of Miller v. The Canada Guarantee Company (1).\nNow, in this case the judge in the Superior Court has maintained our plea, and this judgment has been reversed by four judges of the Court of Appeals, one of whom Mr. Justice Ramsay declares that the Chief Justice and himself had dissented from the majority of the court in the case of The Canada Guarantee Company v. Mc Nichols, and that, although his opinion was unchanged, he thought it right in a matter of this kind, where the interpretation of a statute only is involved, to adopt the jurisprudence established, leaving to a higher tribunal or to the legislature the responsibility of settling the court right if it is in error.\nEverybody is unanimous as to the rules by which surety ships are governed. Whether it be limited or unlimited it is always strictissimi juris and cannot be extended de persona ad personam, de tempore ad tempus, de. re ad rem and its effects must necessarily be restricted to the obligations derived directly therefrom. This is the principle admitted by the honorable judge who rendered judgment in this cause in the Superior Court.\nThe statute provides for the appointment of provisional assignees who receive the insolvent's properties, who have the safe guard of them and administer them until the creditors have had an opportunity of choosing an administrator themselves. This provisional assignee is called official assignee that is to say that he acts of office, by the mere enactment of the law, and by the only duty of his office, but, from the moment that the creditors have manifested their will and have made their choice, if the same person has been selected he does not act any more of office, nor by the only duty of his office.\nIn the ordinary sense, it is true that it is the same person, but in the legal sense, we pretend the contrary.\n2nd. The transfers by Lajoie to Sicotte, and from the latter to respondent, are null and void because the sale of the claim therein contained was made by private agreement, while it could only be made by public sale and at auction. Section 67 of the Insolvent Act is perfectly clear upon this point.\nThe assignee could not dispose of the property of which, he was the administrator, in any other manner than by conforming to the conditions exacted by the statute.\nThe nullity of Lajoie's transfer to Sicotte involves that of the transfer fron Sicotte to Rieutord, and consequently Brunet's estate and not Rieutord, are the owners of the claim\nOn the cross appeal I submit the consid\u00e9rant given by the Court of Queen's Bench, that the respondent cannot be entitled to more than he had paid is unanswerable. It being evident that Rieutord bought what is known in our law as litigious rights.\nBeique for the respondent:\nThe bond, as its terms state, was given in pursuance of the Insolvent Act of 1875 to Her Majesty for her benefit and for the benefit of the creditors of any \"estate which may come into the possession of the principal under the last mentioned Act And the undertaking of the sureties in said bond was that the principal should account for the estate or any part thereof\"\nThe terms are most general and indicate clearly that the bond given in favor of an official assignee is intended to cover every act of the latter performed at any state in the insolvency proceedings, whether such act be performed previous or subsequent to his remaining L or being continued in office pursuant to section 29 of I said act.\nThe act provides for the nomination of a number of official assignees to whom alone assignments can be made or who alone can take possession of the estate of an insolvent under a writ of attachment. It is to these officers who are constituted officers of the court, that the whole charge of winding up insolvent estates in the ordinary course of proceedings under the act is confided. Provision is made, it is true, by which creditors may, at a meeting called for the purpose, name another assignee, but there is no obligation upon them to do so and the act expressly states that in default \" of such appointment, the official assignee shall remain the assignee of the estate; and shall have and exercise \" all the powers vested by this act in the assignee And the official assignee who thus remains assignee of the estate unless removed by the creditors, is not required by the Act to give any further security, except when ordered by the court or judge, on petition of a creditor, while it is provided that a new assignee, if appointed by the creditors \"shall give security,\" it being then obligatory for him to give such security without the necessity of any order to that effect from the court or judge.\nThe respondent further submits that an official assignee remaining or being continued in office, pursuant to section 29 retains his character of official assignee. Otherwise, the power given by paragraph of section 28 cited above to the court or judge to report an assignee to the Secretary of State for dismissal by the Governor could not be exercised for acts done after such meeting of creditors, the term used in. said paragraph being official assignee, The interpretation put upon the law by respondent is in conformity to the practice prevailing throughout the entire country during the whole time the law was in force.\nOfficial assignees have never been required to give security in each estate, except as additional security in few instances, when they had already given security as official assignees. And this because it was well understood that the security provided was sufficient for the exigencies of the law. See Clarke, Insolvent Act of 1875 ([4]).\nAs to the second exception filed by defendant, now appellant, that the sale of the claim in question by Lajoie, assignee of Brunet's estate, to Sicotte, was not made in accordance with the law inasmuch as it was a private and not a public sale, the appellant has no quality to raise that question. Such an exception would lie only in favor of non-assenting creditors of Brunet's estate who themselves would not be allowed to question the validity of the transfer after having received their proportion of the price of sale. Moreover, it is of record that the question was raised between creditors of Brunet's estate and respondent and that the sale was maintained.\nOn the cross appeal I submit that if the interpretation given to the law on the main question by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench is correct the defendant should have been condemned to pay at least the full amount of Rieutord's claim to wit $4,500 and interest which together with the $1,033.24 already paid by him to Delisle et at is still within the amount of the bond.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench has treated Rieutord's claim as a purchase of litigious rights, and have granted him only the amount he paid for the claim.\nThis might have been set up by the defendant as a ground, of defence but it would then have been incumbent on him, instead of disputing his liability, to offer and pay to Rieutord his purchase price and incidental expense with interest, or made a tender there of. (See Art. 1582 Civil Code.)\nPothier, Vente, [par. 507].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C J.\u2014The Government by virtue of section 27 may appoint one or more persons to be official assignee, or assignees, or joint official assignees, in each of the judicial districts of Quebec Montreal and St. Francis, respectively, for the whole district, or for one or more electoral districts in the same. By section 28 security is to be given by the official assignee for the due fulfillment and discharge of his duties.\" Such security to be given to Her Majesty for her benefit and for the benefit of the creditors of any estate which may come into his possession under this act, and in case any such assignee fails to pay over the moneys received by him, or to account for the estate, or any part thereof, the amount for which such assignee may be in default may be recovered from his sureties by Her Majesty, or by the creditors or the subsequent assignee entitled to the same.\nBy sub-section a the official assignee may be required on petition of a creditor to give further security for the benefit of creditors of the estate as the court or judge may order.\nBy sub-section b official assignee is made an officer of the court having jurisdiction in the district for which he is appointed and subject to the summary jurisdiction of the court and judge thereof and accountable for moneys, property and estates coming into his possession as sheriff and as other officers of the court are.\nThen section 29 provides for the appointment of and security to be given by assignees not official as follows (1); Under this section it appears to me clearly contemplated, that unless another other than the official assignee, is appointed, the official assignee should continue assignee, and therefore, by the non-appointment of another, or, in the words of the act, in default of such appointment, the official assignee remains the assignee of the estate clothed with all the powers vested in the assignee, and this is very clearly shown by the 30th section which requires a transfer of the estate from the official assignee to the creditors' assignee. The enactment is as follows ([5]):\nAnd that it was so treated and acted on by the creditors is placed beyond all doubt by the action of the creditors. The following certificate clearly showing that so far from appointing a creditor's assignee they refrained from doing so and simply allowed Lecours the official assignee to continue as assignee.\nExhibit No. 1. du demandeur a l'enqu\u00e9te.\nActe de Faillite de 1875 et ses amendements\nProvince de Qu\u00e9bec District de Montreal\nDans l\u2019affaire de\nHOULE & COMPAGINE Faillis,\nOLIVIER LECOURS, Ex-Syndic.\nET\nJ.

C. DANSEREUTT, Syndic,\nNow, what does the bond say? \u201cLecours having been a appointed to the office or employment of an official as-signee,\" and being required by the law to give security to the Crown for the performance fulfillment and discharge of the duties appertaining thereto and the sureties Jos. Brunet and Charles Henry Letourneux, have consented to become his sureties for such performance of the said duties, and that the bond is given in Pursuance of an Act further to amend an Act respecting the security to be given by the officers of Canada, and after recuing that the bond is also given in pursuance of the Insolvent Act of 1875 to Her Majesty for her benefit and for the benefit of the creditors of any estate which may come into Lecours possession under the said Act. The condition of the bond is that if Lecouss faithfully discharges the duties of the said office, and duly accounts for all money and property which may come into his custody by virtue of the said office, then the obligations shall be void and in case Lecours as such assignee, fails to pay over the moneys received by him, or on account for the estate, or any part thereof, the amount for which he, as such assignee, may be in default, may be recovered from the sureties by Her Majesty or by the creditors or subsequent assignee entitled to the same, by adopting in the said Province such proceedings as are reacquired to recover from the sureties of a sheriff or public officer.\nWhen did Lecours cease to be official assignee? Having received this property as official assignee, when did he cease to hold it as such? By the title by which he received it, by the same title he disposed of it and never having ceased to be the official assignee, no time ever arrived when his sureties ceased to be liable for his acts as assignee, and his duly accounting for the property which came into his possession as such assignee. There was only one way in which the liability of himself and sureties could cease, and he and they, could be relieved from further liability therefor and that was on the creditors appointing another assignee, and, upon such assignee giving the security required by the statute Lecours in accordance with the 30th section should account to line and deliver over the estate. This was never done, and therefore the defendant cannot escape liability for the acts of Lecours as assignee.\nIt seems to me somewhat absurd to suppose that with or without giving any security, in this case without giving any security it should be the duty of the official assignee, as provided by the 30th sec, as soon as the security required Iron the assignee appointed by the creditors shall have been furnished by him to account to himself for all the estate and property of the insolvent which has come into his possession and to pay over and deliver to himself all such estates and property, including all sums of money, bills, notes and accounts whatsoever belonging to the estate and to execute in his own favor a deed of assignment in the form H, all entirely inconsistent with the official assignee becoming the creditors' assignee, but entirely consistent with the creditors neglecting or refusing to appoint a creditors assignee and with their expressing a willingness that the official assignee should continue and remain official assignee.\nWe are of opinion that both this appeal and crossappeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFournier Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I was inclined to hold on the first consideration of this case, that the parties were not liable but after a more careful consideration I think the appointment was simply a continuous one. The creditors had a right to exact further security they did not act on that right and no further security was taken The property came into the hands of the assignee subsequently to the meeting of the creditors, and if he was appointed by the creditors as a new appointment, would hold at one that he would not be answerable, but this appointment was a continuous one, and I think the surety is liable.\nAppeal dismissed with costs,\nSolicitors for appellant: Lacoste, Globensky, Bissaillon & Brosseau.\nSolicitors for respondent: Beique, McGoun & Emard.\n[1] 4 Dorion's Q.

The by-law, after setting out the fact of a petition for such work having been signed by a majority of the rate payers of the township to be benefited by the work, recited the report of the surveyor, by which it appeared that in order to obtain a sufficient fall it was necessary to continue the drain into the adjoining township of Dover. The surveyor assessed certain lots and roads in Dover, and also the town line between Dover and Chatham, for part of the cost as for benefit to be derived by the said lots and roads therefor. The township of Dover appealed from this report, under sec. 582 of 46 Vic. ch. 18, on the grounds, inter alia, that a majority of the owners of property to be benefited by the proposed drainage works had not petitioned for the construction of such work as required by the statute; that no proper reports, plans, specifications, assessments and estimates of said proposed work had been made and served as required by law; that the Council of Chatham, or the surveyor, had no power to assess or charge the lands in Dover for the purposes stated in the said report and by-law; and that the report did not specify any facts to show that the Council of Chatham, or their surveyor, had any authority to assess the lots or roads in Dover for any part of the cost of the proposed work; that the assessment upon lots and roads in Dover was much too high in proportion to any benefit to be derived from the proposed work, and that no assessment whatever should be made on the lands or roads in Dover as the work would, in fact, be an injury thereto; and that the report did not sufficiently specify the beginning and end of the work, nor the manner in which Dover was to be benefited.\nThree arbitrators were appointed under the provisions of the act, and at their last meeting they all agreed that the township of Dover would be benefited by the work, but R.F., one of the arbitrators, thought $500 should be taken off the town line, and W.D., another of the arbitrators, held that while the bulk sum assessed was not too great, the assessment on the respective lands and roads, and parts thereof, should be varied, but that this was a matter for the Court of Revision. A memorandum to this effect was signed by W.D. and A.E., the third arbitrator, at the foot of which R.F. signed a memorandum that he dissented and declined to be present at the adjourned meeting to sign the award, \u201cif in accordance with the above memoranda.\u201d Later, on the same day, W.D. and A.E. met and signed an award determining that the assessment on the lands and roads in Dover, and on the town line, made by the surveyor should be sustained and confirmed, and that the appeal should be dismissed, and that the several grounds mentioned in the notice of appeal had not been sustained. The Queen\u2019s Bench Division set aside this award on the two grounds, namely, of want of concurring minds in the arbitrators, and of defect in the surveyor\u2019s report in not showing specifically the beginning and end of the work. The judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division was sustained by the Court of Appeal. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, Ritchie C.J. dissenting, that the award should have been set aside upon the ground that it was not shown that a petition for the proposed work was signed by a majority of the owners of the property to be benefited thereby, so as to give to the corpora tion of Chatham jurisdiction to enter the township of Dover and do any work therein.\nThat the arbitrators should have adjudicated, upon the merits of the appeal, against the several assessments on the lots and roads assessed, as their award was, by secs. 400 & 403 of 46 Vic. ch. 18, made final, subject to appeal only to the High Court of Judicature, and it was not a matter for the Court of Revision to deal with at all as held by one of the arbitrators. That the award should have been set aside because it did, in point of fact, as it stood, profess to be a final adjudication against the township of Dover upon all the grounds of appeal stated in the notice of appeal, and did, in point of fact, charge every one of the lots and roads so assessed with the precise amount assessed upon them respectively, although, by a minute of the proceedings of the arbitrators who signed the award, it appeared that they refused to render any award upon such point and expressed their intention to be to submit that to the Court of Revision.\nThat the arbitrators should have allowed the appeal to them against the surveyor\u2019s assessment, and that their award should also have been set aside on the merits, because the evidence not only failed to show any benefit which the lots or roads in Dover which were assessed would receive from the proposed work, but the evidence of the surveyor himself showed that he did not assess them for any benefit the work would confer upon them, but for reasons of his own which were not sufficient under the statute and did not warrant them to be assessed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2], which set aside the award in an arbitration between the municipalities of Dover and Chatham.\nThe facts of the case are fully set out in the previous reports and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne in this court.\nPegley for the appellants.\nPractically, the question to be decided is, whether the award was valid or not.\nThe Cons. Mun. Act of 1883 contains the provisions under which the proceedings in this case have been carried on. See sections 570 to 590 inclusive.\nThere are two species of enactment in regard to the construction of drains. One where a drain goes near an adjoining township but does not enter it, and the other where it does enter the lands of the adjoining township. This case belongs to the second class.\nThe respondents will contend that in the absence of an express provision Dover could not be assessed for this drain, but it is submitted that sec. 579 applies to this case and is such an express provision.\nWe must read all the sections together to ascertain the mind of the legislature. I would refer to secs. 576, 578, 579, 580, 581 and 582, in which the language used is the same.\nTaking the grounds of objection as set out in the notice of the respondents, I would say as to the first, that the arbitrators were not functus officii; that what is claimed to be an award first made is merely a memo, of the intention of the arbitrators, and the subsequent finding was the proper award. Two of the arbitrators could sign. Sec 402.\nAs to the objection of want of concurrence in the minds of the arbitrators, I submit that there was such concurrence. They may have differed as to their powers, but that was all. They had no authority to distribute the assessment which must be done in the Court of Revision subject to an appeal to the County Court Judge. Grant v. Eastwood[3].\nThe next objection is, that the award was contrary to law and evidence. I submit that this award must be taken as the finding of a jury and the court will not inquire as to whether the award was too much or too little.\nAs to the objection that there was not a proper report of the surveyor, I submit that the evidence is clear that the surveyor pursued the usual course and the report is sufficient. It is contended that the full details should have been reported, but that would have been almost impossible to be done, and of very little use if it were done.\nAgain they say there was no proper by-law, and no proper petition. That objection is not open to them here. They proved the by-law themselves, and the by-law recited the petition. Montgomery v. Raleigh[4].\nIt is contended that Chatham had no power to carry their drain into Dover further than sufficient to find fall enough to carry off the water beyond the limits of Chatham, and could not assess Dover therefor.\nThe act provides how far the engineer can go and he has not gone farther than the law allows. The power to assess I have already pointed out.\nIn answer to the next two objections, it is submitted that the titles to the lands assessed in Dover are sufficiently set out in the report.\nIt will be contended that no power is given to the engineer to assess for bridges. But it is clear that where power to do a thing is given by an act there is, by necessary implication, power to do everything requisite to the completion of the work. See sec. 570 of the Act of 1881, and sec. 529 of ch. 24 of the R.S.O.\nRobinson Q.C. and Matthew Wilson for the respondents.\nThere are three or four important questions of law to be considered.\nWe contend, first, that there was no concurrence in the minds of the arbitrators to make the award relied on by the appellants.\nOne declines to sign the award altogether; another objects to the distribution. Who then is to sign an award confirming that distribution? The only award that could be made was one according to the memo., and we had a right to have the opinion of Douglas before the Court of Revision.\nThen we submit that the Engineer had no power to assess the lands and roads, or if lands, not roads, in the lower townships.\nSee the judgments delivered in the court below[5], and see sec. 284 of the Municipal Act of 1883.\nThe only case where power to assess is expressly given is in that of an upper township. Sec. 580.\nThen, if they had power to assess lands, had they power to assess roads also? That will depend upon the question whether or not the arbitrators had anything to do with the distribution of the assessment. That has occasioned great difference of opinion among the judges of the court below. It was supposed to be set at rest by two decisions in our court, Essex v. Rochester[6], cited in Thurlow v. Sidney[7] but they were found not to do so.\nIt is contended that there must be power to assess or else the provision as to giving notice, &c., would be useless. But a section merely pointing out a mode of procedure cannot enlarge power to assess. Wilberforce on Statutes[8].\nThe report is not sufficient as it does not specify the work to be done. It should be sufficient to entitle us to compel them to perform the work as we would have to pay the money whether it is done or not. Chatham v. Sombra[9].\nThe following authorities also were cited:\u2014\nNorthwood v. Raleigh[10]; Rome v. Township of Rochster[11]; Harrison\u2019s Municipal Manual[12].\nPegley was heard in reply. Sir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This case was very fully discussed by the learned judge before whom it was originally heard, and by the judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nChief Justice Cameron set the award aside on two grounds; first, the want of concurrent minds on the part of the arbitrators, and secondly, the insufficiency of the original report, in not disclosing the beginning nor the end of the work.\nHagarty C.J. thought the report not open to objection as not showing a fixed point of commencement; with the aid of plans he thought it readily ascertainable, and that it sufficiently fixed the amount to be assessed against Dover as to lots and roads; and did not think the objection fatal that the surveyors could only go into Dover as far as was necessary to get sufficient outfall; he thought, that in view of the opinion of Mr. Douglas, the award should not have formally sanctioned and affirmed the whole of the assessment, but should merely have affirmed the amount of the assessment as a whole, and not the detailed adjustment of the assessment as made on lands and roads. Yet strange to say, as Mr. Justice Burton points out, one of the reasons assigned by Dover against the validity of the award is \u201cthat the arbitrators did not confirm, nor intend to confirm, the different particular assessments.\u201d Mr. Justice Osler thought that Dover could not be legally assessed for and on account of the roads in Dover or for the town line; he also thought the surveyor\u2019s report defective, in not showing one of the termini of the proposed work, the last station being omitted in profile plans; also in not stating, as expressly required by section 578, that the work is to be constructed at the expense of both municipalities, and in what proportion. Mr. Justice Patterson thought that where roads derive a benefit from a work which is continued into the municipality, the same liability exists as is clearly imposed where the works do not extend beyond the municipality where they are commenced but greatly improve the roads of another; he did not think the report, plans, &c., open to the objection of want of definiteness, and as to removing obstructions below 240\u2014$350, it can have no force since the passing of 45 Vic. ch. 26, three weeks after the date of the report, and over a year before it was communicated to the head of the Dover Council and which enacts that the R.S.O. ch. 174, sec. 529, should extend to the removal of any obstruction which prevents the free flow of the waters of any stream. This is now in section 570. And as to the objection that the engineers had no right to continue the proposed deepening or drainage farther into Dover than sufficient to find fall enough to carry the water beyond the limits of Chatham, the learned judge says:\u2014\nI can find no proof in support of this objection. The evidence of two surveyors seems rather to suggest that the work should be carried farther than proposed, on account of the creek being obstructed.\nThe learned judge goes on to say that section 570 makes provision for passing by-laws for work which may be desirable, for determining what property will be benefited, &c., the proportion in which assessments should be made on the various portions of lands so benefited, and in every case of complaint by the owner, &c., to proceedings for trial of such complaint, and appeal therefrom, as under the Assessment Act. Reading section 581 with section 578, and with sections 580 and 570, the learned judge says:\u2014\nIt seems perfectly manifest that the servient municipality is in no way affected by the engineer\u2019s detailed assessment of its lots and roads, but is bound only by his apportionment of the aggregate amount between the two municipalities. That amount it distributes, by its own by-law, among its lands and roads in the same manner and with its same incidents of appeal to its own Court of Revision and to the judge, as the other municipality. Each may avail itself, to what extent it pleases, of the engineer\u2019s details; those details will, doubtless, as a matter of practice, be, in most cases, adopted and followed in the by-law, but the statute leaves both municipalities alike free to vary them.\nThe learned judge also thought the appeal from the report simply an appeal against the aggregate charge upon the municipality, and he did not think the award differs from the memorandum; he thought the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to deal with the apportionment, and the award disposes of the matters over which the arbitrators had jurisdiction. Therefore he thought the award good and that the appeal should be allowed.\nBurton J. thought the view taken by Douglas was the correct one, namely, that if one of the parties, or the municipality, complained of the assessment inter se, the proper course was to appeal to the Court of Review, when the by-law determining the assessment had been introduced, and it was a matter with which the arbitrators had no concern, As to the objection that the award proposes to confirm the assessment made by the surveyors on the roads and lots and parts of lots on the several proportions mentioned by him, and that the findings did not set forth, or show, or assess, or charge every road, lot, &c., in proportion, &c., that the arbitrators did not confirm, or intend to confirm, the different particular assessments, the learned judge thought that to hold the award bad on that ground would be to ignore what took place before the arbitrators, where the council for Dover wished them to consider the propriety of the several assessments, and also would be in the face of the admission by Dover in the objection to the award that it does not set forth or show or assess or charge every road, lot or portion of lot, &c. As to the sufficiency of the surveyor\u2019s report the learned judge thought the plans and profile, in connection with the report, intelligible enough, and he thought the only question the arbitrators had to deal with was the gross amount charged against the municipality, and that Douglas was correct in his view of the law, and the objection on the ground of want of concurrence between the two arbitrators, fell to the ground.\nThe main question as to the validity of the award seems to me to be: Were the arbitrators bound to pass on every assessment or charge on every road and lot, or portion of lot, according to the proportion of benefit the same, in the opinion of the arbitrators, derives, or will derive, from the work, or to confirm the different particular assessments? I think it was the duty of the arbitrators to pass only on the validity of the assessment in respect to the gross or bulk sum assessed, and not on the lands and roads, and parts thereof, assessed. It appears to me, that under section 580, and the sections referred to by Mr. Justice Patterson, that the only matter which is subject to appeal on the report, &c., served on the head of the council of the municipality into which the deepening or drainage is to be continued, is the adjustment of the proportion in which each of the two municipalities shall contribute, and no provision having been made for bringing the property owners before the arbitrators a fair inference, and, in fact, a fair construction of the statute, I think, is that they were, if dissatisfied with the individual apportionment, left to appeal from the assessment under the by-law to the Court of Review, or appeal as in ordinary cases, to have the assessment properly apportioned among themselves, without interfering with the gross or aggregate amount placed on the municipality, and this is the view of one of the arbitrators, and if correct his mere statement of it could in no way affect the validity of the award. In my opinion, the award is not bad in not determining this latter question. If, then, the duty was confined to determining only as to the correctness of the gross or bulk sum think the award good. The memorandum signed at the meeting at 9.15 a.m. of the 18th of May, 1883, was not the formal award, but simply a memorandum for drawing up the formal award, for the signing of which a time and place were fixed, namely, four o\u2019clock of the same day, at the same place, of which Fleck, the dissenting arbitrator, had full notice, and having declined, under his hand, to sign any award, and having, in like manner, also declined to be present at the adjourned meeting to sign the award it in accordance with the memorandum of the morning, and the formal award of the majority, as contained in such award, being in accordance with the memorandum of the morning as to the bulk or gross sum and costs, there was, on all matter so awarded, a consensus of opinion by the majority; the absence of Fleck, when the formal award was signed, did not, in any way, vitiate the award so made, the arbitrators not being functus officii as alleged.\nI cannot say the surveyor\u2019s report, with the plan and profile, does not disclose the beginning or end of the work; the starting point seems plain enough, and, although the right of the surveyor is limited to the point where he finds fall sufficient to carry the water beyond the limits of such (dominant) municipality, in this case he did so to remove obstructions from the stream, and the charges for work as to be done were $350. It is said this does not come within the terms of the statute, but if there is no sufficient fall without removing these obstructions, can it be said that until he removed them, he had found a sufficient fall, the intention, in my opinion, being, as Mr. Justice Cameron expresses it, to make it running, and not stagnant, water at that point? I think that Dover was assessable for and on account of the roads in Dover, and for the town line.\nI think there is a sufficient statement that the work is to be constructed at the expense of both municipalities, and that the proportions are made sufficiently apparent.\nIt is suggested that, in point of fact, Dover was not benefited by the work. Chief Justice Cameron thus disposes of this question.\nA knowledge possessed by the arbitrators of the locality may enable them to see benefits that I do not, and I would therefore, on the mere question of amount of benefit, defer to them.\nAnd Hagarty C.J.O., in the Court of Appeal, says:\u2014\nI share his (Chief Justice Cameron\u2019s) reluctance to interfere on that ground alone with the decision of the arbitrators, the more particularly as the dissenting arbitrator was willing to hold Dover benefited in a lesser sum than they awarded.\nThe strongest evidence, I think, is to be found in the fact that the arbitrator for Dover appears to have been unable to arrive at the conclusion that Dover derived no benefit, but, on the contrary, was of an opposite opinion, and differred from his co-arbitrators only as to the quantum of benefit, the majority of the arbitrators thinking the benefit was to the extent of $1,000, and the arbitrator for Dover putting the amount of the benefit at $500.\nBefore I should be presumptuous enough to interfere in a case, and on a point, such as this, and say the award was wrong, and that the court below were wrong in upholding it on this ground, in a matter on which the arbitrators and the judges of the court below, from local knowledge, are so much more capable of forming an opinion than I can presume to be, I should require that the case should be beyond all reasonable doubt, which, in my opinion, is by no means the case here.\nI entirely agree with the judgments of Patterson, and Burton JJ., and think this appeal should be allowed. FOURNIER J.\u2014I have not been able to come to that conclusion. I think the appeal should be dismissed,\nEach portion of the lots or roads should be assessed for its portion of benefit to be derived from the work done. This has not been done here.\nI doubt very much if any appeal would lie in this case, because these proceedings seem to me to be regulated by special acts, unless giving an appeal in matters of award would be applicable here.\nI have read the very full and exhaustive judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Gwynne, and concur in all that he says.\nHENRY J.\u2014After considering this case with a great deal of attention, 1 have satisfied my mind that the whole of the proceedings were unauthorized by any law. I will deal with it as presented by the argument, by the evidence, and by the opinion of the learned judges in Ontario, and then I will turn to the question of the legality of the proceedings.\nThe application for the work to be done to be presented to the town council as required by sec. 570 of the act, that is taking the act of 1888, is to be signed by a majority of the parties to be benefited. In this case a number of the parties interested in the township of Cover are reported by the surveyor as the parties who are to be benefited. No application was made to them to sign a petition; they were not called upon in any way to take part in this transaction. Now let us look at the statute, which I will read. (His Lordship read sec. 570 of the Municipal Act of 1883.)\nUnder that statute the council would have authority only in case a majority of the parties who are to be benefited by the improvement in the township should sign the petition.\nBut there is no provision made in this proceeding for obtaining the signatures of parties in that township to the petition, although alleged to be benefited. It would appear, if the provision of section 570 is to be studied, and for the purpose of carrying out what is intended, that the parties who are to be benefited should be all considered, and in that case, where the law provides that a majority of the parties to be benefited by the improvements must sign the petition, if they are resident out of the township they are not here as petitioners. The policy of that provision of the law is simply to enable a majority to force the minority to make the improvements. But if the township of Chatham is to be benefited and not Dover, and the majority in Chatham were to sign a petition and the council of that township could act on that petition and tax the people of Dover, the principle would not apply.\nI cannot think that a bare majority in the township of Chatham should originate proceedings where the contemplated works would extend into Dover, and that the legislature could be said to have endowed them with the power of making improvements that in the township of Chatham may cost $1,000, and in the township of Dover may cost four times as much, and the people in the latter taxed without having any voice or say in the matter. It seems to me that where the property is situated in two townships it would be necessary to show that the petition was signed by a majority of the persons to be benefited in both.\nI have already said that if the act authorised the proceedings, section 570 is the only provision in the law by which this right could be exercised in Dover, and I am of opinion that that section requires the petition to be signed by a majority of the persons to be benefited in both townships. The law making provision for an appeal from the decision of the surveyor allows such appeal to arbitrators whose decision shall be final on the whole question of benefit. It is in evidence that objections were taken and fyled with the arbitrators, who declined to consider them. I think it was the duty of the arbitrators to consider these objections. I do not think the award made was a good or binding one. It is a well known principle that if certain matters are left to arbitrators, who fail to consider them, the award is not good. The minutes in evidence show that several matters were not considered.\nAnother objection that I take is that the weight of evidence shows that Dover was not to be benefited by the change. Then, if this benefit is altogether for the township of Chatham, what right had that township to tax Dover?\nIf the improvement is made it leaves Dover according to the evidence just about where it is at present. But we have, I think, only to look at the evidence of the surveyor himself. He says:\nIn making the assessment in Dover I took into consideration that Chatham had made all these taps mentioned, and if Chatham had not done so, perhaps I would not have assessed Dover at all for this work. * * * I would not have assessed either lands or roads in Dover so high for this work if the cut off had not been made by Chatham.\nThe meaning of that is, that because Chatham had previously made a drain at its own expense, years afterwards it would have a right to tax Dover.\nAnd when we have, in addition to that, the almost certain evidence that Dover was not to be benefited in any way, I think the whole proceedings are inequitable.\nBut I have still another objection to the whole of the proceedings in this case. I am of opinion that they were all bad from beginning to end. Section 577 provides for the taxation of an adjoining township where the work to be done extends beyond the limits of the municipality where it is commenced. If the work of drainage in this case is commenced in Chatham and being a benefit to Dover, is brought up to the limits between the two townships, then this section applies.\nSection 577 is as follows: (His Lordship read the section.)\nNow how does the case stand? This act is not intended to allow one township to go into another, make a drain, and alter their bridges and roads and affect and tax the property owners. It is simply to come up to the limits, and the law provides that if the operation is beneficial to the adjoining township the latter may be called upon to contribute. But here Dover is sought to be taxed for a portion of the work to be done in Dover beyond the limits of Chatham. Now where is the law to be found to sustain such a claim? Surely if the legislature had intended that one township could go in and dig drains in and tax another it would have said so.\nThen I turn to section 578 and that section provides: (His Lordship read this section.)\nThat does not alter the other clauses. Then section 580 says: (This section was then read by His Lordship.)\nThat does not allow one township to go into another. The law protects civil rights and we are to construe the public statutes so as to prevent any interference with these rights.\nThen how are we to construe these sections? Plainly it must be that a township is not to operate outside of its own limits. How can we say that the statute intended one township to operate in another unless it so prescribes and enacts?\nThen section 582 provides: (His Lordship read this section.)\n\u201cIf the work being continued in its limits,\u201d that is, where it is brought up to the line and the other township benefited, the work being continued within the limits where it was commenced.\nBut if I had any difficulty in the construction to be put on these sections I think section 598 would settle it beyond all question or manner of doubt. That section says:\nWhere any works proposed to be constructed in any locality under section 570 affect more than one municipality, either on account of such works passing, or partly passing, through two or more municipalities, or on account of the lowering or raising of the waters of any stream or lake, which is contemplated in the proposed scheme of drainage, either draining or flooding lands in two or more townships, the county council of the county to which such municipalities belong, upon the application of the council of any of the municipalities affected, and without any preliminary petition from the owners of the property to be benefited, may pass by-laws for the purposes authorized by the said section.\nThe application for the improvement in question should have been brought before the county council. I think no one township could originate the proceedings, and contract for an expenditure of money, in another. The legislature says, \u201cwhere the work passes through two or more municipalities,\u201d which it did here, and section 59S clearly provides for a case of that kind and no one council is authorized to deal with it, but either may apply to the county council\nSo think that our judgment should be to dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne, in whose judgment I concur.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By the Municipal Institutions Act in force when the proceedings which are the subject of this appeal were instituted by the Township of Chatham, namely, ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, in its 529th section it is enacted that:\u2014\n(His Lordship here read the section) By the 530th section it is enacted that \u201csuch by-law shall, mutatis mutandis, be in the form or to the effect following:\u201d\nHere follows the form of a by-law framed wholly as applicable to the case of a work contemplated to be completed within the limits of the municipality in which it originates, leaving it to the draftsman of a by-law for a case coming within the 2nd sub-section of section 529, namely, to the case of a work extending beyond the limits of the municipality in which it originates, to frame a by-law applicable to such a case upon, the model (mutatis mutandis) of that given in section 530 for a work completed within the municipality in which it originates. To this model it will, however, in the case before us, be useful to refer for the purpose of seeing what the legislature has enacted should appear in a by-law fox executing works of this nature to make it a good by-law. The form is headed:\nA by-law to provide for draining parts (or for the deepening of , in , as the case may,) the township of , and for borrowing, on the credit of the municipality, the sum of for completing the same,\nProvisionally adopted the day of A.D.,\nWhereas a majority in number of the owners as shown by the last revised assessment roll of the property hereinafter set forth, to be benefited by the drainage (or deepening as the case may be) have petitioned the council of the said township of praying that (here set out the purport of the petition describing generally the property to be benefited).\nNow, from this clause it appears that the preliminary essential condition precedent, necessary to give the council jurisdiction to take any action which could have any binding effect whatever upon any persons sought to be made chargeable with any part of the cost of such a work, is that a petition should be presented to the council praying for the performance of the proposed work, describing its nature, and signed by a majority of the owners of the property to be benefited by the proposed work, which property should be designated in the by-law. The next clause is:\nAnd whereas thereupon the said council procured an examination to be made by , being a person competent for such purpose, of the said locality proposed to be drained (or the said stream, creek or water course proposed to be deepened, as the case may be) and has also procured plans and estimates of the work to be made by the said , and an assessment to be made by him of the real property to be benefited by such drainage (or deepening as the case may be) stating as nearly as he can the proportion of benefit which, in his opinion, will be derived in consequence of such drainage (or deepening as the case may be) by every road, and lot, or portion of lot, the said assessment so made, and the report of the said in respect thereof and of the said drainage (or deepening as the case may be) being as follows (here set out the report and assessment of the engineer or surveyor employed,)\nNow from this clause it appears clearly that the duty of the engineer employed to examine the work was, first, upon a survey to determine the total cost of the proposed work; and then to assess the whole of the property which, in his opinion, would be benefited by the proposed work, whether consisting of roads or lots, with the whole of such cost; the proportion of benefit to be derived by each road, lot, or part of lot, upon completion of the work being specially assessed against each such road, lot or part of lot. The by-law then proceeds:\u2014\nAnd where as the said council are of opinion that the drainage of the locality described (or the deepening of such stream, creek or water course, as the case may be) is desirable: Be it therefore enacted by the said municipal council of the said township of\npursuant to the provisions of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario\u2014\n1st. That the said report, plans and estimates be adopted, and the said drain, (or deepening as the case may be) and the works connected therewith, be made and constructed in accordance therewith.\n2nd. That the Reeve of the said township may borrow on the credit of the corporation of the said township of the sum of , being the funds necessary for the work, and may issue debentures of the corporation to that amount in sums of not less than one hundred dollars each, and payable within years, with interest at the rate of per centum per annum, that is to say in (insert the manner of payment whether in annual payments or otherwise) such debentures to be payable at and to have attached to them coupons for the payment of interest.\n3rd. That for the purpose of paying the sum of being the amount charged against the said lands so to be benefited as aforesaid other than lands (or roads, or lands and roads,) belonging to the municipality, and to cover interest thereon for years at the rate of per cent. per annum, the following special rates over and above all other rates shall be assessed and levied in the same manner, and at the same time, as taxes are levied upon the under mentioned lots and parts of lots; and the amount of the said special rates and interest assessed as aforesaid against each lot, or part of lot respectively, shall be divided into equal parts, and one such part shall be assessed and levied as aforesaid in each year for years after the final passing of this by-law, during which the said debentures have to run.\nHere follows a schedule of the lots assessed as benefited, with the amounts respectively assessed against each, by the engineer appointed to examine and report upon the work as appearing in his report to the council, and the by-law proceeds:\n4th. For the purpose of paying the sum of being the total amount assessed as aforesaid, against the said roads (or lands or roads and lands) of the said municipality and to cover interest thereon for years, at the rate of per cent. per annum, a special rate of in the dollar, shall, over and above all other rates, be levied, in the same manner and at the same time as taxes are levied upon the whole rateable property in the said township of in each year for the period of years after the final passing of this by-law, during which the said debentures have to run\nThe statute then provides by a second sub-section to the said 530th section that:\nIn the event of the assessment being altered by the Court of Revision or judge, the by\u2011law shall, before being finally passed, be amended so as to correspond with such alteration by the Court of Revision or judge (as the case may be).\nNow, it is to be observed that the form of by-law above given in sec, 530, and the whole of that section with its sub-section and of sec. 529 with all of its subsections except the second, relate exclusively to a work to be completed in the municipality in which it originates, and that this 2nd sub-section of sec. 529, which is the only one which relates to a work originated in one municipality and continued into another, provides that the originating municipality shall raise the funds necessary to defray the cost of the entire work, subject to be reimbursed (to use the language of the sub-section) \u201cas hereinafter mentioned.\u201d Upon the municipality in which the work originates the burthen of providing all the funds necessary for the completion of the entire work seems to be imposed, subject, however, to a right to be re-imbursed by the municipality into which the work is continued for such special benefit as the work shall confer on the lots and roads in the latter municipality.\nThe only provision made which authorizes a municipality in which a work originates to continue it into an adjoining municipality, or for reimbursing the former in such a case for any part of the cost of such continuance, is contained in the following sections: (His Lordship then read secs. 534, 536 and 537.)\nNow from these sections it is apparent that the only purpose for which the legislature has given to one municipality the extraordinary exceptional power of sending its officers into an adjoining municipality and of constructing any work of drainage therein, is to carry off the water brought down by the work commenced in an upper municipality, and the only case in which power is given to charge the municipality into which the work is continued, or the lands situate within the limits of such municipality, with any part of the cost of such work is in the event that the lands of the municipality (in which term I include its roads), or the lands of individual owners situate within the limits of the municipality, derive a special benefit from the work, and such power is limited to the extent of such benefit, by which term, as applied to such a case, I understand that the roads and lands so charged should derive such a substantial benefit from the work, beyond that which they respectively enjoyed independently of such work, as to make it plainly just and proper that they should be made to contribute to the cost of a work undertaken for the sole benefit of lands situate in another municipality, and actually necessary for effecting that object. As it is not competent for the engineer or surveyor of the municipality in which the work originates to do anything whatever, within the limits of the municipality into which the work is continued, beyond what is necessary to carry off the water brought down by the work done in the upper municipality, all the work done in the lower municipality must be regarded as being essential and necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose of the upper municipality, and the owners of property therein which is benefited thereby, the incidental benefit therefore, if any there be, to the roads and lots in the lower municipality should be very clearly established beyond all manner of doubt, to warrant the lands in the lower municipality being subjected, against the will of the owners, to contribute to the cost of a work wholly necessary for the benefit of the owners of the upper municipality. The assessment in such a case imposed by an officer of the upper municipality upon property situate in the lower municipality should be scrutinized with the utmost care and jealousy; and it is for this reason, I apprehend, that section 588 of ch. 174 R.S.O. has been amended by sec. 580 of 46th Vic. ch. 18, which came into force before the arbitration had in this case and applies to it, and enacts that:\nThe council of the municipality in which the deepening or drain- age is to be commenced shall serve the head of the municipality into which the same is to be continued (or whose lands or roads are benefited without the deepening or drainage being continued), with a copy of the report, plans, specifications, assessment and estimates of the engineer or surveyor aforesaid, and unless the same is appealed from as hereinafter provided it shall be binding on the council of such municipality.\nFor the purpose stated in the above section, and for all proceedings in this case subsequent thereto, this act, 46 Vic. ch. 18, which is an act in consolidation and amendment of the acts respecting municipal institutions, is the one which applies to this case before us, and I shall, therefore, henceforth refer to the sections of this act. The 581st section enacts that: (His Lordship read the section.)\nThis section, 570, is identical with section 529 of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, already set out in full.\nThe 582nd section enacts that: (His Lordship read secs. 582 and 583.)\nThe only sections necessary to be referred to in this connection are sections 400 and 403 by the former of which it is enacted that: (The said sections were read by His Lordship.)\nNow from these sections it is apparent that what were the matters referred to the arbitrators is to be determined by reference to the report, plans, specifications, assessment and estimates of the engineer, mentioned in the 580th section, and to the grounds of appeal stated in the notice of appeal mentioned in the 582nd section, all which documents taken together constitute the submission to arbitration; and the object of the arbitration, as appears by the 580th sec., is to determine whether or not the said report, plans, specifications, assessment and estimates of the engineer are to have binding effect to any, and if any to what, extent upon the council of the municipality into which the work is proposed to be continued, which, in the case before us, is the municipality of the township of Dover East. It becomes therefore necessary to refer to the said report and other documents mentioned in the 580th sec, and to the notice of appeal served on the township of Chatham, to determine what were the matters in difference between these two municipalities which were referred to the arbitrators in this case; but before doing so it will be necessary to draw attention to the condition of things as they existed before the making of the report, plans, &c., prepared by authority of the council of Chatham and served upon the council of Dover for the purpose of charging the latter township with a portion of the cost of a work deemed necessary to be constructed for the benefit of the owners of property in the township of Chatham.\nThe Little Bear Creek drain, the deepening of which is the work under consideration, was constructed several years ago along the marshes and low wet lands in Chatham, across the greater part of that township, until it reached Little Bear Creek where it flows close to the town line between Chatham and Dover East. The drain crossed the Prince Albert road, in the heart of the township, where the lands are very low and wet. This drain would have been quite ineffective for the purpose for which it was constructed without what is called the Prangley Tap, which was constructed by the county of Kent in the east end of the township of Chatham, and by which waters collecting in Camden and the eastern part of Chatham are drawn off to the river Sydenham. The township of Dover, as one of the townships of the county of Kent, contributed its share to the construction of this drain. Notwithstanding that the Prangley Tap carried off a quantity of water in the township of Chatham, which otherwise would have had no means of escape beyond the limits of the township except such as was afforded by Little Bear Creek drain and creek, the waters of the creek below the outlet of the drain overflowed its banks and damaged the lands in Dover. In order to drain the lands along the town line, between Chatham and Dover, and to relieve Bear Creek of a portion of the water so brought into it by Little Bear Creek drain, a drain, called the town line tap, was constructed within the limits of the township of Chatham close to the town line from Little Bear Creek drain, along the town line northerly. To the cost of this work the township of Dover contributed between $8,000 and $9,000; subsequently what is called the town line extension drain was constructed, in and by the township of Chatham, for the purpose of giving better outlet for Chatham waters and lessening the flow of water into Bear Creek, to which drain Dover contributed upwards of $1,000.\nIt was found, however, that the town line drain so constructed, with its extension, and Little Bear Creek drain and creek, were wholly insufficient to give effective drainage of the great mass of water collecting and lying in the heart of the Township of Chatham, and therefore that township, at its own expense, constructed a drain, called the Prince Albert Road Tap, along the Prince Albert road, to carry off a portion of the waters collected there and which the Little Bear Creek drain and creek, and the town line tap and extension, were incapable of carrying off So many small drains, however, have been constructed by individuals to drain their lots, and by the public to drain roads, which small drains are conducted into the Prince Albert Road Tap, and so low is the land at the Prince Albert road, and so great is the quantity of water which collects there, that the drain was quite unable, even with the assistance of Little Bear Creek drain, to carry it all off, and the Prince Albert road is much overflowed and dam- aged thereby. Besides the above drains, the township of Chatham has constructed other drains to carry off water collecting in Chatham, and which had no natural outlet except such as Bear Creek afforded, which creek was utterly incapable of carrying off all of such water. The municipality of the township of Dover, also at its sole expense, constructed in the westerly part of that township a drain called the Baldoon street drain, at the lower extremity of the work now proposed to be done, which falls into Bear Creek near its outlet.\nSuch was the state of things when Mr. W.G. McGeorge, an engineer and surveyor employed by the council of the municipality of the township of Chatham, made the following report, which is addressed to the reeve, deputy reeve and municipal council of Chatham township. (His Lordship read the report, which is set out in full in 5 O.R. 326.)\nSubjoined are two schedules, the one for the township of Chatham the other for that of Dover; to the former it is unnecessary to refer, as it is with the schedule of the township of Dover that we are concerned, which, as it is not long, it will be convenient to set out in full, for the purpose of showing precisely what it is that Mr. McGeorge did, and what it is that his report purports to adjudicate upon; for it is in the nature of an adjudication binding upon the municipality unless appealed from, and in case of appeal the award made by the arbitrators to whom the appeal is referred is absolutely conclusive and binding upon all parties, subject always to the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice, as we have seen by reference to the sections of the act above extracted.\nThe schedule in respect of the township of Dover is headed and is as follows:\nLittle Bear Creek drain west of Prince Albert road. Schedule of assessments on lands and roads in the township of Dover East, for benefit, for outlet, and for constructing a drain to carry off water brought down on lands to damage them:\nConcession 10, Lot 24\n$ 10 00\n\u201c 11, \u201c 24\n20 00\n\u201c 12, \u201c 24\n20 00\n\u201c 13, \u201c 24\n5 00\nE.

The profile annexed to the report, and also made part of it, shows that this drain was deepened upwards of three feet at the Prince Albert road to carry off water from the Prince Albert road drain and that this depth was continued with a fall of three feet to the town line tap where the bottom of Little Bear Creek drain, when deepened, will be between three and four feet below the bottom of the town line tap; from this point the deepening is to be in Little Bear Creek itself, which, at present, has a fall of about two feet from the town line to Baldoon street drain. The Little Bear Creek, when deepened, is to have its bed lowered to the level of the bottom of the Little Bear Creek drain, at the town line tap, which depth is to be maintained on a dead level to Baldoon street drain, so that instead of the natural fall which the creek now has, from the town line to Baldoon street drain, the current and flow of the waters in the creek, between these points, will be created and maintained solely by the force of the extra water, brought in at Albert road, coming down the Little Bear Creek drain on the fall of three feet given to it, from that point to the town line tap, and this tap will be of no use until the waters in Little Bear Creek drain rise high enough to enter the town line tap. The profile has at its foot, at station 239, the following entry which must also be taken as part of the report:\nContinue 300 rods further clearing bars and timber.\nNow, against this report and the assessment therein contained, and against all proceedings of the council of the municipality of the township of Chatham there upon, the municipality of Dover, in accordance with the above provisions of the statute in that behalf, appeals by a notice of appeal, in which the grounds of appeal are stated as follows:\nTo James Clancey Esquire, Reeve of the Township of Chatham and North Gore:\u2014\nTake notice that the council of the municipality of the township of Dover East and West do appeal against the pretended report of W.G. McGeorge, provincial land surveyor and engineer for Chatham aforesaid, for the deepening of Little Bear Creek drain, west from Prince Albert road, to the Chatham and Dover town line, and for the extension thereof into the township of Dover East beyond Baldoon street, and against the assessment made by the said McGeorge as mentioned in such report, and against all proceedings taken by the council of Chatham aforesaid thereon.\nAnd the grounds for such appeal are: (His Lordship read the grounds of appeal as set out in 5 O.R. 329.)\nThe notice then notifies Chatham of the appointment by Dover of an arbitrator to act on behalf of that township and of the name of such arbitrator, and calls upon the council of Chatham to appoint an arbitrator to act upon behalf of that township. An arbitrator having been appointed by Chatham in pursuance of this notice, and a third arbitrator having been also duly appointed, according to law, the matter in difference, as appearing by reference to the reports and other documents appealed against, and to the grounds of appeal as stated in the notice of appeal, whatever those matters were, became referred to the three arbitrators so appointed whose duty it was finally to adjudicate thereon.\nThe material question therefore is: What were the matters so referred?\nNow, it cannot, I think, admit of any doubt or question that the municipality of Chatham had no power whatever, by their engineer or otherwise, to carry any work originating in Chatham, and necessary for the drainage of Chatham, into the township of Dover, or to impose any burthen by way of assessment upon any lands or roads in Dover to reimburse Chatham for, or to pay, the cost of any part of such work, unless a petition, signed by a majority of the owners of property in the township of Chatham to be benefited by the proposed work, should be first presented to the council of the municipality praying that the proposed work should be undertaken and executed under the provisions of the statute. The presentation of such a petition so signed is a condition precedent to the acquisition by the municipality of the township of Chatham of any jurisdiction whatever over the township of Dover or over any lands situate therein. That no such petition ever was presented as would give to Chatham the jurisdiction over Dover in this case having been made one of the grounds of appeal against the validity of Mr. McGeorge\u2019s report, I cannot see upon what ground it can be held that such a matter was not one which should have been enquired into and adjudicated upon by the arbitrators. If none such had been presented the jurisdiction never attached, and in such case the report of Mr. McGeorge had no validity or binding effect whatever, and the appeal, as it appears to me, must have succeeded upon that ground alone. Now no express decision of the arbitrators has been given upon this point; the objection was taken by the notice of appeal and appears never to have been abandoned; it has been urged before the High Court of Justice for Ontario, on the motion to set aside the award, and has been repeated before us.\nThe onus of proving that the jurisdiction had attached lies plainly upon the municipality which assumes to exercise the jurisdiction, but no evidence appears to have been offered upon the point. The recital in the by-law of the township of Chatham, which was produced but with which the township of Dover had nothing to do, of the existence of a fact necessary to exist before the jurisdiction could attach, cannot have the effect of giving the jurisdiction.\nThe point was made a ground of objection to the award of the arbitrators upon the motion to set it aside made in the High Court of Justice for Ontario, and it is still pressed before us by the respondents as a reason against this appeal, and upon this ground, if on no other, I cannot see why the appeal of the township of Dover against Mr. McGeorge\u2019s report should not have prevailed.\nBut assuming the jurisdiction to have attached, then it became the duty of the engineer employed to report upon the work to set forth in his report a statement of all the several lots and roads in the township of Dover, if any there were, which in his opinion would be benefited by the completion of the proposed work, and to assess and charge each of such lots and roads with the amount of such benefit to be received by each. If the work should be for the benefit of Chatham alone, and should confer no benefit upon lands in Dover, no lands in Dover should be assessed; only such as should be benefited should be assessed, and each lot, separately, only with the amount of the benefit it should receive. If lots should be benefited, but roads not, then the lots only should be assessed, each to the amount of its own benefit, and the roads should not be assessed, or if roads alone should be benefited, then they alone should be assessed to the amount of such benefit, and the lots should not be assessed. Now what Mr. McGeorge by his report did, was to set out in a schedule, which was made part of his report, all the lands and roads in Dover which, in his opinion, would be benefited by the work, and to assess and charge each of such lots and roads with the particular amount of benefit which, in his opinion, each would receive. The township of Dover, in their notice of appeal, object to this part of his report upon the that the several lots and roads so assessed and charged with such burthen will not derive from the completion of the work a benefit to the amounts respectively assessed upon them, nor in fact any benefit at all, but that, on the contrary, the work will do them injury. This is the substantial ground of appeal upon this point, upon which, in my opinion, it was the duty of the arbitrators to have adjudicated. I cannot, I confess, comprehend how there can be any doubt upon this point The statute requires the engineer to assess and charge every lot and road, if any there be, which in his opinion is benefited, with the amount of such benefit, and to make the assessment so made by him part of his report. It further makes the report, including his assessments, binding if there be no appeal, but if there be an appeal, then the statute creates a special court of arbitrators to whom the whole report, and the matters in difference in relation thereto, and to its contents, which are stated in the notice of appeal, as grounds of appeal are referred; and it makes the arbitrators\u2019 award, on such matters so referred, to be conclusively binding upon all parties, which term \u201call parties,\u201d as here used, in my opinion, comprehends the owners of the lands assessed, as is apparent from section 400 of 46 Vict. ch. 18, which enacts that in cases of this nature one copy of the award shall be registered in the registry office of the county or division in which the lands affected are situate. For what purpose can this be supposed to be done except to perfect most effectually the charge of the several sums assessed upon the lands charged, and to give notice thereof to all purchasers of such lands or any of them. What the foundation is for the idea that, in a case like the present, there is a bulk sum charged by the engineer\u2019s report the propriety of which alone is what is submitted to the arbitrators, and that the manner in which such bulk sum is apportioned, and what are the lots among which it should be apportioned, and in what manner, are matters with which the arbitrators have nothing to do, but are reserved for after consideration by a Court of Revision, I am unable to see. There is nothing in the statute expressed to that effect, and no such thing can be implied from what is expressed. Such a construction would defeat what, in my opinion, appears to be the plain intention of the legislature, namely, that the award of the arbitrators should be conclusive and binding upon all parties affected by the assessment, and that by registering the award the lands so assessed should become irrevocably charged with the amount assessed against each. The by-law thereafter to be passed by the council of the municipality of Dover is merely for the purpose of levying by yearly rates, in the same manner and at the same time as other rates are levied, the amounts already effectually charged upon the lands assessed. Now that there is any bulk sum, in the report appealed from, which is assessed upon the township of Dover as such, that is to say, in any other sense than that the aggregate of the several sums charged upon the several lots and roads mentioned in the report of necessity makes a sum total or, if the term be liked better, a bulk sum is, in my opinion, quite a mistake. By adding up the several sums charged upon the several lots and roads assessed, we find, no doubt, that they amount to $1,479, which sum of necessity does bear a proportion to the amount of the whole cost of the work as estimated at $10,196 which proportion is well expressed, it is true, by the fraction 1479\/10196, and thus the proportion which Mr. McGeorge\u2019s report finds that the township of Dover should contribute to the proposed work can be ascer- tained, and this, indeed, is the only way in which such proportion can be ascertained consistently with the provisions of the statute, which is to charge severally the lands in Dover with the particular amounts by which they shall be respectively benefited.\nIf there be error in the items, or any of the items which compose the sum total, that sum total must be erroneous to the extent of such error in the particular items. Whether, therefore, there be any, and if any, what, error in the particular items, or in any and which of them, is the material question, and it requires adjudition upon each particular item.\nThe sum of $1,479, being arrived at in no other way than by addition of the several items charged upon the several lots and roads, is nothing more than a result of what Mr. McGeorge shows by his report that he did, which was, as he was required to do, to assess the particular lots and roads with the particular sums by which he says that, in his opinion, they will respectively be benefited by the work. That was the only thing done, and which his report represents as having been done, by him, and it is against the things so represented as having been done that the appeal was taken. If it should appear that all, or any, of the lots and roads assessed should not have been assessed for the reason that it does not appear that they would be benefited by the proposed work to the respective sums assessed upon them severally, or to any amount, the assessment would be bad as regards every lot and road so wrongfully or excessively assessed; the correctness of the several assessments was, in my opinion, one of the matters which was submitted to the arbitrators by the express terms of the notice of appeal; that, assuming the jurisdiction to have attached, was the very point upon which the arbitrators were called upon to adjudicate, and upon which they should have made their award so as to make it, as it is by the statute intended to be, conclusive and binding upon all parties. Whatever might be the difficulties and delay attending the proceedings which might be necessary to be taken for the purpose, that, as it appears to me, was their clear duty. There is no such thing mentioned in the report, nor, indeed, could there be, as a bulk sum, which, having been first ascertained in some unexplained or unsuggested manner, has thereafter to be apportioned among some lots and roads without any diminution of the bulk sum. The only bulk sum being the sum total of the assessments charged on the several lots and roads added together, that sum total must vary accordingly as it should be found that the assessments charged upon the several roads were properly or improperly charged.\nIf any of those assessments should be removed for the reason that the lots or roads on which they were charged would not be benefited by the proposed work the sum total must of necessity be diminished accordingly. If the lots would not be benefited, but the roads would be, the assessment charged upon the lots must be removed; so if the roads would not be benefited, but the lots would be, the assessments charged upon the roads must be removed; and in neither case could the amount deducted in respect of the one be charged upon the other, either in justice or common sense or by reason of anything expressed in the act, which, by providing a court of arbitration to adjudicate upon the matters in difference, plainly intended, as I think, that complete justice to all parties concerned should be finally administered by that court.\nNow the award, which was signed by two only of the arbitrators, after reciting the engineer\u2019s report and the assessments made by him upon the lands and roads in Dover mentioned in his report, and the appeal therefrom, and that the arbitrators had considered all the evidence offered before them, adjudicated as follows:\u2014\nFirst\u2014We order, award and determine that the said assessment upon lands and road in the township of Dover East and West, and the town line between the said township of Dover East and West, and the township of Chatham and North Gore, by the said George McGeorge, be sustained and confirmed, as the said lands and roads in the said township of Dover East and West will be greatly benefited and improved by the said work, and also the said town line road between the said municipalities of Dover and Chatham, and that the said appeal be and the said is hereby dismissed, and that the several grounds mentioned in the notice of appeal have not been sustained.\nNow that this award purports to be a full, final and complete adjudication upon every ground of appeal stated in the notice of appeal, cannot, I think, admit of a doubt. It determines, in effect, that the event which alone could give any jurisdiction to the township of Chatham to affect the township of Dover had occurred. It determines that every one of the assessments of lots and roads in the township of Dover, made by Mr. McGeorge, was just and proper, and that each one of those lots and roads would be benefited by the proposed work and to the amount charged upon it. In form it is perfect as a conclusive award which is by the act made binding upon all parties, subject only to being interfered with by the High Court of Justice to the jurisdiction of which court it was subjected; and I cannot doubt (if not interfered with by the High Court of Justice) that, if and when registered in the registry office of the county where the lands lie, it would irrevocably charge every one of lots and roads so assessed with the precise amount so assessed upon them respectively. The duty of the municipal council of the township of Dover to pass a by-law for levying these amounts by yearly rates within the period allowed by the statute for that purpose was simply ministerial, and no court of Revision, or other court, could ever review such assess- ments so confirmed. The registration of the award would irrevocably bind the several lands with the respective amounts so charged upon them respectively, subject always to the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice over the award. But that the arbitrators who signed the award never intended it to have the effect which, from its terms, in my opinion it clearly has, appears from a minute of proceedings before the arbitrators which, with the evidence taken before them, has been returned to the High Court of Justice for Ontario for the purpose of being used upon the motion made in that court by the township of Dover that the award should be set aside, for, among other reasons, the same reasons as had been stated in the notice of appeal to the arbitrators, and because the said findings and award of the arbitrators are contrary to law and evidence and the weight of evidence.\nFrom this minute of proceedings it appears that on the 18th May, 1883, all the arbitrators met to decide as to the award, when the following entry is made.\nThe arbitrators have considered it best to decide against the legal objections, and to decide against Mr. Wilson\u2019s contention, (Mr. Wilson was counsel for Dover) leaving him to bring them before the courts if he thinks proper.\nThe arbitrators all agree that Dover will be benefited by the work, Mr. Fleck holding that, on the evidence offered, five hundred dollars should be taken off the assessment on the town line road, the other arbitrators holding that lands and roads in the township of Dover are benefited to more than the amount of assessment and that it should be confirmed, but one of the arbitrators, Mr. Douglas, holding that while the bulk sum assessed is not too great the lands and roads and parts thereof so assessed should be varied, which it is competent for the Court of Revision to do. The arbitrators thereupon agree to confirm the assessment as above.\nMr. Fleck declines to sign the award.\nArbitrators now adjourn till 4 p.m. this day to sign the award at same place.\nI have already expressed my opinion to be that this view of Mr. Douglas, as to there being a bulk sum which could be correct although the items of which it is composed, or some of them, should be removed, is erroneous. The error, I think, consists in the application of sections of the act, which relate solely to a work constructed wholly at the cost of the municipality in which it is both begun and completed, to the case of lands in a township into which a work of an adjoining municipality is continued by and for the benefit of the municipality constructing the work, to which case the sections do not apply, and with respect to which special provision is made by other sections of the act. In the former case there is a bulk sum first ascertained, namely, the cost of the whole work, which afterwards is apportioned (without any diminution of the bulk sum, which of course cannot be diminished being the amount of the cost of the whole work,) in such a manner as may appear most fair and just, among certain lots and roads, even though the proportion of the whole cost which the several lots and roads would have to pay might be greater than any actual benefit that could be said to be conferred upon them respectively by the work. In the present case, where a work begun in and for the benefit of Chatham is continued into Dover, there is no bulk sum in so far as Dover is concerned as to it, the lands therein cannot be subjected to any charge except for the actual benefit each lot and road shall be considered to receive. There is no bulk sum to be apportioned among any lands in Dover. The only bulk sum in the case at all is the cost of the whole work, which must be borne by Chatham, except in so far as particular lots and roads, if any there be in Dover, can be said to derive benefit from the work, and these lots and roads can only be charged with a sum representing the actual benefit which can be fairly attributed to the work irrespective of any bulk sum.\nFor the reasons already given, I am of opinion that the Court of Revision has not, and cannot have, anything to do with a case of this kind. The Court of Arbitration is the final court (subject only to the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice) to adjudicate upon all matters in difference arising in a case of this kind.\nThe sec. 581 of 46 Vic. ch. 18, which provides that the municipality into which a work is continued by an adjoining municipality shall pass a by-law to levy the amounts legally assessed upon lands in the lower township, and which says that such by-law shall be passed in like manner, and with such other provisions, as would have been proper if the majority of the owners of the land to be taxed had petitioned for such work, as provided in sec. 570, does not say that the by-law so passed shall be subject to the provisions contained in sec. 570 and its sub-sections, but that it shall be passed with (that is in my opinion shall contain) such provisions as a by-law petitioned for in the manner provided for in sec. 570; that is to say, provisions for borrowing on debentures the required sum and for levying the sums charged on the several lots by special yearly rates on the respective lots, and for raising the amount charged on roads by a general assessment on the ratepayers of the municipality.\nTo subject assessments which, on appeal, have been submitted to the decision of arbitrators to be again revised by a court of revision would, in my opinion, be quite inconsistent with the plain intent of the act, that the award should be conclusively binding upon all parties, subject only to revision by the High Court of Justice, and with the provision that the award shall be registered in the registry office of the county in which the lands affected are situate. In my opinion, therefore, the arbiter ors erred in not adjudicating in fact upon the merits of the appeal against the several assessments on the lots and roads assessed, as by their award they have in terms done, and that for this error, plainly appearing upon their minutes, the award should have been set aside.\nThere remains to be considered the main point insisted upon, both before the arbitrators and against the award, namely, that the evidence failed to establish that the proposed work would confer any benefit upon the lots and roads assessed, and that on the contrary it established, as well as could be established in advance of the construction of the work, that it would inflict injury upon some of them.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, concurring with certain expressions in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Divisional Court before whom the motion to set aside the award as against law and evidence and the weight of evidence was made, says upon this point:\nOn the general merits of the award I share with the learned Chief Justice his difficulty in seeing, on the evidence, how Dover is to be benefited by the proposed work, but I share also his reluctance to interfere, on that ground alone, with the decision of the arbitrators, the more so as the dissenting arbitrator was willing to hold Dover benefited in a lesser sum than awarded.\nIf the question was one depending upon the credibility of witnesses, or upon a nice estimate of contradictory evidence, I quite concur that the judgment of arbitrators upon a mere question of fact should not be interfered with. But here no question of the credibility of any of the witnesses arises, and there appears to be very little, if any, contradiction in the evidence, all of which is brought before us. Difference of opinion there may be, but in the facts upon which opinions should be formed there does not appear to be any material difference. Here the great mass of the evidence certainly appears to be against there being any benefit conferred, and if the principle upon which the engineer says that he made the assessments, and formed his opinion that the lots and roads assessed would be benefited, be, as is insisted by the respondents, erroneous, a court of appeal, on a motion to set aside an award which confirms the assessments, is bound to exercise its independent judgment upon the evidence.\nIt is not questioned that all the work proposed to be done is absolutely necessary to carry off the extra water brought down from Chatham. This being so, the evidence that benefit will be conferred upon the lots and roads assessed in Dover to justify their being charged with a portion of the cost of a work wholly necessary for the accomplishment of the purposes of Chatham ought, in my mind, to be absolutely free from doubt, for, prima facie, in such a case the burthen of the cost of the whole work ought to be borne by the municipality which invades the territory of another in order to accomplish purposes of its own.\nIt might give rise to a serious question hereafter if lands in Dover should now, before the construction of the work, be assessed as for benefit anticipated to be conferred upon them by the work, and it should after its construction turn out that injury and not benefit, as is most strenuously and for very strong reasons insisted by many of the witnesses, would be the actual result, whether the owners of the land so assessed might not be deprived of their right to compensation, under sec. 591 of 46 Vict. ch. 18, for the injury so done to their property.\nTurning then to the engineer\u2019s report, we find him there saying that the charges made upon the lots and roads in Dover assessed by him are, \u201cfor benefit,\u201d \u201cfor outlet\u201d and \u201cfor constructing a drain to carry off water brought down on lands to damage them.\u201d\nNow as to this latter item of service done to the lots and roads assessed in Dover, it is to be observed that the only water brought down on lands in Dover, and which certainly will damage some lands in Dover unless effectually carried off, will be the water brought down by the deepened drain in Chatham, which water Chatham is bound to carry off effectually so as not to damage any lands in Dover or, in default, to recompense the injured parties under sec. 591 of 46 Vict. ch. 18, as well as at common law, so that this item can form no just ground for charging lands in Dover with any part of the cost of the work. Then as to item \u201cfor outlet.\u201d What is meant by this item is difficult to understand, for the only outlet which the proposed work will give to any water will be outlet for the extra waters brought into Dover by the deepened drain in Chatham, which waters by the deepening of Bear Creek in Dover will find their outlet through that stream eventually to Lake St. Clair. The deepening Bear Creek in Dover for this purpose gives no outlet to Dover\u2019s waters that Dover had not before. There can therefore be no justification for the charge imposed upon the lots and roads assessed in Dover under the item \u201cfor outlet.\u201d\nThen as to the item \u201cfor benefit.\u201d\nThe engineer himself, in his evidence before the arbitrators, says:\nThe drain is necessary to carry off the water brought down to the Prince Albert road and district. There is very great need to carry off the water from the Prince Albert road (in Chatham). I don\u2019t think any smaller drain than I have proposed would be sufficient.\nAgain:\nIt is for outlet that I assess the roads south of the proposed work\u2014the 12th and 13th concession roads. I also assess for outlet, and we have to construct bridges on them, which will cost $200 each. I estimated the buildings in Dover, including Dover\u2019s proportion of the town line bridge, at $450. Without the bridges the roads in Dover are benefited by the outlet and are assessed for that, and because they use the drain. I suppose they could use the creek without the drain. I assess them because they will use the outlet, and not because I can see any possible benefit.\nThen he speaks of four taps which had in years past been made in Chatham, taking water to the Thames and thence to the river Sydenham. As to these he says:\nEvery one of these taps has been of advantage to Dover and these taps have relieved Dover of more water than will be brought down by the proposed drain. I looked on it that in its natural state Chatham and Dover had a joint interest in Bear Creek, and that if Chatham had made a cut off, to take water off Dover, they would have a right to send as much water down as naturally went there originally, and that Dover would not have a right to make a drain like Baldoon drain, taking water in, which would not naturally come in, to the exclusion of water from Chatham, or without enlarging Bear Creek to carry it off, nor drain their roads to occupy the outlet without giving Chatham the same rights as before. I think that owing to the original conditions of the water and country, Dover should contribute for making the outlet, as it now occupies space in Bear Creek that Chatham formerly occupied. Dover was not assessed for the Prince Albert drain, the Louisville tap or Prangley tap, and contributed nothing unless their share of the county grant.\nNow, the meaning of all this seems to be, that in the opinion of the engineer, as Bear Creek was the only natural drain for a large tract of low, wet marshy lands situate in Chatham and Dover, and as such natural drain was wholly inadequate to carry off the great mass of water which collected in Chatham, and as to carry off some of such water, by other outlets through the rivers Thames and Sydenham, Chatham had constructed certain drains to which Dover only contributed its portion of a county grant, although to others Dover had contributed between $9,000 and $10,000, and as Dover also had constructed a drain conducting into Bear Creek, at the western extremity of the proposed works, some water which would not naturally reach that stream, therefore, Dover should now contribute to this proposed work, constructed for the purpose of carrying off water from Chatham, although the engineer who entertains this opinion cannot see any perceptible benefit that the work will confer on Dover, other than giving (as he calls it) an outlet which Dover already has, and is no other than that of the stream called Bear Creek, which by the proposed work Chatham avails itself of, and for its own purposes has to enlarge the capacity of the creek.\nAgain he says:\nIn making the assessment in Dover, I took into consideration that Chatham had made all these taps mentioned, and if Chatham had not done so, perhaps I would not have assessed Dover at all for this work. I thought Chatham was not sending more water than she sent there originally, and on this account I assessed Dover.\nAnother engineer who was called by the township of Chatham, although he also expressed the opinion that Dover was benefited by the work, gives his reason for entertaining that opinion thus: \u201cIt will improve the health of the county, if nothing else.\u201d\nThen, as to the charge on Dover for bridges, it appears by the evidence that they are, as they stand, abundantly sufficient for the water at present passing under them, and that the enlargement is necessitated by the increased flow of water brought down from Chatham by the proposed work.\nUpon the evidence before us, all that need be said, as it appears to me, is that if the opinion of Mr. McGeorge, as to the reasons for which he has charged the lots and roads in Dover assessed by him with a part of the cost of this work, be just and sound, legislation is necessary to give effect to it, for, in my opinion, those reasons do not, under the provisions of the statute as it at present stands, warrant any charge being imposed upon them for the purpose.\nUpon this main point of the contestation I am unable to come to any other conclusion upon the evidence, than that it fails to establish that the proposed work will confer any benefit upon the lots and roads assessed, or that they should be compelled to contribute to the cost of the proposed work. And for this reason, also, in my opinion, the award should have been set aside and the engineer\u2019s report also. This appeal, therefore, must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Charles E.

By the notice published in accordance with the provisions of the statute such by-law was to be taken into consideration by the council after one month from its first publication on the 24th of September, 1873. The vote of the ratepayers was in favor of the by-law, and on 20th October a motion was made in the council that it be read a second and third time, which was carried and the by-law passed. The mayor of the council, however, refused to sign it, on the ground that its consideration was premature, and on 5th November the same motion was made and the by-law was rejected. Nothing more was done in the matter until April, 1874, when a motion was again made before the council that such by-law be read a second and third time, which motion was, on this occasion, carried. At this meeting a copy only of the by-law was before the council, the original having been mislaid, and it was not found until after the commencement of this suit. When it was found it was discovered that the copy voted on by the ratepayers contained, by mistake of the printers, a date for the by-law to come into operation different from that of the original.\nIn 1883 an action was brought against the corporation of the city of O. for the delivery of the debentures provided for by the by-law, in which suit the question of the validity of the whole proceedings was raised.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below\u2014\n1. That the vote of 20th November, 1873, was premature, and not in conformity with the provisions of sec. 231 of the Municipal Act; that the mayor properly refused to sign it, and that without such signature the by-law was invalid under sec. 226.\n2. That the council had power to consider the by-law on 5th November, 1873, and the matter was then disposed of.\n3. That the proceedings of 7th April, 1874, were void for two reasons. One, that the by\u2011law was not considered by the council to which it was first submitted as provided by sec. 236, which is to be construed as meaning the council elected for the year and not the same corporation; and the other reason is, that the by-law passed in 1874 was not the same as that submitted, there being a difference in the dates.\nSemble, that the functions of a municipality in considering a by-law after it has been voted on by the ratepayers are not ministerial only, but the by-law can be confirmed or rejected irrespective of the favorable vote.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Chancery-Division[2] in favor of the defendants.\nThe facts of the case will sufficiently appear from the previous reports and the judgment of this court.\nMcCarthy Q.C., O\u2019Gara Q.C., and J.J. Gormully for the appellants.\nThe by-law was passed on 20th October, 1873, and although it was a few days ahead of time, that was only an irregularity, and the by-law would stand unless quashed within a reasonable time. There is a limit of time given to quash a by-law by the Mun. Inst. Act, sec. 241. See Vanlecar v. East Oxford[3].\nThe provision that the by-law shall not be taken into consideration before the expiration of one month from publication, is directory only, and not mandatory, and unless damage be shown as a result of non-compliance the court will not invalidate it.\nSealing is not necessary to the validity of a by-law, but is only required for the purposes of indentification: Sec. 226.

This manner was provided by the 231st section which enacted that in case a by-law requires the assent of the electors of a municipality before the final passing thereof, the council shall by the by-law fix the day, hour, and place for taking the votes of the electors thereon at every place in the municipality at which the elections of the members of the council therein are held, and shall, before the final passing of the proposed by-law, publish a copy thereof in some public newspaper published within the municipality, or, if there is no such newspaper, in the public newspaper published nearest the municipality, and also, in either case, in a newspaper published in the county town, if there be any such newspaper, the publication to be continued in at least one number of each of such papers for three successive weeks, and shall also put up a copy of the by-law at four or more of the most public places in the municipality, and that appended to each copy so published and posted shall be a notice signed by the clerk of the council stating that such copy is a true copy of a proposed by-law which will be taken into consideration by the council after one month from the first publication in the newspaper, stating the date of the first publication, and that at the hour, day, place, or places therein fixed for taking the votes of the electors, the polls will be held. And by the 248th section it was enacted that no by-law for contracting a debt by borrowing money or otherwise, or for levying rates for payment of such debts on the ratable property of the municipality for any purpose within the jurisdiction of the council, should be valid unless the by-law should name a day in the financial year in which the same is passed when the by-law shall take effect, and that the whole of the debt and of the obligations to be issued therefor should be made payable in twenty years at furthest from the day on which such by-law takes effect; and that the by-law should settle an equal special rate per annum, in addition to all other rates to be levied in each year, and that such special rate should be sufficient, according to the amount of ratable property appearing by the last revised assessment rolls, to discharge the debt and interest when respectively payable, and that the amount of ratable property shall be ascertained irrespective of any future increase of the ratable property of the municipality, and of any income in the nature of tolls, &c., &c., or of any income from the temporary investment of the sinking fund or of any part thereof.\nOn the 24th September, 1873, the clerk of the council of the city of Ottawa published in two newspapers published in the city of Ottawa, and also put up at four of the most public places in the city for the length of time required by the 231st section of the above act, what he certified under his hand as city clerk to be true copies of a proposed by-law to authorize the issue of debentures, to the extent of $100,000, to be given as a bonus to the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway, in which proposed by-law as so published were the clauses following:\u2014\n2. \u201cThe said debentures\u201d (those authorized by the previous sec- tion) shall be payable on the twenty-ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-three, at the office of the Quebec Bank in the city of Ottawa, and shall have coupons attached for the payment of the interest as it falls due.\n5. This by-law shall take effect and come into operation on the thirteenth day of December in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three.\nAnd this final clause:\u2014\nAnd whereas this by-law requires the assent of the electors of the city of Ottawa aforesaid before the final passing thereof, therefore, for the purpose of taking the votes of the said electors thereon the corporation of the city of Ottawa in council assembled do hereby appoint the sixteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, at the several places hereinafter mentioned.\nHere follow the places named for taking the poll of votes and the names of the persons to be returning officers. And at the foot is the notice required by the statute to be signed, and which was signed by the city clerk, as follows:\u2014\nTake Notice\nThat the above is a true copy of a proposed by-law which will be taken into consideration by the council of the corporation of the city of Ottawa after one month from the first publication thereof in the Free Press newspaper, the date of which first publication was the twenty-fourth day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, and the votes of the electors of the said municipality will be taken thereon at the following places within the city of Ottawa, namely, (here follows an enumeration of the places as in the published by-law,) on the sixteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, at the hour of nine of the clock in the forenoon of the same day.\nWM. P. LETT,\nCity Clerk\nCity of Ottawa,\n24th September, A.D. 1873.\nBetween the 16th and 20th October, 1873, the city clerk reported to the council, as required by the act, that the proposed by-law was approved by a majority of the votes polled, and upon the said 20th October a motion was proposed in council and carried to the effect that the by-law granting a bonus of $100,000 to the Montreal and Ottawa City Junction Company be read a second and third time and passed, suspending all rules of council to the contrary. At the time this motion was, put the original of the proposed by-law was not before the council, it having been then lost, as it, in fact, so continued to be until just before the re-hearing of this cause, when a clerk of the plaintiffs made an affidavit, to which was annexed a document which he swore he found on the 11th February, 1884, in the office of the Free Press, which, as he said, he was informed by the proprietor of that newspaper was on file in his office since the 23rd or 24th September, 1873, and which had the appearance of being the original of the said proposed by-law as read a first time in council. The motion of the 20th October never was acted upon, the same having been found to be premature, in consequence of which, as appears by the evidence of the city clerk, the mayor declined to act upon the motion by signing the by-law, and as it was then lost he could not have signed it, nor was it, in fact, read a second and third time in council, and under the circumstances the motion although entered in the minutes, was treated, as it, in fact, was, as nugatory, the time when by the notice, as required by the statute attached to the proposed by-law as submitted to the ratepayers they were notified it would be taken into consideration by the council, not having arrived. In consequence of this defect in the proceedings of the 20th October, a motion was made in council on the 5th of November, 1873, as follows:\u2014\nWhereas the by-law granting $100,000 to the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway Company passed by the ratepayers of the city having been passed by this council previous to the time required by law, the same be now read a second and third time and passed, suspending all rules of this council to the contrary, and that the said by-law as so passed be signed and sealed by his worship the mayor according to law.\nWhich motion having been put to the council was lost by a vote of seven against three.\nNothing further was done in the matter until the 7th April, 1874, when in the minutes of council of that year, at a time when, to all appearance, all progress with the work of construction of the railway was abandoned, the following entries appear:\u2014\nAlderman McDougall introduced the by-law to grant a bonus of $100,000 to the Montreal and Ottawa Junction Railway Company, read a first time on the 20th day of October, 1873.\nMoved by Alderman McDougall, seconded by Alderman Bangs:\nThat whereas the by-law granting $100,000 to the Montreal and Ottawa City Junction Railway Company passed by the ratepayers of the city having been passed by this council previous to the time required by law, the same be now read a second and third time and passed, suspending all rules of this council to the contrary.\u2014Carried.\nNow, it is to be observed here that no by-law of the nature of that recited in the above minutes of council had been read a first time on the 20th of October, 1873, and that on this 7th day of April, 1874, the original of the proposed by-law which had been introduced into the council and read a first time on the 22nd of September, 1873, was not forthcoming; it still remained lost; it was not before the council of 1874; neither was the copy which was submitted to the ratepayers; all that was before the council of 1874 was what the clerk of the council testified to as being a copy of the proposed by-law as originally introduced in 1873, with the exception of the final clause providing for its submission to the ratepayers and which, by the statute, is required to be a part of the by-law, but which was omitted from the document which the council was professing to read a second and third time, and to pass, upon the 7th April, 1874. In effect, then, the document which the council of the year 1874, purported to read a second and third time, and pass on the 7th April, 1874, had never been read a first time in the council of that year, and, moreover, it was not the proposed by-law which had been originally introduced and read a first time in the council of 1873, if the council of 1874 could read that by-law a second and third time and pass it, nor was it the proposed by-law as submitted to the ratepayers on the 16th of October, 1873, for in the copy before the council on the 7th April, 1874, the clause as to the time when the by-law should take effect was stated to be the thirtieth day of December, 1873, and not the thirteenth day of December of that year, as stated in the proposed by-law submitted to the ratepayers.\nIt is contended now that the date of the thirteenth day of December, 1873, was a mistake of the printer in the copies as submitted to the ratepayers, those copies having been printed, and that in the original as introduced into the council the date was the thirtieth of December. As an independent matter of fact that may be so, and, if we should look at the paper said by the clerk of the plaintiffs to have been found in February, 1884, in the office of the Free Press, would appear to be so, but in an action of this nature, which is not instituted for the purpose of supporting the validity of debentures issued under the provisions of the by-law upon the assumption of its being valid, and disposed of for value, but for the purpose of having the proceedings of the council and the by-law of the date of the 7th April, 1874, declared to be valid after the lapse of twelve years without anything having been done under the by-law, as if it was valid, or any rate collected under it, although, if valid, rates should have been collected every year from the ratepayers on the rolls of those years, who, and not those now on the roll, should have been the persons to pay the moneys leviable dur- ing these years, I doubt whether we should or can receive any evidence which would contradict the statutory notice and certificate of the clerk of the council required to be appended to the proposed byes law, as submitted to the ratepayers, to the effect that the copy so submitted which names the thirteenth day of December, 1873, as the day when the proposed by-law shall take effect is a true copy of the proposed by-law, which, after the ratepayers shall have voted thereon, shall be taken into consideration by the council.\nThe effect of this statutory notice and certificate is, as it appears to me, to provide that the proposed by-law, as submitted to the ratepayers, is to be the one to be taken into consideration by the council after one month from the first publication in the newspapers.\nIt has been argued that the alteration from the thirteenth of December, as inserted in the proposed by-law as submitted to the ratepayers, to the thirtieth of December, as in the document alleged to have been passed, signed and sealed on the 7th April, 1874, was the mere correction of a mistake of a most formal nature which it was quite within the power of the council to make for the reason that, as is suggested, the mistake cannot be supposed to have influenced the ratepayers in recording their votes; but, with submission, in an action of this nature I do not think we can enquire whether the mistake could or could not have influenced the ratepayers in recording their votes; the question appears to me to be simply has the statute been complied with. If a by-law of this nature, in order to be a valid by-law, must name a day within the financial year in which the same is passed when the by-law shall take effect, and if it must be approved by the ratepayers before the council can pass it, it appears to me that the proposed by-law which is to be taken into consideration by the council after having been voted upon by the ratepayers, and to be passed as having been approved by them, must be the very one which was submitted to them. The proposed by-law as submitted to the ratepayers and voted upon by them, and the only one of which they approved, and which, as approved by them, the council could pass, was upon the face of it absolutely void, because that proposed by-law being declared to take effect and to come into operation on the thirteenth of December, 1873, and the debentures authorized to be issued thereunder being made payable on the 29th December, 1893, such debentures were not, as the statute required them to be, made payable within twenty years from the day on which such by-law takes effect. Then it was argued that, notwithstanding the proceedings of the 7th April, 1874, the by-law which was introduced into the council of 1873 in September of that year was substantially passed in fact and in law upon and by the vote of the ratepayers of the 16th October, 1873, approving of its being passed by the council, and that all further acts of the council to give validity to the by-law were purely ministerial; but in presence of the provisions of the statute that to the copy of the proposed by-law there shall be appended a notice to the effect that the proposed by-law so submitted will be taken into consideration by the council after one month from the first publication, I cannot think that the council were divested of their legislative deliberative character, and that they had no power to express an opinion upon a matter which the legislature said they should take into their consideration; or that the vote of the ratepayers converted their office from being one of a deliberative and legislative character into one purely ministerial, the execution of which could be enforced by mandamus against their deliberate conviction that there were abundant reasons why the by-law should not be passed. As for example, suppose that after the vote of the ratepayers in favor of the proposed by-law should be taken the council should discover that the recital of their debts in the proposed by-law already incurred was incorrect, or that they had already exhausted their statutory power of incurring pecuniary obligations; or that there was a verbal agreement with the company which constituted a condition upon which the bonus was proposed to be given, and which the company refused to put into shape of a legal obligation; or that the bonus was proposed to be given upon the faith of the city being the terminus of the railway, and that after the vote of the ratepayers was taken the company had amalgamated with another company, by the terms of amalgamation with which it was provided that the city should not be a terminus, but should be a mere way station, and not receiving the benefit, which, as a terminus, it would have received; or that the company had wholly abandoned their projected railway, or for other like reasons; can it be held that the corporation could be compelled by mandamus in such cases to read a second and third time, and to pass, the by-law, and to sign and seal it, and so give it validity contrary to their own judgment as to the propriety of so doing? And at whose suit could the application for a mandamus be made? Not, I think, at the suit of the railway company, for the money proposed to be given being by way of a bonus and voluntary grant the company could have no interest, giving them a locus standi in curia, until the by-law should be passed by virtue of which alone could they assert any claim. It is contended that the 236th section of the act shows that after a vote by the ratepayers giving the approval of a majority to the proposed by-law being passed, the office of the council is merely ministerial. That section provides that: Any by-law which shall be carried by a majority of the duly qualified electors voting thereon shall, within six weeks thereafter, be passed by the Council which submitted the same.\nThis section must be read in connection with section 231, which provides for the notice being given that the proposed by-law will be taken into consideration by the council after one month from the first publication in the newspaper, and construing them together, it appears to me to be more consistent with the constitution and deliberative character of municipal councils to construe section 236 as prescribing the time within which the consideration to be given by the council to the proposed by-law should be perfected, or in default thereof, that it should drop. The case of Harwich v. The Erie Railway Co., cited in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, proceeded upon a wholly different act; a private act incorporating the Erie and Huron Railway Company, which act contained most extraordinary and exceptional provisions in the interest of that company, which expressly divested the councils of municipalities giving bonuses to that company of their legislative deliberative character, for it was made compulsory on those councils, upon receiving a petition from a prescribed number of qualified voters, to submit to the ratepayers a by-law for granting a bonus to the amount named in such petition, and in case such proposed by-law should be approved by a majority of the votes given thereon it was imperatively enacted that the council should, within one month after such voting has taken place, read the said by-law a third time and pass the same, and should, within one month thereafter, issue the debentures for the bonus thereby granted and deliver the same to trustees to be appointed under the act. The Municipal Institutions Act not having any such imperative enactments does not, I think, require that it should be construed as divesting the council, upon these questions of granting bonuses, of all discretion and of their constitutional character as deliberative bodies. But however this may be, this section 236 shows that the proposed by-aw does not become a by-law by the vote of the ratepayers approving of it, but that to become a by-law it must be passed by the council of the municipality and by the same council which submitted it to the ratepayers. It has been argued that this expression \u201cshall be passed, &c., by the council which submitted the same,\u201d is to be construed as meaning that a proposed by\u2011law introduced into a municipal council, and by them submitted to the ratepayers, must be passed by a council of the same municipality, and not by the council of another and different municipality; but this contention cannot prevail for there would be no sense in enacting that a by-law introduced into the council of (for example) the city of Ottawa, and read a first time there and by them submitted to the ratepayers of the city, should not be passed by the council of another municipality. It could not be passed by the council of any municipality but that of the city of Ottawa. Such a construction as that contended for involves the reading of the word \u201ccouncil\u201d in the section as if it were \u201ccorporation.\u201d The council is a fluctuating body varying from year to year and having existence only for the year for which the members composing it are elected to serve; and that the word means the council which was the governing body of the municipality in the year in which the proposed by-law was introduced, and by which it was submitted to the ratepayers, there can, I think, be no doubt whatever. The statute provides that the proposed by-law, as submitted to the ratepayers, shall settle an equal special rate per annum in addition to all other rates to be levied in each year, which special rate shall be sufficient, according to the amount of ratable property appearing in the last revised assessment roll, to discharge the debt and interest, and it shall name a day in the financial year in which it is passed when the by-law shall take effect. It is apparent from these provisions that the last revised assessment rolls which are to regulate the special rate to be named in the by-law when passed are the rolls of the year before the passing of the by-law, and as this provision must be in the proposed by-law when first introduced, the introduction of the proposed by-law, and its submission to the ratepayers, and its final passage, must take place in the same year.\nTo my mind, I confess, there seems to be strong reason for holding that until the by-law is signed and sealed, as required by the 226th section of the act, it does not become a valid by-law. That section enacts that:\nEvery by-law shall be under the seal of the corporation, and shall be signed by the head of the corporation or by the person presiding at the meeting at which the by-law has been passed, and by the clerk of the corporation.\nThe word \u201cpresiding\u201d here used applies to \u201cthe head of the corporation,\u201d as well as to any other person presiding at the meeting at which the by-law has been passed, the object to be attained being that it shall be signed by the person presiding at the meeting at which the by\u2011law is passed, whether such person be the head of the corporation at that time or any other person presiding in his place, and I think the signature should take place immediately upon, or shortly after, its being passed while the very by-law, as passed, is in the presence of the meeting by which it is passed. But that this section was not enacted for the mere purpose of affording proof of the by-law in any action arising in respect of it appears from the 227th section, which enacts that:\nA copy of any by-law, written or printed, without erasure or inter- lineation, and under the seal of the corporation, and certified to be a true copy by the clerk and by any member of the council, shall be deemed authentic, and shall be received in evidence in any court of justice, unless it is specially pleaded or alleged that one or both of the signatures have been forged.\nThe former of these sections appears to me to point to an act material to be performed for the purpose of the by-law coming into complete existence, the latter to the mode by which the fact of its having acquired existence under the 226th section shall be authenticated. The by-law itself, when signed and sealed as required by the 226th sec., becomes a record to be preserved among the archives of the municipality to be proved, whenever proof of the existence of the by-law should be required in any court, by the copy sealed with the corporate seal and certified to be a true copy by the clerk for the time being and any member of council, and such certified copy should, as it appears to me, show that the original by-law filed among the records of the municipality had the corporate seal annexed to it and was signed, or appeared to be signed, as required by the 226th section. If, ten or fifteen years after a by-law was passed, proof of it was required in a court of justice when the head of the corporation and the clerk and the members of council were wholly different persons from those who filled those respective offices when the by-law was read a third time and passed and if, upon referring to the original by-law filed of record among the archives of the municipality, it should appear that it never had been sealed with the corporate seal, nor signed by the head of the corporation at the time of its having been passed, nor by any person as presiding at the meeting of council at which it was passed, nor by the person who was then clerk of the corporation, the certified copy showing these defects would, as it appears to me, be defective as proof, and I cannot think that such defects in the original by-law could be cured, and that the provisions of the 226th section would be complied with, by the persons who filled the respective offices of head and of clerk of the corporation when the certified copy was required signing the original by-law on record among the archives of the municipality with their own names, and setting the corporate seal to it, ten or fifteen years after the third reading of the by-law in the council of that time\nNow, the only document in the present case which there is any evidence of having been signed and sealed is the document alleged to have been read a second and third time and passed on the 7th April, 1874, and of this document we have no proof under the seal of the corporation. The original apparently no longer exists, and no proof under the 227th section has been, if such could be now, given. But this is of little importance as it manifestly appears, I think, for the reasons already given, that the proceeding of the 7th April, 1874, was wholly void. Admitting, apparently, this difficulty the learned counsel for the appellants endeavored to rest the appellants case, first, upon the contention that upon the vote of the majority of the ratepayers who voted upon the proposed by-law as submitted to them the by-law became passed and a valid by law, and failing in that contention, that the proceedings in council of the 20th October, 1873, made the by-law valid. But the proposed by-law as submitted to the ratepayers, and as voted on by them, was, as already shown, void upon its face, and even if it had been an exact copy of the proposed by-law as introduced into the council, it did not, as I think I have also shown, become passed and valid in law upon the vote of the ratepayers being taken; and as to the proceedings of the 20th of October, 1873, they, as it appears to me, were null and void and were, very properly as I think, so treated to be; for the statutory notice appended to the proposed by-law which was submitted to the ratepayers having declared that the proposed by-law so submitted would be taken into consideration by the council after one month from the first publication of the proposed by-law, amounted to an enactment, by implication, that it should not be taken into consideration before the lapse of that month. The mayor, therefore, of that year acted, as I think, in a very proper manner when he declined to recognize what was done on the 20th October, 1873, as having any validity and refused to sign the by-law as passed; when, then, the motion was made on the 5th November, 1873, in council that the by-law should be read a second and third time and passed, it was competent for the council to take the matter then into their consideration, save in so far as the difference between the proposed by-law as originally introduced and that submitted to the ratepayers may have affected the validity of the proceeding of the council; and we must treat them as having then taken the matter into their consideration, which consideration, whether they had or not power so to exercise it, they did exercise, with what motive is not open to enquiry, by refusing to read the by-law a second and third time and to pass it. So that in point of fact and of law the by-law never was passed by the council which submitted it, and never acquired any force or validity in law.\nIn the view which I have taken it is unnecessary to dwell upon the point relied upon in the judgments of some of the learned judges in the court below, namely, that the completion of the railway within the eight years from the 14th April, 1871, prescribed by the 18th section of the company\u2019s act of incorporation, must be taken to be an implied term or condition of the by-law, assuming it to have ever had any validity; but in that opinion I entirely concur. The right of the company at this distance of time to compel the delivery to them of debentures under the by-law, and to require a rate to be now levied sufficient to meet them, must, I think, if such right can exist at all, be maintained only upon the ground that it was the duty of the corporation to have levied the rate as specified in the by-law during the last thirteen years since the passing of the by-law, and that the corporation is now just as responsible as if the rate had been duly levied; but in view of the utter abandonment of the work of construction of the railway during all the time that elapsed from the month of January, 1874, before the first year\u2019s rate was leviable under the by-law, until the month of February, 1881, all claim of the company, if any they ever had, to any benefit under the by\u2011law was, in my opinion, forfeited before the work was recommenced in 1881, and the corporation was justified in regarding the project, which they proposed aiding, as abandoned, and they were not only justified in not levying any rate under the by-law and in regarding it as having no force, but they would not have been justified in levying the rate under the circumstances. Upon all the grounds of objection, therefore, which have been urged against the claim of the appellants, the respondents must succeed, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSir W.J.

The defendants pleaded that the property taxed was used as an educational institution and therefore exempt.\nThe parties agreed to make the following admissions:\nFirst. That the property set out in the said plaintiff's declaration was during the time mentioned therein occupied and used as a private boarding and day school for girls Kept and maintained by the said defendant who employed divers teachers, and during that time had therein, on an average, for their education, as pupils, eighty-five girls per annum.\nSecond. That the said institution for the education of girls never received any grant from the plaintiff. Third. That if the said, institution be not an educational institution under Sect. 26 of 41 Vic. ch 6 judgment should go for the amount demanded and costs, if on the contrary it is such educational institution, within the meaning of the said section, the said plaintiff's action should be dismissed with costs.\nRainsville J. in the Superior Court, gave judgment for the city holding that educational institutions, under the statute, are those of a permanent character, founded in the interest and under the authority, of the public. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed this judgment, Hon. Justices Monk and Cross dissenting.\nKerr Q.C. for appellants contended that appellants were entitled to exemption from the payment of municipal school taxes under sec. 26 ch. 6 of 41 Vic. P.O. the same being an addition to sec. 17 ch. 15 Cons. Stats. L.

City of New Orleans ([3]); Coichester v. Kewney ([4]).\nRoy Q. C. for respondents contended that there was no legislative provision conferring immunity from municipal taxes upon a property used as a private boarding school, and cited:\nHilliard on Taxatonn ([5]); State v Ross ([6]) City of Indianapolis v. Sturdevant ([7]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2011The appellant claims exemption under the following statutory provisions :\u2014\nConsolidated Statutes of Lower Canada ([8]). All buildings set apart for purposes of education or of religious worship, parsonages houses, and all charitable institutions or hospitals incorporated by act of Parliament, and the ground or land on which such buildings are erected, and also all burial grounds shall be exempt from all rates imposed for the purposes of this Act 9 Vie. oh. 27 sec. 37.\nStatute s of Quebec ([9]).\n26. Section 77 of chapter 15 of the Consolidated Statutes of Tower Canada, is amended by adding after sub-sec. 2 the following provision:\n\"3. Every educational institution receiving no grant from the corporation or municipality in which they are situated, and the land on which they are erected, and its dependencies, shall be exempt from municipal and school taxes, whatever may be the act or charter under which such taxes are imposed, notwithstanding all provisions to the contrary.\"\nThere can be no doubt that the appellant\u2019s school was an educational institution in the primary grammatical signification of that term, and would, prima facie, be exempted, under the authority of these statutory provisions, from payment of the taxes claimed unless there is to be found some statutory provision depriving such an educational institution as that of the appellants of the exemption, by limiting the words educational institution \" to a public incorporated educational institution. I am quite willing to admit that the intention to exempt must be expressed in clear unambiguous language; that taxation is the rule and exemption the exception, and therefore to be strictly construed; but in this case the intention to exempt seems to me to be made as clear as plain unequivocal language can very well make it. We have nothing, that I can discover, indicating an intention to limit the exemption to public or incorporated institutions. On the contrary, we find in sec. 77 sub-sec. 2 incorporation made necessary in the case of charitable institutions or hospitals but not so with reference to all buildings set apart for purposes of education or of religious worship, or to parsonage houses and all burial grounds. Why should it not with as much force be contended that churches, parsonage houses, and burial grounds, should be incorporated before they are exempt under that section? Surely a school house, seminary or school is an educational institution without reference to incorporation and may be established by individuals quite as well as by corporations. And again, an incorporated school might be quite as much a private school as this we are now considering. Incorporation gives merely a legal entity; the advancement and interest of education may be quite as much forwarded by private schools of high standing, such as this is admitted to be under the immediate government of the proprietors as by incorporated schools governed by a board of directors. The mere act of incorporating an existing school, or certain persons to carry it on, does not make it more or less an educational institution, nor more or less a public or private institution, than it was previous to its incorporation. That the legislature fully understood the distinction between private and public, and between incorporated and unincorporated, educational institutions is to be discovered in numerous acts Thus in 29 Vic ch 57 (1865), relating to the corporation of the city of Quebec in the exemption from taxation we find the limitation clearly expressed\nThe property of any incorporated institution for educational or charitable purposes, occupied and used for educational or charitable purposes, and also all other property by such institutions leased for the aforesaid purposes, or occupied as school houses by the school commissioners of the said city, shall be exempt from taxation, and such houses or properties so occupied are also exempt from tenant's tax.\nBy 38 Vic. ch. 76 sec. 101 (1875) the city of Three Rivers is authorized to levy on all lands, city lots or parts of lots, excepting churches, bishop's palaces parsonage houses, charitable and educational establishments as also their dependencies, whether there are buildings erected thereon or not, with, all buildings and erections thereon fifty cents in each $100 and not a word about incorporation or limiting the exemption to any particular class of charitable or educational establishments. So in 38 Vic. ch. 76 sec. 125 :\u2014\nEvery place of public worship, and every burying ground; every public school house and the ground on which the same is built; every public educational establishment and the ground on which the same is built; all buildings, lands and property occupied or possessed by hospitals or other charitable institutions.\nThen there is 39 Vic. ch. 79 incorporating the city of Hull:\u2014\n4. Every public school house and the ground upon which the same is constructed No 5 Every educational establishment and the ground upon which the same is constructed.\nBy 40 Vic. c 29 \"he Town Corporation General Clauses Act\" who applies to every town corporation or municipality which shall hereafter be established, the following property shall not be taxable:\u2014\n3. Property belonging to fabriques or religious, charitable or educational institutions, or corporations;\n4. Burial grounds, bishops' palaces, parsonage houses and their dependencies.\nThe principle of exemption was, no doubt, to encourage education, generally in like manner as religious instruction was encouraged by exempting all buildings set apart for the purposes of religious worship and for the burial of the dead, by whomsoever owned, and without the slightest reference to incorporation. The legislatures have, no doubt, some very good reasons for requiring incorporation only in the case of charitable institutions and hospitals.\nThe legislation may, very well, be assumed to be based on the idea that certain kinds of property, such as church property, school property, property used for charitable purposes, burial grounds, and the like, are not fit objects for public contributions, inasmuch as they are supposed to contribute to the general public benefit, and operate in relief of public burdens; and this last is particularly applicable to property devoted to works of education and charity. And the exemptions are \"IV doubtless, granted on consideration of public policy, to be recalled whenever this view of public policy shall have changed.\nThe American cases from the State of New York, which were much relied on, I have examined, but they do not, in my opinion, assist us, because they appear to have been decided on the peculiar wording of the statute, in the construction of which, the court held that from such peculiar wording the term \" incorporated,\" used in the connexion it was in the statute showed that the legislature intended to confine the exemption to incorporated institutions. The wording of our statute being entirely different and no such intention being discoverable from the language used, the cases do not seem to me to apply.\nUnder these circumstances, I do not think we have any right to confine the exemption to narrower limits than the terms of the statute not only fairly imply, but actually express. Considerations of public policy are, in my opinion, opposed to our doing so, for thereby we may frustrate the object the legislature may have had in view, namely, the encouragement of education. The value of an educational institution such as this is admitted to be to the city of Montreal in which it is situated, and, in fact, to the Province of Quebec, no one will, I think, venture to deny. To exempt such an institution from local taxation is but a very moderate encouragement to the cause of education, and one to which it is by no means unreasonable to suppose the legislature may have considered it, in the public interests, justly entitled. At any rate, if this is not so, when amending this section had the legislature intended so to limit the application of the term \u201ceducational institution \" as to prevent the exemption applying, to private educational institutions they should, have made their intention more apparent. And if we have misinterpreted their intention, the remedy is at hand; the legislature can, by the use of unequivocal and explicit language, make their intention clear.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Cet appel est d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de Qu\u00e9bec confirmant un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du District de Montr\u00e9al, condamnant l'appelante a payer a l'intim\u00e9e $440.80, pour taxes municipales, sur une propriete occup\u00e9e par elle comme \u00e9cole et pensionnat de jeunes filles qui y recoivent l'instruction.\nL'appelante a plaid\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait en vertu de la 41me Vic, ch, 6, sec, 26, exemptee du paiement des taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es. Cette section est ainsi concue:\n26. La section 77 du chap. 15 des Statuts Refondus pour le Bas Canada est amend\u00e9e en. y ajoutant, apr\u00e9s la sous section 2, la disposition suivante:\n3. Toutes maisons d'\u00e9ducation qui no recoivent aucune subvention de la Corporation ou Municipalit\u00e9 ou elles sont situess ainsi que les terrains sur lesquels elles sont \u00e9rigees et leurs d\u00e9pendances, seront exemptees des cotisations municipales et scolaires, quel que soit lacte ou charte en vertu duquel ces cotisations sont impos\u00e9es, et ce nonobstant toutes dispositions a ce contrarres.\nIl est admis que pendant les ann\u00e9es pour lesquelles les taxes sont demandees l'appelante a occup\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans la declaration comme \u00e9cole et pensionnat priv\u00e9 de jeunes filies, et quelle employait plusieurs instituteurs a donner l'education a quatre. vingtcmq jeunes filies, en moyenne, par ann\u00e9e.\nIi est aussi admis que l'appelante n'a refu de i'intim\u00e9e aucune subvention pour le soutien de son \u00e9cole.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9e est que l'exemption invoqu\u00e9e ne s'applique pas aux \u00e9coles privees, mais seulement aux institutions d'education incorporees. La seule question \u00e0. decider est de savoir si l'ecole tenue par l'appelante est une maison d'education, (educational institutions) suivant l'inteniion de la clause ci-dessus cit\u00e9e\nL'hon. juge qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en premiere instanee a donn\u00e9 gain de cause a l'intim\u00e9 en se fondant sur le motif suivant \" Consid\u00e9rant que les expressions dont s'esfc servi le statut implicquent l'idee que les maisons d'education [educational institutions) sont des institutions d'un caractere permanent et fond\u00e9es dans un interet public, et sous le controle de l'autorite, et non des institutions privees et qu'en consequenee les lieux occupes par la d\u00e9feuderesse ne sont pas exempts do taxes.\"\nCette distinction est-elle bien fondee ? Le Ieffislateur avait-il r\u00e9ellement l'inteniion de donner a la disposition ci-dessus cit\u00e9e l'effet d'exclure du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'exemption toutes les \u00e9coles privees qui ne sont pas sons le controle des lois d'education? Au contraire les teimes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux de la disposition t toutes maisons d'education \" doivent nous faire conclure que dans son intention l\u2019exemption est generale, a moins que l'expression \" maison d'education n n'ait recue, avant l'adopiion de cette disposition une signification precise et limitative. fei tel Ctait le cas, le legislateur n'ayant aucunement defini ou qualie. l'expression dont il se sert est necessairement presume l'avoir employee dans le sens que d'autre statut sur le meme sujet ont pa lui donner. Bien que la 4lme Vic, ch. 6, soit an statut amendant les lois concern ant l'education, la sec. 26 amende le ch. 15, sec. 77, en ajoutant une disposition nouvelle, et non pas en modifiant on changeant quelques-unes de ces dispositions. Cependant cette disposition doit-tre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en la lisant comme faisant maintenant partie du statut amend\u00e9 et l'on doit recourir a ce statut pour voir si l'on y trouvera trace de la distinction faite par la cour de premiere instance, Des divesses categories d'exemption de taxe mentionn\u00e9es dans la clause 77, la deuxieme seulement peat nous servir a l'interpretation de celle dont ii s'agit, elle est ainsi concue:\n\u00a7 2. All buildings set apart for purposes of education or of . religious worship, parsonage houses, and all charitable institutions or hospitals, incorporated by Act of Parliament, and the ground or land upon which such buildings are erected, and also all burial ground, shall be exempt from all rates imposed for the purposes of this Act,\nCes exemptions sont generals pour chacune des categories mentionnees,\u2014il n'y a aucune expression qui puisse en limiter l'application, si ce n'est que lesbatisses exemotees doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 destinees, (Set apart,) a des fins religieuses ou d'education. Mais il n'y est nullement question qu'elles devront 6tre soumises au controle d'une autorite publique quelconque. La seule restriction a la g\u00e9neralit\u00e9 de l'exemption n'existe qu'a Tegard des hopitaux et des institutions de charit\u00e9 qui pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'exemption, doivent \u00e9tre des institutions incorpore\u00e9s. La conclusion a tirer de la c'est que quant aux institutions d'education ii suffit pour avoir droit a l'exemption que leurs batisses soient destin\u00e9es a l'education. La loi n'exige pas qu'elle soient incorporees comme les hopitaux ou institutions de charit\u00e9 ni qu'elles soient sous le controle d'une autorit\u00e9 quelconque. Plus tard esc venue la sec. 26 cit\u00e9e plus haut, ajoutant une autre classe d'exemption; comme ii a deja \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus haut cette exemption est \u00e9tablie en des termes g\u00e9neraux qui n impiiquent aucune restriction. Ii me semble qu'on ne devrait pas introduire une distiction du genre de celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur lui-m\u00eame n'a pas jug\u00e9 a propos d'en faire dans les dispositions ci-dessus cit\u00e9es.\nUne \u00e9cole tenue comme l'est celle dont ii s'agit, estelle moins une institution d'education que si elle \u00e9tait sous le controle de commssaires d'ecolle? Fait-on autre chose dans l'une et l'autre que d'enseigner. Le controle auquel pent etre souiais une \u00e9cole en change-t-il la. nature Si deux \u00e9coles sont tenues exactement cle la m\u00earne maniere, ou l'enseignement est de meme valeur, mais Tune est sous le controle des commissaries d'ecole et l'autre en dehors de ce controle, et sous ia direction seulement d'un professeur particulier, serait-il raisonnable de dire que la premiere est une institution d'education et que la seconde ne lest pas? Si la loi a considere les \u00e9coess \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires comme des irstitutions d'education, \u00e9videmment on ne doit pas restreindre les termes \"maison d'education n a la designation des institutions d'enseignement superieure,\u2014ils ont une signification plus ample et pouvent comprendre les \u00e9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires. Cette interpretation est adimise par la sec. 6 du ch. 15 reglant la distribution du fonds destine a l'encouragement de l'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur entre les University, College, S\u00e9minaires, Academies, etc. et institutions d'education, autre que les \u00e9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentairss ordinaires, etc. Pourquoi le l\u00e9gislateur a-t-il fait cette exception, si ce nest parce que sans cette declaration expresse les \u00e9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 comprisss dans les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \"institutions d'education qui comprennent toutes les \u00e9coles, qu'elles soient privees ou publiques. Je ne trouve pas dans nos lois d'education d'expressions sutnsantes pour justifier la distinction qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite; bien au contraire je trouve que les expressions si gen\u00e9rates quelle emploie repoussent l'idee d'une telle distinction. Je crois en consequence devorr donner a la sec. 26 tout l'effet que comporte la gen\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de sea termes et je crois que l'ecole de l'appelante doit etre consider comme une maison d'education suivant cette disposition.\nJe crois que la cause de Chegaray v. Jenkins ([10]), n'a aucune application a la present cause. Sa decision repose sur des statuts differents des notres.\nQuant a labus que lon pourrait faire de cette exemption de taxes en \u00e9tablissant des \u00e9coles plus tot dans le but de beneficier de l'exemption que dans celui d'enseigner, ii n'en peut tre question dans cette cause. Les faits reepoussent toute supposition de ce genre. Ce n'est pas un sujet de plainte en cette cause,\u2014mais simplement un argument ab inconvenienti. Lorsqu'on se plaindra d'un semblable abus, je crois que les tribunaux n'eprouveront pas de difficult a faire la distinction entre une \u00e9cole tenue de bonne foi et celle ciui ne le serait que comme un pr\u00e9texte pour \u00e9viter le paiement de la taxe.\nPour ces motifs je suss d'avis que l'appel doit \u00e9tre allou\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAUJ J.\u2014The only question in this case is whether the appellant's property in Montreal, occupied, as she claims, as an educational institution, is exempt from municipal taxes. To the respondent's action for such taxes the appellants pleaded that the said immovable property, described in the said plaintiffs declaration, and upon and in respect of \"which the assessments or taxes sought to be recovered by the present action have been, as the plaintiff alleges, imposed, was, during the whole of the years eighteen hundred and seventy-eight, eighteen hundred and seventy-nine, and eighteen hundred and eighty, and long previous thereto, occupied by the said defendants as an educational institution, with its dependencies, for the education of girls, and that the said educational institution received no grant from the plaintiff within the limits of which it was situated and that by law the said immovable property on which the said educational institution is erected, and its dependencies, was, at all the times mentioned in the said plaintiff's declaration, exempt from all municipal and school taxes whatsoever; by reason whereof the said immovable property is exempt from D the taxes sought to be recovered in this case, and the said defendants are not bound nor liable, as alleged in ] the said plaintiff's declaration.\nThe parties adopted the following admissions:\nFirst. That the property set out in the said plaintiff's declaration was, during the time mentioned therein, occupied and used as a private boarding and day school for girls, kept and maintained by the said defendant, who employed divers teachers, and during that time had therein, on an average, for their education, as pupils, eighty-five girls per annum.\nSecond. That the said institution for the education of girls never received any grant from the plaintiff.\nThird. That if the said institution be not an educational institution under section 26 of 41 Vic. c. 6 judgment should go for the amount demanded and costs; if, on the contrary, it is such educational institution, within the meaning of the said section, the said plaintiff's action should be dismissed with costs.\nThis is then all that we have to determine.\nThe section of the act referred to reads as follows:\u2014\nEvery educational institution receiving no grant from the corporation or municipality in which, they are situated, and the land on which they are erected, and its dependencies, shall be exempted from municipal and school taxes, whatever may be the act or charter under which such taxes are imposed, notwithstanding all provisions to the contrary.\nAs a matter of fact, the property in question, it cannot be denied is an educational institution and nothing else. But, say the respondents, it is not an educational institution within the meaning of the act. In other words, they contend that though the statute says \"every educational establishment\" it does not mean every educational establishment.\" On them, it must be conceded rests the onus to establish that proposition. Their contention is that this statute applies only to public institutions under the control of the school commissioners, and not to private schools like the one kept by the appellant. After mature con side ratio, I think it safer not to distinguish when the law does not do so\u2014not to try, as it were, to make the statute say what it does not say\u2014and to hold? that the property in question is free from taxation. Under sec. 6 of ch. 15 C. S. L.C . this institution could get a grant from the education funds. The respondents admit that it would then not be taxable. But does the fact that they do not receive any such grant from the public funds render them liable to taxation ? I cannot see it. It is just because they are no burthen to the Government, or to the municipal authority, that they should be exempt from these taxes There are a number of education al institutions in Montreal and other cities that is colleges seminaries and convents\u2014which do not fall under said ch. 15 0.C.S.C. and which receive no grant from the government, and yet which pay no municipal taxes Yet this must be so under this very clause of this 41 Vic. I do not know of any other statute in the same sense. I asked counsel at the argument if they knew Of any other and they could cite none. For, it must be remembered, sec. 77 of ch. 15 0.5.L.O , and sec. 13 of 32 Vic. ch. 16, apply only to school, and not to municipal, taxes, and sec. 712 of the Municipal Code does not apply to incorporated cities or towns. The fact that such colleges and convents may be incorporated cannot affect the question. This section of the Municipal Code I have just cited exempts from taxation all educational institutions or corporations, showing that, throughout all the rural districts an educational institution need not necessarily be incorporated to be free from municipal taxes. Has the legislature intended that what is not taxable in the rural parts of the country should be taxable in Montreal or other incorporated cities ? It would require a clear text of law to brine: me to such a conclusion.\nIt has been argued that the consequences of a judgment maintaining the appellants' contention would be to free from taxation a number of small private schools in Montreal. I do not think so. \"We simply declare that the property here in question is an educational institution within the meaning of the act. I do not say that any petty school in Montreal or elsewhere would come under these terms.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the plaintiffs' action dismissed with costs in all the courts against them.\nGWYNEE J.\u2014The clause relied upon by the appellants as exempting their property from liability to the payment of municipal taxes in the city of Montreal, is found in an act of the legislature of the Province of Quebec 41 Vic. ch. 6 which is intituled \"An act further to amend the laws respecting public instruction in this province \" and it is enacted in amendment of sec. 77 ch 15 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada which is intituled: \" An act respecting provincial aid for superior education and Normal \" and Common Schools,\" and the question before us is whether the property of private persons used as a private school for the education of young ladies, and conducted wholly under the direction, management and control .of the private proprietors for their own benefit, as their source of income, is, by the 77th sec. of ch. 15 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada as amended by 41 Vic. c. 6, exempted from liability to municipal taxes in the city of Montreal. By the first five sections of this act which consolidates into one the several statutes theretofore passed and then in force for making provision for the support of common schools, and the promotion of elementary education in the rural municipalities and in the cities of Quebec and Montreal, and for the promotion also of superior education \" and the establishment and support of normal and model schools, a fund called \" The Lower Canada superior education investment fund' composed of the proceeds arising from the sale or commutation of the Jesuits estates, was created; and the revenues and interest accruing from such fund, together with a sum of twenty thousand dollars per annum taken from the Consolidated Fund of Canada, and such sum out of the common school fund of Lower Canada as with the above might be necessary for the realization of eighty-eight thousand dollars per annum, were constituted a fund called u The Lower Canada superior education income fund.\"\nBy the 6th section of the act it was enacted that the said income fund, or such part thereof as the Governor in Council should from time to time direct should be annually apportioned by the superintendent of schools for Lower Canada in such manner and to and among such \"universities,\u201d \u201ccolleges,\" \"seminaries,\" academies,\" \"high or superior schools,\" \"model schools and \"educational institutions other than the ordinary elementary schools,\" in such sums and proportions, as the Governor in Council should approve.\nIt was contended strongly by Mr. Kerr, on behalf of the appellants, that their school for young ladies was clearly an \"educational institution within the meaning of that term as used in the above section, and upon this assumption he argued that the same term introduced into the act by 41st Vic. c 6 should receive a like construction, so as to embrace the appellant's school within the term as it is used in the 77th section as so amended. But that the appellant's school does come within the term \"educational institution\" as used in the 6th section, is by no means to be assumed. The D better opinion appears to me to be that it does not, whatever may be the construction of the 77th section as amended. The fund is created for the purpose of promoting superior education alone; institutions there-fore which impart such education to all or to some of their scholars can only be intended. This is indicated by the title at the head of the sections numbering from 6 to 9 of the act, namely: \"Aid to superior educational institutions.\" Now, the term \"educational institution.\u201d is altogether an unusual and quite inappropriate term to apply to a private person, who conducts a school upon his own property; and that no such person, nor yet the school itself which the private proprietor conducts, is meant, but on the contrary persons united together as religious or secular bodies of a corporate or quasi corporate character, is apparent from the 8th and 9th sections. By the eighth it is provided that no grant shall be made \"to any institution owning real \"estate whose liabilities exceed two-thirds of the value \"of such estate.\" The institution,\" therefore, which is entitled to receive a grant must be capable of owning real estate and of incurring debts, and the term must, therefore, have a personal application. The school property where the education is given, and which is used and occupied for educational purposes, cannot come within the term as here used. The personality of the term is further shown in the 9th section, which pro vides that:-\nAny educational institution desirous of obtaining a grant under this act shall make application to that effect to the superintendent of education, &c, &c.\nEvery institution, therefore, which is entitled to a grant under the act must be capable of entertaining a desire to obtain it, and of making application for it, that is to say, must be possessed of personality. The section then provides that \"the superintendent shall not recommend any grant to any educational institution whose application is not accompanied by a report, showing,\" among other things\u2014\" the composition of the governing body.\"\nThis language points to the institution entitled to receive a grant being of a corporate or quasi-corporate character, having, as such institutions have, a governing body.\n\"The general course of instruction and the books used.\"\nThis is required for the purpose of satisfying the superintendent that the course of instruction comes within what is esteemed superior education.\n\"The number of persons taught gratuitously or taught and boarded gratuitously.\"\nThe requirement is not that the report shall show whether any persons, and if so how many, are taught gratuitously, or taught and boarded gratuitously, but the report must state the number of persons taught gratuitously, &c, &c, seeming thereby to indicate that gratuitous education of some persons is a condition required by the act in order to show that the institution whose application for a grant is to be considered confers some public benefit to justify its receiving aid from public funds. Finally, it appears to me to be a consideration not to be disregarded that as the bodies which are in the 6th section excepted from the term \"educational institutions \" entitled to receive a grant are themselves institutions of a corporate and public character, the general term from which they are excepted should be regarded as of like character; the expression is \"educational institutions other than the ordinary elementary schools.\"\nIn view of all of the above considerations I am of opinion that private persons conducting, as do the appellants under their own sole direction, management and control, a young ladies' private school for their own sole benefit as a source of income, do not, nor does the school so conducted by them come within the term \"educational institution\" as used in the sections of the act numbered from 6 to inclusive; and that, therefore no argument whatever in support of the appellant's construction of the 77th sec. of the act as amended by 41 Vic. ch. 6 can be founded upon the assumption that their school is such a one as would qualify and entitle them to receive a grant under these sections The clauses relating to assessment and rates commence with 73 by which it was enacted that it should be the duty of school commissioners, and of the trustees of dissentient schools in their respective municipalities to cause to be levied by assessment and rate in each municipality a sum equal to that allowed out of the common school fund for such municipality. This clause has no application to the cities of Montreal or Quebec, special provisions being made for these cities by the sections numbering from 128 to 134, which provided that no rate at all should be levied for school purposes in those cities but that the aid to be furnished to common schools therein should be by grant from the general city funds; but as these sections have been repealed and others substituted for them by 32nd Vic. ch. 16 I shall not further refer to them nor for the present shall I refer to sec. 77 further than to say that as it relates as it stood prior to the amendment enacted by 41 Vic only to exemptions from liability to taxes imposed by sec. 73, it had no application to the city of Montreal in which the property of the appellants is situate.\nThe act 32nd Vic. ch. 18 is initialed: \"An act to amend the law respecting education in this Province,\" and its enactments must needs be considered in connection with those of ch. 15 of the C.S.L.C. whenever the construction of the latter becomes now under consideration By the 13th section of tills act it was enacted that the school commissioners of the majority in any school municipality should alone have the power of levying taxes on the lands and real estates of corporations and incorporated companies, but that they should annually pay over to the trustees of the minority a proportion of all the taxes levied by them on such corporations or companies in the same ratio as the government grant for the same year should have been divided between them and the said trustees and that\n\"No religious charitable or educational institutions or corporations should be taxed for school purposes on the property occupied by them for the objects for which they were instituted; but on all property held by them, or any of them, for the purpose of deriving an income therefrom, they shall be taxed by the school commissioners of the religious majority or minority to which such corporations or institutions belong and to the exclusive benefit of such majority or minority, or in conformity with the declarations which they or each of them, may make to that effect; but, in the event that the religious body to which such corporations or institutions belong is not apparent and where no such declaration has been made then such last mentioned properties shall be dealt with in like manner as the properties of other corporations or incorporated companies in virtue of this section.\nBy the 21st section the 133rd sec. of ch. 15 of the C. S.L.C. and the three first sections of 31 Vie ch 22 are repealed. By the 22nd it was enacted that the annual grant to be paid for the support of schools in the cities of Quebec and of Montreal under the 24th, 88th and 89th sections of the 15th chapter of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada should be in the proportion of the populations of the said cities and should be apportioned by the Minister of Public Instruction, or the Superintendent of Education for the time being, between the Roman Catholic and Protestant Boards of School Commissioners according to the relative proportions of the Roman Catholic and Protestant populations in the said cities according to the then last census and by the 23rd. section it was enacted that the corporations of the cities of Quebec and. Montreal should, pay for the support of the schools in the said cities a sum equal to three times the amount of the share of the grant coming to the schools of the said, city, and. that the sum coming to each of the Roman Catholic and Protestant Boards of School Commissioners under provisions for apportionment contained in the act should be paid by the said corporations by two equal semi-annual payments to the secretary-treasurers of the said boards irrespective of the collection of the tax provided for by sec. 24. By this section (24) it was enacted that the corporations of the cities of Quebec and Montreal should levy annually by assessment on real estate in the said cities a tax sufficient to cover the amount payable by them for the support of schools under the above provisions, and that the said tax should be collected and recovered at the time and in the manner provided for the other city taxes on real estate, and the said tax should be known as the \"city school tax.\"Then follows section 25 which enacts that:\nProperty belonging to religious, charitable or educational institutions end corporations and occupied by the said institutions or corporations for the purpose for which they were respectively established and not held by them solely for the purpose of deriving an income therefrom, shall be exempted from the said c city school tax.\"\nThe object and effect of this last section was simply to exempt property in the cities of Quebec and Montreal from the payment of \"the city school tax\" under the like circumstances, and only under the like circumstances, as like property in the rural school municipalities was exempted from payment of school tax by section 13.\nThe exemption there is found in a section relating to the levying of school tax on lands and real estate of corporations and. incorporated companies, The religious, charitable or educational institutions, or corporations z whose property, occupied by them for the purpose for which they were instituted, is exempt from taxation under the section are the same institutions whose property, held by them for the purpose of deriving income there from, is not exempted, but shall be taxed by the school commissioners of the religious body to which such corporations or institutions belong and to the exclusive benefit of such religious body. The. section then provides that i in the event that the religious body to which such corporations or institutions belong is not apparent,\u201d then such properties that is the properties of such corporations or institutions from which they derive income\u2014shall be dealt with as the property of other corporations or incorporated companies. The term \"educational institutions and corporations, as used in this section, plainly refers to the owners of the property which is exempted, and it must, in my opinion, be construed as being limited to corporations. It is wholly inapplicable to the case of a private person using his property for the purpose of conducting a private school thereon for his own profit. We do not speak of the proprietor of a private school as being i instituted \"for that purpose. He cannot be the \"educational institution referred to in the section, So neither can the school which is kept by him on his own property\u2014for the property exempted by the section is the property of the \"educational institutions.\" The term can be applied solely to the owners of the property exempted, and not to the property itself which is occupied as a school Then again these words \"educational institutions or corporations,\" used as they are in connection with \" religious institutions or corporations,\" and with c charitable institutions or corporations,\" plainly, I think, show that what was intended by the term was an aggregation of persons belonging either to the Roman Catholic or Protestant religions united together as a body for the purpose of religion, or of charity, or of education, which aggregation of persons so united together are spoken of as institutions or corporations instituted for one of the above purposes, that is to say, as corporations, and the same construction must be put upon the term wherever it occurs in the ch. 15 of the Consolidated statutes as amended by 32 Vic. ch. 16. Now, as to the operation of section 77 as it stood prior to the passing of 41 Vic. ch. 6, and I think it better that we should refer to the French copy of the act upon a question of this nature :\u2014\nTous les batiments consacres a l'education ou au culte religieux presbyteres, et toutes instututions charitables ou hopitaux incorpores par acte du parliament et le terrain ou emplacement sur lecquel lis sont erig\u00e9s ainsi que les cimetieres seront exempts de la cotisation impos\u00e9e pour les fins de cet acte.\nThe word d dedicated,\" as it seems to me, would be a more exact translation into English of the word consacr\u00e9s \" is here used than s set apart.\" \" Consucre's a l'education ou au culte religleux. These words, so corrected convey to my mind the idea that a destination to a use in which the public, or a considerable portion thereof, were directly interested, as they would be in the case of a building dedicated to religious worship, was intended rather than the use, temporary it might be, by a private person of his own private property to teaching school therein for his own profit; so likewise the other terms used in the same sentence to designate the other descriptions of property intended to be exempted being all of a public nature, seem to me to point in the same direction. \"Presbyteres \" represents a building, which being for the sole occupation, as dwelling houses, of ministers of religion engaged in conducting religious worship, and to be enjoyed as part of their stipend, may be said to be so annexed buildings dedicated to public worship as to partake of z their public nature, so \" toutes iustitulions charitables ou hdpitaux imcorpores, ainsi que les cimilieres,' are all of a public nature, so that in construing the words \u201cles butiments consacres h l'education\" in this connection, the 'maxim noscitur a sociis seems to apply. Moreover, as the act is one relating to public grants in aid of superior education and normal and common schools, the natural construction of the words is to regard them as applying to buildings dedicated to the education to aid which the act is passed, and as exempting from liability to a public tax, levied in aid of such education, property which is dedicated to the purpose in aid of which the tax is levied; and the result, in my opinion, is that private property such as that of the appellant's, occupied as a school by private persons engaged in and pursuing the profession of teaching school for their own benefit and profit, as their source of income, was not exempt from liability to rates levied in aid of the public schools either in \"the rural municipalities or in the city of Montreal.\nThen as to exemption from liability to municipal tax action, the municipal code, which applies only to the territory of the province of Quebec not included in cities and towns incorporated by special statutes, exempts only the following property :\u2014\n1. Property belonging to Her Majesty or held in trust for her use, and property owned or occupied by municipal corporations.\n2. Property owned by or occupied for the use of the federal or the provincial governments.\n3. Property belonging to fabriques or to religious, charitable or educational institutions or corporations, or occupied by such fabriques, institutions or corporations for which they were established, and not possessed solely by them to derive a revenue there from. 4. Burial grounds, bishops' palaces, parsonage houses, and their dependencies.\n5. All property belonging to railway companies, &c\nThe property in the third of the above paragraphs, which is the only one to which we have occasion to refer, is wholly framed upon the model of and, with the exception of the addition of the word \" fabriques, taken almost verbatim from, the 25th section of 32 Vic. ch 16, which defines the property which alone is exempted from the rate by the 24th section of that act directed to be levied by the corporation of the city of Montreal and called the city school tax;\" and the words \" educational institutions \" as used in the above paragraph in the Municipal Code Act, which is itself but a consolidation of the previous acts having relation to the same subject must receive, as indeed from their context they require, a like construction as they would receive in 32 Vic. ch. 16, from which, for the purpose of consolidation into the Municipal Code they are taken, and as so used in the Code they clearly apply to the owners of the property which is to be exempt, and not to the property itself; moreover, in my opinion, they by the context in which they appear, apply to an aggregation or association of persons, religious or secular united together in a corporate capacity to carry out certain purposes of religion or charity or education, for which they were established or founded or united together as an association, and cannot be construed as including a private person, or private persons like the appellants, conducting a private school in order to derive an income there from as their means of supporting themselves, and the conclusion is that a person conducting such a school in a rural municipality is not, nor is his property used by him as such school, exempted from taxation by the Municipal Code, and if such property is exempt from taxation, either for school or municipal rates, in any rural municipality, it must v be by force alone of 41st Vic. cli. 6 and. if in any city or town, it must be either by the express terms of the act incorporating such city or town, or in some act amending the same, or by force of 41 Vic. ch. 6.\nIn acts incorporating cities and towns already incorporated, there does not appear to have been adopted any uniform clause expressing in identical terms in every act the property intended to be exempted, and yet it is, I think inconceivable that by the difference in the language used in some of these the legislature intended to exempt property of a private person, used by him for his own private profit, if used for giving private tuition therein or as a private school as a source of income, either from contribution to the fund provided for the maintenance of common schools in which the general public are interested, or from municipal taxes, which enhance the value of the premises by the uses of which he obtains his income, and, no doubt, also his profits, in which the public have no interest whatever. If such an intention had been entertained it would have been unequivocally expressed.\nIn the 29 Vie. ch. 57 (A.D. 1865) which is an act consolidating into one act all acts and ordinances relating to the corporation of the city of Quebec, the exemption from taxation is provided for by the 25th section, in the following terms :\u2014\nThe property of any incorporated institution for educational or charitable purposes, occupied and used for educational or charitable purposes, and also all other property by such institution leased for the aforesaid purposes, or occupied as school houses by the school commissioners of the said city, shall be exempt from taxation, and such houses or properties so occupied are also exempt from tenants' tax.\nIn the act incorporating the town of Longueil, 37 Vie. ch. 49, it is expressed in language identical with that used in the Municipal Code Act. In 37 Vic. ch. 51 which, is an act to revise and consolidated the charter of the city of Montreal and the several acts amending the same there is no clause of exemption of any property, but in 38 Vic. ch. 73 (1875) which was passed in amendment of 37 Vic. ch. 51 there is, and it is as follows:\u2014\nSec. 3. Les eglises, presbyteres et palais piscopaux sont exempts de toutes taxes, les \u00e9tablissements occupes pour des fins de charite sont exempts de taxes municipales ordinaires et annuelles.\nIn this act the intention of the legislature seems to have been that as to the tax called the \"city school tax\" exemption was provided by 32 Vic. ch. 16, and that as to municipal taxes there should be no exemption other than those specified in the above clause of 38 Vic. ch. 73.\nIn 38th Vic. ch. 76 (1876), incorporating the city of Three Rivers, the exemption clause is thus expressed:\nTout bien consacre au culte public ainsi que tout cimetiere.\nToute maison d'ecole pubiique et le terrain sur lequel elle est construite.\nTouee maison ou tout \u00e9tablissement public d'education ainsi que le terrain sur lequel il est construit.\nTous batiments, terrains et proprietes occupes ouposs\u00e9d\u00e9s par des hdpitaux ou autre: \u00e9tablissements de charite.\nIn the act 39 Vic. chap. 79, incorporating the city of Hnil, the exemption is thus expressed;\n4. Touee maison d'ecoee publique et le terrain sur lequel elle est construite.\n5. Tout \u00e9tablissement ou maison d'education ainsi que le terrainsur lequel il est construit.\n6. Tous batimenss, terrains et proprietes occupes ou poss\u00e9cles par des hopitaux ou autres \u00e9tablissements le charite ou d\u00e9ducation, et non poss\u00e9d\u00e9s pour y faire des profits.\nIt was argued that the above clause No. 5, tout \u00e9tab lissement au maisnn d'education, &c shows an intention to exempt every school house of whatever nature, including private schools conducted for private gain as a source of income to the private owner, but no such construction is, in my judgment, at all necessary, and if not necessary the clause should not be so construed. The natural construction, in my opinion, is that in the absence of an express intention to the contrary the properties intended to be exempted are those referred to in the acts relating to public instruction, that is to ch. 15 of C. S. L. C. and the acts in amendment thereof as 32nd Vic. ch. 16.\nThe previous clause exempted only the common and elementary schools and the land on which they are built. This left \"universities,\" c colleges,\" &c , &c, the property of religious communities and incorporated institutions, unprovided for. It is reasonable to construe clause 5 as introduced to cover those, and we are not, in my opinion, justified in construing it to include property of private persons, to exempt which no intention whatever otherwise appears anywhere. To correct in the future the want of uniformity in the clause relating to exemptions in acts of incorporation, provision was made in an act passed in 40 Vic. ch. 29 and initialed: \"The Towns\u2019 Corporations general clauses Act.\"\nBy the 1st section of this act it was enacted that the provisions of the act should apply to every town, corporation or municipality which should thereafter be established by the legislature, and that they should constitute part of the special act relative to such town so as to form with it one and the same act unless they be expressly modified or excepted; and by sec. 2 it was. enacted that for any provisions of the act not to be incorporated in the special act, the special act must expressly declare that such provisions, specifying them by their numbers, should not form part thereof, and that the act should be interpreted accordingly; and the general exemption clause was enacted as follows in sec. 325:\nThe following property shall not be taxable:\u2014 1. Property belonging to Her Majesty or held in trust for her use, and property owned or occupied by the corporation of the municipality.\n2. Property owned or occupied by the federal or the provincial governments.\n3. Property belonging to fabriques or religious, charitable or educational institutions or corporations.\n4. Burial grounds, bishops palaces, parsonage houses and there dependencies.\n5. All property belonging to railway companies receiving a grant from the provincial government, for the whole time during which such grant is accorded,\nThus adopting the precise exemptions, and almost in identical language, as those named in the Municipal Code Act. Then by sec. 441 it is enacted that the act might apply to city corporations which should in future be incorporated, and in such case the word town shall be replaced by the word city every time that the meaning of the act thus applied should require it. Provision was thus made for uniformity in so far as to place the rural municipalities and all corporations or municipalities of cities or towns to be created in the future upon the same tooting as to exemptions, namely, these enumerated in this act, and these only; thus manifestly, as it appears to me, excluding the idea of any intention that any property of any private persons engaged as the appellants are in keeping school thereon for their own profit, and as their means of deriving income there from, should be exempted. But though provision was thus made for uniformity as regards city or town corporations or municipalities to be created in the future, the want of uniformity caused by the difference in the several exemption clauses in the acts or charters relating to cities and towns already incorporated still remained The provisions of 32 Vic. ch. 16 as to common schools in the cities of Montreal and Quebec were expressly incorporated into the act of incorporation of the city of Hull, 38 Vic. oh. 79 sec. 82 and. possibly into the acts incorporating other cities and towns. By 38 Vie. ch. 76, the corporation of the city of Three Rivers were constituted the \"School Commissioners of the city of Three Rivers,\" in which corporate name, and not in that of the city corporation, they were to act when acting as school commissioners; but as regards municipal taxes, which were regulated by the acts of incorporation of cities and towns, there was no uniformity. Now the removal of this want of uniformity was as necessary as regarded cities and towns already incorporated as those to be incorporated under the provisions of 40 Vic. ch. 29; and this seems to me to afford the key to the construction of the 26th sec. of 41 Vic. ch. 6 which was in my opinion, enacted by way of amendment of sec. 77 of ch. 15 of 0. S. L. 0. for the purpose, by this short addition imported into the section, of providing that the matter of the amendment thus introduced, should be read as part of that act notwithstanding any provision there might be open to a contrary construction in any act or charter of incorporation of any city or town (this being the mode of creating such municipalities) whether such act or charter was passed previously to the passing of ch. 15 0. S. L. 0., or in the interval between the passing of that act and of 41 Vic. c. 6; thus by a short method placing the enactments relating to exemption from taxation both as to school and municipal taxes in cities and towns already incorporated upon the same footing as was provided with regard to the future by 40 Vic.ch. 29, and with regard to rural municipalities by ch. 15 as amended by 32 Vic. oh. 16, and by the Municipal Code Act.\nThe 2nd sub-section of sec. 77 of ch. 15 C. S. L. C. as amended, reads as follows:\nTous les batiements consacres a l'education ou &u culte reliffiGux presbyteres, et toutes institutions charitables, ou hopitaux incor pores par act' du parliament, et le terrain ou emplacement sur lequel ils soot \u00e9rigs, ainsi que les cimetieres, seront exempts de la cotisation imposee pour les fins de cet acte. Toutes maisons d'edu cation qui ne recoivent aucune subvention de la corporation ou municipate ite ou elles sont situess, ainsi que les terrains sur lesquels M elles sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es, et leur d\u00e9pendances, seront exemptes des cotisations municipales et scolaires, quelque soit lacte ou charte en vertu duquel ces cotisations sont impos\u00e9es, et cc nonobstant toutes dispositions a ce contraires.\nThe words toutes maisons d'educafion qui ne recoivent aucune subvention de la corporations, &c, &c, are, in my opinion not well translated e every educational institution,\" as they are in the English version, for in every other part of the act in which that term occurs it applies to persons the owners of property consacris a reducation, and not to the property itself so dedicated.\nWhat is intended by the words qui ne recoivent aucune subvention de la corporation ou, municipality on piles sont situ\u00e9es it is difficult to understand no explanation has been given nor any satisfactory one suggested. the words, according to their ordinary import, convey the idea of a qualification of, or exception from, the generality of the previous words, toutes maisons d'education, as that it is not actually toutes maisons d'education which is intended, but only such as do not receive a subvention from the corporations in which they are situate * but this construction would seem to convey an intention, by implication, that only those who do not receive a subvention from the corporation in which they are should be exempt from taxation, and that those who do receive such subvention should not be. The only maisons d'educatonn which can be said to receive a subvention from the corporation in which they are situate are the common schools in those cities whose acts of incorporation and the acts affecting the corporations are similar to those of the cities of Montreal Quebec and Hull, whereby the aid given to common schools is declared to be by grant out of the general funds of the respective corporations, irrespective wholly of the levy of any tax for the purpose, such grant being subsequently reimbursed to the corporation making it by the levy, together with the ordinary municipal taxes, in each year of what in 32 Vie. oh. 16 is called the \"city school tax.\" If these common schools, which may be said to receive subvention from the corporations in which they are situate, are to be construed as the maisons d'education to be contrasted with those who do not receive any subvention, then the words, qui ne recoivent aucune subvention\" &c, &c, might well mean the universities colleges, seminaries, &c, &c, mentioned in the other sections of the act ch. 15 but why refer to them in this manner? For, by so doing, according to ordinary construction, the intention by implication would arise that the common schools should not be exempt which could not have been the intention.\nIt was argued that the words were intended to cover private schools like that of the appellant's, for they do not receive aid from the corporations in which they are situate; but this view cannot be adopted, for\n1. No act of incorporation of any municipality, nor any act, authorizes the application of the moneys of the corporation in aid of private persons keeping a private school; and it would be senseless to treat persons who therefore could not receive any such aid to be intended under this form of expression.\n2. Applying the words to them or to their schools would still leave unremoved the difficulty of subjecting to taxation by implication these public schools in cities which may for the reasons aforesaid be said to receive subvention from the corporations in which they are situate; and\u2014\n3. Such a construction would be utterly subversive of the intent of preserving uniformity in the case of acts of incorporation of cities and towns hereafter to be incorporated appearing in 40 Vic. ch. 29, which ex eludes all idea that the schools of private persons should be exempt.\nWhatever may have been the object of introducing these words, they seem, at any rate, I think, to indicate that the \"maisons d'education\" intended were those situated in city or town corporations or municipalities; these words \"corporations or municipality\" are the precise words used in 40 Vic. ch. 29 to signify a town or city corporation.\nBy the 1st section it is enacted that the provisions of the act shall apply to \u201cevery town, corporation or municipality,\" and by sec. 441 \"every city, corporation or municipality.\u201d\nThese words \"seront exempts de cotisation municipales et scolaires \" &c. &c. confirm me in this view. Those words impart, to my mind, that the maisons d'education intended to be exempted were these which, by reason of certain provisions to the contrary contained in some act or charter, were, or were deemed to be, not exempted. Now, the only provisions of this nature were contained in some of the acts of incorporation of cities or towns or in some acts in amendment of such, acts of incorporation, which provisions being removed, as in the view which I take of the amendment they are a uniformity is established between exemptions as to municipal and school taxes in the rural municipalities and in incorporated cities and towns, and the provisions of 40 Vic. ch 29.\nReading then sub-sec. 2 of sec, 77 of ch. 15, as amended as one section, it should be construed as applying only to maisons d\u00e9ducation where education is given by the institutions and corporations mentioned in the act and as exempting both from municipal and school taxes all public schools and all universities, colleges, seminaries, &c, &c, for the purpose of aiding winch the act was passed and whether such maisons d'education were situated in cities or towns or the rural districts and this, notwithstanding the provisions to the contrary which do in fact appear in some of the acts incorporating cities and towns,\nThe appeal, therefore, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Kerr, Carter 8c Goldstein.\nSolicitor for respondents: Rouer Roy.\n[1] 3 Sand.

They had dealt in this way for several years, when, in 1882, H. shipped 180 cases of beef vi\u00e2 Pictou and I. C. R., addressed to M. The bill of lading for this shipment was sent to M., and provided that the goods were to be delivered at Pictou to the freight agent of the I. C. R. or his assigns, the freight to be payable in Halifax. M., the consignee, being on the verge of insolvency, indorsed the bill of lading to McM. to secure accommodation acceptances. H. drew on M. for the value of the consignment, but the draft was not accepted, and H. then directed the agent of the I. C. R. not to deliver the goods. The goods had been forwarded from Pictou, and the agent there telegraphed to the agent in Halifax to hold them. McM. applied to the agent at Halifax for the goods, and tendered the freight, but delivery was refused. In a replevin suit against the Halifax agent,\u2014 Held, affirming the judgment of the court below, Henry J. dissenting, that the goods were sent to the agent at Pictou to be forwarded, and that he had no other interest in them, or right or duty connected with them, than to forward them to their destination, and could not authorize the agent at Halifax to retain them.\nHeld also, that whether or not a legal title to the goods passed to McM. the position of the agent in retaining the goods was simply that of a wrongdoer, and McM. had such an equitable interest in such goods, and right to the possession thereof, as would prevent the agent from withholding them.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case may be briefly stated as follows:\nEarly in 1877 one Haley, of Souris P. E. I., wishing to commence the business of packing lobsters, agreed with Mathers, of Halifax, that the latter should supply him with tin plates, money, &c., and that he should send to Mathers all the lobsters which he should pack in order that the supplies should be paid for out of the proceeds of the sales of the goods, Mathers being paid a commission for selling. That agreement was acted on for six years.\nAt the end of 1882 Haley was indebted to Mathers from $7,000 to $9,000. On 28th December, 1882, Haley sent from Souris to Halifax, per schr. \"Josephine,\" vi\u00e2 Pictou and Intercolonial Railway, the goods in question in this suit, 180 cases of canned beef, worth about $1,000, and forwarded to Mathers the bill of lading, which, however, made the goods deliverable to the freight agent of the Intercolonial Railway at Pictou Landing, or his assigns.\nMathers about this time getting into difficulties and wishing to secure the plaintiff, respondent, for accommodation endorsements which had previously been made, endorsed to him the bill of lading, which was never endorsed by the freight agent at Pictou Lading. After the transfer of the bill of lading the respondent called on the appellant and demanded possession of the goods, and tendered the appellant the amount of freight due upon these goods, and also a balance which the appellant claimed was due by Mathers to the railway in respect of certain goods carried and previously delivered to Mathers. The appellant declined to accept the money tendered, and refused to deliver the goods having been so instructed by Haley.\nThe assignee of the bill of lading replevied the goods and obtained a verdict which was sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHenry Q.C., for appellants.\nThe agreement gives Mathers no right to the goods. He obtains an equitable right to have the goods left in his possession. At common law he would have a right to maintain an action for damages for the non-execution of the agreement. He was merely a bailee. Assuming that the bill of lading was effectually indorsed to McPherson, under these circumstances I question whether that would give him any additional rights to those which Mathers had. No new consideration was given.\nThe most that can be said as to Mather's position is, that he had a right to get the goods as Haley's agent. It will be conceded that in law and equity Haley is the real owner of the goods.\nI take the point that this action, having been brought before the Judicature Act, must fail.\nMcPherson brought this action on the theory that these were his goods. Suppose this case were in equity, the judgment gives plaintiff the goods themselves, not the value of them.\nGraham Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe legal title in these goods passed to Mathers. The only thing urged against this is, that the bill of lading was unindorsed. This having been done in pursuance of the previous agreement, it vested the title to the goods in the plaintiff. See Allen v. Williams[1]; Campbell on Commercial Sales, p. 240 citing the case of Coxe v. Harden[2]; Dick v. humsden[3]. The delivery of the bill of lading was the transfer of the goods. Haile v. Smith[4]. It was an indication of the intention.\nSee Hutchinson on Carriers[5], and see Benjamin on Sales[6], which contains the rest of the cases relied on.\nI think that under the Factor's Act McPherson had a right to the goods; at all events he had the bill of lading by which he had a right to receive the goods as a pledge. Story on Agency[7]; Donald v. Suckling[8].\nAt common law you could not pass the property in the goods, though you could pass it as a pledge; but under an agreement such as this Mathers had a right to the possession of the goods. Jones on Pledges[9]; Abbott on Shipping[10]; Halliday v. Holgate[11].\nHenry Q.C. in reply.\nThe relation of a factor, at common law, to his employer is that of a common agent, differing in no way from the position of any other agent. The Factor's Act does not apply to cases of past indebtedness. R. S. 4th ser., p. 63, sec. 3 A factor is but an agent to sell, and has no right to pledge. Further, even if he has a lien, he has no right to sell. The agreement excludes a right to do anything but sell. See Jones on Pledges, sec 338. The goods were not given to the plaintiff as security. Sir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The goods in question were originally the property of Haley, who shipped them from Prince Edward Island in a vessel called the \"Josephine,\" the master of which signed the bill of lading to deliver the same at the port of Pictou \"unto the freight agent, Intercolonial Railway, or to his assigns, freight payable in Halifax.\" In the margin \"180 cases marked B;\" freight \"to I. H. Mathers, Esq., Halifax.\" These goods were unquestionably sent to the agent of the Intercolonial Railway at Pictou, to be forwarded by him, by the I. C. R., to the consignee, I. H. Mathers, at Halifax; and the agent at Pictou had no other interest in the goods, or right or duty connected with them, than to forward them to their destination.\nOn the arrival of the goods at Pictou, the agent gave to the captain of the \"Josephine\" the following receipt:\u2014\nB. A. W. 2.\nINTERCOLONIAL RAILWAY,\nPICTOU LANDING STATION,\n2nd January, 1883.\nReceived from \"Josephine,\" Haley, the following goods or merchandize, which are to be transported from this station to Halitax station, and delivered as addressed, agreeably to the \"Conditions of Carriage,\" as set forth in the \"General Freight Tariff\" of this railway.\nMark\u2014B; Car, 1817; Address in full\u2014I.

It is as follows:\u2014\nDANIEL BAIN.\u2014Live at Pictou Landing; in the Intercolonial Railway employ for 16 years; was so in December, 1882, and January, 1883; was station agent at Pictou Landing; still hold that office, but have been temporarily removed to other side of Pictou harbor; remember consignment of goods came to the railway by schooner \"Josephine\" from Souris; I saw bill of lading that came with them; this is bill of lading signed by captain; I had no interest in goods. Bill marked B. A. W. No. 1. My duty in connection with these goods was to see that they were shipped and forwarded by rail to Halifax; goods were put into cars by captain of schooner; I signed shipping receipt for goods; I forwarded them to Halifax under way bill; gave two receipts to the captain and held one which I now produce\u2014(B. A. W. 2); I did this on 2nd Jan., 1883; goods came into car that day and think they arrived in schooner same day; I have form of way bill in use and have press copy of way bill given with these goods; original way bill forwarded by me to R. McDonald, station agent of Intercolonial, at Halifax. Copy of way bill marked B. A. W. No. 3 produced. So far as respects these goods it is a correct copy of original way bill; I received goods from vessel and forwarded them to Halifax.\nBain says he received a telegram from Haley in reference to these goods. Haley's telegram was for him to hold 180 cases shipped by \"Josephine.\" He says Haley's telegram was received on the 3rd of January, 1883. \"The goods had been forwarded before I received the telegram; I mean forwarded from Pictou Landing,\" therefore at a time when Bain's duty in reference to, or control over, the goods had ceased\nBut he says on receipt of the telegram he telegraphed defendant as follows:\u2014\nB. A. W. No. 5.\nPICTOU LANDING, 3rd January, 1883.\nR. McDonald, Halifax,\u2014\nPlease hold 180 cases canned goods billed to I. H. Mathers per my bill 341 to-day for instructions; answer if all right.\nD. Bain, To this defendant telegraphed in reply:\nB. A. W. No. 4.\nHalifax. 3rd January, 1883.\nD. Bain,\nAt whose instance are you holding the 180 cases canned goods, per your bill 341, for I. H. Mathers? There is a party here with endorsed bill of lading waiting to receive them. Have been sold him by Mathers; reply giving car number.\nR. McDonald.\nAnd on the 4th, the day following, Bain replies by telegram.;\nB. A. W. No. 6.\nPictou Landing, 4th January, 1883.\nR. McDonald, Halifax,\u2014\nThe 180 cases canned goods, per my bill 341, are held by order of shipper, C. J. Haley, Souris, P.E.I. Car No. 1817.\nD. Bain.\nThis is all the authority defendant appears to have for holding these goods, and Haley does not seem to have interfered in any other way, or to have intervened or taken part in this trial, or set up any right to the goods as against either Mathers or the plaintiff, or to controvert the statement of Mathers that at the time of the shipment of these goods he, Haley, was largely indebted to Mathers, or that Mathers was entitled, on the sale or other disposal of these goods, to apply the proceeds thereof in liquidation of such indebtedness.\nMathers, on the 1st of January, 1883, disposed of and transferred these goods to the plaintiff for a valuable consideration in excess of the value of the goods, and delivered to him the bill of lading transmitted by Haley to Mathers on 8th Dec, 1882, on which he endorsed the following: \"deliver to David McPherson or order. Isaac H. Mathers.\" Under these circumstances I cannot understand upon what principle Bain interfered with these goods, or upon what principle defendant, when as he himself says there was a party here (at Halifax) with endorsed bill of lading waiting to receive them, they having been, as he says, sold to such party by Mathers, did not deliver them to such purchaser in obedience to the order endorsed on the bill of lading by Mathers, the consignee at Halifax, on being tendered the freight; and how, without showing any right whatever in Haley to stop the goods, he can keep possession of them against Mathers and his assignee. It is not, in my opinion, necessary to discuss the relations and rights of Haley and Mathers, as between themselves, as to the manner of the disposal of these goods by Mathers. With this, it appears to me, the defendant has nothing whatever to do. Mathers must account to Haley for their proper disposal or full value. Nor whether, as between Mathers and the plaintiff, an absolute legal title passed to the plaintiff. It is sufficient, I think, to say that as against the defendant, whose position, on the evidence, is simply that of a wrongdoer, the plaintiff, if he had not such a strict legal title, had such an equitable interest in the goods, and right to the possession thereof, as would prevent the present defendant from legally withholding them from him. The appeal, therefore, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, as delivered by Mr. Justice Thompson, was right, and should be affirmed.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an action of replevin brought by the respondent to obtain the possession of one hundred and eighty cases of canned beef alleged to be of the value of nine hundred dollars.\nThe defendant, when the action was brought, was station master of the Intercolonial Railway at Halifax, and as such had the goods in question in his keeping. While the goods were en route from Pictou the respondent obtained an order from Mathers to whom the shipper Haley had written apprising him of the shipment, for the delivery of them, and demanded them, but the appellant refused, at the instance of the shipper, to deliver them to him.\nThe defendant pleaded as follows to the action:\u2014\n1. The said defendant by J. Norman Ritchie, his attorney, for a first plea as to plaintiff's writ or declaration, says, that he did not unjustly detain said goods as alleged.\n2. And for a second plea as to said writ or declaration defendant says, that the said goods were not, nor were any of them, the plaintiff's, as alleged.\n3. And for a third plea as to said writ or declaration, defendant says, that the said goods were not, nor were any of them, the goods of the plaintiff, but were the goods of one Charles J. Haley, by whose authority he detained the same.\n4. And for a fourth plea as to said writ or declaration, defendant says, that the said goods were the property of one Charles J. Haley, and were delivered by his authority to the station master or agent for the Intercolonial Railway at Pictou, to be carried by said railway to Halifax. That the said goods were so carried to Halifax and came into possession of the defendant, who was and is the agent or station master of said railway at Halifax, and were received by him in that capacity, and that while said goods were so in his custody as such station master as aforesaid the said Charles J. Haley, the owner thereof, claimed the same, and forbid the defendant from delivering them to any other person, and said goods were and are lawfully detained by the authority and directions of the said Charles J. Haley, the owner thereof.\n5. And for a fifth plea as to said writ or declaration, defendant says that the said goods were the property of one Charles J. Haley, and were delivered by him to be carried to Halifax and delivered to one Isaac H. Mathers, who was the agent of the said Charles J. Haley for the sale thereof, and then representing himself to be a person of credit in trade and fit to be trusted with the said goods for sale, and who agreed to accept a bill of exchange or draft for one thousand dollars drawn on him by the said Charles J. Haley on account of the proceeds which might be realized by him from the sale of said goods. And the said Charles J. Haley, then believing the said Isaac H. Mathers to be solvent, and a person fit to be trusted with the said goods for sale on the terms above mentioned, delivered the said goods to be carried as hereinbefore mentioned; that after the delivery of the said goods, and before they arrived in Halifax or come into the custody of defendant, the said Isaac H. Mathers became insolvent and refused to accept said bill of exchange, and attempted to make an assignment of said goods to the plaintiff, who accepted the same in fraud of the said Charles J. Haley without giving any legal or valid consideration therefor; the said plaintiff then well knowing the premises, and that the said Isaac H. Mathers was insolvent and unable to meet his liabilities. That the said defendant is and was the station master and agent for the Intercolonial Railway at Halifax, and the said goods afterwards came into his custody as such, and after the said bill had been refused acceptance and protested, and after the said Isaac H. Mathers had become insolvent and unable to pay the same, and before the delivery of the said goods to the said Isaac H. Mathers or to the plaintiff, the said Charles J Haley gave notice to defendant not to deliver the said good to the said Isaac H. Mathers or his assigns, and then stopped the same in transitu and required them to be delivered to him, and defendant, at the request of the said Charles J. Haley stopped the same, and refused to deliver said goods to plaintiff, the same being then stopped in transitu by said Charles J. Haley, as he the said defendant lawfully might.\nThe respondent's ownership of the goods and his right to the possession of them being denied, strictly legal issues are raised and under them the action was tried. The defendant was lawfully in possession of the goods under Haley, the owner and shipper.\nTo recover, therefore, it was necessary to show that Haley was divested of his property in them and of the right to retain possession of them, and that such property and right of possession in them had been legally transferred to the respondent. That has been attempted to be shown by a document purporting to be a copy of a bill of lading sent by Haley to Mathers. The bill of lading executed by the master of a schooner who carried the goods from Souris, in Prince Edward Island, where they were put up by Haley, required the master to deliver them at Pictou to the freight agent of the Intercolonial Railway or to his assigns\u2014the goods being stated as being marked and numbered as in the margin. The entries on the margin are: \"180 cases marked (B)\u2014freight\u2014To I. H. Mathers, Halifax, N.S.\" On the copy of the bill of lading Mathers wrote and signed the endorsement: \"Deliver to David McPherson\" (the respondent) \"or order. Isaac H. Mathers,\" and delivered the copy of the bill of lading so endorsed to the respondent. That was done, as appears by the evidence, before the goods arrived at Halifax, and it is relied on as evidence of a transfer of the property in the goods by Mathers to the respondent. I have no doubt when Haley shipped the goods he intended them to be delivered to Mathers as his agent to sell them on his account, but by doing so conveyed no property in them. Mathers was not intended to become the owner of the goods, but by the authority of Haley he could, by a sale in a legal way have, as authorized by the latter, transferred the property in the goods to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser from him within his authority as agent of Haley, but in no other way could he transfer the property in them. If for the purpose of such sale Mathers had got the possession of the goods he would still be but a special bailee of Haley, but only for the sale of them. His possession would be good against all others but Haley would still be the owner, subject to any claim of Mathers' for storage, commission, &c. If then Mathers transferred the possession of the goods or parted with them on any terms outside of his authority both he and his transferree would be liable to Haley for a wrongful conversion. Mathers' authority then was to sell the goods to a real and bon\u00e2 fide purchaser and account to Haley for the proceeds. Mathers so states it. He however did not so sell, but by the evidence is shown to have given that order for the delivery before mentioned to the respondent to enable him to obtain the possession of the goods to be held by him as security to indemnify him against loss in case certain bills of exchange then current drawn by Mathers and endorsed and negotiated by the respondent should be unpaid and unproductive. Such a transfer, if what was done amounted to a transfer, conveyed the property in the goods to the respondent. They still were the goods of Haley, and the other parties, if the goods were delivered to the respondent, would in law have been wrongdoers. By the compact between Haley and Mathers the former gave the latter no authority to transfer his goods for the payment of, or security for, the debts or liabilities of the latter and without such authority Haley would not be bound. The goods were not and never had been in Mathers' possession and until they came to his possession by the acts and consent of Haley he could not in any way deal with them. If the goods had been destroyed or injured the loss would have been Haley's. A good deal was said on the argument, and in the judgment of the court below, that was applicable to cases of transfer and delivery to carriers, but the propositions were applicable only to cases between absolute vendors and purchasers, and wholly inapplicable to the position of parties here. If a man sells goods he intends to part with the property in them, and after delivery to a common carrier the property in them vests in the consignee as purchaser, but, if sold on credit, subject to the seller's right of stoppage in transitu. The law regulating such a stoppage is wholly inapplicable here, for as the obtaining of possession of goods sold would bar that right the purchaser's title to the goods would be complete. In a case like this such possession would not divest the shipper and owner, and he would remain owner until the goods were sold by his authority. As that was not done in this case Haley remained the legal owner and the respondent got no property in them, and the possession of the railway officials was that of Haley. If, however, Mathers became, as I have shown he did not, the transferee of the property in the goods, where is there evidence of a transfer by him to the respondent of the property in them? If the endorsement on the copy of the bill of lading had been an endorsement of a bill of lading to which Mathers was a party, as consignee, by which the title appeared to be in him, it would, in ordinary circumstances, operate as an assignment, but the endorsement of the request to deliver the goods to the respondent, written as it was, cannot operate as an assignment, and it amounts to nothing more than a request to deliver to the respondent, it might be as the agent or servant of Mathers. It is not at all events any transfer of the property. A regular bill of lading is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of property in the consignee, and its assignment is evidence also of property in his assignee, but the words in question endorsed on a bill of lading in favor of another party is of no more value than if written on a blank piece of paper, unless, indeed, to identify the goods to be delivered. It, however, appears that Mathers gave the order for the delivery of the goods to the respondent to receive and retain them as security as I before stated. No delivery of possession was or could be made because Mathers had no possession No delivery, no present consideration given or received. No debt then due by Mathers to the respondent. No possession obtained by the latter. Was not the whole transaction void? It was only in words amounting to this, that, expecting that the respondent would get possession he, as far as Mathers was concerned, was to retain the goods, if he got them as security. Suppose after the respondent's failure to get delivery, Mathers, being more successful, had succeeded in getting them, what property had the respondent in them by what took place to recover them, or the value of them, by an action of replevin or otherwise, from Mathers. There was not, I maintain, any transfer of property legal or equitable. There was no delivery or consideration at the time nor was there any note or memorandum in writing except the request to deliver, and the whole transaction so far as concerns the assign ment of the goods was void by the statute of frauds and both parties as to it were afterwards as if such had never taken place.\nThe learned judge who tried the case reports:\u2014\nMy judgment was for plaintiff; my view being that Mathers had the equitable right to the goods, that he had made, at least, an equitable transfer of that right to the plaintiff and that the equitable right of the plaintiff was sufficient to entitle him to recover since the Judicature Act. I cited 1 Q. B. D. 709 and L. R. 5 P. C. 253.\nIf the transaction as an assignment or sale of property was void I am at a loss to know how it could be enforced in equity or by law.\nThe case, of Holroyd v. Marshall[12]; and the judgment of this court in Clark v. Scottish Imperial Insurance Company[13]; have been referred to, but I fail to recognize anything in them applicable to this case. The question in the latter case was as to the insurable interest in a vessel in course of building. In that case the plaintiff had furnished supplies to the party who built the vessel under the express agreement that he should have a lien on her to the amount of his advances. He insured in an amount sufficient to cover his advances and she was burnt before being finished. On the ground that an equitable lien was sufficient to give an insurable interest this court decided in the plaintiff's favor. That, however, is a very different position from that of Mathers in respect of the preserved or canned beef in reference to which no bargain was made that Mathers was to have any lien or even any right to sell on account of Haley unless specially authorized. It appears from the evidence that about four or five years previous to the shipment of the goods in question, Mathers, who resided at Halifax, entered into an agreement with Haley to advance supplies and money to him to enable him to carry on, at Souris, the business of packing lobsters It was agreed, Mathers says in his evidence, that Haley was to give him all the goods (that is the lobsters) he packed to recoup him; he added: \"such goods I was to sell on commission for him.\" \"That was the agreement at the start and was acted on for six years.\"\nAt the end of 1882 Mathers says Haley owed him $9,000, but there is no evidence to show that any of it was advances made on account of the packing or preserving of beef, nor is it pretended on the part of Mathers that as to canned beef there was any agreement that Mathers was to have the sale of it. Mathers made advances to Haley under the agreement as to the packing of lobsters but for nothing else. If then Haley undertook other business and in the course of such business put up pickled fish or purchased grain, hay, vegetables, or other articles, could it be contended that even if Mathers had a lien on canned lobsters the lien could be decreed either by law or equity to extend to those other articles?\nMathers was examined on the trial and did not pretend that he had any special agreement with Haley as to the canned beef. He, on the contrary, pretty clearly shows the contrary. He says:\nI do not know when Haley's transactions in canned beef with me commenced, but I believe I sold canned beef for him before '82, The agreement between us related to lobsters, it was not then contemplated that he should can meats. I charged no commission in my books on beef.\nFrom this evidence the conclusion is irresistible that Haley was under no agreement or promise of any kind to give Mathers the sale of canned beef. Mathers does not even say that he so understood. In fact he plainly and clearly discriminates as regards the canned lobsters and the canned beef. There does not appear to have been any previous transaction between them as to canned beef. Mathers says he thinks he sold some for Haley before '82 but on referring to his books he finds no commission charged for selling beef. If he had sold any his books would certainly show it. Where then arises the lien on or any obligation on the part of Haley to employ Mathers to sell the canned beef for him? Suppose in addition to the canned beef Haley had canned indian corn, tomatoes, berries and fruits of different kinds could, it be contended that Mathers' lien on lobsters, made four years before, extended to each and all of the others? If so there must be something cabalistic in the term \"canned\" and if beef is included why not the others and if canned beef why not pickled beef put up in barrels or tierces We are considering alone the question of a lien by Mathers on the identical article of canned beef and to decide in favor of the respondent he must show that lien by evidence. I have fully considered the evidence on the trial and find it impossible to detect any. The issue was on the respondent and in my opinion he most signally failed to prove it.\nIt has been contended that, as Haley was indebted to Mathers for advances made under the original agreement as to the canned lobsters, he had an equitable claim to the possession of the canned beef. As I before stated no advance was made specially for the canned beef and what better does the fact of the indebtedness of Haley to Mathers make the plaintiff's claim. It was assumed by the learned judge that Mathers' rights as to the corned beef were the same as to the canned lobsters, but I cannot find any evidence to sustain it. If such assumptions are permitted to prevail then the old and recognized rule that parties rights must be adjudged according to their allegations and proofs would be improperly violated and the rights of parties decided upon and affected injuriously. The assumption however in this case, is, in my opinion, not only without any proof to sustain it, but actually in opposition to the evidence on the trial of the principal witness for the respondent.\nIt is not always that an equitable lien can be set up, and an equitable lien does not always give the party holding it the right of possession, and a legal binding conveyance and transfer of personal property may be made so as to oust the equitable lien. The decision lately of this court in McAllister v. Forsyth[14], supported by and founded on English decisions, establishes that position. If Mathers had even an equitable lien on the goods in question, and Haley did not deliver them as agreed upon, what right would he have by means of an action of replevin to obtain the possession, and if Haley sold and delivered to another for a valuable consideration the property would pass by such sale, but if the property remained in the possession of Haley he might be required to deliver it under the terms of his agreement or Mathers might sustain an action for damages for the loss he sustained by not having the sale of the goods as agreed upon, but not including any amount due by Haley for money or supplies advanced to him. Such should be recovered under the common counts in assumpsit. The aid of equity is invoked to enforce specific performance of contracts but it is no part of its jurisdiction to make them for parties. As there was not shown to have been any equitable lien on the goods in question an equity court would, I think, go beyond its proper functions to assume one, and I am at a loss to conceive upon what principle an equitable lien could be decreed by a court of equity to be a legal title so as to enable the holder of it to recover the possession in replevin, and I am equally at a loss to know how the application of the Judicature Act to the case can affect the legal rights of the parties in this suit.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I concur with the learned judge before whom this case was tried without a jury that the course of dealing between Haley and Mathers with respect to canned beef was conducted on the same understanding and agreement as had governed their dealings with respect to canned lobsters; and that the proper inference to be drawn from the manner in which the particular quantity of beef in question was forwarded by Haley to Mathers and from the circumstance of Haley having transmitted to Mathers by post a duplicate of the bill of lading is that Mathers had an interest in the beef and authority to dispose thereof to pay himself a portion of the debt of about $9,000 due to him by Haley. When the goods came into the possession of McDonald, as the servant of the Intercolonial Railway Company, at Halifax, he, as the servant of the company, held them for and on behalf of Mathers subject only to the payment of the freight charges, and when he refused to deliver up the goods to the plaintiff upon Mathers' order he committed a tort of which the plaintiff could sustain an action for the wrongful detention. The question that was raised and tried was as to Mathers having a right to have the goods delivered to him or to his order and not a question as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff's title to the property as between him and Mathers, Haley having already received full value for the goods and having sent forward the goods to Mathers upon a contract enabling him to pay himself out of the proceeds of the goods a portion of the debt due by Haley to him, and having forwarded to Mathers the bill of lading to enable him to receive the goods in fulfilment of such contract, could not, I think, stop the delivery of the goods after their arrival at the place of delivery to Mathers, or justify the carriers and their servant in detaining them.\nThe appeal therefore, in my opinion, must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: J.

Stats of New Brunswick relating to rates and taxes, provides that \"real estate, where the assessors cannot obtain the names of any of the owners, shall be rated in the name of the occupier or person having ostensible control, but under such description as to persons and property * * * as shall be sufficient to indicate the property assessed, and the character in which the person is assessed.\"\nT. G., owner of real estate in Westmoreland County, N.B., died leaving a widow who administered to his estate and resided on the property. The property was assessed for several years in the name of the estate of T. G., and in 1878 it was assessed in the name of \"Widow G.\"\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the last named assessment was illegal, as not comprising such description of persons and property as would be sufficient to indicate the property assessed, and the character in which the person was assessed.\nWhere a warrant for the collection of a single sum for rates for several years, included the amount of an assessment which did not appear to be either against the owner or the occupier of the property.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the inclusion of such assessment would vitiate the warrant. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a non-suit to be entered.\nThe following facts appear from the printed case filed on the appeal to this court:\u2014\nThis is an action of ejectment tried at the Circuit Court for the county of Westmoreland in July, 1883.\nThe lessors of the plaintiff claim the land as heirs of Thomas Gamble; the defendant Johanna Flanagan claims it under a deed to her from the sheriff of the county as purchaser at a sale under a warrant issued by the chairman of the town council of the town of Moncton, commanding the sheriff to seize and sell the real estate named in said warrant (being the locus in quo) or so much thereof as in his judgment may be sufficient to pay the sum of $45.72 and 17 cents for advertising, together with all his charges and expenses, \"the said sum of $45.72 being taxes assessed by town of Moncton for the years 1875, 1876, 1877 and 1878, against the estate of Thomas Gamble, deceased, in respect of such real estate.\"\nThe sheriff's deed to the female defendant bears date 4th March, 1880.\nIn 1868, Thomas Gamble conveyed his real estate, of which the locus in quo was a part, to three trustees for benefit of his creditors, which deed was duly registered in July, 1868. These trustees, on the 3rd November, 1873, reconveyed the property to Gamble by deed, but the deed was not acknowledged or registered until the 3rd October, 1881.\nGamble died 29th December, 1875, after the assessment for 1875 had been made.\nThe lands were assessed in '75, '76, '77, in no other way than as \"the estate of Thomas Gamble,\" and in 1878 than as \"Widow Gamble.\"\nGamble was in possession and actual occupation of the land from the year 1859 to the time of his death in December, 1875, and his widow and family occupied it until the sale by the sheriff, and from his death to the time of the sheriffs' sale it was undivided.\nBefore the sheriff's sale the plaintiffs' lessors knew in fact that such sale was to be made and they did not forbid it or protest against it, but requested one Martin Dowling to attend at the sale and bid the property in; but there was no evidence that Dowling did attend the sale or bid at it at all.\nThey did not appeal to the town council of the town of Moncton from any of the assessments at any time.\nThe plaintiffs obtained a verdict at the trial, the learned judge who presided refusing to non suit, holding that the sheriff's sale was illegal in consequence of the assessment on the property being defective, and that the title was in the lessors of the plaintiffs as heirs of Thomas Gamble. A motion was made before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to have this verdict set aside, and a non-suit entered, which motion was dismissed. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBorden for the appellants.\nThe assessments were properly made, and the sale was lawful. The assessors had jurisdiction to make the assessments, and their proceedings must stand until quashed. See 38 Vic. ch. 40 (Moncton Incorporation Act) and Cons. Stats. ch 100 sec. 16.\nThe action of the chairman of the town council can only be attacked by proceeding against the assessment itself.\nThe assessment was made against the estate of Thomas Gamble. It was so entered on the roll, and was made before the Incorporation Act came into force.\nThe respondents have been guilty of negligence in not making their claim known and moving to have the assessments quashed. They are estopped as well by their own acts as by the judgment of the assessors.\nR. Barry Smith for the respondents.\nI contend that the assessments were all bad, because made when Gamble was dead, and the provisions of ch. 100 Cons. Stats, in regard to assessments on estates of deceased persons not being complied with. But, at all events, the assessment for 1878 is invalid and that would vitiate the warrant. The assessment for 1878 is against \"Widow Gamble.\" That certainly does not show on its face the property assessed and the character of the person. Cons. Stats. ch. 100 sec. 16. There is nothing in the term \"widow\" to show any particular relation to the property.\nThen, if this assessment is bad the whole warrant is bad, and the sale under it void. There is no statutory provision authorizing a sale where some of the assessments are good and the others bad.\nMy learned friend says we are estopped. I submit that we cannot be estopped by silence.\nBorden in reply.\nAs to the assessment of 1878, I submit the widow Gamble was in possession of the property, and administratrix of the estate of the owner, which is sufficient. Where the law has been specifically carried out the technicalities should not be considered.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.

BARRY SMITH,\nAttorney for plaintiffs and lessors.\nThe defendants admit,\u2014\nThat the property now in question is that described in the trust deed to Breau, Palmer and Tait as the third lot.\nThat it was assessed in 1875, 1876, 1877 in no other way than as the \"estate of Thomas Gamble\" and in 1878 than as \"Widow Gamble.\"\nThat the lessors of the plaintiff are the heirs of Thomas Gamble referred to in deed from Breau, Palmer and Tait, 3rd October, 1881.\nThat the lot in question was held by Thomas Gamble in actual possession since 1859 till the trust deed.\nThat Gamble died in December, 1875, and that his widow administered.\nThat trustees lived at the time in Dorchester, Westmoreland Co.\n(Signed,) BORDEN & ATKINSON,\nDefendant's attorneys.\nBoth parties agree that all deeds may be proved by production of registry books containing them, or copies of them, without objection on that ground.\nThe plaintiffs were, consequently, entitled to recover unless the defendant could show that their claim to the land had been extinguished. This they attempted to do by producing a deed from the sheriff of Westmoreland to Johanna Flangan, dated the 4th of March, 1880, of the locus in quo, made in pursuance of a sale under a warrant authorizing him to sell the said lands for nonpayment of rates in the town of Moncton.\nThe plaintiff objected at the trial:\nFirst\u2014That the assessment was bad because not assessed upon the trustees, Palmer, Breau and Tait.\nSecondly\u2014That the town had no power to sell land, at all events, not to sell for taxes in arrears.\nThirdly\u2014That if they had power to sell there were no arrears, consequently, no power to sell.\nFourthly\u2014That under the act of 1878 ch. 82, Moncton Assessment Act, secs. 2, 3 and 4, and under the Incorporation Act of Moncton, the real estate of defaulting ratepayers cannot in any case be sold for taxes until the personal property is exhausted. The defendant contended that the trustees, Palmer, Breau and Tait, had no power to assign or re-convey to the lessors of the plaintiff, and that the lessors are estopped on the ground of acquiescence.\nThe plaintiffs made out their prim\u00e2 facie case, and, in my opinion, the purchasers under the sheriff's deed have no locus standi to attack the trust deed or the re-conveyance. It is contended by the plaintiffs that the assessments for 1875 and 1878 are bad. It is admitted that the property was assessed for 1875, 1876 and 1877, in no other way than as the \"estate of Thomas Gamble\"; and in 1878 as \"Widow Gamble.\" It is contended that if the assessors could not obtain the names of any of the owners, but sought to rate in the name of the occupier or person having the ostensible control, then there was \"no such description as to persons and property as would be sufficient to indicate the property assessed and the character in which the person was assessed.\"\nI agree with Judge King that a description of person and property sufficient to indicate the property assessed, and the character in which the person was assessed, is essential to make an assessment against a mere occupier a binding assessment upon the estate of the real owner, and that the same is the case where an undivided estate is assessed in the name of one of the owners; therefore I agree with the learned judge that this last assessment, as it appears on the assessment list, was bad in form and substance, and was not a binding assessment against the estate of Thomas Gamble,\nI also agree with the learned judge, that where a warrant is for the collection of a single sum for rates for several years, the inclusion in it of the amount of an assessment which does not appear to be either against the owner or the occupier of his property vitiates the warrant, and therefore the inclusion of the assessment of 1878, whatever may be said of the assessment of 1875, would vitiate the warrant in this case.\nThe owners, in this case, were not assessed; the estate of Thomas Gamble was not assessed; \"the widow Gamble\" was assessed but without any specification of the property on which she was assessed, or any indication of the capacity or character, whether as owner or or mere occupier, in which she was assessed. The owner of property cannot be bound by an assessment in which neither he nor his land is named; and there is, consequently, nothing to show that his land has been assessed, or that another has been assessed in respect of his land or liable to be assessed for it. Without such information appearing on the assessment roll, how is it possible that the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of chapter 82 of the acts of 1878 can be complied with? What then does all that was done in this case amount to but that there was no valid or binding assessment on this property? If so, how can the acts of the collector and chairman validate and make good an assessment that never existed, either against the owners of the property or against the property itself; and how could they, by an ex parte proceeding, sell so much of the real estate of such person, namely, the person assessed on real estate whether such person is owner or occupier thereof, for an assessment which never had a legal existence? To give the collector and chairman any authority or jurisdiction in the matter there must be, in my opinion, a legal assessment capable of being enforced, which there was not in this case for the year 1878; there being, in fact, no assessment, there could be no collection; therefore, as regards the assessment of 1878, the proceedings of the collector and chairman were simply coram non judice. There being no assessment to authorize a sale of any interest of the present lessors, the combined action of the collector and chairman could not legalize and give effect to a sale unauthorized by law. There was no assessment, in point of fact, as set out in the warrant, for the year 1878. In the warrant the taxes for 1878 were stated to be against the estate of Thomas Gamble deceased. There was no such assessment; the actual assessment in 1878 was against \"Widow Gamble,\" without reference to Thomas Gamble or his heirs or estate.\nAs to the estoppel claimed I do not think the mere fact of the lessors knowing of the sale, and not forbidding, or protesting against it, would estop them from contesting its validity, nor the mere fact of the plaintiff's requesting Dowling to attend the sale and bid the property in. It does not, however, appear, Judge King says, that Dowling bid, nor that defendants knew that he was present, or was present as agent for the lessors of the plaintiff, nor indeed, that Dowling was present at all; nor does it appear that the lessors of the plaintiff knew, at the time of the sale, of the illegality of the warrant or of the facts upon which that illegality is now sought to be maintained, nor that the defendant was at all influenced by what the lessors of the plaintiff did or omitted. So far as the defendant is concerned there is no representation made to her at all, and certainly none made with the intent that it should be acted upon by her. The plaintiffs did not, by words or conduct, wilfully cause defendant to believe in a certain state of things, and thereby induce her to act on that belief or to alter her previous position, and could not have meant their representations or acts to be acted on, and they could not have been acted on. In other words, the defendants were never deceived, or induced to alter their position by any statement or act of the plaintiffs. All the admission amounts to is, that plaintiffs knew of the sale and did not forbid it or protest against it. This, in my opinion, they were not bound to do; there was no duty to speak. Then the admission says they requested one Martin Dowling to attend at the sale and bid it in. I have already stated what Judge King says on this point, and Judge Fraser says, \"it does not appear that the female defendant, when she purchased, was aware that Dowling was present acting for the lessors, nor was the knowledge of the lessors that a sale was about to take place, such conduct on their part as could have influenced the purchaser.\"\nTherefore, in this case, the two great ingredients mentioned in Freeman v. Cook[1], referred to in Howard v. Hudson[2] are wanting, namely, that the plaintiff intended that the defendant should act on the faith of his act or representation, nor that the defendant did so act, nor does it come within any of the following cases.\nIn the Duchess of Kingston's Case[3] the principle is thus laid down:\nAnd in Cairncross v. Lorimer[4], Lord Campbell (chancellor) stated the general rules as to estoppels of this class, when the legality of the act assented to is in question, in the following words:\nThe doctrine is found, I believe, in the laws of all civilized Dations, that if a man, either by words or by conduct, has intimated that he consents to an act which has been done, and that he will offer no opposition to it, although it could not have been lawfully done without his consent, and he thereby induces others to do that from which they might otherwise have abstained, he cannot question the legality of the act he has so sanctioned, to the prejudices of those who have so given faith to his words, or to the fair inference to be drawn from his conduct.\nAnd again[5]:\nLastly in Carr v. London and North Western Railway Co.[6], the following are laid down by Brett L. J. (delivering the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas) as \"recognized propositions of an estoppel in pais. One such proposition,\" says his lordship, \"is, if a man by his words or conduct wilfully endeavors to cause another to believe in a certain state of things which the first knows to be false, and if the second believes in such a state of things and acts upon his belief, he who knowingly made the false statement is estopped from averring afterwards that such a state of things did not in fact exist.\"\nAnother recognized proposition seems to be, that if a man, either in express terms or by conduct, makes a representation to another of the existence of a certain state of facts which he intends to be acted upon in a certain way, and it be acted upon in that way, in the belief of the existence of such a state of facts to the damage of him who so believes and acts, the first is estopped from denying the existence of such a state of facts.\nAnd another proposition is, that if a man, whatever his real meaning may be, so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take his conduct to mean a certain representation of facts, and that it was a true representation, and that the latter was intended to act upon it in a particular way, and he with such belief does act in that way to his damage, the first is estopped from denying that the facts were as represented.\nThere is yet another proposition as to estoppel. If in the transaction itself which is in dispute one has lead another into the belief of a certain state of facts by conduct of culpable negligence, calculated to have that result, and such culpable negligence has been the proximate cause of leading, and has led, the other to act by mistake upon such belief to his prejudice, the second cannot be heard afterwards as against the first to show that the state of facts referred to did not exist.\nTo the above may be added the rule enunciated by James L.J. in ex parte Adamson, In re Collie[7].\nNobody, says his lordship, ought to be estopped from averring the truth or asserting a just demand, unless by his acts or words, or neglect his now averring the truth or asserting the demand would work some wrong to some other person who has been induced to do some thing, or to abstain from doing something by reason of what he had said or done, or omitted to say or do.\nClarke & Chapman v. Hart[8].\nLord Chelmsford:\u2014\nIn the case of Freeman v. Cooke, Mr. Baron Parke, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Exchequer, qualified that proposition by saying: \"In most cases the doctrine in Pickard v. Sears[9] is not to be applied, unless the representation is such as to amount to the contract or license of the party making it.\" So that I apprehend, where there is a vested right or interest in any party, the principle of law as now firmly established is, that he cannot waive or abandon that right, except by acts which are equivalent to an agreement or to a license.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the sale was illegal and void, and that there was no estoppel. My judgment is based on the grounds stated by Mr. Justice King in the court below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I entirely concur in the views expressed that the sale was totally illegal. It was a sale under warrant for taxes assessed on an estate, and the whole sale was void. There is no evidence of concurrence in the sale, for the alleged agent did not bid and it does not clearly appear that he was even present.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Borden & Atkinson.\nSolicitor for respondents: R.

A loss having occurred, the damage was adjusted by the inspector of the company, and neither he, nor the agent, made any objection to the loss on the ground of non-compliance with the above condition.\nIn a suit to recover the amount of the policy the company pleaded breach of the condition, in reply to which the plaintiff set up a waiver of the condition and contended that by the act of the agent and inspector the company were estopped from setting it up.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the insured not having complied with the condition the policy ceased and became of no effect on the subsequent insurance being effected and that neither the agent nor the inspector had power to waive a compliance with its terms.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia refusing to set aside a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiff, Gibson, insured his stock in the Western Assurance Company and assigned the policy to the firm of Doull & Miller, to whom he was indebted. He subsequently effected an insurance of $4,000 on the same stock in the British American Insurance Company and notified the agent of the Western of his having done so, but such further insurance was not indorsed on his policy in the Western, nor in any way acknowledged in writing by the company. A loss having occurred, one Corey, the official adjuster or inspector of the Western, adjusted the damage, and a certain amount of delay took place owing to some of Gibson's books having been burnt or mislaid. Gibson had several interviews with the agent and the inspector, both of whom knew of the insurance in the British American, but at no time was payment of the loss objected to on that ground; the agent, on one occasion, telling him that the company would pay, and that the delay was occasioned by another company with whom Gibson had insured previous to insuring in the Western. The company did not pay and Doull & Miller sued, and when the case was brought down to trial obtained leave to amend by adding Gibson as a plaintiff. The company pleaded non-compliance with the condition in the policy requiring notice of subsequent insurance to be given to the company and indorsed on the policy or otherwise acknowledged in writing. In answer to that it was contended that the agent, or inspector, or both, had waived such condition. The plaintiffs obtained a verdict, which was sustained by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHenry Q.C. and Graham Q.C. for the appellants.\nGreer had no authority to waive any of the conditions of the policy. There was no doubt as to the subsequent insurance. The only proof of notice was that the same person was agent for both companies. They say that Greer told Doull that there was no objection to the claim, and that the mere fact that Greer was the agent was sufficient.\nWe take the point first that Greer had no authority to waive any condition. He only had special authority and had no right to settle losses. It is contended that the renewal was an acknowledgment of the subsequent insurance, but I take it that it makes no difference if it was renewed twenty times if it was not brought home to the company.\nBillington v. Provincial Ins. Co.[1]; Scott v. McGrath[2].\nGreer had no authority to settle this loss, and therefore the waiver amounts to nothing. Where a contract provides that notice shall be given to an agent, it is not met by showing mere knowledge in the agent. David v. Hartford Ins. Co.[3]; Ayres v. Hartford Ins. Co.[4]; Bush v. Westchester Ins. Co.[5]; Acey v. Fernie[6]; were cited on the point as to authority of agent.\nEven if Greer had authority to waive the condition, inasmuch as this matter called waiver operates as an estoppel, company could not be bound by it because the time had already expired.\nAnd see also Lohnes v. Ins. Co. of North America[7], which refers to those other decisions. The Ontario decisions are to the same effect. Hendrickson v. The Queen Ins. Co.[8]; Walsh v. Hartford Ins. Co.[9].\nSedgwick Q.C. for respondents.\nGreer was the general agent of the company. The policy provides that proofs of loss shall be given to the agent. This is a condition which may or may not be taken advantage of by the company. I submit that Corey had authority to waive proofs of loss. When the policy was renewed the other insurance had been effected whereby the policy was void, therefore the premium should have been returned.\nSee Mayor on Insurance, sec. 500, citing a case from the Supreme Court of Illinois Etna Ins. Co. v. Maguire[10].\nAs to the appointment of adjuster, see a case from Indiana, Etna Ins. Co. v. Tryer[11] decided in 1883. May on Insurance, secs. 498, 501, 502[12].\nBoth Corey and Greer extended the time for putting in proofs of loss. That is a matter for the jury. As the point regarding proofs of loss was not taken at the trial, I contend that silence is an admission that they were properly put in. Cites May, secs. 464, 468, 469, 473 and sec. 142[13]. As to agency Wood on Insurance[14].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The policy in this case was issued 22nd April, 1882, and contained this clause:\nThis policy is made and accepted in reference to the conditions herein contained and hereto annexed, which are hereby declared to be part of this contract, and to be used and resorted to in order to explain the rights and obligations of the parties hereto, in all cases not herein or otherwise specially provided for.\nAnd this condition:\nVI.\u2014Notices of all previous assurances upon property assured by this company shall be given to them, and endorsed on this policy, or otherwise acknowledged by this company in writing, at or before the time of their making assurance thereon, otherwise the policy subscribed by this company shall cease and be of no effect. And in case of subsequent assurance on any interest in property assured by this company (whether the interest assured be the same as that assured by this company or not), notice thereof must also be given in writing at once, and such subsequent assurance endorsed on the policy granted by this company, or otherwise acknowledged in writing; in default whereof, such policy shall thenceforth cease and be of no effect. And in all cases of further assurance this company shall be liable only for such ratable proportion of the loss or damage happening to the object assured as the amount assured by this company shall bear to the whole amount assured thereon, without reference to the dates of the different policies; and any general policy on different properties to be treated as a specific policy on each property for the whole amount thereby assured.\nOn the 28th of May, 1883, a further insurance of $4,000 in the British American Insurance Company was put on the property by Gibson in addition to the amount insured by the policy in suit, and which was admitted to be in force.\nThis subsequent insurance was not at once notified to the company in writing, nor was it endorsed on the policy in suit granted by the company or otherwise acknowledged in writing, in default whereof the policy thenceforth ceased and became of no effect.\nThe respondents contend that the appellants waived this condition, and are stopped from setting it up. It is not, and cannot be, contended that the company, with knowledge of this further insurance waived the condition in respect to it, for previous to the loss it does not appear to have been called to their notice; in fact, the head office had neither notice verbal or written, nor actual cognizance of such further insurance. But it is contended that the condition was waived by their agent, or inspector, or both, neither of whom, however, in my opinion, had any authority to dispense with the performance of this condition, if they really attempted or intended to do so, which is more than doubtful.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The policy sued upon contains a reference to the conditions in the following terms:\nThis policy is made and accepted in reference to the conditions herein contained and hereto annexed, which are hereby declared to be part of this contract, and to be used and resorted to, in order to explain the rights and obligations of the parties hereto in all cases not herein or otherwise specially provided for.\nThe sixth condition annexed to the policy is as follows:\nVI.\u2014Notices of all previous assurances upon property assured by this company shall be given to them, and endorsed on this policy, or otherwise acknowledged by this company in writing, at or before the time of their making assurance thereon, otherwise the policy subscribed by this company shall cease and be of no effect. And in case of subsequent assurance on any interest in property assured by this company (whether the interest assured be the same as that assured by this company or not), notice thereof must also be given in writing at once, and such subsequent assurance endorsed on the policy granted by this company, or otherwise acknowledged in writing; in default whereof, such policy shall thenceforth cease and be of no effect. And in all cases of further assurance this company shall be liable only for such ratable proportion of the loss or damage happening to the object assured as the amount assured by this company shall bear to the whole amount assured thereon, without reference to the dates of the different policies; and any general policy on different properties to be treated as a specific policy on each property for the whole amount thereby assured.\nIt is alleged in the declaration that, except as hereinafter mentioned, all conditions were fulfilled, and all things happened, and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiffs to maintain this action.\nFurther, the declaration contains the following averment with reference to the 6th condition:\nAnd as to the sixth condition contained in said policy, whereby it was provided that in case of subsequent assurance on any interest in property assured by defendant company notice thereof must be given in writing at once and such subsequent assurance endorsed on the policy granted by the company or otherwise acknowledged in writing, plaintiffs say that shortly after subsequent assurance was effected on said property, and before said loss, notice thereof was given verbally and in writing to the agent of defendant company, who accepted the same as a sufficient compliance with said condition on the part of the plaintiffs, it being the duty of the defendant company or its agent to endorse such subsequent assurance on the policy or otherwise to acknowledge it in writing, and which said company or its agent neglected to do.\nThe fifth plea is as follows:\n5. And for a fifth plea to said amended declaration defendants say that no notice of any subsequent insurance was given their agent, nor was such notice accepted as sufficient compliance with said sixth condition as alleged, nor was it the duty of defendants to endorse such subsequent insurance on said policy, or otherwise to acknowledge it in writing, nor did defendants or their agent neglect so to do as alleged.\nTo this fifth plea the plaintiffs replied taking issue, and also as follows:\u2014\n2. As to 5th plea, that all subsequent insurances were known to defendants, and defendants accepted such knowledge as a sufficient compliance with 6th condition, and relieved plaintiffs from further compliance with condition.\nUpon this replication issue was taken.\nPending this action the \"Nova Scotia Judicature Act, 1884,\" was passed by the provincial legislature, and by the 10th sec. of that act it was made applicable to proceedings in actions pending and which had not reached the stage of final judgment prior to the 1st of October, 1884. The cause came on for trial on the 8th of November, 1884. Consequently all equitable as well as legal questions, which were sufficiently raised by the pleadings, were open to the parties, and the court was bound, pursuant to the 12th sec. of the act in question, to administer equitable as well as legal relief in determining the issues raised upon the record.\nThe allegation as to compliance with the 6 th condition contained in the declaration and which has already been stated, is clearly insufficient to show performance of this condition. The condition requires that notice shall be given to the company. It is not alleged, nor is it proved, that it was within the authority of the local agent to receive such a notice, and decided cases have determined that a condition of this kind requires that notice should be given to the company directly through its managing officers at its head office Gale v. Lewis[15]; Mason v. Hartford Ins. Co.[16]. Moreover, the terms of the condition show that beyond giving notice, the subsequent assurance must be indorsed on the policy or acknowledged in writing; the words are \"in default whereof such policy shall thenceforth cease and be of no effect.\" It is neither pleaded nor proved that any notice was given to the company in the manner required, nor that the subsequent policy was endorsed or otherwise acknowledged in writing, which by the express stipulations of the policy was to be the only evidence of the appellants' consent to continue the risk after a subsequent policy had been effected Noad v. The Provincial Ins. Co.[17]; Chapman v. Lancashire Ins. Co.[18]. The question as to the sufficiency of the respondent's answer to the defence raised upon this sixth condition is therefore reduced to one of waiver. It is not shewn that it was within the scope of Greer's authority as a local agent to waive such a condition. The condition itself does not, either by express words or by implication, recognize such an authority, but the reason for requiring the notice obviously points to a directly contrary construction Moreover, the English case already quoted, which determines that the required notice is to be given to the company itself and not to the local agent, shows, a fortiori, that such an agent has in the absence of express authority no power to waive the condition Direct authority is, however, not wanting. In the case of Shannon v. The Gore District Mutual Insurance Co.[19] the facts were the same as in the present case, the subsequent assurance having been effected through the agent who also acted for the defendants in taking the original risk. It was contended that the successive insurances having been thus effected with the same person as the agent of the two companies, the company which granted the first policy had knowledge of the subsequent insurance, and were, therefore, estopped from setting up a condition vitiating the policy for want of written notice. But the Court of Appeal held otherwise, and determined that in such a case notice to the agent was not notice to the company, and that the agent neither had authority to waive the condition nor could by his conduct estop his principals the first insurers. As regards any direct action of the appellants through their immediate agents, the directors or principal officers of the company conducting its affairs at the head office, there is no pretence for saying that there is in the present case the slightest evidence of conduct upon which either a defence of waiver of the condition, or by way of estoppel against insisting upon it, can be based, and this for the very plain reason that these directors and officers never had the fact of a subsequent assurance brought to their knowledge; and without proof of such knowledge neither waiver nor estoppel can be made out.\nIf, therefore, the appellants have in any way disentitled themselves to set up the defence they insist upon, founded on the 6th condition, it can only be in consequence of what was done or agreed to by Mr. Corey, the adjuster, employed to ascertain the circumstances attending the loss and the amount for which the appellants were liable.\nThe observations already made with reference to a waiver by the company, that it could not be said to have waived an objection to its liability founded on a fact of which it had no knowledge, is also applicable to any contention of this kind founded on the mere fact of the appointment of Corey as an agent to ascertain the circumstances of the loss and a reference to him to adjust the proportion which the appellants were liable for. It is manifest that, upon the facts in evidence, no waiver can be implied from such an appointment and delegation. If, then, there was any waiver or estoppel binding the appellants, it can only be by reason of the acts of Corey within the scope of his authority. Corey was an average adjuster living at St. John, and came to Halifax for the special purpose of investigating this loss, and ascertaining the share which the several companies, whose policies covered the goods, were bound to contribute. It does not appear very clearly whether he was instructed directly from the principal office of the appellants or through Greer. The latter in his evidence says, he \"had a telegram from defendant \"company authorizing me to request Corey to adjust \"the loss, and I requested him to do so.\" In cross-examination he says: \"After a loss I notify the head \"office and I get instructions from them what to do. \"Generally they instruct Corey or Dodd to adjust for \"them. I do not remember getting a telegram authorizing \"me to get Corey.\" Corey himself does not state from whom he derived his instructions, nor what they precisely were.\nI think, however, we may assume\u2014and this is putting it perhaps more strongly against the appellants than the evidence warrants\u2014that Corey was employed either directly by the appellants managing officers, or through Greer, in pursuance of express instructions from the head office; and that, consequently, whatever he did within the scope of his authority bound the appellants.\nThen, what were his powers? We have no direct evidence of this. All that appears is that he was authorized to investigate and adjust the loss. By this I understand that it was his duty to ascertain the circumstances and amount of the loss, and either with or without the agreement of the adjuster for the other insurers to ascertain the proportion of it to which the defendants were liable It is manifest that this involved no actual authority to waive a condition by a breach of which the policy had been avoided long before the loss, and of which breach the appellants themselves, when they conferred authority on Corey to act for them, had no knowledge. Neither did it imply any such authority. As regards proofs of loss I should have no difficulty in holding that Corey had authority to waive them, for as the first step to be taken by him in investigating the loss would have been to call for the proofs he must have had, by implication, power to dispense with such proofs, or to accept such proofs short of those actually required by the conditions, as might seem to him sufficient. But as regards breaches of conditions which had vitiated the policy long before the loss, these he could have had no more power to waive than he had to waive a defence extra the terms and conditions of the policy altogether, such as fraud in the inception of the contract or want of interest invalidating the policy ab initio.\nIn the case of Mason v. Hartford Insurance Co.[20] the court had to deal with this identical question, and they held that an agent with much wider authority than Corey had in the present case, viz, express authority to examine into the circumstances of the loss, adjust it and to settle it, or report to the office, had no authority to waive a condition respecting subsequent assurance in all respects similar to that now in question. The court, by Wilson J., say:\nIt was said at the trial the duties of the inspector are to examine into the circumstances, to adjust the loss and to settle, or report to the office. The description of the position which Mr. Marr, the inspector of the defendants, filled in their service, and of the duties that devolved upon him, and of the powers exercisable by him as such officer, does not necessarily give him the right to waive conditions favorable to the company unless the waiver relate distinctly to some matter in and over which he can exercise such power. It is said the inspector is to adjust the loss\u2014that is, to examine the books of accounts and vouchers and to make all due enquiries of the insured and of his employees as to the value of the goods insured which have been destroyed or injured, to determine probably whether the goods claimed for come within the description of those insured, the extent of the loss sustained, how much is total and how much partial, the value to be set upon the different kinds of loss; and, generally, to do all such acts as will enable him to arrive at a fair estimate of the damage sustained. Now, suppose there was a condition on the policy that in adjusting the loss the insured should deliver to the inspector or agent of the company engaged in the adjustment an account or statement in writing of the various matters which the inspector should require him to furnish, and if he did not do so that the policy should be void. I should say without hesitation that if an adjustment were made by an agent without a statement in writing such as the condition required being furnished by the insured and without the agent requiring any such statement because he was willing and content to do without it, that the adjustment so made\u2014free from fraud or collusion of course - would be binding on the insurer because that would be an act within the line of duty, and powers, of such an agent to deal with. But when such a person assumes to dispense with conditions relating to the keeping of prohibited or highly hazardous goods or largely in excess of the allowable quantities, or to a misdescription of the mode of heating or the precautions required in case of steam being used, or with respect to chimneys or stove pipes, or the deposit of ashes in the proximity of dangerous places and the like, a different question is certainly presented. * * * * * * * * I am not satisfied that an inspector of an insurance company, or such an agent as Marr is described to be, has the right or power to waive or dispense with the condition in question relating to further insurance, or with any other condition than such as may fall clearly within the power of the agent's clear and acknowledged line of duty.\nAlthough this case was not a binding authority either on the court below or on this court, yet the observations contained in the extract from the judgment just given so commend themselves to our consideration in the present case, alike by the force of the reasoning and by their exact applicability to the facts now before us, that they appear to me to be decisive of the question here raised as to the powers of Mr. Corey to waive this condition. It is further to be observed that the powers of the agent in the case just quoted from were much larger than those which were possessed by Corey, for in the Ontario case the agent had express power to \"settle the loss.\"\nBut even if Corey had had authority to waive, it is plain, on the evidence, he never assumed to exercise it. All he did was to ascertain the circumstances attending the loss, and the amount which the appellants would have had to contribute to it in case they had been liable to pay; he did not assume to waive any rights of the appellants, and nothing of the kind could be implied from the investigation and valuation which he made or caused to be made. Indeed, so careful was Greer to guard against any such construction being put on what was done, that in the appointment of appraisers to value the damaged goods there was an express provision that the reference to the valuers should not affect the rights of the insurers as regards the conditions of the policies. The clause being as follows:\u2014\nIt being understood that this appraisement is without reference to any other questions or matters of difference, if any, within the terms and conditions of the insurance, and is of binding effect only so far as regards the actual cash value of or damage to such property covered by policies of said companies as may be found to have been saved in a damaged condition, and not in regard to any other matter whatever.\nNothing seems to have been done by Mr. Corey beyond making this appraisement and making an enquiry into the circumstances of the loss, and it is impossible to imply from these acts any intention on his part to waive the rights of the appellants to insist on a forfeiture under the 6th condition, even if he had had notice of the breach of condition, of which there was no evidence, and had had authority to waive the defence which the company had under its terms, in respect to which, also, there is an entire failure of proof.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and judgment in the court below entered for the appellants, with costs in both courts.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred\nHENRY J.\u2014I think, also, that this appeal should be allowed. The condition in the policy is one which must be complied with or waived. The company, by signing a condition of that kind, reserves to itself the right to withdraw the policy in case of further insurance. That question is one which cannot be decided by a mere local agent. He may receive the notice for transmission, but he cannot act on it; it must be brought to the notice of some person authorized by the company to continue the insurance after notice has been given them. It has been decided in a number of cases in England that a local agent has not such authority, and a mere notice to him, even in a case where he is acting for another company taking the further risk, has been held to be no notice to the company.\nBut independent of all that, the condition requires that the consent should be signed on the back of the policy. So that, even if the company had consented verbally, and had not so signified its consent, it would not have been a compliance with the condition.\nI think we must come to the conclusion that the agent had not power to waive the condition, and did not waive it.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014 I am also of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Henry & Weston.\nSolicitor for respondents: Thomas Ritchie.\n[1] 3 Can.

J, Ritchie C.

Cons. Slats. L. C. ch. 15 sec. 77\u201441 Vic. ch. 6 sec 26 P. Q.\u2014Construction of.\nIn an action brought by appellants against the respondents to recover the sum of $808.50 for three years' school taxes imposed on property occupied by them as a farm, situated in one municipality the products of which, with the exception of a portion sold to cover the expenses of working and cultivating, were consumed at the other House situated in another municipality.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that as the property taxed was not occupied by the respondents for the objects for which they were instituted, but was held for the purpose of deriving a revenue therefrom, it did not come within the exemptions from taxation for school rates provided for by sec. 13 of ch, 16 32 Vic. (P. Q.)\nHeld, also, that said sec, 13 does not extend, as regards exemptions, sec. 77 of ch. 15 of the Cons. Stats L C. which has not been repealed but which has been amended by the addition of sec. 26 ch. 6 41 Vic. (P.Q.)\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThis was an action by the school commissioners of the municipality of the village of St. Gabriel against the congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal for school taxes upon a farm of tile defendants situated within the said municipality. The defence set up is that the farm is used for educational purposes, and, therefore, exempt from such taxation\nThere was only one witness for the defendants as to the nature of the property sought to be assessed. According to her evidence, the property consists of a farm managed by two or three of the ladies of the congregation. All the products of the farm are consumed at the Mother House Villa Maria in another municipality, except a portion sold to cover the expenses of working and cultivating the farm. Occasionally, some of the nuns who were ill or indisposed, would pass a few days there, but the establishment was not kept as a sanitarium or place of repose for the respondents. The respondents have no school or house of education at the establishment in question nor even within the municipality.\nThe question raised on this appeal was whether or not the respondents are exempt from taxation under c. 10 of 32 Vic. (Quebec); the; sections bearing upon the case are given at length in the judgments.\nLacoste Q.C. for respondents, claimed that the letters patent granted to them by the King of France recognize them as an educational institution, and that the property in question was given to them for the purposes for which they were instituted and therefore is within the Act.\nGeoffrion Q.C. for appellants, contended that the respondents derive an income from the said property and are therefore liable to be taxed under the Act\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J\u2014I think the property assessed was held solely for the purposes of deriving a revenue therefrom. The object of working the farm was to make a profit to the funds of the institute from the proceeds of the farm, and therefore for the purposes of revenue, whether received in produce or the produce sold and received in money. I entirely agree with the judgment delivered by Chief Justice Dorion in the case of La Corporation du Village de Verdun v. Les Soeurs de la Congregation de Notre Dame ([1]) and have nothing to add. to what he there said.\nFOTURNIER, J.\u2014Les appelants ont poursuivi les intim\u00e9es pour le recouvrement de $808.50, pour trois ann\u00e9es de taxes scolaires impos\u00e9es par eux sur certains immeubles dont les intim\u00e9es sont propri\u00e9taires dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9 du village St. Gabriel.\nLes intim\u00e9es ont plaid\u00e9 qu'elles sont une institution d'\u00e9ducation et que comme telles, les terrains mentionn\u00e9s en la d\u00e9claration des demandeurs (appelants) comme leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9, sont exemptes du paiement des taxes scolaires et municipales, et que ces biens sont poss\u00e9d\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9es pour les fins pour lesquelles leur institution a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie\nPar une r\u00e9ponse sp\u00e9ciale, les appelants ont ni\u00e9 que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question soient exempt\u00e9es du paiement des taxes r\u00e9clam\u00e9es, et all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas poss\u00e9d\u00e9es par les intim\u00e9es pour des fins d'\u00e9ducation mais seulement pour en retirer un revenu.\nLes faits n'offrent aucune difficult\u00e9, les intim\u00e9es admettant la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9claration, et se reposant enti\u00e8rement, pour le succ\u00e8s de leur cause sur l\u2019exemption plaid\u00e9e.\nLa nature de l'occupation et de l'exploitation de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont il s'agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e par la s\u0153ur Ste. Justine, une des religieuses de la congr\u00e9gation intim\u00e9e. Elles sont administr\u00e9es par deux ou trois dames de la congr\u00e9gation, qui les font exploiter comme propri\u00e9t\u00e9s agricoles, dont les revenue sont d\u00e9pens\u00e9s \u00e0 Villa Maria, la maison-m\u00e8re de cette institution situ\u00e9e dans une autre municipalit\u00e9, \u00e0 l'exception de ce qui est vendu pour subvenir aux frais de culture. De temps en temps des religieuses malades ou indispos\u00e9es y passent quelques jours, mais l'\u00e9tablissement n'est pas un h\u00f4pital.\nQ. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement alors no consiste qu'en une ferme surveill\u00e9e par deux ou trois s\u0153urs et des employ\u00e9s, et d'autres s\u0153urs qui, quelquefois, vont y passer un intervalle de temps pour leur sant\u00e9? R, Oui monsieur.\nIl est aussi prouv\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9es ne tiennent ni \u00e9cole, ni pensionnat pour l'\u00e9ducation des jeunes filles, et qu'elles n'en ont pas dans les limites do la municipality en question.\nDans ces circonstances, la nature de l'usage et de l'exploitation des proprietes en question donne-t-elle aux intim\u00e9es le droit de se pr\u00e9valoir de l'exemption \u00e9tablie par la sec. 13 du ch. 16, 32\u00e8me Victoria (Qu\u00e9bec)? Telle est la seule question en contestation, en cette cause. La 2\u00e8me partie de la 13\u00e8me section concernant cette exemption, est ainsi con\u00e7ue:\nAucune institution ou congr\u00e9gation religieuse, charitable ou d'\u00e9ducation, ne sera tax\u00e9e pour les frais scolaires, pour les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s occup\u00e9es par elles pour les fins pour lesquelles elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies, mais les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s poss\u00e9d\u00e9es par elles pour des fins de revenu seront tax\u00e9es par les commissaires d'\u00e9cole; etc.\nLes intim\u00e9es pr\u00e9tendent que cette disposition est en amendement du ch. 15 Stat. Ref. B. C, qui, par Ia sec. 76, d\u00e9clare que les taxes scolaires doivent \u00eatre impos\u00e9es \u00e9galement d'apr\u00e8s la valeur de chaque propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur tous les immeubles sujets aux taxes dans la municipalit\u00e9 scolaire, et par la sec. 77, d\u00e9clare quelles sont les exceptions \u00e0 ce principe. Parmi les exceptions sont \"toutes\" b\u00e2tisses pour les fins de l'\u00e9ducation et le terrain sur le \"quel elles sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es.\" Cette disposition, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les intim\u00e9es, \u00e9tait beaucoup plus restreinte que celle de la section 13, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans le but d'en \u00e9largir I\u2018effet et de le rendre plus favorable aux institutions d'\u00e9ducation. L'acte 32\u00e8me Vict., ch. 16, quoique portant le titre d'acte pour amender les lois d'\u00e9ducation, introduit plus de dispositions tout-\u00e0-fait nouvelles qu'il n'en amende. Lorsqu'il r\u00e9voque ou amende quelques dispositions des lois existantes il en est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fait mention. C\u2019est ainsi que par la sec. 11, il donne une nouvelle d\u00e9finition du mot habitant; par la sec. 21 il r\u00e9voque la sec. 133 du ch. 15 Statuts Refondus; par la section 36, les sections 61 et 62 du ch. 15, sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es inapplicables aux secr\u00e9taires-tr\u00e9soriers des cit\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec et de Montr\u00e9al. Si le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son intention d'amender dans ces cas ne l'eut-il pas fait aussi dans la section 13, contenant en termes diff\u00e9rents, 1 importante disposition concernant les exemptions de paiement de taxe. Son silence a cet \u00e9gard est une pr\u00e9somption qu'il n'avait pas l'intention de modifier ou amender la loi dans le sens que pr\u00e9tendent les intim\u00e9es. La raison en est sans doute que lorsque l'on compare les deux dispositions, ii est difficile d\u2019y trouver une diff\u00e9rence suffisante pour en conclure qu\u2019il y a eu intention \u00e9vidente d'amender. Les termes de l'exemption dans le ch. 15, sont:\nToutes les b\u00e2tisses pour les fins d'\u00e9ducation, et le terrain sur lequel elles sont \u00e9rig\u00e9es.\nCette disposition signifie clairement que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s poss\u00e9d\u00e9es pour autres fins que celles de l'\u00e9ducation seront tax\u00e9es. La section 13 dit-elle autre chose lorsqu'elle d\u00e9clare que\u2014\nLes institutions d'\u00e9ducation ne seront pas tax\u00e9es pour les \u00e9coles a raison des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019elles occuperont pour les fins pour lesquelles elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9es, mais elles seront tax\u00e9es par les commissaires d\u2019\u00e9cole \u00e0 raison des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'elles poss\u00e8dent pour en retirer un revenu.\nLe pouvoir de taxer n'est-il pas aussi, dans ce dernier cas, limite, comme dans le premier, aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s poss\u00e9d\u00e9es pour des fins d'\u00e9ducation? Les mots \"a raison \"des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'elles occuperont pour les fins pour \"lesquelles elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9es,\" ne sont l\u00e0 que pour \u00e9viter de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la mention des institutions mentionn\u00e9es plus haut et ne signifient clairement pas autre chose que chacune d'elles n'aura le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'exemption qu'a raison des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'elle poss\u00e8de pour le but particulier pour lequel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9; c'est-\u00e0-dire pour les intim\u00e9es le but sp\u00e9cial de l'\u00e9ducation des jeunes filles, et pour les autres institutions religieuses ou de charit\u00e9, les terrains qu'elles occupent pour leurs fins, soit religieuse ou de charit\u00e9. Puisque la loi n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'accorder une exemption g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il faut donc n\u00e9cessairement donner \u00e0 cette clause un effet limit\u00e9, et cette limite nous ne pouvons la trouver, dans ce cas-ci, que dans la possession de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour les fins d'\u00e9ducation. Pour ces fins il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de poss\u00e9der de grandes \u00e9tendues de terres, ou d'autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s poss\u00e9d\u00e9es et exploit\u00e9es seulement dans le but d'en tirer des revenus. Je ne puis voir entre les deux dispositions une diff\u00e9rence qui me permette de conclure que la deuxi\u00e8me est une extension de la premi\u00e8re, donnant le droit d'exemption de taxe a d'autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des intim\u00e9es que celles qu'elles poss\u00e8dent pour des fins d'\u00e9ducation. Si l\u2019on n'adopte pas cette r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation que je trouve dans les deux dispositions, il en r\u00e9sulterait une exemption g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, car il suffirait pour \u00e9luder la loi d'\u00e9tablir une modeste \u00e9cole sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de grande valeur pour \u00eatre exempte de taxe, d'apr\u00e8s l'interpr\u00e9tation que les intim\u00e9es veulent faire pr\u00e9valoir.\nPour emp\u00eacher sans doute l'introduction de semblables abus la sec. 13 que je trouve plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re que la sec. 77, qui n\u2019\u00e9non\u00e7ait que l\u2019exemption de taxe d\u00e9clare que les institutions d'\u00e9ducation seront tax\u00e9es \u00e0 raison des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s quelles poss\u00e8dent pour en retirer des revenus Toute la question se r\u00e9sume donc \u00e0 savoir si une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est poss\u00e9d\u00e9e pour des fins d'\u00e9ducation ou des fins de revenus. Comme on l'a vu plus haut, la preuve faite par une des religieuses, s\u0153ur Ste. Justine, les intim\u00e9es n'ont aucune institution d'\u00e9ducation dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9 du village de St. Gabriel, et les produits des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'elles y poss\u00e8dent sont employ\u00e9s pour partie \u00e0 payer les d\u00e9penses de culture et le surplus est consomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison-m\u00e8re \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Il est \u00e9vident qu'elles n'occupent pas les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question en cette cause pour les fins de l'\u00e9ducation et qu'en cons\u00e9quence ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sont sujettes aux taxes scolaires\u2014les seules dont il s'agisse en cette cause. Je dois ajouter que je concoure dans los vues exprim\u00e9es sur cette question par l'honorable juge en chef du Bane de la Reine, Sir Aim\u00e9 Dorion et son coll\u00e8gue, l'honorable juge Cross, dans la cause de la corporation de Verdun contre les intim\u00e9es en cette cause. Ces honorables juges diff\u00e8rent de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour qui en \u00e9tait venue \u00e0 une conclusion contraire et avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cette question comme l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 celle-ci, en faveur des intim\u00e9es. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, l'honorable juge Tessier qui n'avait pas si\u00e9g\u00e9 dans le premier, a diff\u00e9r\u00e9 de la majorit\u00e9 et a adopt\u00e9e l'opinion do l'honorable juge en chef et de l'honorable juge Cross, ce qui donne pour r\u00e9sultat une division \u00e9gale des six juges de la cour du Banc do la Reine\nPour les raisons exprim\u00e9es plus haut, je me range a l'opinion qui tend \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer quo dans le cas actuel los intim\u00e9es ne sont pas exempt\u00e9es du paiement des taxes scolaires. En cons\u00e9quence je d'avis d'allouer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nJe dois ajouter que je n'ai pas cru devoir discuter la question de savoir si les produits tir\u00e9s de la ferme sont un revenu, car cola ne me parait pas susceptible d'un doute.\nHenry and Gwynne JJ concurred. TASCHEREAU, J.\u2014This action was brought to recover the sum of $808.50 for three years' school taxes (1878, 1879, 1880) imposed by the appellants upon certain immovable property owned by the respondents within the limits of the village of St. Gabriel.\nThe respondents allege by their defence, that they are an educational institution and that the lands mentioned in appellants' declaration as being their property, are exempt from the payment of municipal and school taxes inasmuch as the said parcels of land are held by the respondents for the objects for which they were established\nBy their answer the appellants deny that the property taxed was held by the respondents for educational objects but contend that the latter work the same for the purposes of deriving an income therefrom.\nThe respondents have admitted the truth of the declaration, and rely solely upon the exemption pleaded by them.\nOnly one witness was examined, Sister Ste. Justine. She explains the nature of the respondents' occupation and the use to which the immovable\u2019s in question were put. They consist of a farm managed by two or three of the ladies of the Congregation. She states that all the products of this farm are consumed at the Mother House, Villa Maria, situated in another municipality, with the exception of a portion sold to cover the expenses of working and cultivating the farm. Occasionally some of the nuns who were ill or indisposed would pass a few days there, but the establishment was not kept as a sanitarium or place of repose for the respondents. The respondents have no school or house of education at the establishment in question nor even within the municipality of St. Gabriel.\nUnder these circumstances the respondents invoke in their favor the exemption established by section 13 off chapter 16 of 82 Victoria (P.Q.)\nThis is the whole question at issue. The portion of] the above mentioned section bearing upon this question reads as follows:\u2014\nNo religious, charitable or educational institutions or corporations shall be taxed for school purposes on the property occupied by them for the objects for which they were instituted, but on all property held by them or any of them, for the purposes of deriving any income therefrom they shall be taxed by the school commissioners.\nPar 2 of see 77 ch 15 O.S.L.C enacts that:\u2014\nAll buildings set apart for purposes of education, or of religious worship, parsonage houses, and all charitable institutions or hospitals incorporated by Act of Parliament, and the ground or land on which such buildings are erected, and also all burial grounds shall be exempt from all rates imposed for the purposes of this Act.\nIt was contended at the argument that this last enactment of the Consolidated Statutes was repealed or should be considered as repealed by the above subsequent clause of the 82 Vic. (1869). But it is not so, since later on in 1878 41 Vic, ch. 6, sec. 26 the legislature amends the said section of the Consolidated Statutes by adding to the said sub-section 2 that:\u2014\nEvery educational institution, receiving no grant from the corporation or municipality in which they are situated, and the land on which they are erected, and its dependencies, shall be exempt from municipal and school taxes, whatever may be the act or charter under which such are imposed, notwithstanding all provisions to the contrary.\nThis last enactment was not cited at the argument of the case and is not referred to in the factums It applies to the respondents institution however as well as to all other educational institutions. The judgment of the Superior Court, as confirmed in the Queen's Bench. is based, in its first considerant. on the proposition that as sec. 77 of ch. 15 of the C. S. L. O. restricted the exemption from school taxes to the buildings set apart for the purposes of education and the ground or land on which. such buildings are erected the legislature by the posterior said Section of the 32 Vic. must have intended to enlarge the enactment of the Consolidated Statue and extend the exemption to a property, as the one in question, by using the words \" property occupied\" instead of \" all buildings and the ground or land on which such buildings are erected.\" If these two sections stood alone, that reasoning might help the respondents, but it works entirely against them, under the still later amendment, whereby the legislature reaffirming, as it were, the restriction contained in the Consolidated Statute, limits, in express words, the exemption to every educational institution and the land on which they are erected and its dependencies. I need not say that the words \"its dependencies\" cannot apply to the property now in question. For they apply to dependencies of the land, not to dependencies of the institution.\nIf this last enactment is to govern this case it would be clear that the property of the respondents now in question, is not exempted from the taxation claimed. However sec. 13 of the 82 Vic, has been expressly repealed, and the respondents rely upon it to claim for that property an exemption from the school taxes. This would leave us almost exclusively with a question of fact. Is this property occupied by the respondents for the objects for which they were instituted, or is it held by them for the purposes of deriving any income therefrom? with the evidence on the record and bearing in mind that exemptions are to be strictly construed and embrace only what is within their terms I am of opinion that this property is not held by the respondents for the purposes for which they were instituted but is held by them as a source of revenue or income. Sister Ste. Justine, the only witness in the case says that whether in kind or in cash the returns of that farm are exclusively employes aux revenus de la maisonmere. They form part of their revenue, just as if the farm was leased for $1,000 per annum, these $1,000 would form part of the revenues of the institution. Pierce v. Cambridge (1). If the interpretation given by the respondents to that clause was correct it would have been useless for the legislature to make a distinction between the property of an educational institution actually occupied as a school, and their property held for the purposes of revenue or income. It would have enacted that all property whatsoever belonging to an educational institution was not taxable It is clearly not what it intended by its last enactment on the subject, 41 Vic, ch. 6, sec. 26, above cited.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and judgment given for $808.50 with interest from this date and costs, distraits \u00e0 M. M.Geoffrion, Dorion, Lafleur and Rinfret.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Geoffrion, Dorion, Lafleur & Rinfret\nSolicitors for respondents: Lacoste, Globensky, Bissaillon & Brousseau.\n[1] 1 Dor.

The appellant in June, 1883, sued the respondents claiming from them an account of their administration of his estate.\nTo this action the respondents demurred and also pleaded :\n1. That the facts alleged in the plaintiff's declaration are false and insufficient in law *\n2. That they should not have been sued personally but in their quality of trustees;\n3. That they are not bound to render any account to the plaintiff but to his creditors only :\n4. That by virtue of the deed of abandonment they became the absolute owners of appellant's property, and are not bound to account to him for it\n5. That the Superior Court in the district of Three Rivers, has no jurisdiction over them;\n6. That they have already accounted by their declarations in a case C. C. No. 234, Guillet, plaintiff, L'Heureux, defendant, and Lamarche et all garnishees\n7. That the plaintiff's action is unfounded as well in fact as in law; 8. That without being bound to do so, they, in their k quality of trustees (to wit: not under their present liability) set forth for the information of plaintiff in lieu and stead of an account (here followed an account relative to their administration). And they concluded as follows: that without admitting that they are bound to render any account to the plaintiff the hereabove rendering of account be received, and the plaintiff's action dismissed with costs.\"\nBy his general answer to the plea to the merits, the appellant says : \" That the facts, matters and things pleaded in the plea or exception (except the admissions therein contained) are all and each of them false, unfounded in fact and insufficient in law. Wherefore the plaintiff, persisting in the conclusions of his declaration, prays that the said plea or exception be dismissed with cost.\"\nAfter the filing of that general answer the appellant inscribed the case for proof and final hearing upon the merits at the same time, the said appellant declaring by his said inscription that he had no evidence to produce.\nThe parties then proceeded to proof, the appellant cross-examining the respondent's witnesses without making any objection.\nThe appellant gave a consent and an admission at enqu\u00eate to be used as evidence.\nThe Superior Court, sitting at Three Rivers the sixteenth day of September, 1884, dismissed the respondents' demurrer, but maintained their exceptions and dismissed the appellant's action.\nThe case was then inscribed before the Court of Review at Quebec and that court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court.\nOn appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench the judgment of the Superior Court was reinstated Laflamme Q.C. for appellant.\nAccording to law, the respondents' plea cannot certainly be considered as an account.\nThat plea can be summed up as follows: \" The respondents not being bound to account, for such and \"such reasons, consent as a favor to give to the plaintiff certain informations, and they ask that such \"informations, be declared sufficient, and the plaintiff's a action dismissed with costs.\"\nIt is a denial of the plaintiff's right of action, and a refusal to render him an account.\nHow could a tribunal under such circumstances hold there was an account rendered, when the respondents themselves made no such pretention ? See 0. P. C. art. 522, 523. Ord. 1667 tit. 29 Pothier ([2])\nA defendant sued to render account cannot avoid the obligation to file an account duly sworn to containing under separate heads the receipts, expenditure, etc., etc., by giving in lieu thereof some statements on his administration in a plea by which he prays that the plaintiff's action he dismissed.\nUntil now the jurisprudence has been always in conformity with the provisions of the law.\nLes Cure et Marguillers v. Robillard ([3]); Wood et at. v. Wilson ([4]).\nF. Langelier Q.C. for respondent.\nThe whole case depends upon the joint question whether under the circumstances in this case the accounts produced should have been sworn to. There had been no previous demand for an account and therefore no costs. If the plea is singularly worded the proper course for the appellant was to have the account set aside because it was not sworn but as stated by Mr Justice Tessier in the court below the appellant has chosen to join issue on the pleadings and it is too late now to complain.\nThe learned counsel cited Dalloz ([5]) Carr\u00e8 proc. Civ. ([6]) Thomine Desmazures (C P.) ([7])\nTASCHEREAU J. delivered the judgment of the court.\u2014In 1882 the plaintiff, now appellant, assigned his estate to the defendants, present respondents, for the benefit of his creditors. By his present action he claims from the defendants an account of their administration of his estate. By their plea the defendants first allege that they are not bound to account to the plaintiff, \"wherefore they ask the dismissal of the action.\n2nd. They allege that they have already accounted to him before the institution of this action and this as garnishees in a suit between one Guillet and the plaintiff\u2014so therefore they pray for the dismissal of the action. 3rd. They plead the general issue. 4th., They produce a statement which they ask the court to declare to be a true and faithful account of their administration and that the action be consequently dismissed.\nTo this extraordinary plea the plaintiffs' filed a general answer. The defendants\" produced evidence to establish their account. \u2022\nThe Superior Court dismissed the plaintiff's action, on the ground that the account produced was a true and faithful one. The cosiderants refer to the garnishment pleaded, but the dispositif clearly shows that the court was of opinion that the account therein given by the present defendants was not sufficient alone to entitle them to ask for the dismissal of the present action.\nThe Court of Review unanimously reversed that judgment on the ground that the issue to be first determined in the case is as to the right of the plaintiff' to ask for an account from the defendants, and that till that point has been adjudicated upon, he, the Plaintiff is not bound to contest or admit the account filed with the plea.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench reversed the judgment of the Court of Review, and restored the first judgment by which the plaintiff's action had been dismissed. The plaintiff now appeals from that last judgment.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Review is the right one, and that the plaintiff's action was wrongly dismissed by the Superior Court.\nThe defendants first denied the plaintiff's right of action and asked the dismissal of his action. The plaintiff joined issue with them on this point. Was it not the first one to be determined ? The plaintiff says: \" I am entitled to an answer.\" The defendants say \"No, you are not.\" Is this not a clear and distinct issue upon which the court must first pronounce ? It seems to me that there can be no doubt on this point. Mr. Justice Casualt, in the Court of Review, has gone so fully into the case that I can add nothing to it. I entirely concur in all that he says. I would confirm the judgment of the Court of Review in its entirety, thus allowing the appeal with costs against the respondents, costs in Queen's Bench to be also against present respondents distraction of costs in all the courts to L.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ,\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nMatrimonial domicile\u2014Declaration in Act of Marriage\u2014Civil status\u2014Arts. 63, 65, 79, 80, 81, 83, C. C. (P.Q.)\nIn or about 1822, W., a native of Ireland, came to Canada and was employed as a shantyman on the Bonnech\u00e8re, in the Province of Upper Canada. In 1827 he got out timber for himself, and in 1828, while in Quebec, where he was in the habit of going every summer with rafts of timber, he was engaged to be married to one M. Q., the widow of one McM., in his life-time of Upper Canada. W. was married to the widow in the month of September and shortly after his marriage he returned to the Bonnech\u00e8re to carry on lumbering operations there as formerly, and on his way up left his wife and daughter in the neighbourhood of Aylmer, in Lower Canada. In the winter he came down for her and brought her to his home on the Bonnech\u00e8re and lived there for 10 or 12 years and acquired considerable wealth.\nW. declared in the presence of the priest who performed the ceremony that he was a journalier de la Province de Quebec, and he was so described in the certificate of marriage.\nM. Q. having died without a will, W. married again, and by his will left his property to his second wife, the appellant.\nThe respondents, by their action, claimed there was community of property between M. Q., their grandmother, and W. according to the laws of Lower Canada and demanded their share of it in right of heirships.\nThe appellant disputed this claim, contending there was no community.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting, that the facts of the present case were not sufficient to prove that W. had acquired a domicile in the Province of Quebec at the time of this marriage. Also, that the certificate Acte de Mariage, has only relation to residence in connection with matrimonial domicile, and, therefore, has relation to the ceremony of marriage and its validity alone, and not to domicile in reference to the civil status of the parties.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the respondent.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully stated in the report of the case in the court below and in the judgment hereinafter given.\nLaflamme Q.C. and Fleming Q.C. for appellants.\nBarnard Q.C. Creighton and Foran for respondents.\nThe arguments relied on and cases cited are fully reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada, appeal side, rendered on the 25th November last confirming the judgment rendered on the 13th day of May, 1884, by the Superior Court of Lower Canada sitting at Aylmer, for the district of Ottawa. This latter judgment declared that James Wadsworth who married Margaret Quigley in the city of Quebec on the 23rd September, 1828, was domiciled in Quebec as stated in the marriage certificate, and that, in consequence, a community of property between himself and his wife resulted under the law of Lower Canada from the marriage, in the absence of a marriage contract to the contrary.\nThe law which settles questions of domicile which must determine this case is, I think, established beyond all question. In the first place, it cannot be disputed that the domicile of James Wadsworth, as distinguished from his residence at the time of his marriage, governs the rights of the parties, and I presume it will not be disputed that no man can be without a domicile. As to the distinction between domicile and residence, Lord Westbury, in Bell v. Kennedy ([2]), says:\u2014\nNow, residence and domicile are two perfectly distinct things. It is necessary in the administration of the law that the idea of domicile should exist, and that the fact of domicile should be ascertained, in order to determine which of two municipal laws may be invoked for the purpose of regulating the rights of parties. We know very well that succession and distribution depend upon the law of the domicile. Domicile, therefore, is an idea of law. It is the relation which the law creates between an individual and a particular locality or country. To every adult person the law ascribes a domicile, and that domicile remains his fixed attribute until a new and different attribute usurps its place.\nBurge on colonial and foreign laws, ([3]):\u2014\nThe place in which the marriage is celebrated may not be that of the domicile of either of the parties, before, or at the time of, or after the marriage. It may have been resorted to for no other purpose than that of celebrating the marriage, and they may have quitted it when the ceremony was performed.\nIt ought always to be remembered, that the question whether the status has been constituted by means of a legal marriage, is perfectly distinct from the consideration of the rights, powers and capacities, which the status confers. The enquiry whether the status has been constituted, is answered by the law of the country in which the marriage was contracted. If, by a marriage which according to that law is valid, the status is constituted the connection of the parties with the law of that country ceases, unless that place be the domicile of the husband; and then its law governs, not because the marriage was celebrated there, but because it is the country of the husband\u2019s domicile. The parties, if they do not by an express agreement on their marriage stipulate as to their future rights and capacities, are presumed to submit to them as they have been defined by some municipal law; and the law, which it is presumed they contemplate, is not that of a country in which they have no intention to reside, and to which, therefore, their status cannot be subject, but that of the country in which, as it is the place of their domicile, their rights and capacities are to be exercised.\nJurists, therefore, concur in selecting the law of the domicile of the husband and wife, as that which determines the personal powers and capacities incident to their status, and not the law of the place in which the marriage was celebrated.\nJ. Voet, after laying down the rule that the wife\u2019s rights and capacities are those which are conferred by the law of her husband\u2019s domicile, however injurious they may be to her interests, treats of the effect of his change of their domicile.\nDicey on the law of domicile ([4]) says:\nWhere there is no marriage contract or settlement the mutual rights of husband and wife to each other\u2019s movables, whether possessed at the time of the marriage or acquired afterwards, are determined by the law of the husband\u2019s actual domicile at the time of the marriage, without reference to the law of the country where the marriage is celebrated or where the wife is domiciled before marriage.\nAnd Mr. Westlake in his treatise on private international law ([5]) to effect of marriage\u2019 on property, says:\nSavigny begins by laying it down as the accepted principle \u201cthat the property of the spouse is to be regarded according to the domicile of the husband, not according to the place where the marriage was contracted.\u201d\nIt is equally clear that the domicile of an infant is, during infancy, the domicile of his father, which he retains on attaining majority until he changes it.\u2014Dicey p. 7.\nAnd again ([6]) Dicey says:\nResidence in a country is not even prima facie evidence of domicile, when the nature of the residence either is inconsistent with, or rebuts the presumption of, the existence of an intention to reside there permanently (animus manendi).\nAnd in the case of Bell v. Kennedy, before referred to, the Lord Chancellor says:\nThe law is, beyond all doubt, clear with regard to the domicile of birth, that the personal status indicated by that term clings and adheres to the subject of it until an actual change is made, by which the personal status of another domicile is acquired.\nPer Lord Westbury:\nThe domicile of origin adheres until a new domicile is acquired.\nAnd as the Lord Chancellor in the same case, says: The onus of proving the change of domicile is on the party who alleges it.\nAnd Lord Chelmsford, in the case of Morehouse v. Lord ([7]) says:\nLord Chelmsford:\nIn a question of change of domicile the attention must not be too closely confined to the nature and character of the residence by which the new domicile is supposed to have been acquired. It may possibly be of such a description as to show an intention to abandon the former domicile; but that intention must be clearly and unequivocally proved. What was said by my noble and learned friend, Lord Wensleydale, in Aikman v. Aikman ([8]), lays down the rule upon this subject very clearly: \u201cEvery man\u2019s domicile of origin\u201d (and this is to be considered as a domicile of origin resumed) \u201cmust be presumed to continue until he has acquired another sole domicile by actual residence, with the intention of abandoning his domicile of origin. This change must be animo et facto, and the burthen of proof unquestionably lies upon the party who asserts that change.\u201d\nIn Aikman v. Aikman ([9]) Lord Wensleydale says:\nEvery man\u2019s domicile of origin must be presumed to continue until he has acquired another sole domicile by actual residence, with the intention of abandoning his domicile of origin. This change must be animo et facto, and the burthen of proof unquestionably lies upon the party who asserts that change. This rule is laid down in the case of Somerville v. Somerville ([10]), and has been acted upon ever since.\nIn Munro v. Munro ([11]) the Lord Chancellor says:\nQuestions of domicile are frequently attended with great difficulty; and as the circumstances which give rise to such questions are necessarily very various, it is of the utmost importance not to depart from any principles which have been established relative to such questions, particularly if such principles be adopted, not only by the laws of England, but generally by the laws of other countries. It is, I conceive, one of those principles that the domicile of origin must prevail until the party has not only acquired another, but has manifested and carried into execution an intention of abandoning his former domicile and acquiring another as his sole domicile. Such, after the fullest consideration of the authorities, was the principle laid down by Lord Alvanley, in Somerville v. Somerville ([12]), and from which I see no reason for dissenting So firmly indeed did the civil law consider the domicile of origin to adhere, that it holds that if it be actually abandoned and a domicile acquired but that again abandoned and no new one acquired in its place, the domicile of origin revives. To effect this abandonment of the domicile of origin, and substitute another in its place, it required le concours de la volont\u00e9 et du fait; animo et facto; that is, the choice of a place; actual residence in the place then chosen, and that it should be the principal and permanent residence; the spot where he had placed larem rerumque ac fortunarum suarum summum; in fact there must be both residence and intention. Residence alone has no effect per se, though it may be most important as a ground from which to infer intention. Mr. Burge, in his excellent work, 1 Comm. Col & For Laws, 54, cites many authorities from the civilians to establish this proposition. It is not, he says, by purchasing and occupying a house or furnishing it, or vesting a part of his capital there, not by residence alone, that domicile is acquired, but it must be residence with the intention that it should be permanent. In allegations depending upon intention difficulties may arise in coming to a conclusion upon the facts of any particular case, but those difficulties will be much diminished by keeping steadily in view the principle which ought to guide the decision as to the application of the facts.\nMunro v. Munro ([13]) Lord Brougham says:\u2014\nNow up to 1794 it is perfectly clear that the domicile was Scotch, and it appears to be agreed on all hands that the rules which Sir William Grant, then master of the rolls, extracted, as he said, from various decisions, the Annandale case, Bruce v. Bruce, and other cases, to all of which your lordships have been referred, were correct rules. The third of those rules which he extracted from decisions is very material in the present instance, and seems undeniable as the rule of the Scotch, as well as of the English courts; and I apprehend it is the rule universally that, where a domicile has been constituted, the proof of the change of domicile is thrown upon the party who disputes it, and that you must show distinctly that there has been the animus as well as the factum; there has been a desire and intention to change the domicile, as well as the fact of leaving that place of residence, in order to alter the former domicile and to acquire a new one.\nHodgson v. DeBeauchesne ([14]), Tlie Right Hon. Dr. Lushington says:\u2014\nIn Munro v. Munro ([15]), Lord Cofttenham said: \u201cTo effect this abandonment of the domicile of origion and substitute another in its place, it required le concours ae la volont\u00e9 et du fait; animo et facto; that is, the choice of a place; actual residence in the place then chosen, and that it should be the principal and permanent residence; the spot where he had placed larum rerumqiie ac fortunarum suarum summum; in fact, there must be both residence and intention. Residence alone has no effect per se, though it may be most important as a ground from which to refer intention. Mr. Burge ([16]), in his excellent work cites many authorities from the civilians to establish this proposition.\u201d\nIn Collier v. Rivaz ([17]), Sir Herbert Jenner Fust said: \u201cLength of time will not alone do it; intention alone will not do; but the two taken together, do constitute a change of domicile.\u201d\nIn Munro v. Douglas ([18]), Sir John Leach observed: \u201cA domicile cannot be lost by mere abandonment. It is not to be defeated animo merely, but animo et facto.\u201d It was clearly the opinion of that learned judge, that, to constitute domicile, intention and residence must concur. Denisart ([19]), quotes authority to the same effect, that neither the intention without the fact, nor the fact with the intention, can create a domicile.\nDicey ([20]) says:\nD., a domiciled Englishman, leaves England with the intention of never returning there, and travels about the world without settling anywhere. He is domiciled in England.\nIn Udny v. Udny ([21]) the Lord Chancellor says:\nIt appears to me that sufficient weight was not given to the effect of the domicile of origin, and that there is a very substantial difference in principle between an original and an acquired domicile. I shall not add to the many ineffectual attempts to define domicile. But the domicile of origin is a matter wholly irrespective of any animus on the part of its subject. He acquires a certain status civilis, as one of your lordships has designated it, which subjects him and his property to the municipal jurisdiction of a country which he may never even have seen, and in which he may never reside during the whole course of his life, his domicile being simply determined by that of his father. A change of that domicile can only be affected animo et facto; that is to say, by the choice of another domicile, evidenced by residence within the territorial limits to which the jurisdiction of the new domicile extends.\nThe Lord Chancellor ([22]):\nI have stated my opinion more at length than I should have done were it not of great importance that some fixed common principles should guide the courts in every country on international questions. In questions of international law we should not depart from any setfcied decisions, nor lay down any doctrine inconsistent with them. I think some of the expressions used in former cases as to the intent exuere patriam, or to become \u201ca Frenchman instead of an Englishman,\u201d go beyond the question of domicile. The question of naturalization and of allegiance is distinct from that of domicile. A man may continue to be an Englishman, and yet his contracts and the succession to his estate may have to be determined by the law of the country in which he has chosen to settle himself. * * *\nLord Westbury ([23]):\nThe law of England, and of almost all civilized countries, ascribes to each individual at his berth two distinct legal states or conditions; one by virtue of which he becomes the subject of some particular country, binding him by the tie of natural allegiance, and which may be called his political status; another, by virtue of which he has ascribed to him the character of a citizen of some particular country, and as such is possessed of certain municipal rights and subject to certain obligations, which latter character is the civil status or condition of the individual, and may be quite different from his political status. The political status may depend on different laws in different countries; whereas the civil status is governed universally by one single principle, namely, that of domicile, which is the criterion established by law for the purpose of determining civil status. For it is on this basis that the personal rights of the party, that is to say, the law which determines his majority or minority, his marriage, succession, testacy, or intestacy must depend. International law depends on rules which, being in great measure derived from the Roman law, are common to the jurisprudence of all civilized nations. It is a settled principle that no man shall be without a domicile, and to secure this result the law attributes to every individual as soon as he is born the domicil of his father, if the child be legitimate, and the domicile of the mother if illegitimate. This has been called the domicile of origin and is involuntary. Other domiciles, including domicile by operation of law, as on marriage, are domiciles of choice. For as soon as an individual is sui juris it is compet\u00e9nt to him to elect and assume another domicile, the continuance of which depends upon his will and act. When another domicile is put on, the domicile of origin is, for that purpose, relinquished, and remains in abeyance during the continuance of the domicil of choice; but as the domicil of origin is the creature of law, and independent of the will of the party, it would be inconsistent with the principle on which it is by law created and ascribed, to suppose that it is capable of being by the act of the party entirely obliterated and extinguished. It revives and exists whenever there is no other domicil, and it does not require to be regained or reconstituted animo et facto, in the manner which is necessary for the acquisition of a domicil of choice.\nDomicil of choice is a conclusion or inference which the law derives from the fact of a man fixing voluntarily his sole or chief residence in a particular place, with an intention of continuing to reside there for an unlimited time. This is a description of the circumstances which create or constitute a domicil, and not a definition of the term. There must be a residence freely chosen, and not prescribed or dictated by any external necessity, such as the duties of office, the demands of creditors, or the the relief from illness; and it must be residence fixed not for a limited period or particular purpose, but general and indefinite in its future contemplation. It is true that residence originally temporary, or intended for a limited period, may afterwards become general and unlimited, and in such a case so soon as the change of purpose or animus manendi, can be inferred the fact of domicil is established.\nIn Mr. Justice Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws (the last edition) it is stated that \u201cthe moment the foreign domicile (that is the domicile of choice) is abandoned, the native domicile or domicile of origin is re-acquired.\u201d\nAnd such appears to be the just conclusion from several decided cases, as well as from the principles of the law of domicil.\nLord Oolonsay ([24]):\nI regard this case as one of very considerable importance, inasmuch as it has afforded an opportunity for bringing out, more clearly than has been done in any of the former cases, the radical distinction between domicile of origin and domicile of choice.\nLord Chelmsford ([25]):\nIt is undoubted law that no one can be without a domicile.\nLord Chelmsford ([26]):\nBut in a competition between a domicile of origin and an alleged subsequently acquired domicile there may be circumstances to shew that however long a residence may have continued no intention of acquiring a domicile may have existed at any one moment during the whole of the continuance of such residence. The question in such a case is not whether there is evidence of an intention to retain the domicile of origin, but whether it is proved that there was an intention to acquire another domicile. As already shown, the domicile of origin remains till a new one is acquired animo et facto.\nWhat will constitute a change of domicile has been frequently enunciated in the highest courts. Thus in Lord v. Colvin ([27]) the Vice Chancellor:\nI would venture to suggest that the definition of an acquired domicile might stand thus: \u201cThat place is properly the domicile of a person in which he has voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself and his family, not for a mere special and temporary purpose, but with a present intention of making it his permanent home, unless and until something (which is unexpected or the happening of which is uncertain) shall occur to induce him to adopt some other permanent home.\u201d\nI am disposed to think that the definition thus modified would be found to be in accordance with most, if not all, of the leading decisions on the subject of acquired domicile.\nBut whatever may be the most correct and proper terms in which to frame a definition of domicile, this at least is clear and beyond controversy, that to constitute an acquired domicile two things are requisite, act and intention, factum et animus. To use the language of an eminent jurist, to whose admirable writings I have before referred, \u201ctwo things must concur to constitute domicile (of course he is speaking of acquired domicile); first, residence; and secondly, the intention of making it the home of the party\u201d There must be the fact and the intent; for, as Pothier has truly observed, a person cannot establish a domicile in a place, except it be animo et facto.\nJopp v. Wood ([28]).\nMarginal note. A domiciled Scotchman went to India, where he was engaged in merchantile pursuits for nine years. Held, that this residence and occupation in India did not in the absence of any expression of intention change his domicile. Held, that the domicile of J S. at his death was Scotch, and that the domicile of his children, who were born in India and died infants there, was that of their father.\nSir J. Romilly, the Master of the Rolls:\nIt is quite settled that two things are necessary to constitute a change of domicile; first, the factum of the change of residence; and next, the animus manendi. In other words, in order to effect a change of domicile, the person must have settled in a residence out of his former domicile, whether it be the domicile of origin or an acquired domicile; and he must also have the intention of making that residence his permanent home.\nOn appeal, Jopp v. Wood ([29]), the Lord Justice Turner says:\nBut nothing is better settled with reference to the law of domicile than that the domicile can be changed only animo et facto, and although residence may be decisive as to the factum, it cannot when looked at with reference to the animus, be regarded otherwise than as an equivocal act. The mere fact of a man residing in a place different from that in which he has been before domiciled, even although his residence there may be long and continuous, does not of necessity show that he has elected that place as his permanent and abiding home. He may have taken up and continued his residence there for some special purpose, or he may have elected to make the place his temporary home. But domicile, although in some of the cases spoken of as \u201chome,\u201d imports an abiding and permanent home, and not a mere temporary one. The effect of residence or domicile is well explained by Dr. Lushington in his very able judgment in Hodgson v. DeBeauchesne ([30]), and I entirely agree in the opinion which is there expressed upon the subject.\nIn considering cases of this description it must be borne in mind that the acquisition of a new domicile involves an abandonment of the previous domicile; and in order, therefore, to effect the change, the animus of abandonment, or, as Lord Cranworth has strongly expressed it, the intention exuere patriam, must be shown.\nLord v. Colvin, February 14th, ([31]), Vice-Chancellor Kindersley\u2019s Court, domicile:\nThat place is properly the domicile of a person in which he has voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself and his family, not for a mere special and temporary purpose, but with a present intention of making it his permanent home, unless and until something (which is unexpected or uncertain) shall occur to induce him to adopt some other permanent home.\nTo constitute an acquired domicile two things must concur, residence, and the intention of making it the home of the party.\nThe two last cases on the subject that I saw were both decided in 1885 affirming the same principles.\nIn re Patience, Patience v. Main. ([32])\nMarginal note:\nP. was bora in Scotland, in 1792. of Scotch parents. In 1810 he obtained a commission in the army, and immediately proceeded with his regiment on foreign service, and served abroad till 1860, when he retired from the army. From 1860 till his death he resided in lodgings, hotels, and boardings houses in various places in England, dying in 1882, intestate and a bachelor, in a private hotel in London, leaving no real estate in England, and no property whatsoever, in Scotland. From the year 1810 till his death he never revisited Scotland, and for the last twenty-two years of his life never left the territorial limits of England.\nHeld. - That the domicile of the intestate at his death was Scotch.\nThe Lauderdale Peerage ([33]):\nA change of domicile must be a change of residence sine animo revertendi. A temporary residence for the purposes of health, travel, or business does not change the domicile. Also (1) every presumption is to be made in favor of the original domicile; (2) no change can occur without an actual residence in a new place; and (3) no new domicile can be obtained without a clear intention of abandoning the old.\nPage 739, Earl of Selborne:\nThe onus of proving a change of domicile, animo et facto, lies upon those who assert it.\nPage 758, Lord Fitzgerald:\nThe extent to which the evidence must be carried to put an end to the domicile of origin is explained in clear terms in the Countess of Dalhousie\u2019s Case ([34]), and in Munro v. Munro ([35]), both of which were in this house, and reported in Clark and Finelly. It is not upon light evidence or upon a light presumption that we can act, but it must clearly appear by unmistakable evidence that the party who has a domicile of origin intends to part with it and intends to establish his domicile elsewhere.\nI cannot discover that these principles are peculiar to the law of England; they are of universal application as principles of private international law, and so far as the Province of Quebec is concerned, there is nothing in the law of that province antagonistic to them. The code says, art. 79:\nThe domicile of a person, for all civil purposes, is at the place where he has his principal establishment.\nArt. 80:\nChange of domicile is affected by actual residence in another place, coupled with the intention of the person to make it the seat of his principal establishment.\nArt. 81:\nThe proof of such intention results from the declarations of the person and from the circumstances of the case.\nArt. 83:\n* * * * The domicile of an unemancipated minor is with his father or mother or with his tutor.\nI think, then, we may assume it to be established beyond all question:\nFirst.\u2014That no man can, at any time, be without a domicile.\nSecondly. \u2014That the domicile of the father is the domicile of the child during minority, and continues until changed, until a new domicile is acquired after majority.\nThirdly.\u2014That the onus of proof of change of domicile is on the party alleging it.\nFourthly.\u2014That domicile and residence are two distinct things, and that domicile must be ascertained to determine which of two municipal laws regulates the rights of the parties.\nFifthly.\u2014That in order to lose a domicile of origin and acquire another, there must be a residence, and the intention of making the residence a permanent home and not a residence for a mere special or temporary purpose; in other words, domicile imports an abiding and permanent home, and not a mere temporary one; there must be the factum of residence and the animus manendi.\nSixthly.\u2014That the rights of the husband and wife are determined by the domicile of the husband at the time of the marriage, and not by the place where the marriage was contracted.\nIf this be so, then the plaintiff\u2019s claim must be founded on the contention that at the time of the marriage of James Wadsworth with Margaret Quigley, at Quebec, in the then Province of Lower Canada, he was domiciled in that province, and that by virtue of the laws thereof, in force at the time of the said marriage and still in force therein and by which the said marriage was governed, on the celebration of such marriage, there being no contract of marriage, the legal community of property was established which, on the death of Margaret Quigley, enured to the benefit of her children; and so that really the question in issue is, subject to the principles I have deduced from the cases, one of fact.\nWadsworth\u2019s history, not a very eventful one, shortly told is this. He was born of Irish parents, his father being a farmer resident and domiciled in the parish of Ematros, county of Monaghan, in Ireland. In 1822, at the age of 19 or 20, he emigrated; whether he came direct to Canada or not does not appear; if he did, which may be assumed, it is not shown in what part of Canada he landed. The first information we have of his whereabouts in Canada is from Mr. Mather, who saw him on the Bonnechere, in Upper Canada, now Ontario, in the year 1826, where he was lumbering in the employ of one McMullen. The market for the timber cut on the Bonnechere was at Quebec, to which place it was taken in rafts in the spring or summer season, on which rafts it is well known the raftsmen live during the progress to Quebec. Wadsworth was employed in taking rafts to Quebec, and when they were sold or disposed of, returning to the Bonnechere. His employer, McMullen, was killed in the year 1827; he had sent to Ireland for his wife, who came out to Quebec with her daughter in the spring of that year, where, on her arrival, she heard of the death of her husband, who had been killed a short time before She went from Quebec to Hull, and remained there for some months, when she determined to go back to Ireland, and for that purpose returned to Quebec on her way to Ireland. After the death of her husband the lumber business was carried on for the benefit of his partner Kelly, and his widow; in the spring of 1828 a raft in which Kelly and Mrs. McMullen were interested was brought to Quebec by Wadsworth. Mrs. McMullen, then in Quebec, boarded at Mulholland\u2019s, and for a portion of the time that Wadsworth was in Quebec on this occasion he appears to have boarded at the same house. While there Mrs. McMullen, instead of proceeding to Ireland, married Wadsworth on the third of September, 1828; immediately after Wadsworth left Quebec with his wife and returned to the Bonnechere, leaving his wife for a short time at Hull on their way up. Wadsworth in a few weeks returned to Hull for his wife and took her to the Bonnechere, where he purchased a property with a shanty on it, in which he and his wife from that time lived, until he subsequently built a house. He cleared land, farmed, lumbered, and dealt in furs with the Indians, and never again returned to Quebec with his family; nor did he himself visit Quebec for any other than the temporary purpose of taking down rafts and disposing of them there; he, with his wife and family, lived in the house on the Bonnechere, where his lumbering operations were carried on; his children were born there, and one, if not two, died and were buried there; and he continued to reside there as his home for ten or twelve years, until he sold out his establishment to Mr. Egan and removed to the neighborhood of Hull, where he purchased a farm, as his sister, who was then married and settled there, says, to be near her, and subsequently left this neighborhood and resided in Ottawa several years, where his wife died. He married the defendant there, and afterwards moved, on the 9th of May, 1873, to Hull, where he resided until his death at that place.\nThere is no contradiction in the evidence in this case to which I will now refer. The facts are undisputed; the witnesses examined were the relatives Jane Wadsworth, sister of James Wadsworth, William Wadsworth, his brother, and Susan McMullen, daughter of his first wife by her husband McMullen and the intervenor in this case and others. (His Lordship here referred at length to the evidence of the different witnesses as establishing the facts above stated.)\nHow then is this apparently plain case met? Simply by the production of the marriage certificate of James Wadsworth and Margaret Quigley at the city of Quebec, in which certificate Wadsworth is described as, James Wadsworth, journalier de celte ville. It is as follows:\nExtrait du Registre des bapt\u00eames, marriages et s\u00e9pultures de la paroisse de Notre Dame de Qu\u00e9bec, pour l\u2019anne mil huit cent vingt-huit:\nLe vingt-trois septembre mil huit cent vingt-huit, vu la dispense de deux bans de mariage accord\u00e9e par Monseigneur Bernard Claude Panet, \u00e9v\u00eaque de Qu\u00e9bec, en date du vingt du pr\u00e9sent mois, et la publication du troisi\u00e8me faite au pr\u00f4ne de notre messe paroissale de dimanche dernier entre James Wadsworth, journalier de cette ville, fils majeur de William Wadsworth et de d\u00e9fante MaliMa McCabe, du comt\u00e9 de Monaghan en Irlande, d\u2019une part: et Mary Quigley, veuve majeure de James McMullen, du township de Napean dans le Haut Canada, d\u2019autre part; ne s\u2019\u00e9tant d\u00e9couvert aucun emp\u00eachement, nous, pr\u00eatre, vicaire de Qu\u00e9bec soussign\u00e9, avons re\u00e7u leur mutuel consentement de mariage, en presence de Hugh Green et de James MacAnally,.amis de l\u2019\u00e9poux. et de Rebecca Donaughy et de Catherine Dupel, amis de l\u2019\u00e9pouse, dont quelques uns avec les \u00e9poux ont sign\u00e9 avec nous, les autres ayant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne le savoir faire.\nDuly signed and certified.\nNow, with all respect for those from whom I am constrained to differ, in my opinion this certificate has nothing whatever to do with the matter in controversy in this case, inasmuch as it has no connection with the question of domicile. Art. 63 says:\nThe marriage in solemnized at the place of the domicile of one or the other of the parties. If solemnized elsewhere the person officiating is obliged to ascertain and verify the identity of the parties. For the purposes of marriage domicile is established by a residence of six months in the same place.\nBut surely for no other purpose.\nThis certificate has only relation to residence in connection with matrimonial domicile, which latter domicile is established by a residence of six months, and therefore has relation to the ceremony of marriage and its validity alone, and not to domicile in reference to the civil status of the parties which is regulated by art. 6, which declares that:\nThe laws of Lower Canada relative to persons apply to all persons being therein, even to those not domiciled there; subject, as to the latter, to the exception mentioned at the end of the present article.\nWhich exception is:\nBut these laws do not apply to persons domiciled out of Lower Canada, who, as to their status and capacity, remain subject to the laws of their country.\nThen, as these laws do not apply to persons domiciled out of Lower Canada, there is not, that I can discover, a jot or tittle of evidence to show that Wadsworth was ever in the city of Quebec with any other than a mere temporary purpose; when in the employ of others taking their rafts to market, when lumbering for himself taking his rafts to market for sale; living either on the raft or in a boarding house, and returning, when his business was transacted, to the Bonnechere, where the lumbering operations in which he was engaged, either for others of for himself, were carried on, and to which locality, immediately after his marriage, or so soon as conveniently could be, he carried his wife and made it, for the time being, the permanent and fixed place of residence of himself and family, and the chief place where the operations of his business were carried on, and never voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself and family in the Province of Quebec.\nThere seems to me to be everything wanting in this case to establish a Lower Canadian domicile; that his domicile of origin was in Ireland is beyond question; the evidence shows that his visits to Quebec and temporary sojourn there were for a mere special and temporary purpose; that he was never there with the present intention of making it his permanent home; that his stay in Quebec did not an abiding and permanent home but a mere temporary one, nor had he any actual residence there with the intention of making it the seat of his principal establishment, but his principal establishment was always out of Quebec; that there was neither the factum of residence in Quebec, nor the animus manendi; and therefore there is no pretence for saying that he had changed his domicile of origin and acquired a domicile of choice in Quebec.\nThe real question in this case is not whether the domicile of James Wadsworth was in Ireland or in Upper Canada; what the plaintiffs have to establish to enable them to recover is, that James Wadsworth\u2019s domicile at the time of his marriage was in the province of Quebec. Having failed to establish this, but, on the contrary, it being clearly established, as I think it was, that his domicile was out of the province of Quebec the plaintiffs have failed to establish the community claimed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Les Intim\u00e9s r\u00e9clament la succession de leur a\u00efeule, Margaret Quigley, mari\u00e9e deux fois, la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 James McMullen ou Mullen, et la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e0 James Wadsworth. Ce dernier mariage a eu lieu \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, le 23 septeinbre 1828, sans contrat de mariage et aurait d\u2019apr\u00e8s les Intim\u00e9s, \u00e9tabli une communaut\u00e9 de biens entre les conjoints. Les demandeurs intim\u00e9s sont les enfants du second mariage et l\u2019intervenante aussi intim\u00e9e est issue du premier. Ils r\u00e9clament la moiti\u00e9 des biens laiss\u00e9s par James Wadsworth comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 commun en biens avec leur m\u00e8re Margaret Quigley.\nCette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9e par une d\u00e9fense, au fonds en fait,et une d\u00e9fense en droit. Puis une exception p\u00e9remptoire all\u00e9guant qu\u2019avant et apr\u00e8s son mariage avec Margaret Quigley, James Wadsworth r\u00e9sidait \u00e0 Eganville, dans la province d\u2019Ontario o\u00f9 il faisait des affaires et poss\u00e9dait, des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res avant son mariage, et diverses limites \u00e0 bois qu\u2019il tenait de la couronne; qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais eu de domicile dans le Bas-Canada du vivant de Margaret Quigley et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait-point fait affaires et n\u2019y avait pas acquis de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une seule \u00e0 Aylmer. Dans un deuxi\u00e8me plaidoyer r\u00e9p\u00e9tant le premier, l\u2019appelante all\u00e8gue que c\u2019est par erreur que James Wadsworth a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 dans son acte de mariage, comme de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec; qu\u2019il n\u2019y r\u00e9sidait que temporairement, son domicile \u00e9tant alors \u00e0 Eganville, dans le Haut-Canada, o\u00f9 il est. retourn\u00e9 de suite apr\u00e8s son mariage. Par un troisi\u00e8me plaidoyer il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que son domicile \u00e9tait encore en Irlande d\u2019o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9migr\u00e9.\nLe sort de eette cause d\u00e9pend uniquement de la d\u00eacision de la question de savoir o\u00f9 \u00e9tait le domicile de James Wadsworth lors de son mariage \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, le 23 septembre 1828. S\u2019il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, comme le comporte son acte de mariage, il s\u2019en suit d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, de cette province qu\u2019il y aurait eu communaut\u00e9 de biens entre James Wadsworth et Margaret Quigley et que les Intim\u00e9s comme h\u00e9ritiers de cette derni\u00e8re seraient bien fond\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer leurs parts dans cette communaut\u00e9. Au contraire, s\u2019il \u00e9tait alors domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 Eganville (ou Bonnech\u00e8re) dans le Haut-Canada, la loi de cette province n\u2019admettant pas la communaut\u00e9 de biens entre \u00e9poux, la demande des Intim\u00e9s doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Il en serait de m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019avait acquis un domicile ni \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, ni \u00e0 Eganville et qu\u2019il e\u00fbt conserv\u00e9 son domicile d\u2019origine en Irlande, car la loi de ce pays n\u2019admet pas non plus la communaut\u00e9 de biens entre les conjoints.\nIl para\u00eet que la succession est assez consid\u00e9rable; de l\u00e0 l\u2019importance de la question de domicile.\nLa preuve assez contradictoire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par les parties fait de cette cause un exemple de plus d\u00e8s difficult\u00e9s que pr\u00e9sente tr\u00e8s souvent la d\u00e9cision des questions de domicile, surtout lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019en assigner un \u00e0 des personnes qui ont fr\u00e9quemment chang\u00e9 de r\u00e9sidences. Mais ces difficult\u00e9s ne provien, nent pas de l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 du droit \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, car, au contraire les principes qui r\u00e8glent cette mati\u00e8re sont clai\" rement \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le code civil qui n\u2019a pas d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais. Apr\u00e8s avoir lu la revue si savante et si compl\u00e8te que l\u2019honorable juge en chef a faite des d\u00e9cisi ns des tribunaux anglais sur les questions de domicile, on voit que les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux dans la jurisprudence anglaise sont, \u00e0 peu de chose pr\u00e8s, les m\u00eames que ceux du droit fran\u00e7ais. La raison en est que dans l\u2019un, comme dans l\u2019autre droit, les principes sont tir\u00e9s du droit romain La principale diff\u00e9rence que j\u2019y trouve et dont je parlerai plus loin, consiste dans les r\u00e8gles de la preuve suivie en France et dans notre droit, r\u00e8gles qui restreignent plus la preuve testimoniale que celles qui sont suivies dans les .tribunaux d\u2019Angleterre. O\u2019est principalement pour cette raison, et non pour diff\u00e9rence d\u2019opinions sur les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du droit au sujet du domicile que j\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle de l\u2019honorable juge en chef.\nJames Wadsworth qui \u00e9migra d\u2019Irlande en 1822, n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un journalier ausefvice d\u2019un marchand de bois d\u2019abord du nom de Mullen ou McMullen qui, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, manufacturait du bois l\u2019hiver sur la rivi\u00e8re Bonnech\u00e8re, dans Ontario, et le transportait en \u00e9t\u00e9 au march\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce travail que Wadsworth fut employ\u00e9 jusqu\u00e0 l\u00e0 mort de McMullen et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il p\u00fbt faire des affaires pour son propre compte. Il continua pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es ce commerce, passant l\u2019hiver dans la for\u00eat \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de son bois qu\u2019il descendait ensuite au march\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sidait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il en e\u00fbt dispos\u00e9 et obtenu de nouvelles avances pour recommencer ses op\u00e9rations pour une autre ann\u00e9e.\nMcMullen qui avait laiss\u00e9 en Irlande sa femme, Margaret Quigley, et sa fille Susan Mullen, l\u2019intervenante, les ayant fait demander de venir le rejoindre au Canada, celles-ci arriv\u00e8rent \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec en 1827 o\u00f9 elles apprirent la mort de Mullen avant d\u2019avoir pu le rencontrer.\nApr\u00e8s une ann\u00e9e de r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Hull chez Benedict, la veuve de Mullen se rendit \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec dans le but d\u2019y prendre un passage pour retourner en Irlande; mais ayant fait la rencontre de Wadsworth qui s\u2019y trouvait pour affaire de commerce de bois, un mariage fut arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre eux, et c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 en face de l\u2019\u00e9glise catholique romaine, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, le 23 septembre 1828. Apr\u00e8s un court s\u00e9jour dans cette ville, ils se rendirent chez Benedict, \u00e0 Hull, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 Margaret Quigley avait demeur\u00e9 depuis son arriv\u00e9e en Canada.\nLes circonstances qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e8rent ou suivirent ce mariage sont rapport\u00e9es comme suit par Susan Mullen:\nMr. Wadsworth boarded in the same house with us (himself and Margaret Quigley, her mother), but when he came there, or how long he was there before the marriage, I cannot say. I cannot say if he was there a fortnight before the wedding. I think he was. We boarded at M Jiholland's. Mr. Wadsworth came to Quebec on a raft of timber. We remained at olland\u2019s after the marriage until we left Quebec.\nAfter the marriage and some time in October, Mr. Wadsworth, my mother and I came up to Hull where we stayed at George King\u2019s. Mr. Wadsworth left for the woods after settling us at King\u2019s. He went up before the ice took. My mother and I remained at King\u2019s until Mr. Wadsworth returned in January eighteen hundred and twenty-nine, when he took my mother up the Bonnech\u00e8re and took me to Mr. Fulford\u2019s, in Hull.\nAvant son mariage, il est difficile de dire que Wadsworth, qui ne r\u00e9sidait que temporairement en hiver dans la for\u00eat pour y faire du bois, en \u00e9t\u00e9 sur les radeaux qu\u2019il conduisait \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 il s\u00e9journait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il en e\u00fbt dispos\u00e9, et ensuite \u00e0 Hull jusqu\u2019au moment de repartir pour la for\u00eat, ait eu un domicile dans une de ces localit\u00e9s plus que dans l\u2019autre. Il n\u2019y a pas de preuve qu\u2019il ait fait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque aucune d\u00e9claration montrant son intention de se fixer permanemment plut\u00f4t dans l\u2019une que dans l\u2019autre. La double condition de r\u00e9sidence de fait et la preuve d\u2019intention de r\u00e9sider permanemment ne se rencontrant pas, Wadsworth n\u2019y avait donc pas acquis encore un nouveau domicile.\nL\u2019Appelante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans ses plaidoyers qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait des immeubles \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re avant son mariage; mais cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019est aucunement prouv\u00e9e. Il n\u2019est pas m\u00eame certain qu\u2019il y faisait alors des affaires pour son propre compte, car les t\u00e9moins ne peuvent dire si les radeaux qu\u2019il descendit \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec en 1828, ann\u00e9e fie son mariage, \u00e9tait pour son propre compte ou celui de Kelly, l\u2019associ\u00e9 de Mullen qui avait continu\u00e9 avec la veuve de celui-ci les affaires de leur soci\u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'au moment o\u00f9 elle se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 retourner en Irlande. Wadsworth, lors de son mariage, ne poss\u00e9dait aucune propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re et n\u2019y avait point de domicile. Il avait r\u00e9sid\u00e9 autant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec qu\u2019\u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re, et s\u2019il est difficile de dire que son domicile fut plut\u00f4t dans le Haut que dans le Bas-Canada, il n\u2019est pas douteux cependant que par la d\u00e9claration qu\u2019il fit de son domicile \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, dans son acte de mariage, il ait renonc\u00e9 au domicile qu\u2019on aurait pu lui attribuer en Irlande.\nMather, l\u2019un des principaux t\u00e9moins sur lesquels l\u2019Appelante s\u2019appuie pour prouver le domicile de Wadsworth \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8ie, donne un t\u00e9moignage assez vague et qui se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 dire que lorsqu\u2019il a connu Wadsworth, celui-ci vivait et faisait du bois dans le voisinage de la rivi\u00e8re Bonnech\u00e8re, maintenant Eganville, Ontario. Il ne l\u2019a pas vu \u00e0 cet endroit, mais il l\u2019a vu monter et descendre l\u2019Ottawa pour aller \u00e0 ses affaires et descendre des radeaux dans le printemps. Il ne sait pas si c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e qu\u2019il a fait sa connaissance, et Wadsworth faisait alors du bois pour lui-m\u00eame, mais la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e qu\u2019il dit \u00eatre celle de son mariage, il descendait un radeau, que lui Mather pensait appartenir \u00e0 Wadsworth, mais il ne peut dire positivement si c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 lui ou s\u2019il n\u2019en \u00e9tait que le conducteur (foreman). Il ajoute qu\u2019il a compris de W ads worth, que, avant et apr\u00e8s son mariage, sa r\u00e9sidence (his home) \u00e9tait alors \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re. Lorsqu\u2019il venait pour ses affaires \u00e0 Hull, il se retirait soit chez .Fulford soit chez Benedict, ou \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel Columbian. A cette \u00e9poque, il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019h\u00f4tel \u00e0 Ottawa. Lorsqu\u2019il venait de Qu\u00e9bec il se retirait \u00e0 Hull dans quelque maison de pension jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il eut fait ses approvisionnements pour ses travaux d\u2019hiver. Il ne peut dire combien de temps il restait chaque fois \u00e0 Hull,\u2014il n\u2019y restait que le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour ses affaires\u2014ne peut dire si c\u2019\u00e9tait trois ou quatre semaines ou non. Quelques fois les approvisionnements pouvaient \u00eatre exp\u00e9di\u00e9s par eau, d\u2019autres fois il fallait attendre la glace. C\u2019\u00e9tait dans le printemps de l\u2019ann\u00e9e de son mariage qu\u2019il descendit un radeau comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit. Il revint durant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 ou l\u2019automne de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e avec sa femme. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s il laissa l\u2019h\u00f4tel de Benedict ou de Fulford, ne peut dire lequel, o\u00f9 il avait rest\u00e9 avec sa femme et se rendit \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re. Il pense que Wadsworth la laissa pour quelque temps et vint ensuite la chercher. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s, \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il pense,\u2014ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas longtemps apr\u00e8s. Wadsworth v\u00e9cut sur la rivi\u00e8re Bonnech\u00e8re jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il vint exploiter une ferme qu\u2019il avait achet\u00e9e \u00e0 Hull. Il conti-tinua son commerce et allait encore parfois dans la for\u00eat. Il faisait des affaires pour lui-m\u00eame et \u00e9tait support\u00e9 par M. Egan. Il a continu\u00e9 d\u2019aller \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec avec son bois apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre fix\u00e9 \u00e0 Hull.\nJohn Coyne ou Quyne, un des t\u00e9moins les plus \u00e2g\u00e9s, dit qu\u2019il a connu Wadsworth avant son mariage, qu\u2019il faisait alors du bois sur la rivi\u00e8re Bonnech\u00e8re; l\u2019a vu \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec l\u2019ann\u00e9e de son mariage; ne peut dire combien de temps il y est demeur\u00e9 soit avant soit apr\u00e8s son mariage; n\u2019a pas vu sa femme \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, mais a entendu dire qu\u2019elle y \u00e9tait. Apr\u00e8s avoir laiss\u00e9 Qu\u00e9bec, il retourna \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re. Il faisait un peu de bois \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque; il croit qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 Qu\u00e9bec, Wadsworth laissa sa femme \u00e0 Aylmer pour quelques jours. Dans le printemps de cette ann\u00e9e, Coyne \u00e9tait absent de chez lui. Il laissa Qu\u00e9bec pour Bonnech\u00e8re avec sa femme peu de temps apr\u00e8s son mariage......Il pense que l\u2019intention de Wadsworth lorsqu\u2019il est parti pour Qu\u00e9bec avant son mariage \u00e9tait de retourner \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re apr\u00e8s son mariage. Ne se souvient d\u2019aucune circonstance qui puisse faire voir qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de venir \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Il commen\u00e7a \u00e0 b\u00e2tir une maison \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s son retour de Qu\u00e9bec avec sa femme. Ils ont v\u00e9cu l\u00e0 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient venus \u00e0 Hull; ne sait pendant combien d\u2019ann\u00e9es; quelques-uns de leurs enfants y sont n\u00e9s. Il faisait le commerce de bois et aussi la traite avec les sauvages. Il avait amass\u00e9 quelque bien apr\u00e8s son mariage, dans le township de Grattan et ses environs, mais il ne dit pas o\u00f9 cette localit\u00e9 est situ\u00e9e. Il dit que Wadsworth pouvait parler un peu le fran\u00e7ais. Sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question suivante qualifie la carri\u00e8re de Wadsworth avant son mariage\u2014tout en contredisant ce qu\u2019il a dit de sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re avant le mariage: \u2014\nQ. Had Wadsworth any definite place of abode before his marriage or was he like other shantymen in that respect, living in the woods during the winter season, on the river in the early summer, at Quebec after the arrival and until the sale of the timber there, and at or near Hull until it was time to renew winter operations? R. He was like any other shantyman before he was married, but was mostly on the Bonnech\u00e8re.\nIl avoue qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas en \u00e9tat de dire si Wadsworth a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 \u00e0 Hull avant et apr\u00e8s son mariage. Avant il vivait avec ses hommes dans son chantier, en hiver, et sur ses radeaux, lorsque le bois descendait \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Lorsque ce t\u00e9moin a rencontr\u00e9 Wadsworth, avant son mariage, il faisait du bois \u00e0 son propre compte. Il n\u2019avait aucun titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e8s d\u2019Eganville, car les terres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas m\u00eame arpent\u00e9es. Ne peut dire si, en laissant Bonnech\u00e8re avant son mariage, Wadsworth pensait \u00e0 se marier. Il vivait la plupart du temps \u00e0 son chantier et, au meilleur de ma connsissance, Wadsworth n\u2019a jamais v\u00e9cu dans Hull.\nSusan Turner, Mde McMullin, donne une d\u00e9position presque semblable \u00e0 celle de Ooyne; mais quel poids peut avoir son t\u00e9moignage quand elle parle de faits qui ge sont pass\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019avait encore que six ans. Ce t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est qu\u2019une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de choses qu\u2019elle a entendu dire, et non pas de faits qui se sont pass\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance. Elle admet n\u2019\u00eatre pas all\u00e9e \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec en 1828, bien qu\u2019elle pense que Wadsworth pensionnait \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Elle ne peut dire combien de temps avant son mariage elle a connu Wadsworth. Mais cependant elle pense que lorsqu\u2019il a laiss\u00e9 Bonnech\u00e8re en 182 il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment l\u2019intention d\u2019y revenir pour en faire sa demeure Elle dit qu\u2019il n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 les affaires qu\u2019en 1830, et s\u2019accorde \u00e0 dire avec Coyne qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas et ne pouvait avoir de titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait m\u00eame pas de limites \u00e0 bois dans ce temps-l\u00e0, mais elle a entendu dire qu\u2019avant son mariage il vivait avec ses hommes dans son chantier. Elle dit que Wadsworth n\u2019a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 \u00e0 Hull que peu de temps apr\u00e8s son mariage, et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il e\u00fbt achet\u00e9 une propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est \u00e0 la chaipente d\u2019une maison \u00e0 peine commenc\u00e9e que Wadsworth avait achet\u00e9e d\u2019un nomm\u00e9 Boulanger qu\u2019elle fait allusion.\nEn appr\u00e9ciant ces t\u00e9moignages d\u2019apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles trac\u00e9es par le Code civil qui, sous ce rapport, n\u2019a pas d\u00e9rog\u00e9 non plus \u00e0 l\u2019ancien droit fran\u00e7ais, il faut en rejeter une partie importante comme ill\u00e9gale.\nApr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9fini le domicile par l\u2019article 79, et d\u00e9\u2018 clar\u00e9 par l\u2019article 80 que le changement s\u2019en op\u00e8re par le fait d\u2019une habitation r\u00e9elle dans un autre lieu, joint \u00e0 l\u2019intention d\u2019y fixer son principal \u00e9tablissement, le code d\u00e9clare dans l\u2019article 81 que \u201cla preuve de l\u2019intention r\u00e9sulte des d\u00e9clarations de la personne et des circonstances.\u201d L\u2019intention de fixer son domicile d\u2019une mani\u00e8re permanente peut donc \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e de deux mani\u00e8res, premi\u00e8rement par des d\u00e9clarations; deuxi\u00e8mement, par les circonstances d\u2019o\u00f9 r\u00e9sultent cette intention; mais pour constituer le domicile il faut la r\u00e9union des deux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019habitation de fait dans un certain endroit, jointe \u00e0 l\u2019intention d\u2019en faire sa r\u00e9sidence permanente.\nNotre code n\u2019a pas comme l\u2019article 104 du code Napol\u00e9on indiqu\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re ni l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 doivent se faire les d\u00e9clarations d\u2019intention, mais il n\u2019en est pas moins \u2019 certain qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre faites par \u00e9crit pour \u00eatre re\u00e7ues en preuve. En admettre la preuve testimoniale ce serait violer l\u2019article 1223. Les d\u00e9clarations dont il est question dans cet article ne sont \u00e9videmment autres que celles faites incidemment dans des actes judiciaires et extra-judiciaire, dans des actes de l\u2019\u00e9tat civil, dans des actes notari\u00e9s et m\u00eame des actes sous seing priv\u00e9. La pratique en France, dit Phillimore, Domicile ([36]), est de faire preuve des d\u00e9clarations de domicile par la production d\u2019actes. On peut s\u2019assurer de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de cette assertion en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux arr\u00eats rendus sur des question de domicile en France; ces d\u00e9clarations sont toujours prouv\u00e9es par des actes \u00e9crits \u00e9manant de la partie dont il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer le domicile, ou contredites par d\u2019autres d\u00e9clarations en sens contraires. Aussi dans aucun des rapports ne trouve-t-on d\u2019allusions \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale de d\u00e9clarations de domicile.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, laipartie du t\u00e9moignage qui se rapporte \u00e0 des conversations avec Wadsworth par lesquelles on pr\u00e9tend prouver des d\u00e9clarations de domicile \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s suivantes, on ne peut prendre de ces t\u00e9moignages que la partie concernant le fait pur et simple de la r\u00e9sidence sans aucune qualification, soit par les paroles m\u00eames de Wadsworth, soit par ce que les t\u00e9moins disent avoir compris de lui au sujet de sa r\u00e9sidence.\nLaurent ([37]).\nNo 431. Les faits ne se pr\u00e9sentent pas toujours dans la simplicit\u00e9 que la.th\u00e9orie suppose. Il arrive souvent qu\u2019un seul et m\u00eame fait comprend des \u00e9l\u00e9ments complexes, l\u2019un mat\u00e9riel, l\u2019autre juridique. Dans ce cas, on ne peut pas proc\u00e9der d\u2019une mani\u00e8re absolue et dire que la preuve testimoniale est admissible \u00e0 iaison du fait mat\u00e9riel \u00e0 prouver ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas admissible \u00e0 raison du fait juridique qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9tablir. Les divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019un fait ne forment pas un tout indivisible; il faut donc les s\u00e9parer, en appliquant \u00e0 chacun les principles qui r\u00e9gissent les faits selon qu\u2019ils sont juridiques ou purs et simples, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire \u00e0 prouver par t\u00e9moins l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment mat\u00e9riel du fait et prouver par \u00e9crit, dans le sens de l\u2019art. 1341, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment juridique.\nL\u2019autorit\u00e9 suivante de Dalloz contient la m\u00eame doctrine ([38]),\nMais si le fait pur et simple dont on demande \u00e0 faire la preuve se rattache \u00e0 un fait juridique qui d\u00e9termine la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue du droit r\u00e9clam\u00e9, ce fait juridique ne peut \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 par t\u00e9moins. Ainsi, celui qui pr\u00e9tend poss\u00e9der \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, ou poss\u00e9der pour autrui \u00e0 titre de fermier, peut bien \u00e0 Faide de la preuve testi. moniale, \u00e9tablir les faits mat\u00e9riels de sa possession j mais il ne peut invoquer ce moyen de preuve pour d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re juridique de cette possession.\nLa derni\u00e8re partie de cette autorit\u00e9 est d\u2019autant plus applicable, que comme le fait remarquer Duranton ([39]), l\u2019on compare le domicile avec la possession avec laquelle il a en effet quelque rapport; il se conserve comme elle par la seule intention II r\u00e9sulte de ces autorit\u00e9s que l\u2019Appelante pouvait bien prouver les faits mat\u00e9riels de r\u00e9sidence par la preuve testimoniale, mais elle ne pouvait avoir recours \u00e0 cette preuve pour d\u00e9terminer le caract\u00e8re juridique de cette r\u00e9sidence dont la cons\u00e9quence, en compl\u00e9tant la preuve du domicile, serait de d\u00e9truire l\u2019existence du contrat de communaut\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par les Intim\u00e9s. Le fait pur et simple de r\u00e9sidence pouvait donc \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 par t\u00e9moins, les d\u00e9clarations de Wadsworth, rapport\u00e9es par ces t\u00e9moins ne pouvaient pas l\u2019\u00eatre. Quant \u00e0 ces d\u00e9clarations, l\u2019Appelante devait en faire la preuve r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement soit en se procurant un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, soit en produisant des d\u00e9clarations suivant l\u2019art. 81.\nL\u2019on comprend facilement l\u2019importance de la question d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve dans ce cas. Si elle \u00e9tait re\u00e7ue contrairement aux dispositions de la loi le domicile de Wadsworth se trouverait \u00e9tabli \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re et la cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9vitable serait d\u2019enlever aux Intim\u00e9s l\u2019h\u00e9ritage de leur m\u00e8re pour le faire passer en mains \u00e9trang\u00e8res. On voit de suite la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 la rigueur des principes de notre droit et de ne pas aller chercher ailleurs des r\u00e8gles diff\u00e9rentes qui pourraient conduire \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat aussi d\u00e9sastreux\nIl faut donc en vertu des autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es plus haut rejeter comme ill\u00e9gales les parties ci-apr\u00e8s cit\u00e9es des t\u00e9moignages; ainsi que toutes les autres qui sont en contradiction avec le principe qui y est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9. Je ne citerai que les extraits suivants comme exemple des parties de t\u00e9moignages qui doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es.\nMather:\u2014\nI understood from himself, both before and after his marriage, that his home\u2014to wit, the home of the late James Wadsworth\u2014was on the Bonnech\u00e8re until he moved on to a farm in the township of Hull, near the line of Eardley.\nAs near as I can remember, the first time I was in Eganville was in the year eighteen hundred and twenty-five.\nQ.\u2014Have you a certain recollection of Mr. Wadsworth\u2019s whereabouts prior to eighteen hundred and twenty-nine?\nA\u2014I am sure, as far as hs told me, that he made the Bonnech\u00e8re his home when I first knew him.\nJohn McMullen: \u2014\nI understood from him that he had been, living there with his wife from the winter of eighteen hundred and twenty-eight. About the year fifty-four (1854) (they had returned to Hull in 1836) the late Mrs. Wadsworth got me to show her the foundation of the old house, and she then said her husband came there to live after her marriage.\nJohn Wadsworth:\u2014\nI understood, both from James and from his first wife, that they came to the Bonnechere on the first sleighing after their marriage.\nWilliam Wadsworth:\u2014\nIf I remember right my brother told me that it was during ihe winter previous to my arrival in the country that Mr. Wadsworth went up the Bonnechere to live.\nJohn Coyne et S. McMullen:\u2014\n24. Do you know whether when he left for Quebec before his marriage he intended to return to the place he had been at before? \u2014A. J. Q. J. W\u2019s intention was, I think, to return to the Bonnechere after his marriage. S. McM. Most decidedly he came back to make it his home.\n25. What circumstances do you remember showing that the said J. Wadsworth intended to return from Quebec? A. J. Q. I do not remember. S. McMullen, I don\u2019t know except to lumber.\nIl en est autrement pour la preuve de la r\u00e9sidence; comme elle est un fait mat\u00e9riel, elle peut se prouver par t\u00e9moins; mais s\u2019il s\u2019y m\u00eale un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment, comme par exemple dans le cas actuel, les d\u00e9clarations ci-haut cit\u00e9es\u2014ces d\u00e9clarations qui ne sont pas des faits mat\u00e9riels, ne peuvent \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es par t\u00e9moins, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus cit\u00e9es.\nLe t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019Appelante ainsi d\u00e9gag\u00e9 de sa partie ill\u00e9gale se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le fait pur et simple de r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re, sans aucune preuve l\u00e9gale d\u2019intention de la part de Wadsworth d\u2019en faire sa r\u00e9sidence. Il n\u2019y a pas non plus de preuve l\u00e9gale qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire d\u2019immeubles \u00e0 cet endroit; et il est de fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais eu de titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014car ce fait ne pouvait \u00eatre l\u00e9galement \u00e9tabli que par la production d\u2019un titre, et il n\u2019en a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit aucun. Bien que la preuve du fait pur et simple d\u2019occupation p\u00fbt \u00eatre faite par t\u00e9moins, celle de l\u2019existence d\u2019un titre, duquel on voulait tirer une cons\u00e9quence l\u00e9gale importante, comme celle de la preuve de l\u2019intention, ne pouvait l\u2019\u00eatre que par la production du titre lui-m\u00eame. Lorsque Wadsworth, comme le disent certains t\u00e9moins, a vendu, \u00e0 Egan, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9frich\u00e9e, il ne pouvait alors c\u00e9der que les am\u00e9liorations qu\u2019il avait faites sur un sol qui ne lui appartenait pas. S\u2019il y a un acte de cette vente, ce qui n\u2019est pas prouv\u00e9, cet acte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit, sans doute parce que cette vente aurait d\u00e9truit toute pr\u00e9somption de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 chez Wads worth en taisant voir qu\u2019il n\u2019avait vendu que ses am\u00e9liorations et non le sol. Les lois alors en force dans le Haut-Canada ne permettait pas d\u2019occuper les terres publiques sans une autorisation \u00e0 cet effet. Son ocupation \u00e9tait cons\u00e9quemment ill\u00e9gale C\u2019est un principe consacr\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc de la Reine que \u201cLa simple occupation ou possession naturelle, comme celle d\u2019un squatter, sans aucun titre quelconque, ne suppose aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ([40]). Cette occupation sans titre d\u00e9montre au contraire le fait que la r\u00e9sidence n\u2019\u00e9tait que temporaire, puisqu\u2019\u00e8lle ne d\u00e9pendait que de la volont\u00e9 non de Wadsworth, mais de celle du propri\u00e9taire du sol qui pouvait l\u2019en expulser \u00e0 volont\u00e9. Une telle occupation \u00e9tant absolument incompatible avec l\u2019intention d\u2019une r\u00e9sidence permanente, elle ne peut jamais servir \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un domicile.\nL\u2019existence du titre m\u00eame ne suffirait pas pour \u00e9tablir la preuve de l\u2019intention, mais ce serait une circonstance qui pourrait la faire pr\u00e9sumer, mais cette circonstance n\u2019est pas prouv\u00e9e l\u00e9galement. C\u2019est en s\u2019appuyant sur une preuve ill\u00e9gale de d\u00e9clarations d\u2019intention de Wadsworth\u2014et aussi sur une preuve ill\u00e9gale d\u2019acquisition et de possession de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s que quelques-uns des juges se sont appuy\u00e9s pour en conclure que Wadsworth avait son domicile \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re Tandis qu\u2019en faisant abstraction de cette preuve ill\u00e9gale, il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas plus prouv\u00e9 que Wadsworth avait un domicile \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est mari\u00e9, qu\u2019il n\u2019est prouv\u00e9 que lors de son mariage il avait l\u2019intention d\u2019y retourner pour y fixer sa demeure.\nC\u2019est un principe incontestable que pour \u00e9tablir un domicile il faut le concours du fait et de l\u2019intention, la r\u00e9sidence seule ne suffit pas. O\u00f9 est la preuve qu\u2019en se rendant \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re avec sa femme, Wadsworth\" avait alors l\u2019intention de s\u2019y \u00e9tablir d\u2019une mani\u00e8re permanente? Il n\u2019a jamais faii de d\u00e9claration d\u2019une telle intention. L\u2019art. 81 du code civil d\u00e9clare que la preuve de l\u2019intention r\u00e9sulte de la d\u00e9claration de la personne et des circonstances. La preuve des d\u00e9clarations de Wadsworth fait compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9faut et elle est essentielle pour la constitution d\u2019un domicile. La r\u00e9sidence sans la preuve d\u2019intention de s\u2019\u00e9tablir d\u2019une mani\u00e8re permanente ne suffit pas, le concours des deux est essentiel.\nLa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re, non accompagn\u00e9e de preuves de la d\u00e9claration d\u2019intention d\u2019y demeurer permanemment, n\u2019a pu constituer un dpmicile l\u00e9gal. Les observations de l\u2019honorable juge Monck, r\u00e9sumant les principaux faits de la vie de Wadsworth, d\u00e9montrent avec tant de force que son domicile \u00e9tait dans le Bas-Canada, que je me fais un devoir d\u2019en donner un assez long extrait:\nThe legal presumption is that a man who, as a squatter, resides in the woods, on a lot which has not even been surveyed, and in connection with his lumbering operations, whether for seven years, as in this case, or for any number of years, for that matter, has no permanent settlement in view; and when it is considered that after these seven years Wadsworth bought a farm in Hull and settled there; when it is further borne in mind that it was in Hull that he had left his wife after his marriage; that it was in Hull that when his wife joined him in the winter following to share his shanty in the woods, he left his step-daughter to be educated; that it was in Hull that he caused his children who died while he was in the woods to be buried j that it was in Hull that he sent his children to school; and that it was in Hull that he must have transacted any business which as a member of a civilised community he might have had to transact, the conclusion is irresistible that his real domicile after his marriage was in Hull, in Lower Canada, and not on the Bonnech\u00e8re River in Ontario.\nAu soutien de cette conclusion, il y a la preuve la plus forte et la plus compl\u00e8te que Ton puisse faire de l\u2019intention de l\u2019\u00e9tablir dans cette province par la d\u00e9claration contenue dans l\u2019acte de mariage au sujet duquel l\u2019honorable juge Tessier a fait les remarques suivantes que j\u2019approuve compl\u00e8tement:\u2014\nIl n\u2019y a pas, dit-il d\u2019acte plus solennel que l\u2019acte enregistr\u00e9 de la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du mariage en pr\u00e9sence de plusieurs t\u00e9moins. C\u2019est par-l\u00e0 que les \u00e9poux manifestent leur intention quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence de leur domicile et au r\u00e9gime des lois qu\u2019ils adoptent concernant le mariage pour eux et leurs enfants \u00e0 venir. Cela lie la femme, qui n\u2019a pas d\u2019autre domicile que celui du mari. (C.C. art. 83.)\nJ\u2019avoue qu\u2019il est difficile de fixer le domicile de gens qui n\u2019ont pas encore de r\u00e9sidence permanente, mais il faut choisir entre Qu\u00e9bec, Hull et la for\u00eat de Bonnech\u00e8re. Si vous dites que Bonnech\u00e8re \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de leur mariage leur domicile matrimonial, de facto et de animo, o\u00f9 est la preuve de cette intention: tout montre le contraire, ils signent un acte solennel pour d\u00e9clarer leur domicile \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec: o\u00f9 est l\u2019all\u00e9gation ou la preuve de l\u2019erreur?\nEn vertu de l\u2019article 65 de notre code, reproduisant la loi ancienne le fonctionnaire est tenu de constater et indiquer le domicile des \u00e9poux. Il l\u2019a fait. Omnia pr\u0153sumuntur rite et solemniter acta, donee probetur in contranum.\nJe r\u00e9f\u00e8re aussi, sans les citer, aux raisons donn\u00e9es par l\u2019honorable juge Monk pour d\u00e9montrer la force probante de l\u2019acte de mariage d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nPour diminuer l\u2019effet de la preuve irr\u00e9futable de l\u2019existence du domicile de Wadsworth \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019acte de mariage, on invoque la raison que le domicile du mariage est diff\u00e9rent du domicile r\u00e9el et on conc\u00e8de que Wadsworth pouvait y avoir un domicile suffisant pour y contracter mariage, puisque la validit\u00e9 de celui qu\u2019il y a contract\u00e9 n\u2019est nullement attaqu\u00e9e. Le code civil, article 63, fixe \u00e0 six mois l\u2019habitation continue dans un m\u00eame lieu pour y acqu\u00e9rir un domicile pour le mariage, Wadsworth qui, comme on l\u2019a vu ne passait \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re, dans la for\u00eat, que le temps qu\u2019il ne r\u00e9sidait pas \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 il faisait ses principales affaires, avait donc \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec une r\u00e9sidence de fait, un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels pour l\u2019acquisition d\u2019un domicile. Pour faire la preuve complete du domicile r\u00e9el \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec il ne manquait que celle de l\u2019intention d\u2019en faire sa r\u00e9sidence permanente. Cette preuve on la trouve dans l\u2019acte de mariage o\u00f9 il se d\u00e9clare domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec.\nCette d\u00e9claration est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale; elle ne comporte aucune restriction dans les termes, ni par les circonstances dans lesquelles se trouvaient alors Wadsworth. Comme l\u2019acte de mariage a la force probante de l\u2019acte authentique, la d\u00e9claration qu\u00efl contient ne peut \u00eatre contredite que par des preuves \u00e9crites de m\u00eame force. Des tiers pourraient en plaidant erreur \u00eatre admis \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale, mais l\u2019appelante repr\u00e9sentant comme l\u00e9gataire universelle Wadsworth qui a fait cette d\u00e9claration, n\u2019e peut pas plus qu\u2019il ne pourrait le faire lui-m\u00eame attaquer par aucune esp\u00e8ce de preuve cette d\u00e9claration Supposons par exemple que durant l\u2019existence de ce mariage Margaret Quigley eut poursuivi son mari en s\u00e9paration de biens et demand\u00e9 le partage de la communaut\u00e9,\u2014celui-ci aurait-il pu attaquer cette d\u00e9claration comme frauduleuse. Evidemment il ne lui aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 permis de plaider sa propre turpitude. Tout au plus aurait-il pu pendant les dix ans apr\u00e8s la date de cette d\u00e9claration, demander a \u00eatre relev\u00e9 pour cause d\u2019erreur, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pu \u00e9tablir que par des preuves \u00e9crites. L\u2019appelante qui le repr\u00e9sente \u00e0 titre universel ne peut pas le faire plus que lui-m\u00eame. Elle n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 la preuve d\u2019erreur, et l\u2019e\u00fbt-elle fait, l\u2019action \u00e9tant prescrite, c\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 en pure perte. L\u2019acte de mariage doit donc produire tous ses effets l\u00e9gaux, et il en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019ici le domicile r\u00e9el coincide, on peut dire avec le domicile matrimonial, et il n\u2019y a aucune objection l\u00e9gale \u00e0 cela. M\u00eame si Wadsworth qui habitait Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019avait jamais auparavant fait de d\u00e9claration au sujet de son domii\u00fce, rien ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait d\u2019en faire une par son acte de mariage qui aurait eu alors l\u2019effet de lui faire acqu\u00e9rir de suite un domicile r\u00e9el puisqu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019habitation de fait et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait; pas d\u2019autre domicile dans le pays ([41])\nD\u00e8s que la volont\u00e9 est marqu\u00e9e la nouvelle demeure, ne fut-elle que d\u2019un seul jour, \u00e9tablit le changement de domicile. C\u2019est ce que fait tr\u00e8s bien remarquer d\u2019Argentr\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 449 de la Coutume de Bretagne. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs ce que d\u00e9cident express\u00e9ment les lois 4 et 20 D. ad municipalem et l\u2019art. 103 du Code Civil.\nCress\u00e9 v. Baby ([42]).\nUne personne venant dans un endroit dans le Bas Canada avec l\u2019intention d\u2019y r\u00e9sider, acquiert un domicile imm\u00e9diatement $ et son intention peut \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e par ses actes subs\u00e9quents.\nDans tous les cas le fait du domicile, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, doit rester acquis aux intim\u00e9s d\u2019apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s suivantes:\nToullier No 372.\nLe fait doit toujours concourir avec l\u2019intention. La r\u00e9sidence la plus longue ne prouve rien, si elle n\u2019est accompagn\u00e9e de la volont\u00e9, tandis que si l\u2019intention est constante, elle op\u00e8re le changement avec la r\u00e9sidence la plus courte, pe fut-elle que d'un jour, car du moment que le fait concourt avec l\u2019intention, il forme ou change le domicile sans aucun d\u00e9lai.\nLa m\u00eame doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le conseil priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Hodgson v. Beauchesne ([43]).\nLaurent, vol. 2, n\u00b0 81.\n\u201cLes circonstances variant \u00e0 l\u2019infini et pouvant recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation diverse d\u2019apr\u00e8s les nuances qui les distinguent, l\u2019intention peut \u00eatre douteuse. Que faudra-t-il d\u00e9cider en ce cas? La r\u00e9ponse est tr\u00e8s sim\u00b0 pie. Le l\u00e9gislateur se contente de circonstances, mais \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019elles fassent conna\u00eetre l\u2019intention. Si elles laissent du doute, pour la seule raison qu\u2019il n\u2019y aura pas de manifestation de volont\u00e9, et partant pas de changement de domicile. C\u2019est l\u2019opinion de Pothier:\u2014\nLe changement de domicile, dit-il, devant \u00eatre justifi\u00e9, on est toujours, dans le doute, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir conserv\u00e9 le premier. A vrai dire il n\u2019y a pas de pr\u00e9somption, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de loi qui l\u2019\u00e9tablisse. L\u2019ancien domicile subsiste jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9, pour qu\u2019il soit chang\u00e9 il faut la preuve de l\u2019intention; si l\u2019intention n\u2019est pas prouv\u00e9e l\u2019ancien domicile est maintenu.\u201d Pour faire perdre aux intim\u00e9s le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du domicile \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec il faudrait avoir fait une preuve l\u00e9gale que ce domicile a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9, et il n\u2019y en a pas.\nJe ferai remarquer comme l\u2019a fait l\u2019honorable juge, Tessier qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que Wadsworth ait eu l\u2019intention de retourner en Irlande et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pu y conserver son domicile d\u2019origine. Il avait une excellente occasion de manifester ses sentiments \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, lors de son mariage avec Margaret Quigley qui \u00e9tait en route pour y retourner; \u00e0 son mariage il d\u00e9clare au contraire son domicile \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, et apr\u00e8s y \u00eatre rest\u00e9 quelque temps, il se rend avec elle \u00e0 Hull o\u00f9 elle demeurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis un an. Je citerai encore de l\u2019honorable juge les observations suivantes:\nIl se trouve une suite de circonstances qui \u00e9tablissent, \u00e0 part leur d\u00e9claration formelle dans l\u2019acte du mariage, que l\u2019intention des \u00e9poux \u00e9tait de faire leur domicile conjugal dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Ils r\u00e9sident quelque temps en la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, ensuite \u00e0 Hull dans la m\u00eame province, ils font baptiser et enterrer leurs enfants \u00e0 Hull, ils mettent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole les enfants survivants \u00e0vHull, ils y r\u00e9sident apr\u00e8s leur retour de la for\u00eat de Bonnech\u00e8re, ils y meurent tous deux. C\u2019est bien l\u00e0 le si\u00e8ge de leur association conjugale.\nCette conclusion a \u00e9t\u00e9 celle de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour, deux des honorables juges ont diff\u00e9r\u00e9 de la majorit\u00e9, pour le motif que si Wadsworth avait un domicile dans le pays, c\u2019\u00e9tait dans le Haut-Canada, et que si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0j c\u2019\u00e9tait en Irlande. On voit quelle incertitude, il y a dans leur esprit \u00e0 ce sujet; mais je crois avec la majorit\u00e9 de la cour que la seule preuve de d\u00e9claration d\u2019intention au sujet de son domicile faite par Wadsworth a \u00e9t\u00e9 celle contenue dans son certificat de mariage suivie de sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 Hull et de son retour \u00e0 cet endroit apr\u00e8s son s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re. La preuve de l\u2019Appelante ne me para\u00eet pas assez forte pour d\u00e9truire celle des intim\u00e9s et dans un cas o\u00f9 il y a de l\u2019incertitude comme dans celui-ci je crois que les pr\u00e9somptions du bien jug\u00e9 sont en faveur du jugement et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de motif suffisant pour le renverser.\nLa d\u00e9cision de cette cause ne reposant que sur la signification \u00e0 donner aux faits des diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9sidences de Wadsworth, je n\u2019ai pas cru qu\u2019il f\u00fbt n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux autorit\u00e9s, car les principes du droit sur ce sujet ne sont pas contest\u00e9s. J\u2019ai cru devoir m\u2019attacher plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 et l\u2019insuffisance de la preuve de l\u2019Appelante au point de vue de notre droit. Je crois avoir \u00e9tabli d\u2019une mani\u00e8re certaine que le seul fait sur lequel s\u2019appuie l\u2019Appelante pour \u00e9tablir un domicile \u00e0 Bonnech\u00e8re, n\u2019a aucun des caract\u00e8res l\u00e9gaux qui puissent permettre aux juges d\u2019en tirer la conclusion que Wadsworth avait l\u2019intention de s\u2019y fixer d\u2019une mani\u00e8re permanente.\nAppel renvoy\u00e9.\nHENRY J.\u2014Having had the privilege of seeing and considering the two judgments delivered in this case, both of which deal exhaustively with the matter in controversy, I consider it necessary to refer but generally to the legal question upon the conclusion of which the same is to be determined. The respondent claims to recover upon the allegation that there was a community of goods existing between the ancestor, James Wadsworth, and his first wife, Margaret Quigley (who had been previously married to a man named McMullen), during the time of their coverture. The proof of that position must be established or the respondent cannot recover. That community, it is claimed, arose from the alleged residence before the marriage of the parties at Quebec, which took place in September, 1828; and, in proof of which, a marriage certificate was produced in evidence in the terms stated in the two judgments before referred to. The law is clear and beyond all doubt in England and France, as well as in Quebec, that, by the domicile of birth, a personal status is acquired which remains until an actual change is made by which the personal status of another domicile is acquired, the onus of proving which is on the party alleging it; and it is equally clear law that, after a second or other domicile obtained is abandoned, the domicile of birth, suspended in the meantime, is revived and the legal distribution of property determined accordingly. These positions are clearly provided for in the civil code of Quebec, and admitted on all sides.\nThe domicile by birth of James Wadsworth was shown and admitted to have been in the county of Monaghan, in Ireland, where he was born.\nIf, then, during the coverture in question, he had not acquired a domicile in Quebec or in Upper Canada, his domicile of origin was in Ireland when he was married, and during his coverture with his first wife through whom the respondent claims.\nThe main and, I may say, the only, question to be decided is the legal adoption of a domicile at Quebec as claimed by the respondent. If that be not shown it is quite unimportant to consider whether or not he had adopted such a legal domicile in Upper Canada as would remove or suspend his status of domicile in Ireland. It is only necessary to consider his acts and operations in Upper Canada as evidence to affect the question of the adoption by him of a domicile in Quebec. In considering the latter question the legal distinction between domicile and residence must be closely observed.\nIn this case there was no marriage settlement, and the mutual rights of the husband and wife to each other\u2019s movables, whether possessed at the time of the marriage, or acquired afterwards, are determinable by the law of the husband\u2019s actual domicile at the time of the marriage, without reference to the law of the country where the marriage is celebrated or where the wife was domiciled before marriage; and it was therefore necessary to show the establishment by James Wadsworth of a civil domicile for all legal purposes at Quebec when his marriage with his first wife was celebrated. If not, there is nothing in the evidence that, during that coverture, he ever acquired any.\nResidence in a country is not even prim\u00e2 facie evidence of domicile when the nature of that residence either is inconsistent with, or rebuts the presumption of, the existence of an intention to reside there permanently (animo manendi).\nUp to the time of the marriage the evidence shows that he could not have been considered as having ever resided in Quebec. It is true he had gone there sometimes, not to reside in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but for a temporary purpose\u2014that of taking there and disposing of rafts of timber, for others or himself, and returning to the Bonnech\u00e8re as soon as that object was accomplished. It is shown that he had no place of residence at Quebec, but lived, while there, either on the rafts or in a boarding house. It is true that at first he was but a shanty man, so called, or, as called in the French language, voyageur, but his occupation, as such, differed materially from the great body of shanty men who had homes and residences in other places to which they returned during the interval of work in the woods Wadsworth had no home or residence other than that he occupied at the site where his labor was performed\u2014that was virtually his home; and it matters not whether it was a timber shanty or a castle, or whether it was his own or belonged to some one else for whom he was employed, but to which, when he left it, for the special purpose of taking down to Quebec and selling the rafts of timber he worked at in making, he always returned, The fact is well established by evidence and it was not at all necessary to show that he was the owner of movables or immovables. By the evidence, I think his residence there is shown as in contradistinction to the allegation of his residence at Quebec. In deciding this case I feel the responsibility of coming to a conclusion in opposition to that of my learned brethren from Quebec, but I feel it, at the same time, of importance that I am sustained by the views and decisions of the learned Chief Justice Dorion and those of the learned Judge Cross. Residence must be imputed, in the absence of any other, to be the place where a party is employed in the production of marketable commodities rather than to the place he visits solely to make sale of them, and in this case, if we leave out the consideration of his residence of origin, we have but a choice between the two. It must be borne in mind that I am not so much considering whether Wadsworth obtained or made a domicile in Upper Canada, but the question of his alleged residence m Quebec at and before his marriage.\nApart then from the certificate of his marriage, where is there a scintilla of proof of his residence at Quebec? Could a Quebec merchant who shipped annually to England cargoes of timber, and who spent some months there, either living on board his ships or at a boarding house for the purpose of making sale of them, be said to have his residence there? Or could the same be said of one of his clerks or other agent, that he sent there for a like purpose? Could it be said of the clerk or other agent of a manufacturer in Ontario who was sent periodically to sell his employer\u2019s manufactured goods at Montreal or Quebec, and in doing so remained at each time, it might be for months, till the special object of his mission was obtained, and then returned each time to his occupation at the manufactory, be considered for a moment as having a legal residence at either of those last named cities? And in such a case would it be necessary to inquire whether he lived in a house of his own or elsewhere, or whether or not he was the owner of goods movable or immovable? Such, then, is the character of the alleged residence before and at the time of the first marriage of James Wadsworth. Where then is there in the facts shown any actual residence in any way affecting the question of his domicile? And if none, the point ol intention is unnecessary to be considered.\nI think I have made it sufficiently clear that Wadsworth had no residence in Quebec; but admitting for argument\u2019s sake that he had, where is the evidence of that other essential, his intention to make there his permanent residence? It is truly said that under the law in Lower Canada a person coming there with the intention of residing acquires a domicile immediately, and that his intention can be proved by his subsequent acts. That doctrine, however, applies with equal force to his residence at the Bonnech\u00e8re where his acts, after his first going and working there, in farming and other operations, would go to show that he fully intended from the first to make that his permanent residence, constituting as it did the place where he derived the means of living and the accumulation of property, and having at Quebec only the market where he realized money from the sale of what, by his industry and labor, he from time to time produced Article 79 provides that, \u201cthe domicile of a person for all civil purposes is at the place where he has his principal establishment.\u201d It is clearly shown that Wadsworth had no establishment whatever at Quebec. It is said that before losing his domicile at Quebec there should have been legal proof that his domicile had been changed. Such no doubt would be the case if the domicile had been shown there. One of the learned judges of the court below remarks upon the absence of proof that Wadsworth had had any intention of returning to Ireland and that he desired to preserve there his domicile of origin, and says that he had an excellent opportunity of manifesting his sentiments in that regard when his marriage to Margaret Quigley, who had come to Quebec on that occasion en route to return there, took place. No doubt before she consented to become the wife of Wadsworth she so intended. She was then a widow, having recently lost her husband, and intended, no doubt, under the circumstances to return to her native country, but for apparent reasons changed her mind. It is, however, unnecessary to speculate in reference to this matter, for it is the law that operates to continue the domicile and not the intention of the party. Allegiance to a British sovereign it is claimed cannot be changed to another by the act of the party, but domicile can be; but the status of domicile by birth is as tenacious as a man\u2019s allegiance until by his own act he changes or suspends it. The same learned judge gives great weight to the proof of marriage by the register, and he says that it is by that act that the married parties manifest their intention as to the existence of their domicile, and adds that they signed a solemn act (meaning the marriage register) to declare their domicile at Quebec and asks: \u201cWhere is the allegation or the proof of error?\u201d The register, however, is but a certificate of marriage in the usual form. It calls James Wadsworth \u201cjournalier de cette ville\u201d and so it might properly do even had he been born and had his domicile in Upper Canada. To prove such domicile would not contradict the register. Evidence of a party\u2019s domicile outside that register is not only admissible but is generally required. It is well settled by French as well as English law that a residence or domicile for the purpose of marriage is not necessarily a domicile affecting in any way the other civil rights of the parties. The law required a six months\u2019 residence to authorize a marriage, but in no way affected the permanent domicile of the husband. Domicile is not at all in question at marriage. Article 132 enacts that \u201cif the last domicile is out of Lower Canada the cur\u00e9 is bound to ascertain that there is no legal impediment between the parties\u201d and it is a significant fact that the register in this case contains a statement that the cur\u00e9 ascertained that no such impediment existed; which statement would be unnecessary if the cur\u00e9 had not considered that Wadsworth\u2019s domicile was out of Lower Canada. In view of that provision of the code, how can it be legitimately contended oj adjudged that, as regards domicile, there was any intention on the part of those who framed, or the legislature that adopted it, that it was to be taken even as prima facie, not to say conclusive, evidence, and still we are asked to receive it as conclusive on the point. From the statement in question we are fully as much bound to decide that the domicile in question was out of, as to conclude from any other part of it thac it was within, Lower Canada. The establishment of that status must therefore be shown by evidence of extrinsic matters.\nIt is quite true there is no proof of error for none has been suggested as to the register, but the legal effect of it is quite another matter. It was, and must be, admitted, that the register is proof of what it alleges but not of inferences to be drawn, and while the fact of residence at the time which is shown by it cannot be contradicted by oral evidence, it is not inconsistent with that statement, that such residence was but temporary; and that there was wanting the existence of the necessary intention of making it (Quebec) the seat of his permanent residence. The change must be animo et facto. In addition to the fact of residence there must also be shown the animus \u2014 the intention to change the domicile and acquire a new one. It would, I submit with all due deference, be an unwarranted deduction from the mere fact of a residence enabling a party to be married if we decreed an intention to renounce thereby, his domicile of origin and adopt another at the place where the marriage happens to be celebrated. W ould it not be monstrous to decide that an Englishman\u2014a titled nobleman if you will\u2014who resided temporarily at Quebec for pleasure or business, and got married there, had thereby forfeited his domicile of origin and voluntarily changed it to one in Quebec? I can find nothing to justify or warrant such a contusion and assumption, and such was virtually the position of Wadsworth at the time of his marriage. We need not inquire what position as to domicile Wadsworth occupied at the Bonnech\u00e8re before his marriage. It is enough for us to know that his visits to Quebec were but transient and for special purposes, and not only independent of the question of domicile there, but under circumstances negativing the allegation of it.\nWe need not consider whether Wadsworth abandoned his domicile of origin and adopted one in Upper Canada, as a decision of that question is unnecessary under the issue before us.\nThere is, however, one legitimate consideration in regard to the position of those engaged in lumbering about the time Wadsworth first went to the Bonnech\u00e8re, which distinguishes it from that of many and, at this day, the majority, of the places where lumbering has been and is carried on. The river Bonnech\u00e8re falls into the Ottawa river, and at Eganville Wadsworth first operated and afterwards settled. The land was good and favorably situated for agricultural purposes, and access to it was comparatively easy. Timber limits had been granted, but the title to the soil remained in the crown. The matter of the improvements and cultivation made by what are known as squatters was considered when patents were subsequently issued, so that those who lived and settled upon the lands were not considered as trespassers; and, although not vested as to the possession by any act of the crown, they had a possession which the law respected against all others without title. In that way large portions of the country became improved and settled, and patents in the majority of cases followed to the parties in possession, and surveys were made to cover such possessions. A great many, therefore, who, during the winter months, worked in the woods at other parts of the year, were employed in the clearing, improving and cultivating of the land they settled on. Such was the course pursued by Wadsworth, and he, therefore, from the time of his marriage, had a residence and home, and was in the exclusive possession of land, which he continued to improve until he sold out for a considerable sum to Mr. Egan. His position was, therefore, very different from that of what is generally known as a mere shantyman. During the years he was employed in making timber he was employed in making himself a home, showing an intention of making there a civil domicile.\nArticle 81 of the Code provides that \u201cthe proof of the intention results from the declaration of the person and from circumstances.\u201d If, therefore, we were trying the question of the adoption of a new domicile by Wadsworth, I think his verbal declarations would be valid testimony, and if added to the other facts in evidence as to his living and working at the Bonnech\u00e8re, I think as between Upper Canada and Quebec a decision in favor of the former should necessarily result. I can find no express, or even implied, authority for rejecting such evidence. It is, of course, not so satisfactory or conclusive as declarations contained in deeds or other solemn legal documents, but I think such evidence cannot be excluded, and must, I think, be considered legitimate in the absence of any principle to the contrary. The Code makes no distinction between verbal and written declarations. I think, in view of the evidence and the law as to domicile, the respondent has failed to prove the civil domicile of James Wadsworth to have been at Quebec, upon which rested his right to recover, and that, therefore, the appeal herein should be allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014By representing to his wife, as he must be held to have done by the acte de marriage, that his domicile was at Quebec when he married, Wadsworth guaranteed to her, contracted with her in law, that she would be commune en biens with him. Now, could he have been admitted, in his lifetime, under any circumstances, in an action en s\u00e9paration de biens, for instance, to contend that this declaration as to his domicile was a false one, or, in other words, that he had induced his wife to marry him under false pretences or representations? Would he have been received so to invoke his own fraud in order to deprive his wife of her share of the community? Undoubtedly not. Well, who is the appellant here? Clearly, purely and simply, the representative of Wadsworth, the warrantor of his deeds, entitled to what he himself would have been entitled to, but to nothing more. How can she then invoke Wadsworth\u2019s fraud to deprive the respondents of their share of this community? And when she does do so, when she avails herself of Wadsworth\u2019s fraud, is she not then herself in the eyes of the law, committing a fraud? Without adding another word to my brother Fournier\u2019s judgment, in whose reasoning and conclusions I unreservedly agree, I would, with him, dismiss the appeal, and confirm the judgment of the two courts below. This is a very important case, not only for the parties thereto on account of the large amount involved, but also for the public at large. It involves an intricate question of international law, which, as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, may, hereafter, often arise in this country. We expect in the near future from the United Kingdom, and, in fact, from all Europe, a large immigration, and, evidently, eases like the present one must eventually with us become more frequent. But further than that, a principle of not less importance for the Province of Quebec is at stake, that is, whether the rules of the French law as to evidence are to govern such cases or not. For the appellants in the course of a most able and deliberate argument have failed to cite a single case from France in which it has been held that a different coutume than the one settled by the acte de marriage can be invoked to defeat a wife\u2019s claims or her heirs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The simple question which this case presents is: Had the deceased James Wadsworth at the time of his marriage in September, 1828, with Mrs. McMullen, his domicile in the then province of Lower Canada? That is to say, inasmuch as his domicile of origin appears to have been in Ireland, had he in September, 1828, abandoned that domicile and acquired a new one in the province of LowQr Canada by taking up his residence in that province, with the intent of establishing the seat of his principal establishment in that province permanently or for an indefinite period. The argument of the respondents that he had, seems to me to be based wholly upon the assumption that the marriage certificate subscribed by him at the city of Quebec, where he was married, in which he is described as journalier de cette ville, is a solemn act and declaration made by him with the intent of, and for the express purpose of, testifying that he had then, and thenceforth intended to have, his domicile in the city of Quebec, That the certificate was in point of fact subscribed by him with any such intent, there is not only not a particle of evidence, but his subsequent acts are inconsistent with his having then had such intention, and in point of law, apart from intention, it could not have the operation of substituting the city of Quebec as his domicile of choice in the place of his domicile of origin, which must remain until a new domicile has been acquired, in the acquisition of which intention is the essential element. The certificate is valueless as having no bearing at all 011 the question, unless it is adequate to establish that Wadsworth had acquired a domicile of choice in the city of Quebec. The descriptiotl journalier de cette ville, that is, the city of Quebec, could afford no evidence of Wadsworth having acquired a domicile in some place in the province of Lower Canada outside of the city of Quebec, and as the only means we have of judging of his intention of acquiring a domicile of choice in substitution for his domicile of origin consist in drawing inferences from the evidence which we have of his acts and conduct, we have in those acts and conduct the plainest evidence, in my opinion, that he had no idea of establishing his domicile in the city of Quebec. Whether he had established it in some other part of the province of Lower Canada at the time of his marriage in September, 1828, must be determined upon the evid ence of his acts and conduct, if we have any signifying his intention apart wholly from the marriage certificate, which for that purpose is valueless.\nThe first that we hear of him after his leaving Ireland in or about the year 1822, is that in 1826 we find him to be engaged in lumbering operations in Upper Canada with two persons named Kelly and McMullen then associated together in getting out lumber on the Bonnech\u00e8re river. McMullen came to his death in the woods in the spring of 1827. It would seem that in the winter of 1827-28 Wadsworth was engaged in getting out timber there on his own account, for two witnesses who knew him well then speak of his having gone to Quebec in 1828 on a raft of his own to dispose of it. Susan McMullen, a daughter of the deceased McMullen, and who came out with her mother in 1827 to join her father, and was in 1828 only about nine years of age, speaks of her mother having been interested in the raft which Wadsworth brought down lo Quebec in that year; but whether she was or not, or whether it was Wadsworth\u2019s own, matters not, for the evidence shows that his sole object in going down to Quebec then was to sell the raft. While in Quebec he lived part of the time on the raft, probably until it was sold, and part of his time at a boarding house where men of his class boarded, and where in the month of August he met Mrs. McMullen, the widow of McMullen, deceased, on her way back to Ireland, from whence she had come in 1827 to join her husband, who, however, came to his death in the woods shortly before her arrival. While boarding at the house where Wadsworth met the widow he was married to her in September, 1828, and shortly after his marriage he returned to the Bonnech\u00e8re to carry on lumbering operations there as formerly, and he took his wife and her daughter with him; them he left in the neighborhood of Aylmer, on the river Ottawa, in Lower Canada, while he went on to his home on the Bonnech\u00e8re. That his object in leaving his wife there was for a temporary purpose only appears from the fact that when the sleighing became good in the winter he came down for her and brought her up to his home on the Bonnech\u00e8re, and continuously from that time for at least 10 or 12 years she lived with him in Upper Canada, where he continued to carry on lumbering and farming and other business, from which he acquired considerable wealth. In the spring of 1829 he bought the right of one Baker to a house and a lot of 200 acres\u2014a squatter\u2019s right, perhaps but in Upper Canada those rights were always respected by the Government,\u2014and he moved into the house, added to it, cultivated the land, resided there with his wife until 1836, when he sold the place to a Mr. Egan. But although he sold that place he does not appear to have then left Upper Canada, for the evidence is that he lived there continuously for ten or twelve years after his marriage, and that all his children were born there. He did subsequently, but when does not appear, move across the river Ottawa to the township of Hull, for the purpose of being nearer a married sister, who was then living there. How long he remained there does not precisely appear, but after staying there for some years he returned to Upper Canada and resided for many years in By town, afterwards the city of Ottawa, where he owned considerable real estate and other property. While living there his wife died in 1872. In 1873 he married again in Ottawa, and afterwards moved across the river to Hull, but whether or not with the intention of acquiring a domicile there then does not appear, but whether he had or not such intention then is not important.\nThe circumstance of two of his daughters having been baptised at Aylmer, in Lower Canada, was relied upon as an item of evidence having, as was contended, the tendency to show that Wadsworth\u2019s intention ever since his marriage was to make his domicile in Lower Canada, but the account of the circumstance under which this took place shows the utter insufficiency of such evidence for the purpose for which it was relied upon. The baptismal ceremony took place in May, 1846, and under the following circumstances as Susan McMullen testifies. Mr. Wadsworth, she says: \u2014\nHad strong objections to the children being brought up Catholics, and they had to attend the Catholic church by stealth, as it were, so strong were his prejudices; the children were afraid they had never been baptised and consequently took advantage of their father\u2019s absence to be baptised in Aylmer. They might have been baptised by their mother before that, but not by any one keeping a register.\nThe circumstance also of a child of the marriage which was born in 1829 and which lived only for 14 months having been brought to Aylmer to be buried was relied upon for the like purpose, but the evidence shows that at that early period there was not, where Wadsworth resided in Upper Canada or in the neighborhood or nearer than Aylmer, any church or burial place, or priest or minister of any denomination, so that it is not strange that a person although domiciled in Upper Canada should have brought the dead body of his child to Aylmer as the nearest place where it could get a Christian burial. Now the sole question being whether Wadsworth at the time of his marriage in 1828 had acquired a domicile in the Province of Lower Canada, the only inference which can be drawn from the evidence, in my opinion, is that he had not, and that his domicile of origin still remained unless he had acquired a domicile of choice in Upper Canada, but that he had acquired such a domicile is, I think, the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence. It is, however, sufficient for the purposes of the present case to say that he had not acquired a domicile in Lower Canada.\nThe appeal therefore must be allowed with costs and the plaintiff\u2019s action in the Superior Court dismissed with costs. Appeal allowed with costs.*\nSolicitor for appellant : J. R. Fleming.\nSolicitors for respondent : Barnard and Barnard.\n[1] 2 M. L. R. Q.

Q\u2014Erection of a school house\u2014Decision of superintendent\u2014Mandamus.\nUnder 40 Vic. ch. 22 sec. 11 the Superintendent of Education for the province of Quebec, on an appeal to him from the decision of the School Commissioners of St. Valentin, ordered that the school district of the municipality of St. Valentin should be divided into two districts with a school house in each.\nThe School Commissioners by resolution subsequently decreed the division, and a few days later on a petition presented by rate payers protesting against the division, they passed another resolution refusing to entertain the petition. Later on, without having taken any steps to put into execution the decision of the Superintendent, they passed another resolution declaring that the district should not be divided as ordered by the Superintendent but should be re-united into one.\nIn answer to a peremptory writ of mandamus granted by the Superior Court ordering the School Commissioners to put into execution the decision of the Superintendent of Education, the School Commissioners (respondents) contended that they had acted on the decision by approving of it, and that as the law stood they had power and authority to re-unite the two districts on the petition of a majority of the ratepayers, and that their last resolution was valid until set aside by an appeal to the Superintendent.\nHeld reversing the judgment of the court below, that the Commissioners having acted under the authority conferred upon them by Cons. Stats. L. C. ch. 15 stas; 31 and 33, and an appeal having been made to the Superintendent of Education, his decision in the matter was final (40 Vic. oh. 22 sec. 11, P.Q.), and could only be modified by the Superintendent himself On an application made to him under 33 Vie. ch. 25 sec. 7; and. therefore that the peremptory mandamus ordering the respondents to execute the Superintendent decision should issue. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the province of Quebec (appeal side), rendered at Montreal on the 27th day of May, 1884, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court ordering the issue of a \u2014 peremptory writ of mandamus.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully stated in the judgments hereinafter given\nTrudel Q.C. for appellants contended .\n1. That section 11, oh. 22, 40 Vic, gave the Superintendent of Public Instruction absolute power to decide upon the matters which gave rise to this cause and that his decision is final.\n2. That the Superintendent, after mature consideration of the matter in question, gave a decision according to justice and equity and gave clear and precise orders which were never complied with.\n3. That the appellants were entitled to the full and entire execution of the decision of the Superintendent and the issuing of a writ of mandamus was the proper mode and only proceeding which could legally be resorted to to force the school commissioners to execute the decision of the Superintendent; 4. That the decision of Mr. Justice Chignon ordering the issuing of said writ was according to law; 5. That said mandamus was the only proper remedy to be employed.\nGeoffrion Q. C. and Beaudin for respondents contended that the decision of the Superintendent had been complied with and that the commissioners had a perfect right afterwards in the interest of the entire district to reunite the divided parts, reconstituting the old district, and they referred to sees. 7, 31, 33 and 64 of ch. 15 of Cons. Stats., L. C, and sees. 10 11 13, 40, 54 of 40 Vic, oh. 22, P. Q.\nThey also contended that the proper remedy for the appellants was not by mandamus citing Tapping on mandamus ([1]). Sir \"W. J. Ritchie . J. I think the school com missioners did. not carry out the decision of the Superintendent of Education as they should have done, but on the contrary have attempted to evade doing so in an unjustifiable manner.\nI think the appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIET J \u2014 La contestation entre les \"parties en cette cause origine d'une diff\u00e9rence d'opinion entre les contribuables de l'arrondissement No. 2 de la municipalit\u00e9 scolaire de la paroisse de St. Valentin, sur l'opportunit\u00e9 de faire une nouvelle division de cet arrondissement demand\u00e9e par certains d'entr'eux aux commissaires d'\u00e9cole, intim\u00e9s, qui, par leur r\u00e9solution en date du 2 mai 1882 refus\u00e8rent cette demande. Par une autre r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 la m\u00eame s\u00e9ance ils retranch\u00e8rent cependant une partie do cet arrondissement connue sous le nom de \" Le Petit rang.\"\nLa section 11 du ch. 22 de 40 Vie. accordant un appel de cette d\u00e9cision des commissaires an Surintendant le l'instruction publique, les requ\u00e9rants dont la demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e adopt\u00e8rent les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s indiqu\u00e9s par la loi pour appeler de la d\u00e9cision rendue contre eux Sur cet appel le surintendant rendit le 17 mai une d\u00e9cision dont le dispositif est en ces termes :\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je maintiens la requ\u00eate des dits requ\u00e9rants, j'an nulle et mets do c\u00f4t\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution des dits commissaires du deux Mai dernier au sujet de la division du dit arrondissement No. 2, j'ordonne quo le dit arrondissement No. 2 soit divis\u00e9 et ii est par le pr\u00e9sent divis\u00e9 en deux parties \u00e9gales la premi\u00e8re partie sera connue sous le nom d'arrondissement No. 2, et la deuxi\u00e8me partie sous celui d'arrondissement No 21\/2 , et qu'il soit construit, suivant la loi et les refinements une maison d'\u00e9cole dans chacun des dits arrondissements crue Jean-Baptiste Bornais, Pierre veloutier, Achille \"Boivin et Olivier Bisaille soient annex\u00e9s an dit arrondissement No. 2, et j'ordonne do plus quo chacune des dites maisons d'\u00e9cole qui sera construite dans chacun des dits arrondissements \u00e0 la diligence et sous l'autorit\u00e9 des dits commissaries sera fix\u00e9e et \u00e9rig\u00e9e dans le centre de chacun des dits arrondissements, eu \u00e9gard aux distances et au chiffre do Ia population.\nPour se conformer \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision les intim\u00e9s adopt\u00e8rent le 5 l\u00e9vrier 1883 une r\u00e9solution divisant I'arron dissement No. 2 en deux autres, designs par les Nos. 2 et 21\/2\u2014 Tout en reconnaissant qu'il \u00e9tait de leur devoir de se soumettre \u00e0 cette sentence, ils exprimaient leur opinion one cette division \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 nuire \u00e0 l'instruction en d\u00e8truisant une de lour meilleures \u00e9coles. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9fini les limites des nouveaux arrondissements, les commissaires, ordonnent comme suit la construction de deux maisons d'\u00e9coles\nQuo le site de l'\u00e9cole du dit arrondissement No. 2 soit fix\u00e9 sur le coin ouest de Ia propri\u00e9t\u00e9 do Cr\u00e9m\u00e9e Boivin sur le chemin do Ia dite deuxi\u00e8me ligne, laquelle propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est d\u00e9sign\u00e9e au livre do renvoi officiel sons le num\u00e8ro 236; pourvu toutefois qu'il n'y alt pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 de b\u00e2tisses de construites sur le dit site. Dans ce cas un autre endroit pr\u00e8s do l\u00e0 devra \u00eatre choisi ;\nQu'une maison d'\u00e9cole soit construite d'apr\u00e8s les plans et devis do la maison d'\u00e9cole No. 1, si tels plans et devis sont approuv\u00e9s par le surintendant; sinon qu'il soit pri\u00e9 luim\u00eame d'avoir \u00e0 en fournir d'autres quo le Secr\u00e9taire-Tr\u00e9sorier soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 lui \u00e9crire \u00e0 cot effet afin que les travaux do la dite maison puissent so commencer le plus t\u00f4t possible. Agr\u00e9\u00e9 unanimement.\nLe 27 du m\u00eame mois une autre requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aux commissaires leur demandant de rescinder leur r\u00e9solution du 5 fut rejet\u00e9e pour les motifs suivants;\nQuo les commissaires ne doivent ni no peuvett prendre sur eux do changer leur r\u00e9solution du cinq f\u00e9vrier courant par laquelle ils ont divis\u00e9 l'arrondissement No doux tel qu'ordonn\u00e9 par la sentence de l'honorable Surintendant, en date du dix-sept mai huit cent quatre-vingt-deux.\nQuo c\u00e8pe dant les dits commissaires seraient heureux quo le dit honorable Sun tendant voulut bien faire droit \u00e0 la dite reou\u00eate et r\u00e9voquer la dite sentence, vu quo c'est la conviction des dits commissaires qu'un tel arrangement serait pour le plus grand avantage des contribuables et m\u00eame des opposants\nQu'en cons\u00e9quence, la dite requ\u00eate soit adress\u00e9e par le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier an dit honorable Surintendant, avec pri\u00e8re do vouloir bien la prendre on consid\u00e9ration ; Qu'\u00e0 l'avenir, aucune autre requ\u00eate concernant cette question no soit re\u00e7ue par les dits commissaires qui sont parfaitement d\u00e9cid\u00e9s \u00e0 se soumettre aux ordres de l'honorable Surintendant, qu'ils soient ou non favorables aux dits requ\u00e9rants.\nMais le 27 avril 1883, une requ\u00eate ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e aux appelants leur demandant de r\u00e9unir l'arrondissement No. 2 et No. 2 1\/2 ils firent droit \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate r\u00e9voquant virtuellement leur r\u00e9solution du 5 f\u00e9vrier 188.\nLa r\u00e9solution du 27 avril ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e au Surintendant, il r\u00e9pondit qu'il ne pouvait approuver le devis de la maison d'\u00e9cole qu'ils avaient l'intention de construire dans l'arrondissement No. 2 vu que par la ii approuverait leur r\u00e9solution du 27 avril dernier, ce qu'il n'avait pas le droit de faire. Il les pr\u00e9venait en m\u00eame temps que sur eux retomberait toute la responsabilit\u00e9 de cette procedure.\nLes appelants d\u00e9sirant se pr\u00e9valoir de la sentence du Surintendant et consid\u00e9rant comme absolument nuls tons les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s des commissaires tendant \u00e0 l'an\u00e9atir, demand\u00e8rent un bref de mandamus pour faire ordonner l'ex\u00e9cution de la dite sentence en date du 17 mai 1882, et faire ordonner conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 icelle la construction d'une maison d'\u00e9cole convenable dans l'arrondissement No. 2 tel que fourni par la r\u00e9cente sub-division, et \u00e0 ce que les r\u00e9solutions contraires \u00e0 la dite sentence soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es nulles. Les intim\u00e9s ont plaid\u00e9 par d\u00e9fense en droit que la requ\u00eate ne fait pas voir que le Surintendant avait le pouvoir de rendre la dite sentence (17 mai 1882), et que les r\u00e9solutions des 27 avril et 17 mai 1883 modifiant sa dite sentence n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es en appel, sont en force, et qu'il n'est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les requ\u00e9rants n'ont pas d'autre rem\u00e8de que le mandamus. La, d\u00e9fense an fonds r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es m\u00eames moyens dans une forme peu diff\u00e9rente.\nApr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition au m\u00e9rite, la Jour Sup\u00e9rieure a ordonn\u00e9e l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de mandamus. Ce jugement, porte en appel \u00e0 la Cour du Bane de la Reine, a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9. C'est do ce dernier jugement qu'il y a maintenant appel \u00e0 cette Cour.\nLa principale question soulev\u00e9e par cette contestation est de savoir si la r\u00e9solution du 2 mai 1882 pouvait former la base dun appel au surintendant, et si celui-ci avait juridiction pour r\u00e9viser un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de cette nature. Autant qu'on peut le voir par les all\u00e9gations de la requ\u00eate libell\u00e9e, la demande faite aux commissaires et servant de base \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du 2 mai 1882, est une demande n\u00e9gative. C'est plut\u00f4t une protestation contre le projet de diviser l'arrondissement No. 2, dont ii devait sans doute \u00eatre question. La requ\u00eate \u00e0 ce sujet n'\u00e9tant pas n'\u00e8tant on ne pes s'en faire une id\u00e9e que par le proc\u00e8s-qe pal de la s\u00e9ance daus laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e la r\u00e9solution du 2 mai 1882 qui constate que les commissaires prennent en consid\u00e9ration une requ\u00eate sign\u00e9e par 29 contribuables de l'arrondissement No. 2 demandant que leur \u00e9cole soit r\u00e9par\u00e9e, tel que d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par les commissaires \" et qu'aucun changement et division ne soient faites dans cet arrondissement.\" La requ\u00eate para\u00eet aussi avoir demand\u00e9 le renvoi \u00e0 leurs arrondissements respectifs des personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 annex\u00e9es \u00e0 cet arrondissement Ensuite la r\u00e9solution suivante est adopt\u00e9e :\nQu'aucun changement no soit fait dans ce qui rest\u00e9e du dit Aron dissement No. 2, et que les r\u00e9solutions d\u00e9j\u00e0 adopt\u00e9es quant aux r\u00e9parations a faire \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de cet arrondissement, soient mises \u00e0 effet.\nLes commissaires prennent aussi en consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 la m\u00eame s\u00e9ance la requ\u00eate de Jean-Baptiste Bornais l'un des appelants demandant \u00e0 \u00eatre annex\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arrondsssement No. 2 et la renvoie.\nCet expos\u00e9 des proc\u00e8des \u00e9tait certainement insuffisant pour faire voir qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 cette s\u00e9ance une d\u00e9cision susceptible d'\u00eatre reform\u00e9e par appel. Mais la preuve a suppl\u00e9e a ce d\u00e9faut par la production du proc\u00e8s-verbal entier de cette s\u00e9ance, lequel fait voir que ce jour-l\u00e0 une lettre du Surintendant de l'instruction publique avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 lue devant les commissaires, les autorisant \u00e0 changer les limites de l'arrondissement No 2, en en d\u00e9tachant le Pelit rang et engageant en temps les commissaires \u00e0 diviser le reste de l'arrondissement No. 2, et \u00e0 y fixer deux maisons d'\u00e9coles. La suggestion du Surintendant quant an retranchement du Petit rang fut adopt\u00e9e, mais la division du reste de l'arrondissement fut refus\u00e9e. De cette mani\u00e8re on volt que la r\u00e9solution ne se borne pas au maintien des limites de l'arrondissement No. 2, mais qu'il est aussi fait un changement important dans ses limites par le retranchement du Petit rang, en m\u00eame temps qu'elle constate le refus de diviser ce qui reste de cet arrondissement conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordre du Surintendant Cette d\u00e9cision est-elle applicable ?\nLa section 11 de l'acte 40 Vic. chap. 22 dit\nLorsque lemplacement d'un maison d'\u00e9cop\u00e9e est choisi par les commissaires ou syndics d'\u00e9coles, ou Qu'un changement est fait dans d'un arrondissement d'\u00e9cole, ou qu'un nouvel arrondissement est \u00e9tabli dans une municipalit\u00e9 scolaire, ou qu'un ou plusieurs arrondissements \u00e9tablis sont chang\u00e9s ou subdivis\u00e9s, ou lorsque les commissaires ou syndics d'\u00e9coles refusent ou n\u00e9gligent d'exercer ou remplir quelqu'une des attributions ou devoirs que leur conf\u00e8re cette section les contribuables int\u00e9ress\u00e9s pourront en. appeler en tout temps au Surintendant par requ\u00eate sommaire la sentence rendue par le Surintendant sara finale 5 et il pourra ordonner par cette sentence que les commissaires ou syndics d'\u00e9coles fassent ce qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e ou ce qu\u2019il leur ordonne d\u00e9faire ou s'abstiennent de le faire ou ne le fassent qu\u2019en tout ou en partie et aux conditions exig\u00e9es par la sentence.\nD'apr\u00e8s cette section, il est clair qu'un changement fait dans les limites d'un arrondissement donne le droit d'en appeler an Surintendant. Dans ce cas, un tel changement ayant en lieu par le retranchement du Petit range l'intervention du Surintendant \u00e8ait justifiable. Le refus de diviser le reste de l'arrondissement, sinisa que l'ordonnait le Surintendant, donnai \u00e9galement droit d'appeler de la d\u00e9cision des commissaires; car si les circonstances, exigeaient cette division dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019\u00e9ducation comme le d\u00e9clare le Surintendant le refus de le faire \u00e9tait une n\u00e9gligence et un refus de la part des commissaires de remplir une de leurs attributions, d'apr\u00e8s les termes de la susdite section et donn\u00e2t lieu d'appeler d'une d\u00e9cision refusant cette division. Pour ce refus de diviser, comme pour le changement fait par le retranchement du Petil range il v avait lieu \u00e0 appel et la sentence rendue \u00e0 ce sujet par le Surintendant est dans les limites de ses attributions.\nCette sentence ayant donn\u00e9 gain de cause aux appelants, ceux-ci se trouvaient avoir par cela m\u00eame acquis le droit de la faire ex\u00e9cuter Mais les commissaires, apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre soumis \u00e0 cette sentence et avoir rejet\u00e9 une requ\u00eate qui en demandait la modification comme on l'a vu par la r\u00e9solution ci-dessus cit\u00e9e, ne tard\u00e8rent pas \u00e0 adopter des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s qui en d\u00e9truisaient l'effet. L\u00e8s le 27 avril 1883, ils adressent une requ\u00eate demandant, contrairement \u00e0 la dite sentence la r\u00e9union des deux arrondissements No 2 et 21\/2 et d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent qu'une seule \u00e9cole, au lieu de deux, serait construite. Le 17 mai une r\u00e9solution fut adopt\u00e9e pour donner suite \u00e0 celle du 27 avril d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant Ia renon des arrondissements. Etait-il alors au pouvoir des commissaires d'exercer une juridiction quelconque au sujet des limites de ces arrondissements et d'en ordonner la r\u00e9union apr\u00e8s la sentence rendue par le Surintendant et aprss avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'lls s'v conformeraient. L'affirmative a \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenue par eux en se fondant sur les secs. 31 et 33 du ch. 15 Statuts Refondus B. 0. les deux sections sont en force et donnent certainement aux commissaires le droit d'\u00e9tablir des arrondissements d'\u00e9cole, d'en d\u00e9terminer les limites, de les changer \u00e0 leur discr\u00e9tion, de cr\u00e9er de nouveaux arrondissements de temps en temps suivant les besoins de la population; ainsi que le droit, quand ils le jugeront \u00e0 propos, d'unir deux ou plusieurs arrondissements, et de les s\u00e9parer de nouveau, en donnant avis de leur d\u00e9cision au Surintendant. Les commissaires ont incontestablement ce pouvoir et ils en ont fait un l\u00e9gitime exercice quand, pour se conformer \u00e0 la sentence du Surintendant ils ont fait Ia division qu\u2019il avait ordonn\u00e9e. Mais ce pouvoir une fois exerc\u00e9 devient sujet \u00e0 l'appel \u00e9tabli par la sec. 11, et ne peut plus apr\u00e8s cet appel \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 par les commissaires; ii tombe ensuite sous le contr\u00f4le exclusif du Surintendant. Sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tant finale, les commissaires doivent s'y soumettre et n'ont plus le pouvoir d'adopter aucune r\u00e9solution qui serait en contradiction avec sa sentence. C'est pour toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es chose juge Admettre la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s ce serait virtuellement abolir le droit d'appel qui ne serait plus qu'eue proc\u00e9d\u00e9e illusoire, si les commissaires pouvaient mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la sentence du Surintendant en adoptant une autre r\u00e9solution an m\u00eame effet que celle quel le Surintendant aurait rejet\u00e9e ou modifi\u00e9e. Los commissaires sont, dans ce cas, dans la m\u00eame position qu'un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur vis-\u00e0-vis d'une cour d'appel lorsque celle-ci est saisie du litige, le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance n'a plus de juridiction, et la d\u00e9cision du tribunal sup\u00e9rieur doit \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. Je consid\u00e8re comme absolument nulles les r\u00e9solutions des 27 avril et 17 mai 1883 ordonnant la r\u00e9union des deux arrondissements et ii n'v avait aucune n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'en faire le sujet Dun second appel comme le pr\u00e9tendent les intim\u00e9s Mais comme il peut \u00eatre utile suivant les circonstances, de faire modifier la sentence du Surintendant, la loi y a sagement pourvu par la sec. 7 du ch. 28, 33 Vie, en statuant que : Le Ministre de l'instruction publique ou le Surintendant de l'\u00e9ducation pour le temps d'alors, pourra, de temps \u00e0 autre, si on lui donne des raisons suffisantes, propres \u00e0 le satisfaire, changer, r\u00e9voqiier ou modifier toute d\u00e9cision par lui rendue sur appel de la decision des commissaires d'\u00e9coles ou syndics, en vertu du par. (8) huit de la soixante et-quatri\u00e8me section du chapitre quinze des Statuts Refondus du Bas-Canada.\nCette section qui donnait aussi un appel au Suintent dant a \u00e9t\u00e9 retranch\u00e9e et remplac\u00e9e par la section 11, du oh. 22 de 45 Vie cit\u00e9 plus haut. Ii est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s cette section que s'il devient avantageux de faire des modifications aux changements des limites d'arrondissements r\u00e9gl\u00e9es sur appel par une sentence du Surintendant, que ce n'est plus aux commissaires que l'on peut s'adresser, nonobstant les ses. 31 et 33 du oh. 15 mais au Surintendant qui par la dite sec. 7 est soul investi do ce pouvoir. Ceci d\u00e9montre \u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence qu'il ne pouvant pas y avoir appel sur les r\u00e9solutions des 27 avril et 17 mai 1883 modifiant Ia sentence mais que le seul rem\u00e8de qui restait aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e9tait de s'adresser au Surintendant pour Iui demander de la modifier lui memo en lui donnant des raisons suffisantes pour l'en igager \u00e0 le faire. il est facile de voir que Ia loi n'a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 deux juridictions concurrentes sur les changements d'arrondissements, mais une jurisdiction de premi\u00e8re instance chez les commissaires et une d'appel chez le Surintendant Un conflit de juridiction \u00e0 ce sujet aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une source f\u00e9conde de contestation que la loi a voulu \u00e9viter en rendant la d\u00e9cision du Surintendant finale et ne laissant qu'\u00e0 lui seul le droit de modifier sa sentence. En cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis que la sentence du Surintendant a \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement rendue et qu'elle ne pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e par les r\u00e9solutions conta ire des commissaires, et que les appelants ont droit d'en demander l'ex\u00e9cution.\nQuant aux objections faites \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission du bref de mandamus je suis d'avis pour los raisons donn\u00e9es par l'Hon. Juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas fond\u00e9es.\nPour ces motifs, je suss d'opinion que l'appel doit \u00e8tre allou\u00e8 avcc d\u00e8pens.\nHENRY J.- The differences existing between the parties to this suit have arisen under section 11 of ch. 22 40 Vic, of the Statutes of Quebec, which provides as follows :\nWhen a site for a school house is chosen by the school commissioners or trustees, or a change is made in the limits of a school district, or a new school district is establishe1 in a school municipality or when one or more established school districts are changed or subdivided or when the school commissioners or trustees refuse or neglect to exercise or fulfill any of the functions or duties conferred upon them by this section, the ratepayers interested may at all times appeal to the Superintendent, by summary petition; but such appeal shall not be allowed, unless with the approval of three visitors other than the school commissioners or trustees of the said municipality; the decision given by the Superintendent shall be final and he may, by such decision, order the school commissioners or trustees to do that which they have been required or which he orders them to do, or abstain from doing, or to do only in whole or in part and upon the conditions required by such decision.\nIt is shown that within the jurisdiction of the respondents there was in 1882 a school district considered by some to be too large, and a petition for a division of it into two districts having been considered and rejected by the respondent commissioners, the matter was taken by appeal under that section from that decision to the Superintendent who ordered that the district should be divided into two districts with a school house in each. That order was duly made and a resolution of the commissioners was passed in February 1883 as follows:-\nThat though they regret to be obliged to make the said division, yet they are bound to obey the decision of the superintendent and comply with his order in the matter, and consequently the said division is decreed.\nNothing, however, was done by tie commissioners to carry out or give effect to the order of the superintendent, but a resolution was subsequently passed refusing to do so, upon which the appellants obtained a peremptory writ of mandamus to be issued out of the Superior Court, ordering and requiring the commissioners to perform the order of the superintendent.\nThe respondents seek to justify their refusal to perform the order of the superintendent, because, as they allege, a petition was subsequently, during the said month of February, presented to them against the said division and that they unanimously resolved:\u2014\n1st. That they ought not and cannot take upon themselves to change their previous resolution by which in obedience to the superintendent\u2019s order they have decreed the said division\n2nd. That they would, however, be pleased if the superintendent would revoke his said order\n3rd. That consequently the said petition be referred to the superintendent with a recommendation to his consideration.\n4th. That the said commissioners are absolutely to submit to the orders of the superintendent and will hereafter refuse to receive any petition against it.\nThe commissioners failed to cause the division to be made, and in the month of May following passed a resolution that the district should not be divided as ordered by the superintendent, but reunited into one, and it alleged that such was done in answer to the prayer of a petition of a majority of the inhabitants of the district\nThat is substantially the justification offered by the commissioners for their failure to do what appears to me to have been their plain and obvious duty\nAfter the decision of the superintendent was regularly made in regard to any matter as provided for by the section in question the duties of the commissioners became wholly and solely ministerial. After a case before them goes to the superintendent by appeal the functions of the commissioners as judges in the matter are at end and they, by the plain and express words of the section become the mere instruments provided to put in execution the orders of the superintendent. The commissioners are virtually a court of original jurisdiction over certain matters in relation to schools with an appeal from their decisions to the superintendent. When he becomes legally seized by an appeal of a matter previously decided, by the commissioners, they become denuded of all power over the subject matter except, ministerially, to carry out his orders and cause the proper effect to be given to them.\nIn this case he, as the appellate and higher tribunal, decided that the district in question should be divided.\nThe law as found in the section of the statute I have quoted makes his decision final and conclusive and it throws upon the commissioners the duty of carrying out his orders. That is their only duty and it is one they are bound to perform. They have no discretion in the matter nor can they either question or consider, as far as their functions go, the propriety of the legitimate decision of the superintendent. As well, in my opinion, might a legal tribunal of first instance undertake to reverse a decision of a higher court to which a case had been removed by appeal, or decline to adopt and carry out the decision of the higher tribunal.\nI think the writ was properly issued and that the appeal should be allowed and that our judgment should be for the appellants with costs in all the courts.\nIf the commissioners had as required caused the decision of the superintendent to be carried out by an actual division of the district into two in the manner directed by the order of the superintendent, and that the two districts actually existed the commissioners might then have received and decided upon a petition to unite them and their decision would be binding Un less by an appeal to the superintendent their decision was reversed. That, however, is not the case before us. The commissioners in this case had, as I think, no jurisdiction. Their last order was to re-unite two districts that had never existed that had never been created or established as required by the order of the superintendent. The commissioners had passed a resolution agreeing to do so but failed to so effect to their own resolution. Their last order was, in my opinion, against the provision of the statute, and they having no authority to make it, no appeal from it was necessary.\nI think the writ was properly issued, that the appeal should be allowed and that the appellants are entitled to our judgment with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.-This case under the Lower Canada School Law about the division of certain school districts in the municipalitv of St. Valentin.\nThe appellants obtained a peremptory writ of mandamus in the Superior Court against the school commissioners of the said municipality ordering them to put into execution a certain decision of the superintendent of education, rendered on the 17th May, 1882, under sect 1140 \"V ch 22 which reads as follows:-\nWhen a site for a school house is chosen by the school commissioners or trustees or a change is made in the limits of a school district, or a new school district is established in a school municipality or when one or more established school districts are changed or subdivided or when the school commissioners or trustees refuse or neglect to exercise or fulfill any of the functions or duties conferred upon them by this section, the ratepayers interested may at all times appeal to the superintendent, by summary petition : but such appeal shall not be allowed, unless with the approval of three visitors other than the school commissioners or trustees of the said municipality the decision given by the superintendent shall be final and he may by such decision order the school commissioners or trustees to do that which they have been required or which he orders them to do or abstain from doing, or to do only in whole or in part and upon the conditions required by such decision.\nThe superintendent had ordered, on an appeal to him duly instituted under the said section, that a large school district in the said municipality should be divided into two districts with, a school house in each. The legality of this order has not been questioned before this Court.\nThe school commissioners appeared disposed at first to submit, and unanimously passed in February, 1883, a resolution couched in the following terms :\nThat though they regret to be obliged to make the said division, yet they are bound to obey the decision of the superintendent and comply with his order in the matter, and consequently the said division is decreed.\nOn the 27th February, again on a petition presented against this division, the commissioners unanimously resolved\n1st. That they ought not and cannot take upon themselves to change their previous resolution by which in obedience to the superintendent's order they have decreed the said division. 2nd. That they would however be pleased if the superintendent would revoke his said order. 3rd. That, consequently, the said petition be referred to the superintendent with a recommendation to his consideration. 4th. That the said commissioners are absolutely determined to submit to the orders of the superintendent and will thereafter refuse to receive any petition against it.\nNothing better than these resolutions had they acted in accordance with, them could be expected from the commissioners, and they certainly seemed fully then to know their duty and to be so far ready to perform it. It seems, however, that in their opinion the simple passing of these resolutions and the mere consignment in their registers that they were ready to submit to the superintendent's orders were by themselves a sufficient compliance with these orders, and to this, alone their submission was to be confined. For not only did they never take any steps to put these orders into execution, but few weeks later on the 27th of April and 17th. of May, they openly set them at defiance, and not only refused to execute them, but actually ordered the very reverse, of what had been ordered by the superintendent by a resolution to that effect at a regular meeting that the said, districts should not be divided as ordered by the superintendent but re-united into one. These V last words appear by their own registers to have been in the prayer of the petition presented to them. They now plead in answer to the demand for a mandamus ordering to put the superintendent's decision into execution 1st. That they were justified to refuse to execute the said decision because a majority of the parties interested had petitioned them to do so; and 2nd. That their resolution refusing to obey the said decision of the superintendent has not been appealed from to the superintendent.\nTheir contention it seems to me, is an extraordinary one. Their whole argument consists in opposing their rebellious act as a justification for their rebellion to the constituted authority in the matter. We have not here got to enquire whether this division should take place or not. The superintendent has pronounced on that and his decision is final, says the statute. And the contention, that because a majority, or the totality of the inhabitants of these divisions, or of the whole parish, or even if it were of the whole of the Province itself, have asked the commissioners not to obey the superintendent's orders, they were, ipso facto, authorized to do so seems to me utterly untenable. The statute tells them \" you shall obey \"; these petitioners said to them \" don't obey,\" and to the petitioners' wishes (say the respondents,) we submitted in preference to the law's precepts; and that is our defense to the mandamus I have no hesitation to say that such a defense cannot prevail.\nThat is not in my opinion how should be received the orders of a high officer of the state, whom, very properly indeed, the law has declared should be the sole arbiter of these dissensions amongst the school ratepayers. His decrees must be respected and obeyed as those of a court of justice should be and the refusal or negligence to do so is nothing else but an act of rebellion to law and authority.\nAs to the commissioners contention that their resolutions of April and May, by which they refused to submit to the superintendent's decision, have not been appealed from the to superintendent himself and so that they stand in full force, it evidently is as unfounded as their first one, and must fall with it. They had no right or authority whatsoever to pass these resolutions; they were consequently null, absolutely null, and no appeal against them was necessary to put them aside. In fact it all comes to the same question; they here again oppose their rebellious acts in support of their rebellion. They say \"it is true that we refused to obey the decree, that we acted in direct opposition to it, but our refusal, our acts of insubordination, stand till they are appealed from.\" Well, as I have said before the refusal their acts of insubordination, are illegal and void, and it was not necessary, nay, it would have been ludicrous to say the least to appeal from them to the superintendent.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Superior Court by which the commissioners were ordered to submit to the superintendent's decree was right, and that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench which reversed the judgment of the Superior Court was wrong. The appeal should, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed, and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with costs in all courts against the respondents.\nThe conduct of the commissioners in the matter has been so outrageous, the illegality of their acts so flagrant, and their bad faith so glaring, that, had it been asked, I would have put all the costs against them personally, It seems hard, to make the rate-payers suffer the consequences of the misdeeds of these officers.\nGWYNNE J. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Trudel, Charbonneau & Lamothe.\nSolicitors for respondents : Loranger & Beaudoin.\n[1] p. 288.\n",

Adamson, (1886) 12 S.C.R. 563\nDate: 1886-03-08\nMary D. Adamson (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nAlfred Adamson (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1885: November 17; 1886: March 8.\nPresent: Sir W.J. Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nStatute of Limitations\u2014Conveyance to trustees\u2014In trust for tenant for life\u2014Remainder to joint tenants or tenants in common\u2014Possession by tenant for life.\nBy a deed to trustees in 1837 two lots of land were conveyed in trust for E.A. for her life, with remainder as follows:\u2014Lot No. 2 to G.A. and lot No. 1 to A.A. to the use of them, their heirs and assigns, as joint-tenants and not as tenants in common E.A. the tenant for life, entered into possession of lot No. 2, and in 1863 put her son, the husband of the defendant, into possession without exacting any rent. The son died a few months after, and the defendant, his widow, continued in possession of the lot, and was in possession in 1875, when the tenant for life died. In 1878 A.A., the plaintiff, obtained a deed of the legal estate in the two lots from the executors of the surviving trustee (G.A. having died a number of years before) and brought an action against the defendant for the recovery of the said lot No. 2.\nHeld, that as there was no time prior to the death of the tenant for life when either the trustee or the remainder-man could have interfered with the possession of the said lot, the statute of limitations did not begin to run against the remainder-man until the death of the tenant for life in 1875, and he was therefore entitled to recover. Held also, that for the purpose of the said action it was immaterial whether the plaintiff was entitled to the whole lot by survivorship on the termination of the joint-tenancy by the death of his brother, or only to his portion of the lot as one of his brother\u2019s heirs.\nAPPEAL form a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing an appeal from a decree of the Court of Chancery[2], in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case will be found fully set out in the above head-note and previous reports.\nRobinson Q.C. for the appellant.\nThe appellants was in possession of the land in question here for more than ten years before plaintiff brought his action, paying no rent and never having made an acknowledgment of title. This, under the statute of limitations in Ontario, would bar the plaintiff\u2019s right to bring an action unless it is found that the statute did not run against him.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s title to the land is under the trust deed, by which lands are held in trust for Ellen Adamson for life and remainder as follows:\u2014Lot number two to George, lot number one to Alfred, sons, &c., to the use of them, their heirs and assigns as joint tenants\nThere is a difficulty here in reconciling a joint tenancy with estates in severalty.\nThe whole question is whether both trustee and cestui que trust are barred by the statute. As to that see Lewin on Trusts[3].\nThe trustee holds the legal estate and must protect the interests of the cestui que trust. If he fails to do so the rights of the latter may be gone. The trustee should have had the possessor of the land attorn to him. Our statute not only takes away the right of action from the one party but it gives an absolute title to the other. Mowat Q.C., Attorney-General of Ontario, and McLennan Q.C. for the respondents.\nThere are no words of inheritance as to the estates in severalty, and the grantor clearly intended to convey a fee. The words \u201cas joint tenants and not as tenants in common\u201d in the deed cannot be rejected unless no other construction is possible, which is not the case.\nGrantor intended survivorship to be an essential element. Doe v. Green[4], Doe v. Davies[5].\nThen as to the statute of limitations. The words of the deed are \u201cto the parties of the second part, &c., to their use and benefit forever.\u201d A use can be limited upon a use; so, if these words had been omitted, grantees would have taken a legal estate.\nThe policy of the statute was to place legal and equitable estates on the same footing in regard to the act. R.S.O. ch. 108 sec. 29.\nThe courts always strive to avoid destroying a remainder. Thompson v. Simpson[6].\nEven if the legal estate is barred the equitable is not. Morgan v. Morgan[7], Mills v. Capel[8], Wrixon v. Vize[9].\nAs to how astute courts are to find relief against the statute see Gerrard v. Tuck[10], Re Lowes\u2019 settlement[11], Locke v. Matthews[12], Whilmore v. Humphries[13], Heath v. Pugh[14].\nRobinson Q.C. was heard in reply.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think this appeal must be dismissed. I think the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover has not been barred by the statute of limitations. The plain- tiff\u2019s right to the land first accrued in February, 1875, on the death of Ellen Adamson, the tenant for life, as equitable remainder-man in fee, and in January, 1878, he obtained the legal estate in fee by conveyance from the devisees of the surviving trustee under the trust deed of August, 1837; and the time therefore, in my opinion, first began to run against him in February, 1875, when the right to sue first accrued to him. The mother was tenant for life, and had a right to the possession, and had a right to occupy the land, by herself or her tenants, whether such tenants were for her life or at will, and the trustee had no right to interfere with any such tenancy or the possession of the tenant there under. That she did occupy by a tenant at will the evidence of the defendant clearly shows. Such tenant never was in as a trespasser against the tenant for life, but, on the contrary, after her husband\u2019s death, she occupied with the consent and permission of the tenant for life. Such tenancy at will was never put an end to by the lessor or lessee, and could not have been determined by the trustee.\nUnder such circumstances, I cannot conceive it possible that the equitable remainder-man can be cut out by any such dealing with the possession by the tenant for life and her tenant at will. Whether the title of an equitable remainder-man could be destroyed by a possession, for the statutory period, by a trespasser on the tenant for life, or whether even, in such a case, it would have any other effect than to bar the tenant for life during the existence of her tenancy, it is quite unnecessary to discuss. Under the Real Property Limitations Act[15], the right of entry in respect of an estate in remainder shall be deemed to have first accrued at the time at which such estate became an estate in possession. The life estate, in this case, subsisted until 1875, consequently, until that date, plaintiff\u2019s estate did not become an estate in possession. The tenant for life, by herself through her tenant at will, enjoyed the property during her life time, and on her death the plaintiff, as remainder-man, became entitled to the enjoyment of the estate. During the life time of the tenant for life there was not any point of time, that I can discover, where either the trustee or the cestui que trust could enter upon or assert a right of either to the premises.\nI think we are not called upon, in this case, to discuss the construction of the deed, as to whether plaintiff was entitled to the whole as joint-tenant with his brother George, or only to one-fourth, as heir of his brother George. It is sufficient for the present action, that as against the defendant he has the legal estate in the whole; and so far as the defendant is concerned, it matters not whether he is entitled to the whole beneficial interest, or whether the other heirs of George have a beneficial interest in three-fourths.\nAgreeing then, as I do, with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, that whether the present plaintiff was entitled in equity to the whole of the lot in question, or merely to a portion, as one of the heirs of his deceased brother George, he is entitled, in this action, to recover the whole lot, having acquired the legal estate from the trustee, to which the statute of limitations is no answer, inasmuch as the defendant, upon her own showing, was tenant at will to her mother-in-law, the tenant for life, and until that tenancy was determined by the death of the tenant for life the statute would not begin to run, which effectually disposes of the case. Therefore, I do not think it necessary to discuss the differences of opinion entertained by the Court of Appeal on another branch of the case. I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. FOURNIER, and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014Concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. I entirely concur in the judgments delivered by the learned judges who decided the case in the Court of Appeal. I agree with the conclusion that they arrived at in regard to the estate, namely, that it was an estate in common and not joint. It gives a separate lot to each of the two brothers in fee, to them and their heirs, naming them as lot number one and lot number two, and then there is another clause that they should hold as joint tenants. Under that it is attempted to show that the plaintiff took the property by survivorship. The learned judge decided that he took it as heir to his brother who died without issue, and therefore that he took it not by virtue of the deed but as heir.\nI think the statute of limitations did not begin to run until 1875. The plaintiff here could not have brought a suit in the lifetime of the tenant for life; she died in 1875 audit is not necessary to inquire how she occupied it, whether by herself or by her tenant.\nI entirely concur that the appeal, in every consideration of the case, should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed upon the ground that an equitable remainder\u2011man in fee to whom the legal estate has been conveyed by the trustees upon the decease of the equitable tenant for life, who had been admitted into actual possession for her life by the trustee of the legal estate, is not barred of his right of action by the possession of a person who had entered as tenant of the tenant for life in possession under circumstances that might have been sufficient to have barred an action by the tenant for life. The statute preserves the right of entry of the person entitled to an equitable remainder in fee upon his estate becoming an estate in possession by the death of an equitable tenant for life, equally as it does the rights of a person entitled to a legal remainder in fee upon the decease of a legal tenant for life. The property in question was granted and conveyed to the use of trustees, their heirs and assigns, upon trust to the use of Ellen Adamson, wife of the grantor, for and during the term of her natural life without impeachment for waste, and from and after her decease, then it was declared that the trustees should stand seised and possessed thereof, to uses, in language which has given occasion to an attempt being made by the defendant to raise upon this record a question, whether the trustees were to stand seised of the remainder upon the decease of the tenant for life to the use of George Adamson, a brother of the plaintiff, in fee in severalty, or to the use of George Adamson and the plaintiff as joint tenants in fee; other lands were by the same deed conveyed to the same trustees to the use in like manner of Ellen Adamson for life, and the remainders on her decease to the use of other persons in fee, and the trusts of the deed were finally declared to be that the trustees should convey and assure the several lands therein mentioned to the persons severally entitled to the remainders in fee upon the decease of the tenant for life. When the trustees admitted the tenant for life into possession of the land in question in this suit, she became and was possessed thereof under and in virtue of the provisions of the trust deed for the term of her natural life, and the trustees had no right or power of interference with such her possession, whether the same was held by herself actually in person, or by any person admitted into possession by her as her tenant. If she had conveyed her estate and interest in the land to the defendant, the latter would have become entitled to the possession thereof during the life of the tenant for life, and could have held the same free from any interference or interruption whatever by the trustees of the legal estate, so long as the tenant for life should live, but upon her decease the defendant would be liable to be evicted by the trustees in the interest of the equitable remainder man in fee. Now, in this case, defendant\u2019s claim having originated in a tenancy at will under the equitable tenant for life, the latter could have determined that estate at her pleasure, and if upon such determination the defendant had refused to surrender possession to the tenant for life, the latter could have evicted her by an action of ejectment at law without the interposition of the trustees of the legal estate, for in such case the defendant would have been estopped from denying the title of the equitable tenant in fee under whom the defendant had entered as tenant at will, and the effect of the defendant having been suffered by the tenant for life to remain in possession for such a length of time, and under circumstances that would be sufficient to bar the right of the tenant for life to recover in such an action, would simply be to vest in the defendant the right of possession during the life of the tenant for life, that is to say, to vest in the defendant the possession of the land and the right thereto during the estate and interest of the tenant for life, upon whose decease such the defendant\u2019s title would determine equally as if the tenant for life had by deed conveyed the land to the defendant for the estate of the tenant for life, and upon the decease of the tenant for life the right of the trustees to enter and evict the defendant in the interest of the equitable remainder-man in fee would attach. George Adamson having died intestate and without issue during the life of the tenant for life, the persons seized of the legal estate in trust shortly after her decease conveyed the land in question to the plaintiff in fee simple, upon the assumption that by the trust deed the remainder in fee therein had been vested in George Adamson and his brother, the plaintiff, as joint tenants in fee; but whether the estate in remainder in the land in question was so vested in the plaintiff in joint tenancy in fee with his deceased brother George we are not called upon to decide in the present action, for the whole legal estate having been conveyed to the plaintiff by the persons seised thereof upon the trust purposes of the trust deed, he is entitled to recover the whole of the land in question, which he will hold to his own use if the remainder was conveyed in such joint tenancy; and to the use of himself and the other persons who are co-heirs with him of his deceased brother George if the remainder in the land in question was conveyed by the trust deed to the use of George in fee in severalty. The persons who are interested in raising with the plaintiff a question upon this point not being before the court, no such question can arise upon the present record.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Bethune, Moss, Falconbridge and Hoyles.\nSolicitors for respondent: Mowat, MacLennan & Downey.\n[1] 7 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSuretyship\u2014Contract of with firm\u2014Continuing security to firm and member or members constituting firm for the time being\u2014Death of partner\u2014Liability of surety after.\nS. by indenture under seal became security to the firm of C. & Sons for goods to be sold to one Q., and agreed to be a continuing security to the said firm, or \u201cto the member or members for the time being constituting the said firm of C. & Sons,\u201d for sales to be made by the said firm, or\u201d any member or members of the said firm of C. & Sons,\u201d to the said Q., so long as they should mutually deal together.\nP.C., the senior member of the said firm, having died, and by his will appointed his sons, the other members of the firm, his executors, the latter entered into a new agreement of co\u2011partnership and continued to carry on the business under the same firm name of C. & Sons, and subsequently transferred all their interest in the said business to a joint stock company.\nAn action having been brought against S. for goods sold to Q., after the death of the said P.C.:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the death of P.C. dissolved the said firm of C. & Sons, and put an end to the contract of suretyship.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing the appeal of the respondents from the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose[2] dismissing the respondents\u2019 action.\nThe action was on a bond dated 16th of April, 1879, given by the appellant to Patrick Cosgrave, John Cosgrave and Lawrence Joseph Cosgrave, then carrying on business as brewers, under the name of Cosgrave & Sons, as security for any beer, ale or porter they might sell to one Michael Quinn.\nThe respondents alleged that after the execution of the bond the firm of Cosgrave & Sons supplied goods to Quinn; that on the 6th of September, 1881, Patrick Cosgrave died; that afterwards John Cosgrave and Lawrence Joseph Cosgrave entered into a fresh partnership and carried on the business under the old name, and supplied goods to Quinn as before till the 2nd of October, 1882, when they transferred the business to one James Douglas, as trustee; that the business was still carried on under the same name of Cosgrave & Sons till the 13th of December, 1882, when Douglas assigned the business to the respondents, who thence afterwards carried it on.\nThe respondents sought to recover the balance due from Quinn on all the prior transactions up to $5,000, the amount of the bond.\nThe appellant urged that he was not responsible for any transactions after the death of Patrick Cosgrave, and that all prior transactions were paid, which, on the argument, was admitted to be the case.\nThe following is the bond or agreement above mentioned:\nMemorandum of agreement made this 19th day of April, A.D. 1879.\nBetween Patrick Cosgrave, John Cosgrave, and Lawrence Joseph Cosgrave, all of the city of Toronto, carrying on business as brewers, under the name, style, and firm of Cosgrave & Sons, of the first part, and Michael Quinn, of the city of Ottawa, hotel keeper, of the second part, and Michael Starrs, of the said city of Ottawa, grocer, surety for the said party of the second part, of the third part.\nWitnesseth that at the request of the said party hereto of the third part, it hath been agreed and it is hereby agreed between the said parties hereto, that they, the said parties of the first part, should, from time to time, so long as they, the said parties of the first part, desire, sell to the said party of the second part, and that the said party of the second part should purchase from the parties of the first part beer, ale, lager beer, and the casks, bottles, and vessels containing such liquors, or any part thereof, and at such prices and on such terms of payment as may from time to time be mutually agreed upon, and that the said party of the third part should be a continuing security to the said parties of the first part, or to the member or members for the time being constituting the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons, to the amount of $5,000, to cover and protect any sales or advances now or hereafter indefinitely to be made by the said parties of the first part or any member or members of the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons to the said parties of the second part, so long as they may mutually deal together.\nAnd further, it is hereby agreed between the said parties hereto, that until all such sales and advances, and every part thereof, shall have been paid in cash, that these presents shall continue to be a good and valid security at law and in equity to the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons to the amount of $5,000, notwithstanding that they may from time to time receive other securities, notes, bonds, deeds, conveyances, or assignments of lands or goods, or either of them, from the said party of the second part, or any other person or persons as further security for the said sales or advances, or any part thereof, and notwithstanding that they, the said parties of the first part or any of them, may extend the time of payment of the moneys due, or any part thereof, for any such sales or advances, and notwithstanding that they, the said parties of the first part, or any of them, may do any act, matter, or thing thing that would release the said party of the third part at law or in equity from these presents, were it not for the stipulations herein contained.\nIn consideration whereof the said party of the second part hereby agrees with the said parties of the first part to pay the price of all advances and sales of ales, porter, and lager beer, and of all casks, vessels, or bottles that may from time to time be sold to him by the said parties of the first part, or any of them, and at the times that may from time to time be agreed for the payment thereof, and also to pay all notes, bonds, mortgages, or other securities that may from time to time be given for the same.\nAnd the said party of the third part hereby coven- ants and agrees with the said parties of the first part, and with each of them, that he, the said party of the second part, will pay for all such sales and advances, and at the times that might be agreed for the payment thereof, and also all notes, bonds, mortgages, and other securities that may be given for the same, or any part thereof, and that he, the said party of the second part, will in all things perform and fulfil this agreement and all other agreements that may hereafter be made by and between the said parties of the first and second parts with reference to any such sales or advances, or in respect of any money unpaid therefor, and that in default thereof that he, the said party of the third part, will, to the extent of $5,000, be liable to, and pay, the said parties of the first part, or to the member or members for the time being constituting the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons, for all ale, porter and lager beer, and for all casks, bottles, and vessels containing same that may from time to time be sold by the parties of the first part, or the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons, or by any member thereof, to the said party of the second part, and also that in default of payment by the said party of second part of all or any notes, bonds, mortgages, or other securities that may from time to time be given by him, the said party of the second part, to the said parties of the first part as security for any such sales or advances, or any part thereof that he, the said party of the third part, will pay the same.\nIt is hereby expressly stipulated between the parties hereto that nothing herein contained shall compel the parties or any of them hereto to any dealing to any given amount, or for any given period; and further, that these presents shall continue a valid and continuing agreement till all such sales or advances have been fully paid for in cash, and all agreements, notes, bonds mortgages, and securities hereinafter made in respect thereof have been fully satisfied.\nMcLennan Q.C. and O\u2019Gara Q.C. for the appellant.\nThis action is for goods supplied after the death of Patrick Cosgrave and up to the date of the notice that appellant would no longer be a surety for Quinn.\nWe submit, in the first place, that the death of Patrick Cosgrave dissolved the firm with which the appellant made his contract of suretyship, and an entirely new firm was created by the sons after his death, although under the same name. It is the fact that the name of the original is retained that is relied upon by the respondents to bind us under the clause in the deed, by which he covenants to be a continuing security to the member or members for the time being of the firm of Cosgrave & Sons. But those words must be held to depend upon the continued existence of the firm, and once its existence ceases any covenant made with it must be released. To hold otherwise would be to make the appellant covenant with any firm of the name of Cosgrave & Son, which would be absurd. Words must be construed in a legal, not a commercial, sense. Bank of Scotland v. Christie[3], Pemberton v. Oakes[4], Backhouse v. Hall[5], Chapman v. Beckinton5, Weston v. Barton[6], Williamson v. Sleeves[7], Pollock on Contracts p. 440.\nBut I submit, secondly, that even if Starrs can be held liable after the death of Patrick Cosgrave, he is discharged by the giving of time to his principal, the company having taken Quinn\u2019s notes for the full amount of the debt\nOsler Q.C. for the respondents.\nIt is admitted that effect must be given to the words \u201ccontinuing security in the deed,\u201d and I think a reasonable explanation of our contention may be found in the difference between the terms \u201cfirm\u201d and \u201cpartnership.\u201d\n(The learned counsel here read the definitions of these words from Imperial Dictionary and Wharton.)\nThe main thing in the arrangement was the goods supplied. As long as Cosgrave\u2019s beer was sold to Quinn it made no difference who the parties were who supplied it. All the members might go out of the firm, and as long as the brewery business was carried on the liability of the guarantor continued.\nThe case of Pemberton v. Oakes shows the question to be whether or not the parties ever manifested any intention that the liability should continue in case of a change in the firm. The document itself is the best answer to that question.\nSee Lloyds v. Harper[8], Barclay v. Lucas[9], Metcalf v. Bruin[10], Pease v. Hirst[11], Pariente v. Lubbock[12], Lindley on Part. 4 Ed. p. 215, Ex parte Lloyd[13], Ex parte Loyd[14].\nIf a change in the firm would relieve the surety I submit that, according to the authority of these cases, we come within the exception.\nAs to the question of time being given to the principal, I draw your lordships\u2019 attention to the express provision in the agreement. Hargreave v. Smee[15].\nMcLennan Q.C. in reply cites Baylis on Sureties 140, and Fire Extinguisher Co. v. North-West Ex. Co.[16]\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This action was brought to recover $5,000 upon an agreement of suretyship. The learned judge gave judgment in favor of the respondents.\nThe firm of Cosgrave & Sons appears to have been a case of ordinary partnership, and there being no agreement to the contrary, there can be no doubt that the death of Patrick Cosgrave immediately dissolved the partnership, not only as regards the deceased, but as regards all the other partners. This, Mr. Lindsey says, is obviously reasonable, for, by the death of one of the members, it is no longer possible to adhere to the original contract, the essence of which is, in such a case, that all the parties to it should be alive. And the mere fact that the partnership was entered into for a definite term, which was unexpired when the death occurred, is not sufficient to prevent a dissolution by such death.\nThe representatives of the deceased have no right to succeed him in the firm unless there is a clear agreement to that effect.\nOn dissolution, each one of the partners has a perfect right to require, and through equity to compel, a final settlement and adjustment of all questions and all property. On dissolution the power and authority of the surviving partners is for the purpose of winding up and no further; it is an incident to the contract of partnership that the surviving partners should collect the assets and wind up the business of the firm, and after the dissolution of the firm the authority of each partner to bind the firm continues only so far as is necessary to settle and liquidate existing demands, and to complete transactions begun but unfinished at the time of the dissolution, and not otherwise. So that, as to future dealing, the partnership is terminated by the death of one partner, the dissolution, as between the partners themselves, putting an end to the joint power and authority of all the partners any further to employ the property or funds or credit of the partnership in the business or trade thereof or do any act or make any disposition of the partnership property in any manner inconsistent with the primary duty now incumbent upon all of them of winding-up the whole concern of the partnership. And therefore it is the duty of the surviving partners thenceforth to cease altogether from carrying on the trade or business thereof.\nAll parties must be assumed to have entered into this agreement with the full knowledge of the law governing partnerships. Who then were the parties of the first part with whom Starrs contracted? The firm of Cosgrave Bros. by whomsoever and of what time soever composed? Clearly not. The deed itself states that the parties of the first part were Patrick Cosgrave, John Cosgrave and Lawrence Joseph Cosgrave, doing business under the firm of Cosgrave & Sons; it is with that firm, as so composed at the date of the deed, that Starrs contracted; it was with the association of these three, so carrying on business under the name of Cosgrave & Sons, and no other. So soon as the death of the one partner occurred there was a dissolution, and though the surviving partners might enter into a new co-partnership, they had no power or authority to continue the old co-partnership so at an end, and their duty then was, as surviving partners, to close up the affairs of the defunct co-partnership, and the representatives of the deceased partner had the right, and their sole right was, to compel an account by the surviving partners of the state of the firm on the death of their principal, and to call on the surviving partners to settle and close up the affairs of the co-partnership, and to pay over to the estate of the deceased partner the share coming to him on such settlement; and they had no right to carry into a new partnership affairs of the old, whether the old would be thereby benefited or injured.\nIn this case, the moment Patrick Cosgrave died, eo instanti, the partnership was dissolved. When was the new partnership established? And what were the rights of all parties in the interval that must have existed between the death of the partner and the then dissolution of the firm, and the coming into existence of the \u2018new firm, which could only exist by virtue of the new contract entered into by the members of such new firm? In my opinion, the rights of the surviving members of the old firm, and of the representatives of the dead partner, and of every one dealing with that firm, in the absence of an express contract to the contrary, was then and there fixed and determined, and the affairs of the old firm with whom Quinn dealt and for whose indebtedness Starrs became guarantee were then and there settled and determined, and the liability on the guarantee could not be extended, without the consent of Starrs, to dealing between Queen and a new firm with which, as such, Starrs had no connection. The wording of the agreement itself, I think, clearly shows that the security was only to the firm of Cosgrave & Sons as it existed at the time of entering into the contract; the sum guaranteed, $5,000, was \u201cto cover and protect any sales or advances now or hereafter indefinitely to be made by Cosgrave & Sons, or any member or members of the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons to Quinn (that is as I construe it\u2014sales on account of the said firm) so long as they, that is, in my opinion, the firm of Cosgrave & Sons as it existed, and Quinn, may mutually deal together.\u201d\nThe law of England was well established before the passing of the Mercantile Amendment Act; a guarantee was not a continuing guarantee so \u2018as to remain in force after the death of a member of a firm to or for which it was given, unless it appeared by the terms of the instrument that it was the intention of all parties that it should so continue, and the Mercantile Amendment Act did not alter the English law as settled by decided cases, but it was, as said by Blackburn J. in Backhouse v. Hall[17], to make the law of Great Britain uniform, there being a difference in Scottish law. The question as put in that case is just what arises in this: \u201cDoes the intention that the guarantee should continue appear by express stipulation, or by necessary implication, or from the nature of the firm, or otherwise?\u201d And, the answer, as given in that case, applies with equal force to this. Now there is certainly no express stipulation and there is nothing in the nature of the firm beyond those incidents common to every partnership that the partners had changed or might again change, with the exception or additional consideration that, in the present case, the partnership had ceased to exist by the death of one of the partners and no provision for its continuance.\nI think, therefore, that this contract should not be construed as a continuing guarantee after the dissolution of the firm with which the guarantor contracted, and that the appeal should be allowed.\nThe following authorities may be cited in support of the views I have expressed. In Myers v. Edge[18], the report gives the facts as follows:\u2014\nAt the trial before Rooke J.; at Lancaster, the plaintiffs, to take the case out of the statute of frauds, gave in evidence the following letter written by the defendant dated 15th, January, 1794. \u201cTo Messrs. Myers. Fielden, Ainsworth & Co.:\u2014If you please you may let the bearer, Thomas Duxbury, have six bunches of twist more than I told you, and I will be answerable for them as before; and after this I will be answerable for one pack and no more; so when he pays you for the first half pack you may let him have another, and so on till I tell you to the contrary; and you may make the invoice to us both, &c.\u201d At the time when this engagement was entered into, Ainsworth was a partner in the same house with the plaintiffs, and continued so till May, 1795; during which time many parcels of goods were delivered to Duxbury, which were all paid by him, who wa debited for them in the plaintiffs books. The goods in question were furnished to Duxbury by the plaintiffs alone after Ainsworth had retired from the partnership, and Duxbury having failed to pay for them, they demanded payment of the defendant, who said it should be settled, and requested time; but afterwards refusing to pay, this action was brought. It was objected on the part of the defendant, that the action could not be maintained by the present plaintiffs, because Ainsworth, with whom also the contract was made, was not joined with them, and he not being a partner at the time when the goods were furnished. Rooke J. overruled the objection, considering the security as having been given to the house and not to the individuals; the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs. A rule was granted in this term calling on the plaintiffs to show cause why the verdict should not be set aside and a non-suit entered, or a new trial granted.\nLord Keynon C.J.[19]:\nI think that the rule ought to be made absolute. We are to judge on the contract that the parties have made, and ought not to substitute another in lieu of it. Here the defendant contracted with Myers, Fielden, Ainsworth & Co. Perhaps the defendant when he entered into this contract had great; confidence in Ainsworth, and thought that he would use due diligence in enforcing payment of the goods from Duxbury regularly as they were furnished; at least it is too much for us to say that, after Ainsworth ceased to be a partner, the defendant would have given the same credit to the remaining partners. * * * But we cannot say that a contract, that on the face of it imports to have been made with five, ought to be construed to be a contract made with four persons only. I very much approve of the case cited from 3 Wilson 532.\nAshhurst J.:\nThis is not a contract made with a corporation, it is made with a partnership consisting of a certain number, of individuals; and when one of the partners left the business, it put an end to this engagement. If the plaintiffs had intended to furnish goods to Duxbury after this alteration in the partnership, they should have required a new undertaking.\nDenman C.J. in Chapman v. Beckinton[20].\nAll this may well have been without advertising to or intending to alter the legal consequences of such change in the members of the firm; and we ought to be slow in extending by implication the meaning of words beyond that which they ordinarily bear in legal construction, in order to extend the liability of a surety. We are strengthened in this opinion by the authority of a case cited by the counsel for the defendant, which it is difficult to distinguish in principle from the present, that of Pemberton v. Oakes[21]. There a banking partnership was formed for fifteen years, between Harding, Oakes and Wellington; it was stipulated that, if Oakes or Wellington should die during the term the concern should be continued by the survivor or survivors, the deceased\u2019s share to be paid to his executor up to the death; but if Harding should die he might dispose of his share to his wife and children; and there was a provision for his appointing persons who should carry it on, as if he were living, during the minority of his children; and the business was, in that event, to be carried on by the surviving partners and the appointee, in the manner and on the terms and conditions directed by the partnership articles, as if he had not died. Harding made his will in favor of his children as to this share, and appointed persons to carry on the concern with his partners; and, he dying, this was carried into effect. The question was, whether a surety for a customer of the original firm, who had executed a deed to the members of that firm to secure them for sums already due or which should become due to them for advances to be made thenceforward to the end of fifteen years, was liable for any advance made after the death of Harding. And the present lord chancellor held clearly that he was not liable for advances by a new firm, although he had stipulated to secure advances made during the whole fifteen years; and that the death of Harding, with the substitution of the appointees, though contemplated by the original articles, made a new firm. In this case it is true, no new partner has been admitted; but that is immaterial if the death of one of the old ones works a dissolution. And it is true, also, that in this case the defendant (the surety) is averred to have had full notice of the covenants in the partnership deed, a circumstances which did not exist in the case cited; but this also is immaterial, the question turning on the written language of the instruments.\nIn DeColyar\u2019s Law of Guarantees, 2 Ed. 255:\nTo the same effect, also, is the case of Weston v. Barton[22]. There the condition of the bond was for the repayment to five persons of all sums advanced by them, or any of them, to Catterall & Watson, in their capacity of bankers. It was held that the bond did not extend to sums advanced after the decease of one of the five by the four survivors, the four then acting as bankers. Mansfield C.J. delivered the following judgment: \u201cThe question here is, whether the original partnership being at an end, in consequence of the death of Golding, the bond is still in force as security to the surviving four; or whether that political personage, as it may be called, consisting of five, being dead, the bond is not at an end. The case has stood over in consequence of doubts which the court entertained on particular expressions in the bond. Many cases were cited at the bar, and the result of them is that, generally, when a change takes place in the number of persons to whom such a bond is given, the bond no longer exists. These decisions certainly fall hard on the obligees; for I believe the general understanding is that these securities are given to the banking house, and not to the particular individuals who compose it; and we should readily so construe the bond if the words would permit. The words of the condition on which the question depends (and which His Lordship now read over), again and again refer to the obligee\u2019s capacity as bankers; they were bankers, only as they were partners in their banking house, as it is called, and this security is conditioned to pay any money advanced \u2018by them five, or any or \u2018either of them.\u2019 Taking those last words by themselves, it might at first be conceived that, if any one of the five advanced money this bond should secure it, but the words are afterwards explained, when it is seen that the money is to be paid to the five. Now it could never be intended that money advanced by one of them singly should be repaid to the five; and this shows that the words \u2018advanced by them, or any, or either of them,\u2019 must be confined in their meaning to money advanced by any or either of them in their capacity of bankers, on behalf of all the five. This, then, being the construction of the instrument, from almost all the cases, in truth, as we may say, from all (for though there is one adverse case, Barclay v. Lucas, the propriety of that decision has been very much questioned), it results that where one of the obligees dies the security is at an end. It is not necessary now to enter into the reasons of those decisions, but there may be very good reasons for such a construction; it is very probable that sureties may be induced to enter into such a security, by a confidence which they repose in the integrity, diligence, caution and accuracy of one or two of the partners. In the nature of things there cannot be a partnership consisting of several persons, in which there are not some persons possessing these qualities in a greater degree than the rest; and it may be that the partner dying, or going out, may be the very person on whom the sureties relied; it would, therefore, be very unreasonable to hold the surety to his contract after such change. And, though the sum here is limited, that circumstance does not alter the case; for, although the amount of the indemnity is not indefinite, yet \u00a33,000 is a large sum; and, even if it were only \u00a31,000, the same ground, in a degree, holds, for there may be a great deal of difference in, the measure of caution or discretion with which different persons would advance even \u00a31,000; some would permit one who was almost a beggar to extend his credit to that sum; others would exercise a due degree of caution for the safety of the surety; and, therefore, we are of opinion, that as to such sums only which were advanced before the decease of Golding can an indemnity be recovered by the plaintiffs; and, as to the sums claimed for debts incurred since his decease, the judgment must be for the defendant.\u201d\nA similar decision was also come to in the case of Pemberton v. Oakes, 4 Russ. 154. There a banking partnership was formed for fifteen years, between Harding, Oakes and Wellington. It was stipulated that if Oakes or Wellington should die during the term, the concern should be continued by the survivor or survivors, the deceased share to be paid to his executors up to the death; but that if Harding should die, he might dispose of his share to his wife and children, and there was a provision for his appointing persons who should carry it on as if he were living during the minority of his children; and the business was, in that event, to be carried on by the surviving partners and the appointee, in the manner and on the terms and conditions directed by the partnership articles, as if he had not died. Harding made his will in favor of his children as to this share, and appointed persons to carry on the concern with his partners, and he, dying, this was carried into effect. The question was, whether a surety for a customer of the original firm, who had executed a deed to the members of that firm to secure them for sums already due, or which should become due to them for advances to be made thenceforward to the end of the fifteen years, was liable for any advance made after the death of Harding. Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst held clearly that he was not liable for advances by a new firm, although he had stipulated to secure advances made during the whole fifteen years; and that the death of Harding, with the substitution of the appointees, though contemplated by the original articles, made a new firm.\nAnd yet another case in which the same view prevailed, is that of Chapman v. Beckington[23]. In that case the plaintiff and one William Chapman entered into partnership, by deed, with one Potts. Potts was to be the acting partner. In consideration of this trust he and the defendant bound themselves by a bond of guarantee to the plaintiff and the said William Chapman, for the observance by Potts of the covenants in the partnership deed, and also that Potts, during such time as he 3houlcl continue the acting partner in the said trade of the said copartnership, should faithfully make and deliver a true account in writing of all sums of money, notes, bills and other partnership effects, which should come to his hands, or which he should be intrusted with by or on account of the said co-partnership, and also make good, answer for and pay over, the moneys due on the balance to the said plaintiff and W. Chapman. Potts, after the decease of W. Chapman, rendered false accounts. It was held, that the co-partnership referred to in the condition of the bond was determined by W. Chapman\u2019s death, and that the defendant was therefore not liable for Potts\u2019 default happening after that event. In this case Lord Denman C.J., said: \u201cMany cases were cited to show that, where the surety had covenanted with the house, and not the members of the firm, or had stipulated that his liability should not be affected by a change of the members, he would remain liable to the new firm. These cases we do not in the least question, our judgment proceeding on the language of this condition, making all due allowance for the effect which the language of the deed ought to have on its construction.\u201d\nAnd at p. 270:\nThe effect of the death of one of the principal debtors is to determine the surety\u2019s liability. Thus in Simon v. Cooke[24], a bond by which, after reciting the partnership of J.C. and T.C, one W.P. become surety for such sums as should be advanced to meet bills drawn by J.C. and T.C. or either of them, was held not to extend to bills drawn by J.C. after the death of T.C.\nThe voluntary retirement of one of the principal debtors likewise has the effect of putting an end to the surety\u2019s liability. In the case of The University of Cambridge v. Baldwin[25], the condition of a bond recited that the chancellors, masters, and scholars of the university of Cambridge had appointed B., C. and J. their agents for the sale of books printed at their press in the university, and that the defendant had offered to enter into a bond with them as a surety; and it was conditioned that if the said B., C. and J., and the survivors and survivor of them, and such other persons as should or might at any time or times thereafter, in partnership with them or any or either of them, act as agent or agents of the said chancellor, &c., and their successors, for all books delivered or sent to them or any or either of them for sale as aforesaid, and should pay all moneys which should become payable to the said chancellor, &c., in respect of such sale, then the obligation to be void, &c. An action having been brought on this bond against the surety, it was held that, by the retirement of J. from the partnership of B., C. and J., the defendant, as their surety, was discharged from all further liability on this bond.\nLord Arlington v. Merricke[26]:\nIn Bodenham v. Purchas, a bond was given to secure a banking account to several partners; one of them died and a new partner was taken in; the obligor was at that time indebted in a considerable sum; new advances were made, and money paid on account, no new head of account being opened, but the whole being treated as one entire account; the balance was much reduced, and was afterwards transferred to another customer, who, with his assent, was charged by the bankers with the debt of the obligor; that customer becoming insolvent the surviving bankers sued the obligor; it was held, that in the absence of any specific appropriation the money paid on account must be applied to the debt due at the death of the partner, and the money so paid being sufficient to cover that debt, the bond was discharged.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I think the agreement plainly shows that the appellant only became a guarantee to the firm of Patrick Cosgrave & Sons. In no other way can effect be given to the words \u201cmember or members for the time being constituting the firm of Patrick Cosgrave & Sons.\u201d I believe these words must have oeen inserted there inadvertently, but being there we must give effect to them. The appeal must be allowed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I cannot conceive the existence of the slightest relationship between the company here, the Cosgraves, who entered with partnership after the death of the senior partner, and Starrs.\nIn the first place there was a new partnership of the surviving members of the old one. \u2018J hey carried on business, not for the late partnership, nor for any one interested in that partnership, but for themselves. There was no time when the heirs-at-law of the deceased partner could not have enforced a settlement of the previous partnership. The law does not make a party answerable to any one unless by his own act. As soon as Patrick Cosgrave died the contract was put an end to, and I think the plaintiffs here have no cause of action. All the advances made to Quinn were paid for up to a certain time, after notice by the appellant that he would not be answerable under the contract.\nThe business was conducted for several years in the name of the sons, and then a company was formed. Now how can it be said that there was any privity of contract between Starrs and the company? What right had the company to carry on a contract entered into with totally distinct persons and hold the guarantor to another party answerable?\nI consider that the appeal should be dismissed, and judgment given in favor of the appellant with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. I do not think the appellant is answerable for any sales made after the death of Patrick Cosgrave.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that whatever right of action, if any there was, which the firm of Cosgrave & Sons constituted as it was after the death of Patrick, had against the defendant upon his guarantee, at the time of the execution of the instrument of the 2nd of October, 1882, that right has passed to the plaintiffs by force of that instrument and of that of the 13th December, 1882, and that therefore this action is well brought by the plaintiffs, if Cosgrave & Sons had such a right of action.\nThe learned counsel for the defendant in his argument before us contended that assuming the guarantee of the defendant to be a continuing guarantee until the 5th of April, 1882, as adjudged by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and to cover what was then due by Quinn to the firm of Cosgrave & Sons as then constituted, still the evidence showed such amount to have been subsequently and before action fully paid, and that therefore the Court of Appeal for Ontario should have adjudicated upon this point instead of directing a reference to the registrar of the divisional court to enquire and report thereon to that court. The parties at the trial certainly seem to have been of opinion that the evidence as taken was sufficient to enable a determination to be made not only of this point but upon all the points raised, when it was agreed that, upon the jury passing upon the single point agreed to be submitted to them, namely, whether the notice, admitting it to have been given, had not been retracted, as was alleged, then all the other questions should be submitted to the determination of the court. The defendant was, and now is, entitled to judgment in his favor upon this point or any of the points raised and which have all been argued before us, if the evidence be sufficient to warrant and require such judgment as it is contended that it is. The evidence shows Quinn to have been indebted to Cosgrave & Sons on the 5th April, 1882, in a sum varying from $5,931.56, according to Quinn\u2019s evidence, to $6,640 according to the evidence of John Cosgrave It also appears in evidence that between the 5th of April and the 2nd October, 1882, Quinn paid to Cosgrave & Sons $6,620.25, but that this sum was applied, or should have been, or was applicable, to the payment of the amount due on the 5th April, 1882, does not appear, for goods were delivered by Cosgrave & Sons to Quinn between the said 5th of April and 2nd of October to the amount of $6,000, and the manner in which the parties dealt appears to have been that Quinn was in the habit of giving his notes or acceptances to Cosgrave & Sons for the amounts of the several deliveries of the goods sold to him, which notes Cosgrave & Sons discounted and used the proceeds in their business. These notes, under what was deemed to be the authority of the provision in the guarantee relating to extension of time for pay- ment to Quinn, were, as they fell due, renewed, and their renewals were again from time to time renewed in whole or in part; Quinn\u2019s practice as to payments made by him appears to have been to remit moneys for the purpose of meeting particular notes falling due in the bank where they were. By exhibit No. 9, which appears to have been filed by the defendant, it appears that on the 5th April, 1882, there were in existence and discounted by Cosgrave & Sons ten notes given by Quinn which represented the goods previously sold to him, which notes were made payable at different times between the 6th of April and the 3rd of August, and that all of these notes were renewed at least once, and many of them several times, and that one of such renewals for $406.65, was dated the 2nd November, 1882, after the execution of the indenture of the 2nd October, and after the firm of Cosgrave & Sons had assigned all their estate, good will, debts and securities to Douglas in trust to be assigned to the plaintiff company when formed; now, if this exhibit is to be relied upon, and its correctness does not appear to be questioned, then there appears to have been still due by Quinn, when the plaintiffs became assignees of Cosgrave & Sans\u2019 assets, notes and securities, (in respect of sales made to Quinn by Cosgrave & Sons prior to the 5th April, 1882,) the sum of $2,759.11, which still remains due, and for which, if the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario be correct as to the continuance of the guarantee, the defendant is liable to the plaintiffs, unless he has become discharged from such liability by reason of the time given by Cosgrave & Sons to Quinn after the 5th April, 1882, and by the plaintiffs since the assignment to them.\nI understand it to have been contended by the learned counsel for the defendant, that by the books of the plaintiffs and all of Quinn\u2019s notes remaining still unpaid, and which were before the court at the trial, it appeared that the plaintiffs held notes or acceptances of Quinn\u2019s given payable to themselves, which have been discounted by them, and which were taken and received by them in renewal of the notes which were current in the hands of Cosgrave & Sons on the 2nd of October, 1882, and by which notes the plaintiffs have given an extension of time for payment of the moneys secured by the notes, which Cosgrave & Sons held on the said 2nd October in respect of goods sold prior to 5th April, 1882. This may have appeared at the trial, but I find a difficulty in tracing it upon the exhibits before us. If it be true, the parties must be aware of it, and a reference to ascertain it would involve a needless expense, but if it be true the defendant is, in my opinion, discharged and entitled to judgment in his favor upon this point, for the agreement in the guarantee as to the extension for time for payment which might be given to Quinn cannot, in my opinion, be construed to extend to the plaintiffs, who derive title only as the assignees of the assets, business notes, debts and securities, which belonged to the firm of Cosgrave & Sons; which firm upon the execution of the instruments of the 2nd October, 1882, became extinct; assuming the defendant\u2019s right to have judgment rendered in his favor to rest upon this point alone the reference ordered by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, does not appear to be large enough to authorize the taking of evidence upon this point, if the evidence given at the trial be insufficient; nor upon a point as to which the plaintiffs can so readily supply what evidence may be necessary, ought there be any necessity for a reference. Whether the defendant is discharged by the extension of time given by Cosgrave & Sons after the termination of the guarantee upon the 5th of April, as the Court of Appeal for Ontario has adjudged, of which extension of time extending over six months there is abundant evidence, has still to be considered, and as the consideration of this question seems to me to throw some light upon the question as to the continuing character of the guarantee, I propose to consider these two questions together. The authorities relating to the question of continuance of the guarantee, notwithstanding the death of Patrick, have been so fully reviewed by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeals that I do not propose to refer to them further than to say that the principle to be collected from them and which governs this case is, that the question whether or not the guarantee is to be construed as continuing in force after the death of Patrick is to be solved by ascertaining, upon a full consideration of the whole instrument, giving effect as far as possible to all of its clauses and provisions, what was the intention of the parties as appearing expressed in the instrument containing the guarantee, or to be gathered by necessary implication therefrom. I entirely agree with the majority of the Court of Appeals for Ontario that the clause which declares that it was mutually agreed upon that the defendant should be a continuing security\nTo the said parties of the first part or to the member or members for the time being constituting the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons to the amount of $5,000 to cover and protect any sales or advances now or hereafter to be made by the said parties of the first part, or any member or members of the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons, to the party of the second part (Quinn) so long as they may mutually deal together.\nand that portion of the clause containing the covenant of the defendant to the effect that in default of payment by Quinn for all goods sold to him at the times that might be agreed upon for the payment therefor, the defendant\nWill to the extent of five thousand dollars be liable to, and pay, the said parties of the first part, or the member or members for the time being constituting the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons\ndo seem to manifest the intention of the parties to have been that the guarantee should continue in force not only for the benefit of the three persons then parties of the first part who then constituted the firm of Cosgrave & Sons, but for the benefit also of some other persons, who, as was contemplated should, in the future, for the time being, constitute the firm, regarding it as having a continuing existence with a varying constituency; the whole instrument, however, must be taken together, and if there be some other clauses and provisions in the instrument which are inconsistent with this construction their effect may be to require a modification of the construction, to the extent even, if necessary, of wholly eliminating the words \u201cor to the member or members for the time being constituting the said firm of Cosgrave and Sons,\u201d wherever they occur. It is quite impossible, in my opinion, to construe them in the connection in which they are found with the words \u201cthe said parties of the first part,\u201d as meaning, as has been contended, the said Patrick, John and Lawrence Cosgrave or any or either of them. If the other clauses of the instrument require us to hold that the guarantee must determine upon and by reason of the death of Patrick, no sensible meaning can, I think, be attached to the above words and they must be wholly rejected. Whether or not they must be so rejected is the question. The construction of the instrument containing the guarantee is, as the plaintiffs contend, not merely that the defendant is surety for Quinn and guarantees the payment by him for all ale, porter, &c., sold to him by the firm of \u201cCosgrave and Sons,\u201d as it was constituted when the instrument was executed, but that he continues to be such surety for all sales made to him by the firm as constituted after the death of Patrick; and that the instrument being under seal the defendant\u2019s liability under it could not be terminated so long, as the firm, however constituted, should continue dealing with Quinn or at least not without payment, as a condition of such termination, of all moneys then remaining unpaid upon the sales made to him; and further, that the defendant is not merely guarantee for payments being made by Quinn at the expiration of the credit upon which the goods should be sold to him, but that it should be competent for the firm, however constituted from time to time, indefinitely, to give to Quinn extension of time for payment upon his promissory notes or acceptances, and that the defendant shall not be discharged by such extension of time being given, but shall continue liable to pay all such paper, however indefinitely renewed and even though the firm continued renewing after the notice of the 5th April was given and for such length of time as seemed pleasing to the firm. The right of the defendant to terminate by notice all liability for any goods that might thereafter be sold to Quinn cannot be doubted. It is well settled upon the authority of Orford v. Davies[27], Coulthart v. Clementson[28], and Lloyd v. Harper[29]. In the last case the distinction is pointed out between a guarantee for a thing done once for all as upon the appointment of a person to an office or employment guaranteeing his trustworthiness and fidelity during such employment and a guarantee like the present one for payment of goods to be sold from time to time to one upon whose behalf the guarantee is entered into, in which case the guarantee is divisible and attaches to each sale when made as a separate transaction; as to the payment for all previous sales being a condition precedent to, or concurrent with, the notice taking effect; no case in support of that contention has been found; however, in the present case defendant\u2019s liability as to those sales had not attached on the 5th of April, 1882, for at that time they were all covered by notes of Quinns then current which had been discounted by Cosgrave & Sons.\nNow the second clause of the instrument, which immediately follows that which declares the agreement of the parties as to the continuance of the security, provides as follows:\nAnd further, it is hereby agreed between the said parties hereto, that until all such sales and advances and every part thereof shall have been paid in cash, that these presents shall continue to be a good and valid security at law and in equity to the said firm of Cosgrave & Sons to the amount of $5,000, notwithstanding that they may from time to time receive other security, notes, bonds, deeds, conveyances or assignments of lands or goods or either of them, from the said party of the second part or any other person or persons as further security for the said sales or advances or any part thereof, and notwithstanding that they, the said parties of the first part or any of them, may extend the time of payment of the moneys due or any part thereof for any such salees or advances, and notwithstanding that they, the said parties of the first part, or any of them, may do any act, matter or thing that would release the said party of the third part at law or in equity from these presents were it not for stipulations herein contained.\n\u201cThe said firm of Cosgrave & Sons,\u201d in this clause must, I think, be construed as referring only to the firm, as then constituted, namely, Patrick, John and Lawrence, who are described in the first clause of the instrument as carrying on business as brewers under the name style and firm of Cosgrave & Sons of the first part; and the persons who may extend to Quinn the time for payment of the moneys due on sales to him are expressly declared to be \u201cthe said parties of the first part or any of them,\u201d these words \u201c or any of them\u201d in this connection having no more force than declaring that any of them may do what, the said parties of the first part that is to say, what the three of them might together do. Then in the next clause Quinn, the party of the second part to the instrument, in consideration of what has gone before, \u201cagrees with the \u201csaid parties of the first part\u201d to pay the price of all advances and sales of ale, porter and lager beer and of all casks, &c., &c., that may from time to time be sold to him \u201cby the said parties of the first part, or any of them,\u201d at the times that may be agreed from time to time for the payment thereof, and also to pay all notes, &c., &c., that may be given for the same.\n\u201cThe said parties of the first part\u201d in this clause must be construed as referring to the same Patrick, John, and Lawrence Cosgrave, and by this clause it is manifest that the only persons whom Quinn covenants to pay for all goods contemplated as to be sold to him on the faith of the instrument are \u201c the said parties of the first part.\u201d This covenant can only be construed as a covenant by Quinn with the parties to the instrument of the first part; that is, with Patrick, John and Lawrence Cosgrave jointly, to pay them the price of all goods to be sold by them, or any of them on behalf of all, to Quinn, and also to pay all notes, &c., &c., as may from time to time be given for the same goods. Then follows the covenant of the defendant that Quinn \u201cwill pay for all such sales,\u201d which words must be referred to the sales mentioned in the previous clause containing Quinn\u2019s covenant, that is to say, the sales to be made by the three persons who were the said parties of the first part, or any of them on behalf of all, and also all notes, &c., &c., that may be given for the same. Then as to these notes, &c., &c., in default of payment by Quinn the covenant contains these words:\nAnd also that in default of payment by the said party of the second part of all or any notes, &c., &c., that may be given by him to the said parties of the first part as security for any such sales or advances, or any part thereof, that he (the defendant) will pay the same.\nThis latter clause in connection with that first above extracted in full, seems to place beyond all doubt that the only persons who were competent to extend the time to Quinn for payment of goods sold to him, by from time to time taking notes, &c., &c., from him, without thereby discharging the surety, were \u201cthe said parties of the first part,\u201d to whom alone the notes were to be given, that is to say, Patrick, John and Lawrence Cosgrave, or any of them, acting on behalf of the three of them; and as it appears by the instrument, as I think it does, to have been the clear intention of the parties that the power of extending the time for payment of the price of the goods to be sold must belong to \u201cthe said parties of the first part,\u201d it follows that if the power of extending to Quinn the time for payment be limited, as I think it clearly is upon the sound construction of the clauses and provisions above extracted to Patrick, John and Lawrence Cosgrave jointly or to any of them on behalf of them all, it follows that they must be the only persons who are dealt with by the instruments as the vendors to whom alone the defendant became Quinn\u2019s guarantor and that therefore the guarantee came to an end upon the death of Patrick. The clauses and provisions which I have above extracted seem to me so plainly to demonstrate that the defendant only became guarantor to Patrick, John and Lawrence Cosgrave in respect of their joint sales to Quinn, that I do not think any effect can be given to the words, \u201cto the member or members for the time being constituting the said firm of Cosgrave and Sons,\u201d which have created all the difficulty and we must regard them as having been inadvertently introduced by the draftsman of the instrument. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal must be allowed with costs both in this court and in the Court of Appeal for Ontario and that the judgment for the defendant in the Divisional Court must be reinstated.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: O\u2019Gara & Remon.\nSolicitors for respondents: Boswell & Eddis.\n[1] 11 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCorporation\u2014Sale by Director to Company\u2014Ratification of by-law by shareholders\u2014Vote of owner of property.\nWhere a director of a joint stock company procured the passage, by the board of directors, of a by-law authorizing the sale to the company of his own property;\u2014\nHeld, that such by-law was illegal, and could not be ratified by the resolution of the shareholders of the company at a meeting subsequently called for the purpose of such ratification, which resolution was passed by a small majority obtained by the votes of the interested director.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case, which are fully set out in the first report2 may be briefly stated as follows:\u2014\nJames H. Beatty, one of the directors of the North-West Transportation Company, had a boat called the \u201cUnited Empire,\u201d which he was desirous of selling to the company. In order to effect such sale he became the owner of more than half the shares of the company, a few of which he transferred to the defendants, Rose and Laird, and at the first annual meeting thereafter the said James H. Beatty, and the defendants Rose and Laird, were elected directors and constituted a majority of the board, which was composed of five.\nThe board passed a by-law authorizing the purchase by the company of the said boat, and a meeting of the shareholders was subsequently called at which such by-law was confirmed, the said James H. Beatty being present and voting for such confirmation. Without his vote the resolution could not have been passed as he himself voted on nearly half the stock of the company, the capital stock being 600 shares, and there was only a majority of seventeen in favor of the resolution.\nThe plaintiff Henry Beatty, one of the shareholders of the company who voted against the resolution to confirm the by-law, took proceeding on behalf of himself and the other dissentient shareholders to have the sale of the said boat to the company set aside, and a decree was made by the chancellor[3] ordering it to be set aside. The Court of Appeal reversed this decree, holding that though the by-law was illegal the action of the shareholders was lawful, and effected a valid contract of sale. From this decision the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMowat Atty. Gen. for Ontario and McLennan Q.C. for the appellant.\nThis is a contest between J.H. Beatty and the other substantial shareholders of the company, none of whom had any interest in the property sold, and we seek to set aside the sale of the said Beatty\u2019s boat on the ground that he was both vendor and vendee in such sale. There are two cases in which a majority cannot bind a minority, one where the matter in question is ultra vires of the company, and the other where it is a fraud upon the company.\nThe present case is sui generis and the transaction is against the policy of the law. Re Pepperell[4].\nThe true rule to govern a case of this kind is laid down in Gregory v. Patchett[5]; see also Gray v. Lewis[6]; Menier v. Hooper Tel Works[7]; MacDougall v. Gardiner[8]; Mason v. Harris[9]; re London and Mercantile Discount Co.[10]; Pender v. Lushington[11]; East Pant du Mining Co. v. Merryweather[12].\nThe conduct of Beatty was most inequitable in forcing a sale of his property upon an unwilling minority, and the court will not permit a majority to act inequitably whether their conduct can be called fraudulent in the ordinary sense or not.\nThen again the extent of the transaction must be considered. The shareholders may sanction a moderate payment, but not a large one. Tennant v. Trenchard[13].\nThe transaction placed Beatty in a position inconsistent with his duty as a president, manager and director of the company. Davidson v. Tulloch[14].\nThere is authority for setting aside such sale, even if made by an outsider. See ex parte Chippendale, Re German Mining Co.[15]\nThen it is submitted that under the statute incorporating the company only the board of directors could make a contract of this kind, and the shareholders in general meeting had no power over it. If the board had made the contract, shareholders could not annul it. Then the converse is true. See 32 and 33 Vic. ch. 13 ss. 15, 16 and 22. Aberdeen Ry. Co. v. Blakie[16].\nThe following cases were also cited: Foster v. Oxford, &c., Ry. Co.[17]; Panama, & c., Tel. Co. v. India Rubber, &c., Tel Works Co.[18]\nRobinson Q.C. and MacDonald Q.C. for the respondents.\nOne always distrusts the assertion of a rule to prevent fraud, when coupled with a refusal to enter upon the question whether there is fraud in the matter or not. And here plaintiffs charged fraud in their bill and abandoned it on the hearing\nAccording to the contention of the appellants any measure could be defeated in which a party holding shares is interested. If so, what degree of interest would be required? A matter of principle does not admit of degrees, and therefore the slightest possible interest would be sufficient. We agree that the minority should be protected against the operation of fraud, but not on a mere technical rule against the interests of the company.\nThe question is, whether or not a shareholder is prevented from voting upon a question in which he has a present interest.\nSee Lindley on Joint Stock Companies[19]; Stevens on Joint Stock Companies[20], and Thring on Joint Stock Companies[21].\nA shareholder, in a meeting of shareholders, is not a trustee for anybody. He can do acts upon his shares which he could not do as a director. When he comes to the meeting of shareholders, his fiduciary character is gone. It is clear that J.H. Beatty could have distributed his stock among his friends and the same result would have been reached without the posibility of being questioned.\nIn Lushingtons case that was allowed in spite of a provision that the voting power of the stock should be limited and by the distribution the limit was excepted.\nIn re Stranton Iron and Steel Company[22], was a strong case to the same effect.\nI would refer also to Atwool v. Merryweather[23]; Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co.[24] I read this to rebut the contention that a case of this tenor and effect is shocking to the moral sense\nCumberland Coal Co. v. Sherman[25]; Imperial Credit Ass. v. Coleman[26].\nAnd, as bearing on the general principle, we cite Gregory v. Patchett[27], which is a very clear illustration of what a majority can do. Faulds v. Yates[28]; East Pant du Mining Co. v. Merryweather[29].\nPender v. Lushington, cited by my learned friends, has not the least bearing upon the right of a shareholder to vote when interested.\nThe distinction between a shareholder and a director is pointed out in the case of Smith v. Anderson[30], and that between a trustee and a director in Re Denham[31]; Flitcroft\u2019s Case[32].\nIf the shareholders could deal with this matter the action of the directors is immaterial. MacDougall v. Gardiner[33]; Great Luxembourg Ry. Co. v. Magnay[34]; Mason v. Harris[35]; Menier v. Tel. Co.[36] Mowat Q.C., Attorney General, in reply.\nThe case of Great Luxembourg Ry. Co. v. Magnay decides that a director of a company is a trustee. And the case of Bowes v. City of Toronto[37] decided that even a member of a municipal council is a trustee.\nThere are many other cases besides that of fraud where personal interest disqualifies.\nPender v. Lushington does not decide that shares may be distributed and votes used for all purposes.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Though it may be quite true, as a general proposition, that a shareholder of a company, as such, may vote as he pleases, and for purposes of his own interest, on a question in which he is personally interested, does that proposition necessarily cover this case? Is it not abundantly clear that, whatever a simple stockholder may do, no director is entitled to vote, as a director, in respect to any contract in which he is personally interested? Directors cannot manage the affairs of the company for their own personal and private advantage; they cannot act for themselves and, at the same time, as the agents of the corporation whose interests are conflicting; they cannot be the sellers of property and the agents of the vendee; there must be no conflict between interest and duty; they cannot occupy a position which conflicts with the interests of the parties they represent and are bound to protect. Is it not somewhat of a mockery to say that this by-law and sale were invalid and bad, and not enforceable against the company as being contrary to the policy of the law by reason of a director entering into the contract for his personal benefit where his personal interests conflicted with the interests of those he was bound to protect, but that it can be set right by a meeting of the shareholders, by a resolution carried by the vote of the director himself against a large majority of the other shareholders? If this can be done how has the conflict between self-interest and integrity ceased?\nWhile recognizing the general principle of non-interference with the powers of the company to manage its own affairs, this case seems to me to be peculiarly exceptional; a director, acting for the company, makes a sale, acting for himself, to the company, a transaction admittedly indefensible; this purchase is submitted to the shareholders, and the director, having acquired a controlling number of votes for this purpose, secures a majority by his own votes thus obtained without which the purchase would not have been sustained, and confirms as a shareholder his invalid act as a director, and thus validates a transaction against which the policy of the law utterly sets its face.\nIt does seem to me that fair play and common sense alike dictate that if the transaction and act of the director are to be confirmed it should be by the impartial, independent, and intelligent judgment of the disinterested shareholders, and not by the interested director himself who should never have departed from his duty. If he had done his duty and refrained from acting in the transaction as a director the by-law might never have been passed, and the contract of sale never entered into; and having acted contrary to his duty to his co\u2011shareholders he disqualified himself from taking part in the proceedings to confirm his own illegal act; and then to say that he was a legitimate party to confirm his own illegal act seems to me simply absurd, for nobody could doubt what the result in such a case would be, as the futileness of the interested, but discontented shareholders attempting to frustrate the designs of the interested director with his majority is too manifest; but he, if he had done his duty towards them and refrained from entering into the transaction, would never have been in the position of going through this farce of submitting this matter to the shareholders, and when so submitted of himself voting that he, though he had acted entirely illegally, had done right, and thereby binding all the other shareholders who thought the purchase undesirable; or in other words, by his vote carrying a resolution that the bargain he himself had made for the company as buyer, from himself as seller, was a desirable operation and should be confirmed.\nI cannot distinguish this case in principle from Erlanger v. The New Sombrero Phosphate Co.[38], in which a sale by promoters of a company was made to the company. Lord Penzance thus states the general doctrine:\nThe principles of equity to which I refer have been illustrated in a variety of relations, none of them perhaps precisely similar to that of the present parties, but all resting on the same basis, and one which is strictly applicable to the present case. The relations of principal and agent, trustee and cestui que trust, parent and child, guardian and ward, priest and penitent, all furnish instances in which the courts of equity have given protection and relief against the pressure of unfair advantage resulting from the relation and mutual position of the parties, whether in matters of contract or gift; and this relation and position of unfair advantage once made apparent, the courts have always cast upon him who holds that position the burden of showing that he has not used it to his own benefit.\nAnd Lord Cairns, speaking of the duty of promoters of a company, makes these observations:\nIt is now necessary that I should state to your lordships in what position I understand the promoters to be placed with reference to the company which they proposed to form. They stand, in my opinion, undoubtedly in a fiduciary position. They have in their hands the creation and moulding of the company; they have the power of defining bow, and when, and in what shape, and under what supervision it shall start into existence and begin to act as a trading corporation.\nIf they are doing all this in order that the company may, as soon as it starts into life, become, through its managing directors, the purchaser of the property of themselves, the promoters, it is, in my opinion, incumbent upon the promoters to take care that in forming the company they provide it with an executive, that is to say, with a board of directors, who shall both be aware that the property which they are asked to buy is the property of the promoters, and who shall be competent and impartial judges as to whether the purchase ought or ought not to be made. I do not say that the owner of property may not promote and form a joint stock company and then sell his property to it, but I do say that if he does he is bound to take care that he sells it to the company through the medium of a board of directors who can and do exercise an independent and intelligent judgment on the transaction, and who are not left under the belief that the property belongs, not to the promoter, but to some other person.\nThe following American cases, also, contain the same doctrine. Ogden v. Murray[39].\nGrrover J.:\nThis brings the case within the rule, which rests in the soundest wisdom, and is sustained by the best consideration of the infirmities of our human nature, and called for by the only safe protection of the interests of cestui que trust, or beneficiaries, viz., that trusties, and persons standing in similar fiduciary relations, shall not be permitted to exercise their powers, and manage or appropriate the property, of which they have control for their own profit or emolument, or, as it has been expressed, \u201cshall not take advantage of their situation, to obtain any personal benefit to themselves at the expense of their cestui que trust.\u201d\nThis by no means assumes that the trustees were not, in this case, in the actual exercise of the highest integrity. I cannot for a moment doubt that, in reference to the particular case before us; but the principle is one of great importance, and it forbids any inquiry into the honesty of a particular case.\nIn Mathew Ryan et al v. The Leavenworth, &c., Railway Co.[40] Horton C.J. says:\nThis contract was secured, through the votes and influence of members of the directory, who were directly interested in the procurement of such contract; and, the president of the corporation, in executing the same, while nominally representing the corporation, was really acting adverse to its interests and the interests of its stockholders and in the promotion of gain to himself and his co- partners. The elementary text books of authority, on the subject of corporations, lay down the rule that the fiduciary character of directors is such that the law will not permit them to manage the affairs of the corporation for their personal and private advantage when their duty would require them to work for and use reasonable efforts for the general interests of the corporation and its stockholders and creditors. The directors are the primary agents of the corporation and this relation requires of them the highest and most scrupulous good faith in their transactions for the corporation; and the general rule, that no trustee can derive any benefit from dealing with these funds of which he is a trustee, applies with still greater force to the state of things in which the interest of the trustee deprives the corporation of the benefit of his advice and assistance.\nIn European and North American Railway Co. v. Poor[41], Appleton C.J. says:\nThe underlying principle is that no man can serve two masters. He who is acting for others cannot be permitted to act adversely to his principals. The agent to sell cannot become a purchaser of that which he is the agent to sell, for his position as selling agent is adverse to and inconsistent with that of a purchaser. So, the agent to purchase cannot, at the same time, occupy the position of a seller. It is not that in particular instances the sale, or the purchase, may not be reasonable, but to avoid temptation, the agent to sell is disqualified from purchasing and the agent to purchase from selling. In all such contracts the sales or the purchases may be set aside by him for whom such agent is acting. The cestui que trust may confirm all such sale on purchases, if he deems it for his interest.\n* * *\nThe president and directors of a corporation must be held as occupying a fiduciary relation to the stockholders for and in behalf of whom they act. \u201cThe relation between the directors of a corporation and its stockholders,\u201d observes Johnson J., in Butis v. Wood[42], \u201cis that of trustee and cestui que trust.\u201d \u201cThe directors,\u201d remarks Romilly, master of the rolls, in the York and Midland Railway Co. v. Hudson[43], \u201care persons selected to manage the business of the company for the benefit of the shareholders.\u201d It is an office of trust, which, if they undertake, it is their duty to perform fully and entirely. Person, who become directors and managers of a corporation, place themselves in the situation of trustees; and the relation of trustees and cestuis que trust is, thereby, created between them and the stockholders, Scott v. Depeyster[44]. All acts done by the directors officially should be for the interest of the cestuis que trust. Holding a fiduciary relation they cannot be permitted to acquire interests adverse to such relation.\nIn Coleman et al. v. Second Avenue Railroad Co.[45] Grover J.:\nThat the grantees, directors, acting as directors and composing a majority of the board, could not make a bargain with themselves as individuals, binding upon the company to purchase their grant upon the term fixed by them as directors, is a point already determined by this court in Butts v. Wood[46]. If they could not as directors make such a contract obligatory upon the company, they could not by their acts as a board bind the company to pay them any specific sum for their grant.\nIn Wardell v. Railroad Co.[47]\nField J.:\nIt is among the rudiments of the law that the same person cannot act for himself, and, at the same time, with respect to the same matter, as the agent of another whose interests are conflicting. Thus, a person cannot be a purchaser of property, and, at the same time, the agent of the vendor. The two positions impose different obligations and their union would, at once, raise a conflict between interest and duty; and \u201cconstituted as humanity is, in the majority of cases, duty would be over borne in the struggle,\u201d Marsh v. Whitmore[48]. The law, therefore, will always condemn the transactions of a party in his own behalf, where, in respect to the matter concerned, he is the agent of others, and will relieve against them whenever their enforcement is seasonably resisted. Directors of corporations, and all persons who stand in a fiduciary relation to other parties, and are clothed with power to act for them, are subject to this rule: they are not permitted to occupy a position which will conflict with the interest of parties they represent and are bound to protect. They cannot, as agents or trustees, enter into or authorize contracts on behalf of those for whom they are appointed to act, and, then, personally participate in the benefits.\nIn Spering\u2019s Appeal[49], Sharswood J. says:\nIn Williams v. Page[50], Sir John Romilly said, in treating a director as a trustee: \u201cThe trust is no doubt a peculiar one.\u201d In Great Luxembourg Railway Co. v. Magnay[51], he held that if a director enters into a contract for the company he cannot personally derive any benefit from it. So, also, in ex parte Bennett[52], directors of a public company are trustees for the shareholders and their private interests must yeild to their public duty wherever they are conflicting. In Turquard v. Marshall[53], which is the last English case on the subject, Lord Romilly, master of the rolls, held directors liable, first, for not calling a meeting of the shareholders, under a clause of the charter requiring them to do so, on the exhaustion of their surplus fund, and, second, for loaning money, to one of themselves, without security, He used however this language: \u201cThat if directors have been guilty of gross and palpable breach of trust, which cannot be set right by a public meeting of the company, they may be made responsible for their misconduct.\u201d\nIn Port et al. v. Russell et al.[54], Buskirk J. says: The question presented for our consideration and decision is, can a director, in an incorporated company, become a contractor with the company, or can he have any personal and pecuniary interest in a contract between the company of which he is a director and a third person? We think the law is well settled, both in England and in this country, that he cannot. In the case of The Aberdeen Railway Company v. Blaikie[55], the house of lords, reversing the judgment of the Court below, held that a contract entered into by a manufacturer for the supply of iron furnishings to a railway company, of which he was a director or the chairman at the date of the contract, was invalid and not enforceable against the company. Lord Cranworth in delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201cA corporate body can only act by agents and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interest of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such an agent has duties to discharge of a fiduciary character towards his principal, and it is a rule of universal application that no one having such duties to discharge shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, or can have, any personal interest conflicting or which possibly may conflict with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect. So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of a contract so entered into. It obviously is, or may be, impossible to demonstrate how far, in any particular case, the terms of such a contract have been the best for the cestui que trust which it was impossible to obtain. It may some time happen that the terms upon which a trustee has dealt, or atetmpted to deal, with the estate or interest of those for whom he is a trustee, have been as good as could have been obtained from any other person; they may, even, at the time, have been better, but still, so inflexible is the rule, that no inquiry on that subject is permitted. The English authorities on this subject are numerous and uniform.\u201d\nThe three leading cases in this country are Michaud v. Girod[56]; Coal and Iron Company v. Sherman[57]; and the Hoffman Steam Coal Company v. Cumberland Coal and Iron Company[58]. In these cases will be found a full, able and exhaustive discussion of the question and a thorough examination of the English and American cases.\nIf this is so as regards promoters, why should it not apply with equal force to directors and shareholders selling to the company? This sale was not made through the medium of aboard of directors who would, could and did exercise an independent and intelligent judgment on the transaction, and it will be a bold man who will say that Mr. Beatty, either as a director or shareholder, was a competent and impartial judge as to whether the purchase ought or ought not to be made.\nIn my opinion, the whole policy of the law is against the recognition of such a transaction as this, which, if permitted, would open a door by which directors would be enabled successfully to subvert that wise rule which prevents a party from being at the same time buyer and seller, to the injury and wrong of dissatisfied shareholders, and whereby directors recreant to their duty may illegally benefit themselves at the expense of those whose interests it is their duty to protect by forcing the property on unwilling purchasers on their own terms, thereby subverting the commonly received idea, and treating as a vulgar error the ordinarily received notion, that it requires two to make a bargain.\nI think it is clear in this case that the defendant, a director, by his action as director, and by means of the majority secured by his own vote, obtained a benefit for himself at the expense of the minority, the rest of the shareholders. It may possibly be that the act of Mr. Beatty as a director in obtaining the passage of this by-law and making this sale and obtaining a sufficient number of votes to enable him thereby to carry a resolution, at a meeting of the shareholders, to confirm such sale, and by reason thereof ratifying and confirming the sale, may not be properly characterized as fraudulent; if not actually fraudulent it was, in my opinion, an illegal and oppressive proceeding on his part whereby the minority of shareholders were overreached and deprived of their right, and therefore the transaction was such a one as such a majority could not confirm and as should not be sustained in a court of justice.\nI rest this case entirely on the position Beatty held as a director and the duty which pertained to that office. In that view it is not necessary to discuss how far, or rather under what circumstances a shareholder may vote at a general meeting of shareholders on matters on which he is individually interested. I cannot, however, but look upon it as rather a bold and startling proposition that a shareholder should be able to offer a property for sale to the company from a bare majority of votes and by such vote, against the will of all the other shareholders, compel the company to become the purchaser at his own price and on his own terms, against the wish of all the other shareholders who may, as in this case, be a minority of 289 votes against 306.\nFOURNIES J.\u2014I entirely agree, for the reasons given by the learned Chancellor, that the appeal should be allowed. HENRY J.\u2014I concur in the decision of my learned brothers. In the first place, it involves a decision as to whether or not a shareholder has a right to vote on a matter in which he is personally interested, because, if he had such a right, then he could vote for this sale. I think it is competent for a shareholder so to vote at a meeting properly called. But this case does not depend upon that, because, in my opinion, the by-law passed by the directors was improperly passed and could not be confirmed by the shareholders.\nI may have no reason to suppose that Beatty did not consider it in the best interests of the company that they should become the owners of his vessel, and the evidence is favorable on that point; and without attributing any intentional wrong to him, we may inquire whether the by-law was, independent of that consideration, valid.\nThe decision of the directors in favor of the by-law was obtained by the votes of the party who was selling the property. It is well settled that the same party cannot be buyer and seller; a director of a company has a fiduciary character, and he is bound to exercise his functions in the best interests of the company. Where he is himself personally placed in interest in antagonism to the company, his acts are to be considered illegal. The by-law was, in this case, the foundation of the resolution of the shareholders; the directors would not have passed it, but for the vote of the party who was interested in making the sale. The shareholders would not have confirmed the by-law if Beatty had not purchased sufficient additional shares to give him a majority of the votes, so that, by his own act he occupied such a position as director and shareholder as enabled him to deal altogether in his own interests. Now this, if such were tolerated, would enable any person who intended to wrong a company to compel them to purchase, at an exorbitant price, property of which he was the owner. To sanction the exercise of such a power would be dangerous and wrong. I think the sale in this case was illegal, and the judgment of the court below should be reversed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The defendant, James Hughes Beatty, being the owner of 301 out 600 shares which constituted the whole capital of the North-West Transportation Company, and having built a steamship called the United Empire on the speculation of disposing of it to the company and being desirous of selling it to the company of which he was also a director, adopted the following mode of accomplishing his purpose. On the morning of the 7th February, 1883, on which day a general annual meeting of the shareholders was to be, and was, held, he assigned five of those shares to the defendant Laird and five to the defendant Rose who thereby became qualified to be elected directors of the company At the shareholders meeting of that day, a proposition was made by, or on behalf of the defendant James Hughes Beatty, that the company should become purchasers of the steamship, and the price at which the defendant would sell it was mentioned and a resolution was put to the meeting and carried, that a by-law of the company for the purpose of authorizing the purchase embodying the proposed terms, should be prepared and submitted to a special meeting of the shareholders to be convened on the 16th day of the said month of February, for the purpose of considering the same, and of authorizing or declining to authorize the purchase. At this meeting of the 7th February, the defendant James Hughes Beaty, William Beatty, Rose and Laird were elected directors of the company, and at a meeting of those directors, subse- quently held between that day and the tenth of the same month, the defendant, James Hughes Beatty, was elected president, the defendant, John Beatty, besides being a director continued to fill also the office of secretary-treasurer, which office he held from the first organization of the company.\nAt a meeting of directors held on the 10th of February, 1883, a by-law was prepared and approved of by the board for the purpose of being submitted to the special meeting of shareholders to be held on the 16th February, in pursuance of the resolution of the 7th of that month.\nThis by-law was as follows:\nWhereas in consequence of the loss of the steamer Asia and depreciation through wear and tear of the value of other steamers belonging to the company, the capital of the said company has been impaired and the carrying powers of the said company reduced, and it is therefore considered essential, in the interest of the company, and to maintain its efficient working, to purchase a steamer to replace the said steamer Asia. And whereas it has been agreed between the company and James Hughes Beatty, Esq., one of the directors of the said company, that the said company should buy, and the said James Hughes Beatty should sell to them, the steamer United Empire for the price or sum of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars to be paid as follows:\u2014Twenty thousand dollars in cash, and five thousand within five months from the date hereof, secured by promissory note of the company, with interest at seven per cent., and the balance in three equal payments on the first days of December 1883, 1884 and 1885, with interest at seven per cent. per annum on unpaid purchase money with privilege to the company to pay off the purchase money at any time or times, in sums of not less than $5,000, the said balance to be secured on the assets of the company hereinafter set forth. Therefore the North-West Transportation (limited) enacts as follows:\u2014\nThat the said company purchase from the said James Hughes Beatty, the said steamer at and for the said price or sum of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars payable and secured as hereinbefore recited.\nThat the president is hereby authorized to affix the seal of the company to a mortgage to the said James Hughes Beatty, on the following assets: The steamer, United Empire, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, to secure payment of the balance of one hundred thousand dollars, according to the terms hereinbefore recited and provided for the amount of unpaid purchase money as additional security.\nThat for the purpose of making the cash payment, the treasurer of the company may apply any funds in hand, which are not immediately needed for working expenses, and may borrow from any person or corporation on the credit of the company, such sum as may be necessary to make up the balance of the said cash payment.\nOn the 16th February the special meeting of shareholders was held at the office of the company in Toronto, for the purpose of considering the above bylaw, and of adopting or rejecting the same, which meeting was attended in person or by proxy by the holders of 595, out of the total number of 600 shares, constituting the capital of the company, and as appears by the following extract taken from the minutes of the meeting, the following proceedings took place:\nThe by-law, for the purchase of the steamer United Empire was submitted to the shareholders and read by the secretary, as also the agreement of Mr. James H. Beatty in the sale and completion of the said steamer, the said by-law having been passed by the directors at their meeting on the 10th instant, and said agreement having been executed the same day. The matter having been fully and freely discussed, it was moved by Mr. Laird, seconded by Mr. Rose, \u201cthat the by-law passed by the directors for the purchase of the said steamer be now confirmed\u201d Mr. James H. Beatty stating the $125,000 is the actual cost of the boat, including $4,000 for superintendence, $800 for expenses and interest on advances, and that he will lay before the board a detailed statement of cost including the above items, and will credit on said $125,000 any sum by which said cost shall not equal said $125,000, the company agreeing to pay any excess, such excess to be added to the $100,000 as mentioned in the by-law, and paid in three equal payments with said sum\u2014The vote having been taken by shares, it was declared carried, and the by-law thus adopted.\nObjections to the adoption of the by-law were made by Mr. Hankey (who held 71 shares), as follows:\u2014\n1. No necessity for the purchase of a new vessel.\n2. The valuation of the \u201cUnited Empire\u201d is excessive and unfair, and considering the extent of Mr. James H. Beatty\u2019s interest, such valuation should have been submitted to outside and disinterested arbitration.\nThe defendant, James H. Beatty, upon the vote for the adoption of the by-law gave 291 votes, which together with fifteen other votes, given by three of the other directors constituted the whole number, namely, 306 votes given in favour of the by-law, and the purchase of the steamer. The votes given against the bylaw and the purchase were 289 in number. The by\u2011law was thus carried, and the purchase made by the votes of the defendant, James H. Beatty himself alone, acting in the double and conflicting characters of vendor and vendee. The defendant could no more in this character act in such double and conflicting characters than he could as a director. He can no more, by his possession of 291 shares out of 600, compel the holders of other 289 shares to purchase his property against their will at his price, at a meeting of shareholders than he could do so, by his casting voice at the board of directors. The question is not as to the right of courts of justice interfering with the exercise by a shareholder in a company of his right of voting, which is incident to the possession of his shares, upon the ground of his having an interest in the matter upon which the votes are taken, different from that of the other shareholders, but as to the right of one shareholder in a company to use his controlling votes, to the exclusion of all shareholders dissenting from him, for the purpose of assuming to represent the company, and in its name to contract with himself for the purchase of his own property, on his own terms.\nThe question, in short, simply is whether a valid contract has been entered into by the company with the defendant, James Hughes Beatty, for the purchase from him of the steamer United Empire. Now to every valid contract of sale, there must be two perfectly independent parties\u2014the vendor and the vendee, if the latter be so under the control and influence of the former that the latter\u2019s assent to the purchase is obtained only by force of such control and influence, there is no valid contract, the assent of the vendees being given under compulsion of the vendor is no consent, and(there is no contract for the want of two assenting minds. Now this is exactly what has taken place here. The vendor while going through the form of submitting to the general body of independent shareholders the question whether the purchase shall be made or not, lays aside for a time his character of vendor and assumes that of vendee, and by force of his controlling number of votes neutralises the votes of all the independent shares, which are given against the purchase in the proportion of 289 to 15, and so the vendor, in the name of the company and assuming to act for it and to bind it, contracts with himself for the purchase of the vessel from himself, on his own terms and mortgages the whole of the assets of the company to himself to secure payment of the purchase money. It is impossible that such a transaction can be maintained; it is precisely such a one as comes within the designation of illegal oppression and (in the eye of a Court of Equity) fraudulent to use the language of Lord Justice James in MacDougall v. Gardiner[59]; but no such question arises here as did in that case which was, as to the sufficiency of the frame of the bill. In the present case, the statement of claim contains all the necessary averments in explanation of its being filed, not in the name of the company as plaintiff, but by the shareholder on behalf of himself, and all other shareholders who are prejudiced by the wrongful exercise by the defendant, James Hughes Beatty, of his controlling influence to consummate in the name of the company a transaction with himself, which is illegal and in the eye of a court of equity fraudulent.\nThat the three directors who gave the fifteen votes in favour of the purchase, which were the only votes so given except those of the vendor, did so in the belief and conviction, that the purchase was in the best interests of the company, and a fair and honest one, I do not entertain a doubt, and it may be that the defendant, the vendor himself, entertained the same belief, but his entertaining that belief is altogether beside the question and can afford no excuse for his assuming to bind the company as vendees, and in the name of the company to contract with himself as the vendor.\nThe case of East Pant Du United Lead Mining Co. v. Merryweather[60], which was much relied upon in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in support of this sale by the defendant vendor, to the company assenting thereto, only through the vendor assuming to bind them, is very distinguishable from the present case. There a bill had been filed in the name of a company as plaintiff\u2019s, alleging that a contract for the purchase of a mine on the part of the company had been fraudulently obtained by the defendant Merryweather and was void, and that he was not entitled to 600 shares, which had been allotted to him in respect of it, and praying that the purchase of the mine might be set aside, and the money returned to the shareholders who had advanced it. The defendant, Merryweather and two directors who sided with him, moved the court that this bill should be taken off the file on the ground that there had been no resolution of any majority of the shareholders authorizing the use of the company\u2019s name for that purpose, and that it was a bill filed without the sanction of the company.\nThe vice chancellor thought that the proceedings ought not to be stayed until the shareholders should have an opportunity of expressing their opinion as to whether they would adopt the bill or not, and the motion was ordered to stand over for that purpose An extraordinary general meeting was accordingly held for that purpose and after a protest had been made at the commencement of the proceedings against Merry-weather\u2019s presence, and right to vote, a motion was made for the adoption of the bill, this was met by an amendment to refer all matters in difference between the shareholders and Merryweather to arbitration and to stay all proceedings. Upon a poll being taken the amendment was carried by a majority of twenty votes. 78 of the votes given for the amendment were given by Merryweather, so that if these should be excluded, the motion in adoption of the bill would have been carried.\nIn this state of things the motion to take the bill off the file as not being authorized by the company was renewed, and the only question was, whether a bill could be filed in the name of the company by a minority of the company, charging fraud against some of the majority, and alleging that these persons were not to be considered as shareholders or entitled to vote. The question was one as to practise and pleading. The late Sir John Rolt, who was counsel, making the motion, admitted that a bill might have been framed though not in the name of the company as plaintiffs. The single question before the vice chancellor Sir W. Page Wood was: \u201cHad the company sanctioned the suit? To \u201cdecide,\u201d says the learned vice chancellor, \u201cthat it has \u201cdone so, would be to discard Mr. Merry weather\u2019s \u201cvotes and to do that, would in effect be to decide now \u201con this application the question at issue in this suit.\u201d\nThe question raised by the bill was, whether the contract, in virtue of which alone, Merryweather acquired the shares, was valid or not. To discard the votes would have been in effect to pronounce the contract to have been invalid, a point not raised by the motion to take the bill off the file, and so, on such a motion, to decide a point only put in issue by the bill. There was no alternative left but to order the bill to be taken off the file and to leave the objecting shareholders to frame their bill on their own behalf, and not in the name of the company as plaintiffs, as it was admitted by Sir John Holt in argument, they might have done.\nSo in Pender v. Lushington[61] the plaintiff Pender was the registered holder of 1,000 shares in the Direct United States Cable Company, he was also the chairman of the Globe Telegraph and Trust Company, which was worked in connection with the Anglo American Telegraph Company. On the 2nd February, 1877, an extraordinary general meeting of the company was held, pursuant to notice, at which Pender moved a resolution in these terms:\u2014\nThat it is expedient to put an end to the present antagonism of this company towards the Anglo American Telegraph Company and its connections, and to work this company\u2019s cable in friendly alliance with their lines; and that a committee of shareholders be appointed to be named by the meeting to confer with the directors as to the best method of giving effect to this resolution, and to report to the shareholders at such time as the meeting shall appoint.\nThis resolution was seconded and put to the meeting whereupon an amendment was moved by a shareholder, and was seconded and put to the meeting by the chairman and declared to be carried. A poll being demanded by Mr. Pender, the meeting was adjourned to the 5th February, when the poll should be taken. At the adjourned meeting it appeared from the report of the scrutineers that according to the number of votes recorded, there would have been a majority of votes against the amendment, but the chairman ruled out 649 votes and declared the amendment carried by a majority of 609. Mr. Pender then moved a second resolution, and the votes were again taken, and the resolution would have been carried, but the chairman ruled out the same votes as before, and it was accordingly lost. The grounds on which the chairman ruled out these votes, were that they were given in respect of shares, which had been transferred by certain large shareholders in the Direct United States Cable Company and with the object of increasing the voting powers of the transferors, and of furthering the view of the Globe Telegraph and Trust Company. These shares had been duly transferred to their present holders three months before the meeting was held according to article 59 of the articles of association, and the names of the holders were on the register. An action was then brought by Pender on behalf of himself and all the other shareholders of the Direct United States Cable Company, who voted against the amendment to the first resolution, and in favour of the second resolution at the said meetings and the said company as plaintiffs against Lushington and others, the directors of the same company as defendants. A motion was then made on behalf of the plaintiffs, to restrain the defendants from ruling out the 649 votes, and acting contrary to the second resolution, until the hearing of the action. Now, the question involved in this motion was simply whether the fact of the plaintiff having an interest in another company, and which the defendants and those acting with them had not, which special interest of the plaintiffs constituted the motives of their actions made illegal the transfer of shares by the plaintiffs to their own nominees, having otherwise no interest in the company, for the purpose of thereby increasing the voting power of the plaintiff, and which transfer of shares was in other respects within the provisions of the articles of asso- ciation, and whether the plaintiff, by reason of his interest in the other companies, was deprived of the right to have the votes of the transferees of shares counted on the poll which was taken.\nThis is the question to which the observations of the master of the rolls, Sir George Jessel, applies, when he says:\nIf these shareholders have a right of property, then I think all the arguments which have been addressed to me as to the motives which induced them to exercise it are entirely beside the question \u201cand again\u201d there is, if I may say so, no obligation on a shareholder of a company to give his vote merely with a view to what other persons may consider the interests of the company at large. He has a right if he thinks fit, to give his vote from motives or promptings of what he considers his own individual interest \u201cand again.\u201d I am not going to give any opinion as to what the effect of the resolutions may be, when passed. The only point on which I am asked to decide is to say they ought to have been passed, in other words, that there was a majority for them, and to restrain the defendants until further order from acting in contravention of them.\nNow, if the only question in the present suit was merely whether the fact that the defendant James Hughes Beatty had a special interest in the adoption of the question, submitted to the meeting, which the other shareholders had not, deprived him of the right of voting on the question this case might be referred to as an authority that it did not, but the question in the two cases are very different, and it is the difference in the questions voted upon and the conflicting nature of the interests and the opposing character of the positions, which the defendant assumed to represent and act in, and not the mere fact of his having an interest different from that of the other shareholders which makes the difference. In Pender v. Lushington the question was merely upon which side was the majority of votes in point of fact given without any enquiry as to the effect of the resolution; in the present case, the question is, as to the effect of a resolution carried by the sole con- trol of a vendor of a chattel, who assumed to act also in the character of vendee, and insists upon his right of thus perfecting as valid, a contract made by himself as representing the company, in which he is as shareholder and director, with himself as vendor of the chattel for the purchase of his property upon his own terms. 80 likewise the case of Mason v. Harris[62], relied upon in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeal supports the contention of the appellant. Whatever may have been the motive of the defendant in forcing his steamer upon the company, or in attempting so to do, namely whether he did or did not bon\u00e2 fide, believe it to be the interest of the company, to acquire the steamer on the terms named, the transaction is no less one in which the defendant assumed to fill the inconsistent and conflicting positions of vendor and vendee, and by reason thereof the essential condition to the creation of a valid contract was wanting.\nThe appeal therefore must be allowed with costs, and the judgment of the learned chancellor must be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Mowat, MacLellan, Downey & Langton.\nSolicitors for respondents: MacLaren, McDonald, Merritt & Shepley.\n[1] 11 Ont.

Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nSale of land\u2014Warranty against caress and incumbrances\u2014Promise to pay without reserve by subsequent deed with knowledge of assessment\u2014Interest, agreement as to\u2014Compensation\u2014Cross appeal\nOn the 28th June, 1877, the appellants entered into an agreement before Hunter, N. P. by which without any reserve they acknowledged to owe and promised to pay certain sums of money, amongst others to Mrs.L., transferee of one of the vendors, who on the 3rd April, 1875, sold the Windsor Hotel property in Montreal to the appellants, and by the same deed Mrs. L. agreed to assist the appellants in obtaining a loan of $350,000, to relinquish the priority of her hypothec for her share on the property, and also to extend to 6 years the period for the payment of the balance due her, waiving any right to interest until the appellant company had an available surplus after paying interest and insurance in connection with the new loan. Subsequently, on 15th June, 1880, Mrs. L., by notarial deed, transferred to the respondent the balance alleged to be due her under the deed of the 28th June, 1877, and the respondent brought an action to recover this balance with interest from 1st July 1877, to the 15th December, 1885, date of the action.\nTo this action the appellants pleaded inter alia, that under the deed of the 28th June, 1877, interest could be demanded only from the 1st July, 1881, the secretary of the company having on said date testified for the first time there was an available surplus: and also that both principal and interest were compensated by the sum of $1,901.70 paid the city for assessments imposed under 42 and 43 Vic. ch. 53, P.Q., for the cost of public improvements made in the vicinity of the property prior to the sale of the property to the company in 1875. The assessment rolls originally made for these improvements were set aside by two judgments in 1876 and 1879.\nHeld\u2014affirming the judgment of the court below that under the circumstances the respondent, cannot be said to be the garant of the purchasers of the said puppetry, and therefore he is entitled to the payment of the balance alleged to be due under the deed of the 28th June, 1877, no Withstanding any claim the appellants might have against their endorse under the general warranty stipulated in the deed. of purchase of .April 1875\nHeld also, that by the terms of the deed of the 28th June 1877 interest could be recovered only from this of July 1881.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing. respondent's action.\nThe suit was brought by the respondent t\\ recover from the appellants a balance which the latter Knowledged to owe and promised to pay to Mary Ann Lampbell, widow of Elisha Lane, by a deed executed 1fore Hunter, N. P., on the 28th Juno, 1877, and transferred to the respondent by deed before the same notary 26th June, 1882, duly signified.\nThe facts which gave rise to the litigation between the parties are as follows .\nOn the 3rd of April 1875, David Torrance Mary Lunn, Julia Lunn, Emma H. Lunn, and Alexander H. Lunn, sold to the company, appellants, the property on which the Windsor hotel has been since built in the city of Montreal, for the sum of $112212 whereof $18,702 were paid, leaving a balance of $93510 unpaid.\nAlexander EL Lunn, one of the vendors, transferred to Mrs. Lane on the 7th June 1876 his share of the purchase money, and by deed of the 28th June, 1877 the company agreed to pay Mrs. Lane, representing one of the vendors, and the other vendors, $86,034.46 (1) 4 Dorion's Q. B. Rep. 280 S. C. M. L. R.1 Q. B. being 871\/2 per cent, of their claim in principal and R interest. Mrs. Lane and the vendors David Torrance and others, excepting Alexander H. Lunn, who was not a party to the deed, agreed to assist the company in obtaining a loan of $350,000 and to relinquish the priority of their hypothecs upon the property, and also to extend to six years the period for the payment of the balance due them, they relinquishing and waiving a any right to exact and require any interest upon the a amount of said balance until the net revenues of the company shall be sufficient to pay the annual liabilities of the company for interest, insurance, etc., in connection with the said loan of $350000 after which \"the would be entitled to receive interest to the e extent of 7 per cent., out of the surplus of revenue, \"according to its sufficiency.\"\nPrevious to the sale of the property to the company, certain, public improvements had been made in the vicinity by the opening of Stanley street and of Dominion square, and the property had been assessed for a share of the costs of these improvements. The claim of the city was, however, disputed, and by the deed of sale of 3rd of April, 1875, the vendors reserved all right of action, claims and demands they might have against the mayor, aldermen and citizens of Montreal for the recovery of the special assessment for the opening of Stanley street and for the drain in said street paid by the vendors to the corporation,\nBy two judgments rendered in 1876 and 1879 the assessment rolls, by which the property sold to the company had been charged with a proportion of the cost for opening and widening Stanley street and for opening Dominion square, Were set aside.\nSubsequently the city obtained from the provincial legislature authority to cause other assessment rolls to be made for the purposes of assessing, in whole or in part, the cost of the improvements already made upon all and every the pieces or parcels of land or real estate which the commissioners (to be named) should determine to have been benefited. (Act of 1879 42 and 43 Vict, ch. 53 s. 4 \u00a7 1 and 4.)\nNew assessment rolls were made under this act and the commissioners having determined that the property of the company was benefited by the improvements referred to assessed the amount to be paid by the company to the sum of $522900 for the opening and widening of Stanley street, and to the sum of $1350 for the opening of Dominion square.\nThese two sums, with interest, amounting in all to $1,901.70 were paid in 1882 by the company who was subrogated to the rights of the city.\nThe pleadings sufficiently appear in the head note and are fully set out in the report of the case in the court below.\nAt the hearing of the case before the Superior Court the secretary of the company testified that it was only since July, 1881, that the company had a net surplus available to pay interest on the claim of the respondent and judgment was rendered on the 9th June, 1884, declaring the compensation pleaded by the appellants to have taken place and dismissing respondent's action.\nThe Court of Queens Bench for Lower Canada (anneal side) on the 25th September, 1885, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and condemned the appellants to pay the respondent the sum of $1,801233, with interest from the 17th December 1883 and costs.\nFrom this judgment the present appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and the respondent filed a cross appeal claiming to be entitled to interest on the capital from the 1st of July, 1877 under the deed of agreement of the 25th June. 1877 The principal question which arose on this appeal was as to the right of the appellants to set off, in compensation of the respondent's demand for a balance due under a deed of sale the amount of certain special assessments on the property sold, which they were afterwards compelled to pay or in other words whether the respondent was a warrantor ?\nPaynuelo, Q.O., and Abbott, for appellants, contended on this point that the respondent, as representing one of the vendors under the said deed of sale was bound equally and jointly and severally with the other vendors to warrant the appellants, and indemnify them for the payment of the amount of these assessments, which were created before and existed at the time of the granting of the deed of sale.\nThe germ of the obligation was in existence and they were liable for the cost of the improvement as fixed by the subsequent assessment roll, whenever made.\nThe fact of the respondent being a transferee does not relieve him from this claim of compensation. There is nothing to show that the assignment to him was accepted by the company defendants. The Iransfer from Mrs. Lane to him was only signified upon the company on the 14th December, 1883; but there was no acceptance by the company of that assignment, or of the assignment to Mrs, Lane, which never appears to have been signified to them. And any acceptance which might be inferred from the agreement of June, 1877, was before any right to claim compensation existed.\nThe learned counsel cited Pothier Comminute ([2]) Marcade ([3]) Laurent ([4]) Arts Civil Code ([5]) Black well Tax Titles ([6]). Geoffion for respondent.\nThe agreement contained in the notaries document of the 28th June 1877 settled the relations and obligations of the parties towards each other, and precludes the appellants from raising the questions put forward by them\nThat document formally recognized Mary Ann Campbell as a creditor, and distinctly undertook to pay her according to its terms.\nIt made no allusion whatever to the debt having been originally created as part of the consideration of the purchase of property nor to its having come by transfer from Torrance et al.\nThe appellants must be considered to have waived, as far as Mary Ann Campbell was concerned, any demand they may have had against Torrance et al., or otherwise, and to have given her the assurance that she might rely upon them for her payment.\nHer case is much stronger than that provided for by Art. 1192 C. C, which itself is very clear that provides merely for an acceptance of notice of the assignment; but here a debtor distinctly acknowledged to owe and promised to pay a debt, without reference to its having proceeded from another party by transfer.\nThe learned counsel also referred to Larombiere ([7]); Demolombe ([8]); Civil Code ([9]); Dalloz Vo. Vente ([10]).\nTASCHEREAU J. delivered the judgment of the court: The respondent as transferee of a balance due by the appellants on the purchase price of the property known as the Windsor hotel and whose assignment had been accepted by the debtors, sued the appellants for the same. The appellants claim that the sale from Torrance et al. of 3rd April 1875 was made with warranty and being respondent's auteur they are bound to a warrant the appellants against charges and incumbrances. We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed for the reason given by Chief Justice Sir A. A.Dorion, that even supposing the vendors to have been under the general warranty stipulated in the deed of sale of 3rd April 1875 liable to reimburse the sums paid by the company on the assessment rolls made under the Act of 1879 the respondent is not one of the vendors nor bound to the warrant stipulated in that deed of sale. He did not sue on this deed of sale but upon the deed of the 28th June 1877 which was duly signified and by which the appellants promised to pay Mrs. Lane, respondent's transferor, without any reserve the sum he claims this promise having been made by the company after full knowledge of all the circumstances, and after one of the original assessment rolls had been set aside. Under such circumstances the respondent cannot be held to be a garant of the said company and therefore this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAs to the cross appeal we are of opinion that the court below properly held that the interest should be allowed only from the 1st July, 1881.\nAppeal dismissed with costs and cross appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Abbott, Tait, Abbott and Campbell.\nSolicitor for respondent: Selkirk Cross.\n[1] 4 Dorion's Q.

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nFire insurance\u2014Condition in policy\u2014Loss by explosion\u2014Loss by fire caused by explosion\u2014Exemption from liability.\nA policy of insurance against fire contained a condition that \u201cthe company will make good loss caused by the explosion of coal gas in a building not forming part of gas works, and loss by fire caused by any other explosion, or by lightning.\u201d\nA loss occurred by the dropping of a match into a keg of gunpowder on the premises insured, the damage being partly occasioned by the explosion of the gunpowder, and partly by the gunpowder setting fire to the stock insured. The company admitted their liability for the damage caused by fire but not for that caused by the explosion.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, Taschereau J. dubitante, that the company were not exempt by the condition in the policy from liability for damage caused by the explosion.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas Division[2] in the suit against the Guardian, and that of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[3] in the suit against the Northern, both of which judgments were in favor of the defendants.\nThese two cases were precisely similar, the insurance effected in the two companies being the same premises and goods. The fire by which the loss occurred to the plaintiff was caused by a burning match being dropped into a keg of gunpowder, which exploded and set fire to the stock insured. A part of the loss was occasioned by the explosion, and a part by the subsequent fire, and the insurance companies claimed to be liable for the latter only, under the 11th statutory condition of ch. 162 R.S.O. which provides that \u201cthe company will make good loss caused by the explosion of coal gas in a building not forming part of the gas works, and loss by fire caused by any other explosion or by lightning. The amount of the loss caused by fire was paid into court and payment of the balance refused. The plaintiffs brought suit for such balance and submitted the facts to Chief Justice Wilson without argument, and a formal verdict was entered for the plaintiffs in such case which was set aside by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. The insurance companies appealed from the decision of the latter court to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGibbons for the appellants.\nIt is submitted that an explosion by gunpowder is a fire, it being, in fact, the action of a vapid fire.\nSee Scripture v. Lowell Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[4] where the authorities on this question are reviewed.\nThe following cases refer to the distinction between such an explosion causing fire and one not: Waters v. Merchants\u2019 Louisville Ins. Co.[5]; City Fire Ins. Co. v. Corlies[6]; Everett v. London Assurance[7]; Taunton v. Royal Ins. Co.[8] Lightning causing fire is covered by ordinary insurance against fire.\nIn the present case there is an express provision in regard to explosion which distinguishes it from Stanley v. Western Ass. Co.[9], relied upon by the company.\nSee also Citizens\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Parsons[10] Exception must be strong to relieve the insurance company, Harper v. New York Ins. Co.[11]; Barbat v. Allen[12]\nMarsh for the respondents.\nWe have paid for all the loss caused by fire, and did not insure against loss by explosion. Even if the explosion is a fire, it is not such a fire as is insured against. The policy insures against \u201cfire,\u201d using the word in its general, not in its scientific, sense. The company are liable for loss by fire caused by an explosion, but not for loss by explosion not caused by fire.\nBut there is one case in which the company is liable for loss by explosion, namely, by explosion of coal gas. That necessarily excludes liability for loss by any other explosion. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. See Aspdin v. Austin[13], Hare v. Horton[14], Blackburn v. Flavelle [15]\nIf the fire had caused the explosion we might be liable for the loss by the latter, but here the explosion was the proximate cause of the loss. I would also refer to Everitt v. London Ins. Co.[16], Bunyon on Ins.[17], Babcock v. Montgomery Mutual Ins. Co.[18]\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The policy of assurance upon which this suit was brought is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cSum assured $7,000. Premium $35.00.\nWhereas Messrs. Hobbs, Osborn & Hobbs, London, have paid the sum of thirty-five dollars to the undersigned, Greorge Denholm, as authorized agent at Montreal, of the Guardian Fire and Life Assurance Company, of London; being the premium for insuring from loss or damage by fire, the property hereby described; not exceeding the sum specified on each article, namely:\u2014\nOn a four storey and basement brick building 31 by 100 feet, covered with patent roofing owned and occupied by the assured as a wholesale hardware store, situate and being Nos. 343 and 345 Richmond street, London, Ontario; adjoined by similar class buildings on either side as per application and diagram fyled in this office.\u201d\nI adopt the conclusions arrived at in Scripture v. Lowell M.F. Ins. Co.[19], that where the effects produced are the immediate results of the action of a burning substance in contact with a building, it is immaterial whether these results manifest themselves in the form of combustion or explosion or of both combined. In either case the damage occurring is by the action of fire and covered by the ordinary terms of the policy against loss by fire\nThe policy in this case being an ordinary policy against fire, the liability of the company to indemnify the assured would, in my opinion, be beyond question unless the assured\u2019s right to recover is barred by reason of the terms of the 11th statutory condition which reads as follows:\u2014\n11. The company will make good loss caused by the explosion of coal gas in a building not forming part of gas works and loss by fire caused by any other explosion or by lightning.\nI think this condition was not intended to limit but rather to extend, or at any rate to make clear, the liability of the insurer to losses caused by the explosion of coal gas in any building not forming part of gas works, and to make liable the company for loss by fire caused by any other explosion, and not to limit or restrict the right of the assured to recover for a loss by the action of fire, whether the results of such action is in the form of combustion or explosion, the same being such a loss as would be covered by the ordinary terms of a policy against loss by fire, in other words, was not intended to change the contract as entered into in the policy and alter the risk as expressed on the face of the policy, and I think this is abundantly manifest from the preceding section, which is as follows:\u2014\n\u201c10. The company is not liable for the losses following from a to f inclusive:\na. In case of non-ownership.\nb. Riot, invasion, &c.\nd. Goods to which fire heat is being applied.\ne. Repairs by carpenters, &c.\nf. For loss or damage occurring while petroleum, rock, earth, or coal oil, camphine, burning fluid, benzine or any liquid products thereof, or any of their constituent parts (refined coal oil for lighting purposes only, not exceeding five gallons in quantity, excepted,) or more than twenty\u2011five pounds weight of gunpowder are stored or kept in the building insured or containing the property insured unless permission is given in writing by the company.\u201d\nSurely if the legislature had intended to exclude from liability such a loss, admittedly covered by the policy, as an explosion by gunpowder, we should have found it in the category of losses for which the company is not liable, but a critical reading of the condition excludes the construction of the defendants. It says the company shall make good a \u201closs by fire caused by any other explosion or by lighting,\u201d but it does not say the company shall make good a loss by explosion caused by fire, which is the loss covered by the terms of the policy, but by fire caused by explosions. An explosion of steam or dynamite by concussion might overturn an oil lamp in the same or in the adjoining building whereby the building was injured and burnt; in such a case there would be a loss by fire caused by the explosion, and for such, under the terms of the contract, the insurer would be liable.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed and verdict for plaintiff restored.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of allowing the appeal on the grounds stated by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an action on a policy of insurance issued to the appellants by the respondent company for $5,000 on a four-storey stone and brick building, having basement, owned by the insured, occupied as a hardware store (wholesale), situate on the west side of Richmond street, London, Ontario, against destruction or damage by fire, but subject to the terms and conditions printed on the back of the policy, which were to be taken as part of the policy.\nThe provisions required by the Insurance Act for variations from the statutory conditions were not adopted in the policy, and we are, therefore, to consider the rights of the parties in this case by applying those conditions as against those in the policy which conflict with them in favor of the appellants.\nWe are then to inquire how the loss occurred, and to what to attribute it. The question for our decision is whether, under the circumstances, the respondent company is liable for damage to the property covered by the policy not occasioned by the immediate action of fire, but through an explosion. If an explosion from any other cause than that of fire took place, without causing fire in the building insured, it could not be contended that any liability would arise, unless specially provided for either in the conditions of the policy or those prescribed by the Act.\nAn explosion in a building might be the cause of serious damage, but the general provision of the policy against damage by fire would not cover it; but if fire resulted, and damage was done thereby, such damage would be covered under the 11th statutory condition: \u201cThe company will make good loss caused by the explosion of coal gas in a building not forming part of gas works, and loss by fire caused by any other explosion or by lightning.\u201d\nThe judgments of all the learned judges who decided this case in favor of the respondents are founded on their construction of that statutory provision. With every deference to opinions justly entitled to great weight and consideration, I feel constrained to say that in my opinion that statutory condition does not affect in any way the merits of the contest between the parties, and that the contract in, the body of the policy is the governing one in this case,\u2014and I do not think the appellants need invoke the aid of the statutory condition, nor do I think that its provisions can aid the respondents.\nThe policy and the loss or damage are admitted, but the respondents allege that under the statutory condition they are not liable.\nIt is not so much a question of law as of fact that we are called on to decide. The policy is an indemnity against loss or damage by fire, and the legitimate inquiry is therefore to ascertain if the loss in this case caused more immediately by the explosion had or had not its origin in fire; and if we decide that question in the affirmative, then the only one left is as to subsequent results. We have to decide whether the fire was caused by the explosion, or the latter caused by the former.\nThe evidence upon that point is to be found in the \u201cstatement of facts,\u201d agreed upon as follows: \u201cThe said loss was occasioned by some employees accidentally setting fire to some gunpowder stored in the premises insured.\u201d Which, then, in the order of time was first, the explosion or the fire? Which caused the other? Did not the fire precede the explosion? If it did, how can it be said that the explosion caused the fire. It is said the company is not liable for a loss caused by explosion, nor would they be if it was an explosion not preceded by fire. Without the fire there would have been no explosion, and the damage was occasioned by the explosion as the immediate result of the fire. The damage was, therefore, through the agency of the explosion caused by the fire. The time the fire was burning is of but little consequence, and if it caused the explosion, it is unimportant how long it lasted before the explosion took place. Suppose that instead of the almost instantaneous explosion, which I presume took place in the appellants store, a fire had accidentally caught in some ignitable substances and after progressing for hours had reached and exploded gunpowder or some other explosive substances, and damage thereby was done to the insured property, could it be gravely argued that the subsequent explosion was not caused by the fire? The proposition to my mind, admits but of one solution. As well might it be said, in the case of three men standing on the verge of a precipice, one violently shoves a second against the third, who, by the violence, is thrown over the precipice and killed, that his death was occasioned by the second man who was pushed against him. The fire in this case took effect on the gunpowder, and the latter, influenced and promoted by the former, did the damage as the immediate and not remote result of the primary cause.\nI think the defence not sustainable either under the contract in the body of the policy, or within the terms of the 11th statutory condition pleaded by the respondents, and, as the legal result, that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned judge who tried the action affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I have had some difficulty in reaching this conclusion, and if my judgment could have affected the case, I might have decided on dismissing the appeal. I will not dissent, however, though I was much impressed by the arguments of the judges in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By reason of the neglect of the defendants to endorse on these policies the statutory conditions with variations, as required by the Act to secure uniform conditions on policies of fire insurance, ch. 162 of the revised statutes of Ontario, these policies must be read as being subject to the statutory conditions only. The policies are for indemnity against all loss by fire, but loss by fire only happening to the property insured, which consists of a hardware warehouse and the stock of hardware therein, subject, however, to the exceptions and qualifications specified in the 10th statutory condition, and subject also, to such exception and qualification, if any, as may be contained in the 11th of such conditions, which is as follows:\nThe company will make good loss caused by the explosion of coal gas in a building not forming part of gas works, and loss by fire caused by any other explosion or by lightning.\nSome of these statutory conditions, if care be not taken by inserting variations framed so as to adapt the conditions to the particular property insured in each case, may prove to be inapplicable in some cases; for it must be always borne in mind that, although the act requires that when they are not endorsed on the policy with variations in the manner pointed out in the Act the statutory conditions alone without any variations are to be imported into the contract contained in every policy; they must be imported and read in their proper place and character, that is to say, not as what they are not, but as what they are, namely, conditions only, to which the contract, which is in the body of the policy, and is a contract of indemnity against loss to the insured property by fire, is subject. Now the contracts contained in these policies being for indemnity against any loss by fire which should happen to the insured property, subject to such qualification, if any, as is contained in the 11th condition, what is that qualification, if there be any?\nThe condition begins with an affirmation of liability in a particular case terminating with an implied negation of liability in another case. The affirmation is that \u201cthe company will make good loss\u201d\u2014what loss? Plainly only such as can be said to come within their contract for indemnity against loss by fire contained in the body of the policy, for they could be liable to make good no other\u2014\u201cOccasioned by the explosion of coal gas.\u201d Now loss occasioned by explosion of coal gas occurring on the insured premises unless specially excepted, would be a loss within the contract of indemnity contained in the body of the policy, but in reading this condition in connection with the particular property here insured, it is not merely to an explosion of coal gas occurring on the insured premises, to which the condition relates, but an explosion of coal gas occuring \u201cin a building not forming part of gas works,\u201d and doing damage to the insured property of the plaintiffs\u2014so that the manner in which this condition (if it affects at all the contract in the policy) operates as a qualification or modification of the liability of the defendants to indemnify the insured against loss by fire happening to the insured premises, namely, the plaintiffs hardware warehouse and stock of hardware, is that the defendants will not be responsible for any loss occurring to the insured property, although within the terms of the contract of indemnity contained in the body of the policy, if such loss be occasioned by the explosion of coal gas occurring in any building which forms part of gas works. This is the only way, in my opinion, in which this condition qualifies the contract of indemnity contained in the body of the policies, and except as qualifying such contract it can have no operation whatever.\nAs to reading the condition as an independent contract providing for the case of loss of a wholly different character, and occuring from a different cause from that mentioned in the body of the policies, namely, the case of loss occurring by concussion wholly apart from loss by fire, if such concussion should be occasioned by the explosion of coal gas, it might be in a building quite remote, that is, in my opinion, quite out of the question. Such a construction would create a wholly new contract, imposing a wholly new liability on the defendants, not imposed by the body of the policy\u2014diverting that which is intended to be, and whose sole office is to operate as, a condition or qualification, subject to which the contract, which is in the body of the policy, is made into a wholly new and independent contract. Such a construction cannot, in my opinion, be supported. But the condition adds that the company will make good loss by fire caused by any other explosion or by lightning. Such losses, however, are within the terms of the contract contained in the body of the policies, and this affirmation of liability in respect of such losses is but a re-affirmation of a liability incurred by the contract, which is in the body of the policies, and is not a qualification of that contract. The language is not put in the form of an exception from or qualification of, that contract, and this condition in which the language appears can operate in no other way. If it had been intended to operate as creating an exemption from liability for such loss as should be occasioned by the explosion of gunpowder on the insured premises as distinguishable from loss by lire, it should have been specifically so expressed, and no doubt would have been in the 10th condition, in which provision is made for the case of gunpowder being on the insured premises, and which provision must, I think, be held to comprehend the whole of the provisions as affecting the policies in so far as gunpowder or its explosion is concerned.\nThe whole question really arising in the cases is one arising on the contract as contained in the body of the policies, unqualified, as it appears to me, by the 11th condition, and is simply this: When gunpowder within the quantity authorised by the tenth statutory condition is on the insured premises, and becomes ignited by contact with fire, whether of the flame of a candle, or a lighted match, or otherwise, and by explosion expands and spreads the fire by which it became ignited, and in such explosion and expansion does damage, is or is not the whole of the property so damaged loss within the contract contained in the policy for indemnity against loss by fire? And are the defendants liable for the whole of the damage so occasioned, or only for a part? And can they separate the loss so as to claim exemption from liability for so much as is attributable to the explosion as distinguished from that attributable directly to fire subsequent to the explosion, and the answer, in my opinion, is that the whole loss or damage is loss by fire within the contract of indemnity, and that the defendants are liable for the whole.\nIn the case of the Northern Insurance Company, whose policy insured the stock in trade on the insured premises, including the gunpowder which exploded, the contention that the defendants are exempt from liability for a part of the loss as attributable to the explosion seems to me to border upon the brink of absurdity. The gunpowder itself, having been part of the stock in trade insured, its loss surely is a loss within the terms of the policy for which the insured is entitled to be indemnified\u2014its loss was loss by fire. If, then, the plaintiffs are entitled to indemnity for the loss of the gunpowder, how can their right to indemnity be said to be limited to the property damaged or destroyed subsequently to the loss of the gunpowder? The loss for which the plaintiffs are in both cases, in my opinion, entitled to indemnity is the whole loss caused by and consequent upon the lire which ignited the gunpowder which, by its explosion, expanded and caused the whole loss.\nThe appeals, therefore, in both cases, should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs to the plaintiffs in all the courts, and judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs on the verdicts rendered in their favor.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Gibbons, McNab & Mulkern.\nSolicitors for respondents: Lount & Marsh.\n[1] 11 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nJoint stock company\u2014Contribntories\u2014Sub scription for stock\u2014Payment by services.\nThe act of incorporation of a joint stock company provided \u201cthat no subscription for stock should be legal or valid until ten percent, should have been actually and bona fide paid thereon.\u201d\nC. gave to the manager of the company a power of attorney to subscribe for him ten shares in the company, such power of attorney containing these words \u201cand I herewith enclose ten per cent. thereof, and ratify and confirm all that my said attorney may do by virtue thereof.\u201d The ten per cent. was not, in fact, enclosed, but the amount was placed to the credit of C. in the books of the company, and a certificate of stock issued to him which he held for several years.\nThe company having failed, proceedings were taken to have C. placed on the list of contributories, in which proceedings he gave evidence to the effect that the sum to his credit was for professional services to the company, he having been appointed a local solicitor, and there had been an arrangement that his stock Was to be paid for by such services.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Henry J. dissenting, that C. was rightly placed on the list of contributories.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the order of Ferguson J.[2], that Caston was properly placed on the list of contributories of the Standard Fire Ins. Co.\nFor a statement of the facts of the case see the reports in the courts below.\nGalt for the appellant.\nIf the contract with Caston for the stock is invalid there has been no payment. Fathergill\u2019s Case[3]. I submit that it is invalid. There was to be a local board in Toronto of which he was to be solicitor, but such board was never formed. No bill lor services was rendered, and the application never came before the company or the directors. The company could not take advantage of the subscription without being paid everything required to make it good. Simpson\u2019s Case[4]; Pellatt\u2019s Case[5].\nThe certificate of stock was not issued by direction of the directors, but by the mere motion of the secretary. See Roscoe\u2019s N.P. Evidence, 15th ed. p. 1,060, and see Stephens on Joint Stock Companies for the form of the certificate.\nThe certificate being non-negotiable we are not bound by it. Duke v. Andrews[6]; Chaplin v. Clarke[7]. And see Eley v. Positive Ass. Co.[8]; and Nicol\u2019s Case[9] as to contract between shareholders and applicants for stock.\nThe learned counsel cited also Cartmell\u2019s Case[10] and Hallmark\u2019s Case[11], and referred to secs. 15 and 19 of the Joint Stock Companies Act R.S.O. ch. 49 and secs. 29, 34, 35, 37 and 49 of R.S.O. ch. 50.\nBain Q.C. for respondents.\nThe entry in the books of the company, and the issue of the stock certificate, are prim\u00e2 facie evidence of Caston being a shareholder, and the onus is on him to show that he is not.\nThe ten per cent. clause only referred to the increased stock, and after the board was formed the directors could allow payment in any form they chose, by promissory notes, by services or in any other manner. See East Gloucester Ry. Co. v. Bartholomew[12]; Piscatagua Ferry Co. v. Jones[13].\nThe distinction between Elkington\u2019s Case[14] and Pellat\u2019s Case referred to by the learned counsel is pointed out in the former, and see also Thomson\u2019s Case[15]; Woollaston\u2019s Case[16]; Oakes v. Turquand[17].\nThe intention of the company to accept the application for stock, as shown by the issue of the certificate, makes the applicant a stockholder. Richards v. Home Ass. Co.[18]; Gorrissen\u2019s Case[19]; Ritso\u2019s Case[20]; National Ins. Co. v. Egleson[21].\nGalt in reply cited Bain v. Whitehaven Ry. Co.[22]; Nasmith v. Manning[23]; Port Dover & Lake Huron Ry. Co. v. Grey[24]; re Duckworth[25].\nHENRY J.\u2014The law requires that 10 per cent. of the stock of a joint stock company should be paid up, and that no subscription for stock shall be valid unless that amount is paid. The question arises then: Was that amount paid in this case?\nThe payment must be to the company, and it is claimed here that $100 was paid to the company in services. But it is in evidence that no such services were performed for the company. Any services performed were for the promoters of the company, and the payment for the stock was arranged to be by services for the promoters, and not for the company.\nI think it is necessary, to entitle a party to claim as one of the stockholders of a company, that he should be a regular and lawful stockholder. I do not think such could have been the case here unless ten per cent. of the stock was paid up. The claimant had arranged for no services to the company; he had no claim against the company; and if he had applied to the company for his stock, I think they could well have answered: \u201cYou have not paid the 10 per cent;\u201d and if he had claimed that he had arranged that with the promoters, they could have replied: we have nothing to do with the promoters. I think the plaintiff could not have enforced his claim against this company in any way, and the rule should work both ways. In my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In my opinion the appeal in this case should be dismissed, and the appellant\u2019s name has been rightly placed on the list of contributories. The condition upon which the appellant says he agreed to subscribe for the shares in the Alliance Insurance Company now merged into the Standard, namely that the stock so subscribed for should be paid by services to be rendered by him as solicitor of the company, that is to say that the moneys to become due to him for services as solicitor should be applied by the company to his quotas in payment of his stock, was a condition subsequent, and although under the circumstances stated by the appellant in his evidence, he might have had the right to rescind the contract while the company was solvent, he has lost that right now.\nIn October, 1880, he executed a power of attorney to one Crawford, the manager of the company, authorizing him to subscribe for ten shares in the capital stock of the Alliance Insurance Company of the face value of $100 each, and in that power of attorney are the words following:\u2014 \u201cAnd I herewith enclose ten per cent, thereof, and ratify and confirm all my said attorney may do by virtue thereof.\u201d Now what his attorney did was to cause the appellant\u2019s name to be entered on the stock register as a holder of ten shares, upon which ten per cent. was entered as paid. The appellant now says that he never did send the $100 mentioned in the power of attorney to be sent with it, and being asked, was there any arrangement between him and any person as to the credit of $100, he replied, \u201cthat was part of my services, it was not in cash,\u201d and being further asked if it had not been credited for services he had rendered the company in getting subscriptions, he replied \u201cYes, part of my arrangement.\u201d Again he says: \u201cIt was distinctly understood that I should pay no cash on my stock.\u201d And the question being again asked whether he was not to be credited on his stock for services, he replied, \u201cyes.\u201d He admitted also that he had received a scrip certificate of shares held by him, which on his examination he produced, and bears date the 9th November, 1880. whereby it is certified under the hand of the secretary of the company, that the appellant holds ten shares of the stock of the Alliance Insurance Company, of the par value of \u201cone hundred dollars each on which ten per cent. has been paid in.\u201d This certificate he held in his hands for years without repudiating it so long as the company continued in existence, nor in fact until the Standard Insurance Company into which the Alliance became merged, became insolvent and in process of being wound up. He also received a warrant of attorney under the seal of the company dated 80th of October, 1880, constituting him solicitor of the company for the transaction of their professional business arising out of and in and for the county of York and city of Toronto. Under these circumstances, I do not think that he can evade being placed on the list of contributories. The case as it appears to me, presents as clear a case of liability to contribution as appeared in the recent cases of Southport and West Lancashire Banking Company; Fishers case and Herringtons case.\nSir W.J.

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNew trial\u2014Verdict for plaintiff\u2014Technical breach of contract Defendant entitled to nominal damages for.\nIn an action to recover the balance of the contract price for work done for the defendant, the declaration also containing the common count for work and labor, the evidence showed that there was a technical breach of the contract by which, however, the defendant had sustained no substantial damage. A verdict was found for the plaintiff and a rule for a new trial was refused by the Divisional Court, and also by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, that a verdict would not be set aside merely to enter a verdict for the other party for nominal damages.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiffs and order a new trial.\nThis action was brought by the executors of the late George N. Oille, of St. Catharines, to recover from the appellant the sum of $14,500, being a balance alleged to be due by him under a contract in writing and under seal between the said George N. Oille and the appellant, executed on the 13th day of May, 1881.\nUnder the contract Oille agreed for the sum of $26,500 to build a compound engine \u201cof the proportions, quality, style and finish, with furnishings the most complete and best, and to be provided with cylinder boilers built of the best boiler steel, and shall have all the requirements, furnishings and attachments complete, according to the specifications hereunto annexed, said specification to form and does form part of this agreement, the engines and boilers to be all finished in every particular, and furnished, setup, and securely and amply fastened to the steamer now building near the town of Sarnia, on or before the 1st day of March, A.D. 1882.\u201d\nThe specifications which, as appears above, are made a part of the contract, commence as follows: \u201cSpecifications of a compound engine and two cylinder boilers to be built by George N. Oille, of the city of St. Catharines, for James H. Beatty, of the town of Thorold, to be completed and set up in the vessel now being constructed at the town of Sarnia, and to be in every way finished and furnished with all things necessary and required for such a style of engine and boilers and description of steamer; the material used in the engine and boilers shall be of the very best quality and the work on the most improved and approved plans and best workmanship.\u201d\nThe appellant\u2019s defence was that default was made in the completion of the engine; that Oille, in December, 1882, wholly abandoned the work; that the appellant was then obliged to finish it, and expended large sums of money in so doing; that by reason of the default of Oille the engine and boiler were not finished until the opening of navigation in 1883, and the appellant thus lost the profits which the boat would have earned in the season of 1882; that the work was performed by Oille in an unskilful, negligent and careless manner; that large sums had been expended by the appellant in remedying defects, and that it would be necessary to expend a still larger amount before the engine and boiler were brought to the standard called for by the contract; that the moneys expended by the appellant to complete the engine and boilers and remedy the defects and the loss by the delay and defective and negligent work were more than the amount of the plaintiffs claim, and the appellant counter-claimed for the balance.\nThe case came on before Mr. Justice Armour and a jury on the 17th and 18th January, 1885.\nWhile the appellant was being examined at the trial the plaintiffs admitted his right to credit for the moneys expended by him in completing the work after it had been abandoned as aforesaid, and also a sum of between $200 and $300 which the appellant paid in replacing a portion of the machinery in which inferior material had been used, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim was thus reduced to the sum of $9,911.50, which sum, with interest to the date of the trial, making in all the sum of $10,329, was claimed by the plaintiffs when the case went to the jury.\nThe jury brought in a verdict for the plaintiffs for the sum of $10,329, being the full amount claimed, and wholly disallowed the claim and counter-claim of the appellant.\nThe defendants applied to the Divisional Court for a new trial, which was refused, and on appeal to the Court of Appeal the judgment of the Divisional Court refusing the new trial was sustained.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and McDonald Q.C. for the appellants.\nThe questions to be decided are: First\u2014Was the work done according to contract? And secondly\u2014If not, is the defendant entitled to damages for the non-completion and for the loss of what the vessel would have earned during the season?\nThe work was not finished until May, 1883. The season commences in May and ends in November. The date for completing the engine, namely, March 1st, was important, as it would leave two months to complete all arrangements and get the vessel ready by the first of May. The hull was ready to receive the boiler in December, 1881. The boiler was not commenced until June, and the engine until September, 1882.\nThen the engine when finished was defective. The reason why the boat was not given a higher speed than 11 or 12 miles an hour is, that the port or opening into the high-pressure engine from the boiler was too small. The same mistake was made between the high\u2011pressure and the low-pressure engine. The vacuum pipe also was too small and the hot well was so badly constructed that it burst. A large outlay would be required to remedy these defects and make the boat fit for her business. See Thomson v. South Eastern Ry. Co.[1].\nIt is clear that we are entitled to damages for loss of what would be the ordinary use of what the plaintiff contracted to supply us with. Cory v. Thames Iron Works and Ship Building Co.[2]; Ex parte Cambrian Steamship Co.[3]; Elbinger Actien Gessellschafft v. Armstrong[4]; Roscoe\u2019s Nisi Prius[5]; Benjamin on Sales[6]; Hadley v. Baxendale[7].\nLarge profits might have been made out of this boat. See Fletcher v. Tayleur[8].\nThen we are entitled to a new trial on the ground of misdirection. White v. Crawford[9] and Hoyt v. Stockton[10] show that the observations of the judge to the jury on matters of fact will form ground for a new trial if the jury have been misled by them. See also Maddock v. Glass[11].\nOsler Q.C. and Cox for the respondents\nThe objections to the judge\u2019s charge were not made at the trial and should not be considered here.\nAs to the claim that the engine was defective it is only necessary to refer to the evidence, which shows that the appellant tested it on two trial trips and made no objection then nor at any time until he pat in his counter claim in 1884. The vessel was kept running for a year, never losing a day, and was sold then for the full cost price, with $4,000 added for his personal superintendence in her construction.\nIn answer to the claim for damages for the non-completion according to contract, it is submitted that the defendant sustained no substantial injury thereby. The contractor for the hull failed in March, 1882, with $45,000 of work yet to be done. There is no evidence that the vessel would have been ready for sea if the engine and boiler had been furnished. Defendant had no sale for the vessel until 1883, and could have done nothing with her before.\nThe following authorities were also cited: Canada Central Ry. v. Murray[12]; Connecticut Mutual Ins. Co. v. Moore[13]; Cousins v. Merrill[14]; Reg. v. Fick[15]; Fitzpatrick v. Casselman[16].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014There does not appear to have been any misdirection in this case, and no objection was taken to the judge\u2019s charge. The questions raised were properly for the jury, who found in favor of the plaintiff with, evidently, the concurrence of the learned judge before whom the case was tried.\nOn a motion to the Divisional Court to set aside the verdict on the ground that the verdict, so far as it was in favor of the plaintiff on his statement of claim, was against law and evidence and the weight of evidence, and also so far as it related to the contention of the defendant, the court were of opinion that the finding of the jury ought not to be disturbed; that there was no miscarriage in the case upon any question of law; that there was no objection to the judge\u2019s charge nor any room for objection; that though the impression on the mind of the learned judge was favorable to the plaintiff he presented the evidence fairly to the jury, and that his comments thereon seem to have been fully warranted; that though there was a technical breach of contract which might have entitled the defendant to have recovered nominal damages, yet that that was not a ground for interfering with a verdict when the jury found, as they must be taken to have done in this case, that substantial damage had not flowed from the breach, at which conclusion the court thought the jury were fully warranted in arriving; therefore the court refused to interfere with the verdict.\nThe defendant appealed from this decision of the Divisional Court to the Court of Appeal. That court was unanimously of opinion that though on his counter claim the defendant was in strictness entitled to a finding in his favor for nominal damages for breach of contract as to the time appointed for finishing the work, yet the court would not disturb the verdict on that ground as \u201cfor a long series of years the courts have refused to disturb verdicts merely for the purpose or entering a nominal amount for either party, where no right was involved and the case sounded wholly in damages.\u201d The court could not see that there was any misdirection, and concurred generally in the reasons for judgment in the court below discharging the rule against the verdict. \u201cThe evidence\u201d the court said \u201cwas, as usual, rather contradictory as to the character of the work done by plaintiff, but it was a fair question for the jury as to whether it fairly answered the contract and specifications,\u201d and the court would not say that the jury had arrived at an erroneous conclusion, and they thought it unlikely that any other jury to whom the case should be submitted would arrive at any different conclusion, and so dismissed the appeal, and so, I think, must we\nI am far from being prepared to say that the jury and the courts below were wrong in the conclusions at. which they arrived. On the contrary, had I been on the jury I think I should have arrived at the same conclusion that the jury did.\nFOURNIER, HENRY and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014Concurred. GWYNNE J.\u2014This action is brought by the executors of one Oille to recover a balance alleged to be due to them as such executors upon a contract made by their testator with the defendant for the construction and fitting of composite engines and boilers in a vessel then being about to be built by the defendant. The plaintiffs in their statement of claim alleged the completion of the engines and boilers and the fitting the same in the vessel, and that after the completion of the vessel they were found, upon a trial trip, to work satisfactorily, whereupon, as the plaintiffs alleged, the balance of the contract price amounting to $14,500.00 ($12,000.00 having been paid during the progress of the work) became due and payable to the plaintiffs, as such executors, with interest. The defendant in his statement of defence set out the contract whereby it appeared that Oille, in the month of May, 1881, had agreed with the defendant to construct the engines and boilers according to specifications annexed to the contract and to set up the same in a steam vessel then being built by the defendant at the town of Sarnia, on or before the 1st day of March, 1882, and by the contract it was provided that the whole of the work on the engines and boilers should be pushed forward so as not to interfere with or delay the shipbuilders in their work, and that any change made in material, construction, and furnishing, required by the shipowner or the inspector, should be consistent with the said contract, and it was thereby agreed further that when the engines and boilers should be finished and set up in the vessel and everything finished and requirements met according to the contract and a satisfactory trial made by a round trip to Duluth and return, that then the shipowner should pay to the contractor in full of his contract the full sum of twenty-six thousand five hundred dollars, but that should the contractor desire it he could draw money during the time of completing the contract to the amount of twelve thousand dollars. The defendant then alleged that Oille failed in completing the work by the time specified in the contract, and that in the month of December, 1882, the work being still unfinished, he wholly abandoned the work and left the same in an unfinished state, and that the work then done was not done according to the contract, and was unskilfully and negligently-done and performed, and that after the abandonment of the said work by Oille the defendant was obliged to complete the same, and thereupon employed men and obtained materials for the purpose of completing said work, and had expended in such work and materials the sum of $7,000; that the said steamer had since the opening of navigation in the year 1883, and during the seasons of 1883 and 1884, been employed in running between Sarnia and Duluth, yet that no satisfactory trip had yet been made by reason of the said engine not working properly or satisfactorily; that the defendant had expended large sums of money in investigating and endeavouring to ascertain the defect in the construction of the said engine, and had ascertained that certain work in the construction of the said engine in the interior thereof was performed by Oille not according to the specifications in the contract mentioned, but in an unskilful, careless and negligent manner, which work was, as the defendant alleged, recently and long after the opening of navigation for the year 1883, discovered by the defendant; and the defendant claimed that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim should be dismissed with costs and by way of counter-claim the defendant claimed that he should be paid by the plaintiffs out of the assets of the estate of their testator, the said Oille, the damages which the defendant had sustained by reason of the default of the said Oille in not completing his said contract according to the terms thereof, and for the loss which the defendant had sustained in being deprived of the earnings of his said steam vessel for the season of 1882, and for the loss and damage which the defendant had sustained by reason of the unskilfulness, neglect and careless work performed on said engine, as aforesaid. The plaintiffs in their reply, among other things, alleged that the delay in completing the said contract was caused solely by the defendant and the persons employed by him to construct the hull of the said vessel, and they alleged further that during the progress of the said contract work the defendant made frequent changes therein and required the said Oille to alter the same in many particulars and vary from the said specifications, and also to do work not provided for by the said specifications, and thereby materially hindered and delayed the said Oille in his said contract work; and the plaintiffs submitted that by reason of such the conduct of the defendant, the said Oille was released from the obligation to complete the said work at the time specified in the contract; and the plaintiffs further alleged that the said specifications were prepared and the said engines and boilers and other work mentioned in the said contract were planned and designed by the defendant, and he personally superintended the said contract work during the progress thereof and that the same was done in all respects according to his instructions and directions, and they further alleged that a satisfactory trial trip was made after the completion of the said work, and that the defendant was satisfied therewith and made no complaints whatever respecting the same until shortly before the commencement of this action, and they denied that the defendant had suffered any damage whatever by reason of any default of the said Oille, or that he had sustained any loss whatever for which the said Oille was, or the plaintiffs as his executors are, respond- sible. At the trial before Armour J. it appeared that the inspector referred to in the contract to superintend for the defendant the performance of the work was not appointed by the defendant until the latter end of November, 1881. In a letter of the 21st of that month addressed by the defendant to Oille, he says:\u2014\u201cI have engaged Mr. Thos. Pettigrew for one year at $1,000 and board, he to take charge of the work in your shop till the engine and boiler are completed and set up, and then he is to take charge of and run the engine till the close of navigation, and he will be ready to commence work next week. Get your material and men at once. Should the forging not be ready now, go to Buffalo and see after it so that there may be no delay, also all patterns and castings. In a word, the whole work is to be shoved ahead. I hope you have ordered the strap plates for the horizontal seams as they must be triple riveted. We have taken measures of the hold and find the distance from the top of the boiler to the top of the main deck, allowing six inches for the saddle, to be 23 inches, and the throw down should stand about six inches above the deck, say whole length, 30 inches between boiler and dome. Now there is another thing I wish to call your attention to, that is, the absolute necessity of making provision for a receiver over engine working at right angles; this could be dispensed with provided the engine worked at opposite centres. This must be provided without fail. How have you arranged in regard to the small cylinder where the receiver was intended to be? Can you give me the size of the engine on which you intend to have the steam lap and exhaust pipe, with the distance the exhaust pipe will be from the centre of the engine, giving size of exhaust pipe and the inside and outside measures from centre, This we want, as we are laying our beams and stringers. Please write at once, give the size and distance of exhaust pipe from cylinder.\u201d\nIt appeared from the evidence of Pettigrew, who had thus been engaged by the defendant to superintend the construction of the engines and to run he vessel when completed, that the defendant himself was backwards and forwards at the workshop where they were constructed 80 per cent. of the time during which the work was in progress, and yet during all that time he does not appear to have ever complained of the delay which had occurred in the construction of the engines or that the contract therefor had thereby been broken. He also gave evidence that the vessel made a satisfactory trial trip when finished, and that she ran 16 trips during the year 1883, during all of which trips the engines ran very fairly and were successful during the season. In March, 1883, Oille, the contractor, died, and in June of that year, after the trial trip, one of the plaintiffs having written him a letter enquiring as to the working of the engines, the defendant in reply wrote the following letter, dated June 15th, 1883:\u2014\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I have just returned from the East and found your letter, and beg to state I am not in a position to give you the desired information respecting the working of the engine of the \u201cUnited Empire,\u201d but from the intimation I am inclined to think it does not work satisfactorily, but will write when I receive the engineer\u2019s full report. There are several parts that must be supplied with different material, which may affect the efficiency. It will be some two weeks before I can get this report from the engineer, when I will correspond with you fully respecting the efficiency of the engine.\nThe defendant, however, never did subsequently correspond with the plaintiffs, or either of them, upon the subject. Pettigrew, who was the engineer who ran the vessel in 1883, upon this point said that the defendant applied to him for a report of the working of the engines, and although he saw the defendant upon the occasion of every trip that the only thing which passed between them upon the subject of the engines was when laying up the vessel in the fall of the year 1888 the defendant came into the engine room and said that \u201cthere must be something wrong with the engine because she was not coming up to his expectation, and he asked me what was the matter. I told him that the proportions of the engines were the same as the Buffalo engines, and that they did as good work as any boats that were going across the lakes.\u201d\nHe added, in his evidence, that he had got a speed of 11, 12 and 13 miles an hour out of the engines, and that he ran her at the speed which he found to be most economical for her, which was upon an average 112 miles per hour. It appeared, also, in evidence that the persons who had contacted to build the hull for the defendant failed, and in March, 1882, wholly abandoned their contract, after which time the defendant had to take the work into his own hands and was obliged to lay out in workmanship and material the sum of $45,000 to complete the vessel, of which sum the material which the defendant was obliged to purchase to complete the vessel cost from $10,000 to $15,000. The contention of the defendant upon this point was that although the contractors for construction of the hull did abandon their contract in March, 1882, still that the vessel had been sufficiently advanced to receive the machinery in the fall of 1881. In answer to this contention the plaintiffs relied upon the defendant\u2019s letter of the 21st November, 1881; and, moreover, they contended that even if the jury should be of opinion that the hull was sufficiently advanced so as to receive the engines before the 1st March, 1882, still the non-completion of the vessel so as to engage in the navigation of 1882 was not to be attributed to the delay in the completion of the engines, but to the delay occasioned by the failure of the contractors for the construc- tion of the hull, and in support of their contention that the defendant had not been damnified, as he claimed to be, by the delay in construction of the engines, from not having the use of the vessel during the period of navigation of 1882, the plaintiffs relied upon the following which appeared in evidence, namely, that the vessel was built by the defendant wholly upon the speculation of selling her to a certain company called the North-West Transport and Navigation Company, of which company the defendant was the principal stockholder, and that during the whole of the year 1882 that company refused to purchase or to have anything to do with the vessel, and so the plaintiff contended that it was for the jury to say whether the defendant had not for this reason taken the whole of the year 1882 to complete the vessel, and that he was in reality not damnified by the delay which had taken place in the construction of the engines. Much evidence was entered into upon the question whether or not the engines and boilers had been constructed in accordance with the specifications, and as to the sufficiency of the work to meet the requirements of the contract, by which it was stipulated that the engines were to be built, according to the specifications annexed, with furnishings most complete and with cylindrical boilers built of the best boiler steel. The specifications appeared to have been drawn by the defendant himself, and not to have been altogether perfect, many things which as was contended by the defendant were necessary to make the engine complete and perfect not being specifically mentioned therein. During the examination of one of the witnesses, an expert, the learned judge before whom the case was tried made the observation that: \u201cThe question is, did this engine fill the specifications, to begin with, and as far as these specifications do not specify, was it reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was intended?\u201d And he added: \u201cIf the man who ran the engine in 1883, says it is as good an engine as ever went into a ship, that would be evidence to go to a jury to show that it was reasonably tit for the work.\u201d No objection appears to have been taken to the correctness of this view, as to the question before the jury as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the engine to meet the contract, the main ground of insufficiency relied upon by the defendant, was that the speed of the vessel did not come up to what was expected by him, which was from 13 to 14 miles per hour, and the evidence he relied upon on this point was that of an expert who had examined the vessel after the close of navigation of the year 1884, and who suggested considerable changes at a very large outlay with the view of increasing the speed of the vessel. Whether the suggestions made by this witness were at all necessary and whether the alterations suggested were required by the contract was the subject of much criticism, and of evidence in contradiction offered by the plaintiffs, which latter evidence included that of the witness Pettigrew who inspected the whole of the work until the engines and boilers were fitted in the vessel, the part taken by the defendant in completing them being only to advance for materials and work a sum in excess of the $12,000 agreed to be paid during the progress of the work. The learned judge no doubt, formed an opinion which the jury perceived to be unfavorable to the defendant, but he left the case to the jury with charge to which no objection whatever was taken either for misdirection or non-direction or for any other cause. Nor was he asked to vary in any respect upon any point, the manner in which he left the case to the jury. His direction as to the rule of law as to the measure of damages applicable in cases of the nature of the present was not then nor has it since been objected to. The jury upon this charge rendered a verdict for the plaintiff of $10,32900 allowing thus to the defendant $4,171.00, to cover all moneys which had been advanced by the defendant during the progress of the work and certain parts of the machinery which had proved defective and which had been supplied by the defendant, but disallowing the defendant\u2019s counter claim for damages for the delay complained of in the non\u2011completion of the engines by the 1st of March, 1882, or otherwise. A rule nisi for a new trial upon the ground of the verdict being against law and evidence and the weight of evidence, having been obtained, was, on argument, discharged by the Divisional Court, whose judgment has been unanimously sustained by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the defendant has appealed to this court, and in the argument before us the learned counsel for the defence undertook to establish, which he has failed to do, that these judgments are clearly erronous. Moore v. The Connecticut Ins. Co.[17] before the Privy Council, is an authority that even where a verdict is unsatisfactory in the opinion of a court before which it is reviewed as against law and evidence and the weight of evidence, which the verdict in this case does not appear to me to be, that is not sufficient to justify a court in granting a new trial. That in order to be justified in granting a new trial they must be satisfied that the evidence so strongly preponderates in favor of the party as to lead to the conclusion that the jury in finding for the other party have either wilfully disregarded the evidence or failed to understand or appreciate it. Consistently with this ruling, which is conclusively binding upon this court, there does not appear to be any foundation for the contention that the unanimous judgments of two courts upon the point in question should be reversed. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: MacLaren, MacDonald, Merritt and Shepley.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Miller, Cox and Gale.\n[1] 9 Q.B.D. 320.\n[2] L.R. 3 Q.B. 181.\n[3] 4 Ch.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nJoint Stock Company\u2014Misrepresentation by promoters of\u2014Action by individual shareholders\u2014Delay in bringing action\u2014Parties.\nIndividual shareholders in a joint stock company cannot bring an action against the promoters for damages caused by alleged misrepresentations by the latter as to the prospects of the company when formed, the injury, if any, being an injury to the company, not to the respective shareholders. (Strong J. dissenting).\nIf the shareholders could bring such action a delay of four years, during which they suffered the business of the company to go on with full knowledge of the alleged misrepresentations, would disentitle them to relief. (Strong J. dissenting.) APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Wilson J. in the Chancery Division[2].\nThis was a suit brought by certain shareholders in the North-West Transportation Company against other shareholders who had been the promoters of the company. The bill was filed after the company had been in operation for some four years, and alleged that the plaintiffs and defendants had been owners of rival lines of steamers and the defendants proposed to the plaintiffs that the two lines be amalgamated and a joint stock company formed to run them; that the proposition was carried out and the company formed, the stock being divided between the two lines, plaintiffs receiving the larger share; that the defendants had represented that their line had a four years\u2019 contract with the Government to carry the mails from Windsor to Duluth, for which the subsidy was $2,500 a year, and that they also received a bonus from the town of Windsor of $2,000 a year; that the representation as to the mail contract was false, the defendants only having a con tract from year to year, which was discontinued after the company was formed; that the plaintiffs would not have agreed to the distribution of shares that was made if they had known the true state of affairs as to this contract; that the defendants had received the Windsor bonus for one year and the plaintiffs were entitled to this amount and the amount of the mail contract for three years as damages. The defendants denied the alleged misrepresentations, and claimed that the plaintiffs, by their delay and conduct in permitting the business to proceed for so long a time without making any claim for relief, they having, the defendants alleged, full knowledge of the true state of affairs from the time the company was formed, were not enti- tled to claim relief now.\nThe cause was heard before Wilson J. in the Chancery Division and resulted in the plaintiffs obtaining judgment for $9,500, being the amount of the postal subsidy for three years and the Windsor bonus for one year. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, holding that the plaintiffs, by their delay and conduct, were disentitled to relief. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcCarthy Q.C., and McDonald Q.C. for the appellants.\nPrevious to the formation of the company the plaintiffs were in partnership under the agreement. They had at that time a right to sue or they could not sue now. The company had no rights by contract but only by assignment. Kelner v. Baxter[3]; Scott v. Lord Ebury[4]; Willmott v. Barber[5]. If the company should sue the action would be because they had not received property worth $9,500, and the shareholders guilty of the deceit would participate in the benefits of the action.\nWe say that we have a right to maintain a common law action for deceit; if not, we have a right to relief in equity. In the first we have to establish moral fraud; in the other misrepresentation is sufficient, though not made intentionally. Arkwright v. Newbold[6]; Rawlins v. Wickham[7]; Urquhart v. MacPherson[8].\nAs to what will amount to misrepresentation see Smith v. Kay[9]; Cater v. Wood[10]; Boswell v. Coaks[11]; Redgrave v. Hurd[12].\nThis court should consider the evidence in this case and are not bound by the decision of the court below where it is contradictory. Grasett v. Carter[13].\nWe submit that there has not been such delay as to disentitle the plaintiffs to recover.\nRobinson Q.C. and W. Cassels Q.C. for the respondents.\nThis court should not reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal on matters of evidence. Hale v. Kennedy[14]; Smith v. Chadwick[15]; Sanderson v. Burdett[16].\nThe plaintiffs cannot maintain this action as the money, if recovered, would belong to the company. I do not admit that the company could not sue on the contract with the promoters.

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I do not feel called upon to express any opinion as to the objection (assuming the case was sustained by evidence) that the proceedings should have been by and in the name of the North West Transportation Company, because I think the evidence did not warrant the conclusion at which the learned Chief Justice in the court of first instance arrived.\nAs to the question of the contract for carrying mails from Windsor to Duluth once a week at the rate of $100 a trip, the learned Chief Justice says:\u2014\nThe parties are as much opposed to each other upon that part of the case as it is possible for them to be.\nAgain he says:\u2014\nI am, upon the whole, led to adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 account of what took place at the time of the negotiations with respect to the $100 a week subsidy, rather than that of the defendants, although I do so with some degree of doubt as to the Windsor bonus.\nI think the burthen was on the plaintiff of making out his case without leaving any reasonable doubt. I agree with the observations of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario:\u2014\nThat this suit was brought, after great and wholly unexpected delay, after the company had been four years in full operation, and with full knowledge on plaintiffs\u2019 part of the alleged misrepresentations almost from the beginning. That it was a case, under all the extraordinary circumstances, which a court of justice should have required to be proved with undoubted clearness.\nI take it there is no proposition better established than that fraud must be distinctly and clearly proved; that the law will presume in favor of honesty and against fraud. As Parke B. said in Shaw appellant and Beck respondent[22]:\u2014\nDefendants who seek to set an instrument aside as fraudulent must establish fraud, upon the universal principle that every transaction in the first instance is assumed to be valid, and the proof of fraud lies upon the person by whom it is imputed.\nTherefore, unless the alleged fraud is established beyond a reasonable doubt, the presumption in law would be that the proceeding on the part of the defendants was fair and honest. The agreement is a fair and valid one on its face, and has been accepted and acted on for years after notice by all parties of the alleged grievances; by which acting, if the plaintiffs\u2019 contention is right, they were, from time to time, receiving less, and the defendants more, in the way of dividends than they were respectively entitled to, and this without, apparently, any complaint or remonstrance or effort to have the alleged wrong rectified.\nThe evidence is most contradictory, and there were material discrepancies, on several points, on both sides, the defendants most distinctly denying that the repre- sentations sworn to by the plaintiffs were ever made. It then, in my opinion, becomes most important to look at the conduct of the parties, and their dealing with the subject matter in dispute, with a view of ascertaining \u201cwith which side such conduct has been most consistent.\nOn the 29th of December, 1876, the agreement was entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendants and one Graham, since deceased. A company was formed and incorporated, and a charter obtained, on the 5th of March, 1877. Some time in May, 1877, James Beatty says that he discovered the alleged misrepresentations as to the Windsor contract and bonus and brought it before the board meeting of the company in the next month of June. Though thus aware of what the plaintiffs alleged was the true state of the case immediately after the incorporation, no steps whatever were taken by either the plaintiffs or the corporation (the latter the party really damnified by the misrepresentations, for the injury, if any, was clearly to the joint adventure) for a rescission of the contract or the dissolution of the company, and a re-conveyance of the property conveyed to the joint adventure.\nOn the contrary, the business of the company was carried on in the ordinary course in the seasons of 1877-8-9 and 1880 and subsequently, and it was not until the 21st of February, 1881, that this suit was commenced, in which plaintiffs obtained a decree, and in which suit, before the Court of Appeal, plaintiffs sought to support a decree giving them the two items of $7,500 and $2,000, to be paid to them personally, which, it is abundantly clear, they could by no possibility be entitled to receive, because, if the representations had been true, these sums would not have belonged to the plaintiffs, but would have been received by the corporation, to be dealt with as the other assets of the company, and out of which they, the plaintiffs, could only receive, by way of dividends, their proportionate shares. How, then, is it possible that these plaintiffs could be entitled to what the decree gives them, namely, the whole extent of these items or assets as their own in undisputed right? The items, then, as said by the Chief Justice of Ontario, are not damages to which the plaintiffs are entitled, and none other are claimed or shown.\nIf the plaintiff\u2019s statement be the true version of the conversations, is it reasonable to suppose that a matter resting on the recollection of transactions and conversations which took place seven or eight years ago would be allowed to remain so long unsettled? Or is it reasonable to suppose that the plaintiffs, with the knowledge they possessed, would have sought no redress, but, on the contrary, have gone on with the business, allotted the shares on a basis they now claim to have been entirely wrong, and have allowed the defendants to deal with shares to some of which they now claim the defendants were not entitled? Or is it reasonable to suppose they would have allowed the defendants, or whoever held the stock, to receive from year to year large dividends to which they were not entitled, and by which their own dividends were diminished, and not until after four years\u2019 business institute these proceedings, and then remain three or four years longer before bringing such proceedings to a hearing?\nI do not put forward these considerations as anything in the nature of a bar, but simply as matters worthy of consideration in determining as to the credit to be given to the conflicting statements, and as showing that the contract as acted on was considered by the parties as valid and binding. At any rate, as establishing a fair inference that the profits had been divided on the basis originally agreed on.\nUnder all these circumstances, I think the conduct of the parties is entirely consistent with, and confirms, the views presented by the defendants, and is equally inconsistent with, and discredits, those of the plaintiffs; and therefore I think the Court of Appeal was right, on the merits and facts of the case (apart from any legal question as to the right of the plaintiffs to sue) in allowing the appeal and dismissing the action, and therefore this appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is a suit in equity to compel the defendants to make good certain representations, upon the faith of which the plaintiffs were induced to enter into a preliminary partnership with the defendants and subsequently to constitute with them a joint stock company.\nThe alleged representations were that the defendants had a contract with the Government for carrying the mails weekly from Windsor to Port Arthur, Lake Superior, for which they were to receive $100 per trip, and of which contract two years were to run, and further, that they were entitled to a bonus from the town of Windsor of $2,000 a year, of which one year was yet unexpired. These contracts were to form part of the defendants\u2019 contribution to the partnership and company.\nIn my opinion the evidence establishes beyond all controversy that such representations were in fact made, that they were so made to induce the plaintiffs to enter into an agreement, that the plaintiffs acted on the faith of them, and that they were untrue. But it is sufficient to say that the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses proved the case made by the bill, and that it was for the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, who presided at the trial, to determine whether their statements or those of the defendants were most entitled to credit. The Chief Justice having found in favor of the plaintiffs, that finding ought to be conclusive as regards the facts.\nIt is, therefore, to be considered now as decisively established that the defendants made the representations in question and that their statements have since turned out to be untrue. It results that they must either have been made by Campbell, who was the chosen spokesman on behalf of the defendants, with consciousness of their untruth, or recklessly without having taken the pains to make enquiries and to verify his assertions from sources of information which were obviously within his reach. In either point of view the plaintiffs are entitled to a remedy for that which was a direct and proximate cause of the injury resulting to them from having put faith in the representations of the defendants. That proximate and direct injury and damage, was the loss of such a proportion of the monies which would have arisen from the contract and bonus (had these sums been received) as would have been allotted to the plaintiffs as holders of 19\/25 of the capital stock of the company. I think the conclusion drawn by the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench from the evidence before him, that the payments under the contract of $100 a week should be estimated at 25 weeks for each year, was correct. This estimate would make the gross receipts from that source $7,500 for the three years. The Windsor bonus amounting to $2,000 being added, the aggregate amount which ought to have been received by the company in order to carry out the representations made to the plaintiffs, was $9,500 of which amount 19 would have been the plaintiffs\u2019 share. If any deduction was to be made from this in respect of extra expenditure or loss in per- forming the service required to fulfil the contract and earn the bonus the defendants should have proved it as reduction of damages, but this they have failed to do.\nThat the plaintiffs were entitled to an equitable remedy to compel the defendants to make good their representations cannot, in my opinion, be a matter of the least doubt.\nThat a representation not true in fact made to induce another to enter into a contract and which is an element in inducing the contract entitles the party who has acted upon it to a decree compelling the other party to make his representations good or, to put it more plainly and directly, to substantial damages, is, I think, clear upon authority; and it makes no difference whether the representation be made with conscious falsehood or only with reckless and careless disregard of the obligation of ascertaining the real facts before hazarding any assertion upon which the opposite party is to act. To deny such a proposition would be to overrule at least three cases of the highest authority, in all of which this principle was most distinctly propounded and acted upon, viz: Burrowes v. Lock[23]; Slim v. Croucher[24]; Rawlins v. Wickham[25]. It is said that these cases have been overruled by Redgrave v. Hurd[26]. But in the first place I do not construe the language of the Master of the Rolls in that case as importing any intention to overrule the long series of cases which has settled this principle of liability in courts of equity, and, secondly, I deny that it was competent for a single judge in a court of first instance to overrule the cases already cited, all of which were decisions of appellate tribunals.\nIn Barry v. Croskey[27] Wood V.C. says that it is essential to entitle a party, complaining of a misrepre- sentation, to relief that he should be able to show (1st) that the representation is false; (2nd) that he has acted upon the faith of it; and (3rd) that he has been damnified from so acting; and, further, that the damage so resulting was not remote but immediate. Here, I am of opinion that we have all these elements of liability. The statements of Campbell were made with the intention on the part of the defendants that they should be acted upon by the plaintiffs, and they were so acted upon, and immediate, and direct injury resulted to the plaintiffs in this that they did not receive or get the benefit of moneys which they would have received and have had the benefit of if the representations had been true. The case is, therefore, in my judgment, eminently one for equitable relief and indemnity. As I have already said, the objection that some deduction ought to be made in respect of increased expenditure in performing the service under the contract and to give a title to the bonus, is met by the consideration that for all that appears the profits and earnings on freight of goods and fares of passengers earned by the vessels which would have been employed on this mail service would have more than recouped the expenditure. If this were not so, it was for the defendants to have proved there would have been a loss entitling them to a reduction of damage. But there is no such proof, and in the absence of it it is to be presumed that the whole amounts represented to be payable under the contract and bonus would have been net profit to be carried to the credit of the profit and loss account, undiminished by any charge for losses.\nI cannot, however, agree with the Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench, that the measure of damages which the plaintiffs are entitled to receive is the whole amount of $9,500. I think they must be restricted to a share of it, proportioned to the amount of their shares in the capital stock of the company, namely, 19\/25, which would amount to $7,220, for which amount, together with costs, I am of opinion, the plaintiffs were entitled to a decree. This appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014The evidence is clear and sufficient that the plaintiffs are entitled to no relief. The Court of Appeal have unanimously so declared and I concur in dismissing the appeal with costs.\nHENRY J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice, and I am further of opinion that Beatty was not, in any way, misled, that he had an opportunity of knowing, or of ascertaining, by inquiry, as to the true state or position of the subsidy; and I think, that the suit, to be successful, should have been instituted in the name of the company The contract was with the company, not with Beatty, and it was a failure of representation to the company, and it was the company that was injured and not Beatty alone, and it being the company the action should have been brought in the name of the company I cannot understand how a mere stockholder can bring an action for a wrong alleged to have been done to the company. It was the company\u2019s stock that was affected and I think the injury, if any, was to the company.\nI am of opinion also from the evidence, and I think there is evidence to sustain the position, that no injury was done. I think it was shown that to carry out the services would cost more than would be realized from them.\nTaking all these matters into consideration I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In no view which can be taken of this case can the action, in my opinion, be maintained. The action is in the nature of the old common law action of deceit, although instituted in the Court of Chancery before the passing of the Judicature Act. The plaintiffs undertake to prove:\n1st. That the representation which is made the foundation of the action was made by the defendants\n2nd. That it was made falsely and fraudulently\n3rd. That the plaintiffs were thereby induced in the agreement which they entered into with the defendants, and set out in the bill, to consent that the defendants should respectively have allotted to them, in the joint stock company which they agreed to form, a greater number of shares than, but for such representation they would have agreed should have been allotted them; and,\n4th. That the plaintiffs have suffered actionable damage from such false and fraudulent representation.\nNow to be actionable the damage must not be remote, but must be shown to be the natural, reasonable and necessary result to the plaintiffs and occasioned by the act complained of.\nThe casue of action as stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill of complaint is that the plaintiffs being owners of a line of steamers running from the town of Sarnia to Duluth, on Lake Superior, and the defendants being owners of a line of steamboats running from the town of Windsor to Duluth, upon the 29th day of December, 1876, entered into an agreement executed under their hands and seals whereby they agreed to form themselves into a joint stock company for the purpose of carrying on the business theretofore carried on by their said respective lines of steamers, and also extending their operations to such other places as might be deemed advisable. That the stock of the said company should be the sum of $250,000 in five hundred shares of $500 each, distributed among the plaintiffs and defendants severally and respectively in certain proportions in the agreement stated. That the plaintiffs thereby agreed to transfer to the company so to be formed three steamers then used by them, namely: The \u201cQuebec,\u201d the \u201cOntario\u201d and the \u201cManitoba,\u201d together with the good will of their said business and all their interest in any contracts into which they had entered in respect of said vessels, and all the boats, tackle, rigging furniture, &c., &c., belonging to the said vessels and used therewith, and the defendant Neelon agreed to transfer to the said joint stock company the steamer \u201cSovereign\u201d and all the boats, tackle, rigging, furniture, &c., belonging to her, and the defendants Graham and Campbell agreed to transfer to the said joint stock company the steamer \u201cAsia\u201d and all her boats, tackle, rigging, furniture, &c., &c., and all the defendants agreed that all the good-will of the business carried on by the defendants with the said steamers, and all contracts and connections of them and by them in connection with the said line of steamers should be included in such transfer; and it was further agreed that a charter of incorporation should be applied for with all reasonable despatch, and in the meantime the parties agreed to enter into and to form a partnership under the name and style of the North\u2011West Transportation Company and to carry on the said business theretofore carried on by the said respective lines of steamers, and to become partners in the said business, until they should procure the said charters of incorporation, and that the rights and liabilities of the said partners, respectively, should be in the proportions represented by the different shares therein mentioned as allotted, or to be allotted, to them respectively in the said proposed joint stock company. And the said parties to the said agreement thereby further agreed that the said steamers, &c., &c., and all and every matter and thing which they had agreed, should form the capital stock and become the property of the said proposed company, and should, until the said act of incorporation should be obtained, be and become the property of the said co-partnership, and that as soon as a company should be incorporated for the purposes aforesaid, then and immediately thereafter all and every part of the property, stock and assets of the said partnership should forthwith, and by proper and suitable deeds of conveyance, be transferred to and become the property of, and be possessed and enjoyed by, the said incorporated company; but so as to secure to each of the partners parties thereto an allotment of paid-up stock in the said incorporated company in value, and in such proportions as therein set forth, and that the said copartnership into which they had thus by the said agreement entered should thereupon be dissolved, and the said joint stock company should stand in the place thereof, both as to ownership of assets, assumption of liabilities, and fulfilments of contracts and engagements. The bill then alleges that the mail contracts of each of the said lines was discussed and considered, and was a most material and important element in determining the proportions in which the capital stock of the said proposed joint stock company should be distributed between the plaintiffs and defendants respectively, and that the defendants, well knowing this, and for the purpose of misleading and deceiving the plaintiffs, and for the purpose of increasing the value to be placed on their steamboats and other property to be contributed by them to the said company, falsely and fraudulently represented to the plaintiffs that they, the said defendants, had a written contract with the Government of the Dominion of Canada for the carrying of Her Majesty\u2019s mail on their said steamboats from Windsor to Duluth, aforesaid, for four years from the spring of one thousand eight hun- dred and seventy-six, under which they were receiving, and would receive, and would be entitled to receive, during said period of four years, for each and every trip of each of their said steamboats from Windsor to Duluth, the sum of one hundred dollars, and that the plaintiffs, relying on the said statements of the said defendants as to the said mail contract, as the defendants well knew, and believing the same to be true, entered into the said agreement, whereby the said capital stock was agreed to be distributed as follows, namely, 380 shares to the plaintiff and 120 shares to the said defendants. The bill then alleges that the said joint stock company was formed and incorporated by letters patent of the Dominion of Canada under the name of the North-West Transportation Company upon the 5th day of March, 1877, and that subsequent to the date of the said agreement, and before the issue of the said letters patent, the plaintiffs and defendants agreed between themselves that the stock of the said company should consist of 600 shares of $500 each, which should be distributed between them in the proportions to which they were by the said agreement to receive the said 500 shares, and that at the time of the issuing of the said letters patent the said stock was allotted and distributed between the plaintiffs and defendants, as follows:\nTo the plaintiff, James H. Beatty, 205 shares.\nTo the plaintiff, Henry Beatty, 120 shares.\nTo the plaintiff, John D. Beatty, 52 shares.\nTo the defendant, Sylvester Neelon, 103 shares.\nTo the defendant, John C. Graham, 60 shares.\nAnd to defendant, George Campbell, 60 shares.\nBut that said distribution and allotment was made having regard to the original basis of distribution of stock as set forth in the said agreement. The bill then alleges that the plaintiffs and defendants were the first directors of the said company until the 3rd March, 1878, when the defendant Campbell ceased to be a director, and thereafter the plaintiffs and the defendants, other than Campbell, have continued to be and still are at the time of the filing of the bill of complaint, namely, on the 21st February, 1881, directors of the company and the defendant Neelon the president thereof.\nThe bill then alleges that the plaintiffs contributed to said company everything required from them by the said agreement of the 29th December, 1876, and among these things a mail contract which the plaintiffs had to carry mails from Sarnia to Duluth, under which the said joint stock company had been in the receipt of $7,000 per annum, and have received in all therefrom the sum of twenty-one thousand dollars. And that after the formation of the said company, and the issuing of the said letters patent, and after the defendants had received their said stock, the plaintiffs for the first time learned that the said defendants had no written or binding mail contract with the Government as represented by them as aforesaid, but had merely a verbal agreement with said Government from year to year, and that the government after the formation of the company refused to continue said verbal agreement or to pay said sum of one hundred dollars per trip as represented by the said defendants in respect of said mails, and that although the said steamboats entitled thereto have continued to run from Windsor to Duluth aforesaid, the said company have wholly lost the said sum of one hundred dollars per trip, whereby also the plaintiffs have suffered loss as such shareholders by reason of the said misrepresentations. The bill then alleged that the defendants had a contract with the town of Windsor to receive from that corporation the sum of $6,000 for running a steamer once a week during the season of navigation for three years, one year of which had yet to run when the agreement of December, 1876, was entered into, and that although the defendants had received the whole of the sum of $6,000, and although the service for the third year was performed by the said joint stock company, yet the defendants refused to pay, or to account to the said company for the sum of $2,000, the proportion applicable to the service during such third year, or any part thereof.\nAssuming the representations to have been made as alleged, it is nevertheless apparent from this bill that the material substance of the agreement of December, 1876, was that the defendants as promoters jointly with the plaintiffs of the contemplated joint stock company would transfer their steamships, &c., &c., and the goodwill of their business and all contracts, &c., &c., to the said joint stock company when formed, for which they were respectively to be allotted and receive the number of shares in the paid-up capital stock of the company in the bill mentioned, and that, until the company should be formed, the plaintiffs and defendants should jointly possess and enjoy the said steamships, &c., &c., &c., in partnership for the purpose of carrying on the business together for their joint benefit in like proportions to the number of shares agreed to be allotted to each in the company. This agreement enured to the benefit of the company when formed. Now the company was formed on the 5th of March, 1877, before ever the season of navigation had commenced, before therefore the business could have been carried on by the plaintiffs and defendants in partnership, and before the plaintiffs could have derived any benefit from the contract assuming it to have been in existence, and the company on the said 5th of March became absolutely entitled, under the terms of the said agreement of December, 1876, to a transfer of all the property, rights and contracts and assets, agreed by the instrument to be transferred to them, including the said contract and all benefit to be derived therefrom.\nNow, when the deeds, which, by the said instrument had been agreed to be executed, transferring to the company the said property, rights, contracts and assets by the plaintiffs and defendants respectively, were, in fact, executed, or in what terms they were drawn, does not appear, but we must, on the statements of the bill, take it that they were executed so as to pass to the company every thing, which by the articles of agreement as set out in the bill was agreed to be transferred, so that if the defendants had, as is alleged, obtained shares allotted to them in the capital stock of the company based upon the allegation of their having such a mail contract as is alleged in the bill and for a greater amount than, but for such allegation, would have been allotted to them and than they would have been entitled to receive, all recompense, indemnity and satisfaction of whatsoever nature, in respect of such excess in said allotment must needs be made to the said joint stock company as the only party entitled to receive the same. That recompense, indemnity or satisfaction could have been obtained, as it appears to me, in one or other of two ways only, namely, either 1st. By the defendants giving up the shares so allotted to them respectively in excess of the number of shares they should have received, or 2nd. By making good the representation by paying over to the company the $100 per trip, which the steamer which should have performed the service, if the contract had existed would have received. But by the bill it appears that while the plaintiffs and defendants were the directors of the company, and in fact the only shareholders therein, it was in May, 1877, discovered there was no such mail contract in existence as the plaintiffs now allege the defendants, for the unjust purpose of increasing the amount of the shares in the capital stock of the company to be allotted to them, represented that they had, and of this fact the plaintiffs, and the company, were thenceforth well aware; yet it appears that out of the profits of the business in the years 1877-8-9 and 1880, the defendants were in each year paid by the company dividends upon the shares alleged to have been allotted to them in excess of what they should have received, in which payment the plaintiffs, as directors of the company and the only shareholders therein besides the defendants, must have concurred. The company thereby, and the plaintiffs as directors thereof and as shareholders therein, having the controlling voting power, with full knowledge of the alleged misrepresentation and the alleged wrongful allotment of shares, recognised and affirmed in the most unequivocal manner the correctness of the allotment and the right of the respective defendants to receive such dividends. The plaintiffs further in their bill allege, as in fact and in law must be admitted to be true, that the loss, whatever it is, if any there be, which has been sustained, has been sustained by the company. The allegation is in the 16th paragraph of the bill, where it is alleged that, by reason of the premises, \u201cthe said company have wholly lost the \u201csaid sum of one hundred dollars per trip,\u201d and the plaintiffs add, \u201cwhereby also the plaintiffs have suffered loss as such shareholders by reason of such misrepresentation.\u201d All the loss that the plaintiffs have Sustained is thus alleged to have been sustained, as indeed under the circumstances it could only be, as Shareholders in the company, such loss arising by reason of the loss which the company in which they are shareholders are said to have sustained, but no action lies at the suit of shareholders in a company for a loss sustained by the company, although in such loss the shareholders must necessarily partake. In this respect the action is unprecedented and unmaintainable. Moreover, the loss which in such a case the shareholders sustain is the several loss of each shareholder and is proportionate to the number and amount of the shares held by each, and for such loss, if it were actionable, each must sue for his own loss.\nThe learned counsel for the appellants, in his argument before us, was obliged to admit that for any loss as shareholders in the company the plaintiffs could not maintain this action; and to get over this difficulty he contended that the plaintiffs, the moment the instrument of December, 1876, was executed, had sustained the loss for which this action is brought, in this that, inasmuch as in point of fact the defendants had not such a contract as they are alleged to have represented that they had, the shares of the plaintiffs in the interim partnership constituted by the instrument were depreciated in value and less saleable. The answer to this contention is twofold: 1st. That no such case is made by the bill. 2nd. Nor could have been successfully, for the agreement in the instrument of December, 1876, is that the partnership between the plaintiffs should continue only until the joint stock company should be formed, and that all the property of the plaintiffs and defendants respectively and their respective rights, contracts and assets agreed to be transferred should continue to be the property of the partnership until the company should be formed, when all should be transferred to the company, and the co-partnership should become dissolved; so that in the interim there were no shares capable of being disposed of or whose intrinsic value could be depreciated, nor could any change whatever in the partnership or its assets or effects have bee\u00bb made without the con- sent of all the partners. If the partnership had continued in existence, and the business been carried on in partnership by reason of delay in the formation of. the company, for the space, say, of a year, during which profits were being made, still the plaintiffs would have sustained no damage necessarily resulting from the misrepresentation; for as the fact of the non-existence of the mail contract was ascertained at the commencement of the season before any profits could have been made, when the profits accruing from the season\u2019s business, which, until divided, would be in the possession and control of the partners jointly, should come to be ascertained and divided the plaintiffs had in their own hands the power of protecting themselves by refusing to let the defendants have any profits in respect of the shares in the partnership, if any there were, which the defendants had acquired in excess of what they were entitled to, or would have had, but for their alleged fraudulent representation of the existence of this mail contract. If, with knowledge of the facts, the plaintiffs had agreed to a distribution of profits to the defendants upon the full amount of an interest in the partnership capital, which they were to have only on the faith of the truth of their representation, the plaintiffs could not complain that they had suffered any damage attributable to the alleged misrepresentation. The matter, in such a case, would have been simply one of account between the partners, to be taken under the direction of the court if the parties should differ among themselves. It is plain, therefore, that no loss could have arisen until the defendants received the shares allotted to them by the company, and that the loss, if any there was, was, as stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, the loss of the company. This view of the case I have already disposed of. Finally, I am of opinion that it is impossible for us to say that the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in reversing the finding of the learned judge who tried the case, have come to an erroneous conclusion on the facts of the case. It is impossible to regard the case as turning simply on the degree of credibility to be attached to the testimony of, or upon the weight to be given to the memory of, persons speaking to conversations which had taken place six years previously. There is a mass of other evidence bearing on the material point in issue; in fact, the whole of the dealings and conduct of the parties constitute most important evidence, which must be taken into consideration in order to arrive at a just conclusion upon the point in issue, which is whether any and, if any, what sum of money, or any and, if any, what number of shares, was agreed to be and was allowed and allotted to the defendants as the value of the alleged mail contract. The question is one depending upon the proper inference to be drawn from the whole of the evidence, and, to my mind, the proper inference to be drawn is that there was not. I am of opinion, therefore, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal, in reversing the judgment of the learned judge who tried the case, must be maintained.\nPrior to the year 1876 the plaintiffs had received $9,000 per annum for the mail service, for which, by their contract of 1876, they were only to receive $7,000. The service to be rendered under this last contract was that a steamer should leave Sarnia twice a week, namely, on Tuesdays and Fridays, calling at Southampton and Fort William only en route to Duluth. The $2,000 per annum so deducted from the amount which the Sarnia line had in previous years received was applied by the Postmaster General in procuring an additional mail service by the Windsor line starting a steamer from Windsor every Thursday, calling at eleven places on the way to Duluth, thus giving enlarged benefit to the public and serving numerous additional places on the route. For this service the defendants received in 1876 $100 per trip, and there is no reason to suppose that they would not have received the like sum in the following year if they should have rendered the like service.\nNow, the plaintiffs admit that their own contract was terminable at any moment at the will of the Postmaster General, and that they knew that whatever contract the defendants had must have been terminable in like manner. The plaintiffs also knew that in carrying out their mail contract a steamer of the defendants\u2019 line had to leave Windsor every Thursday. Now it was this competition and expense caused by this excess of steamship accommodation to do the work that was for them to do, that constituted the motive of bringing about the amalgamation of the two interests into the one joint stock company, and it is admitted by the plaintiffs that to run a separate steamer from Windsor on Thursday, as had been done by the defendants, while other steamers should leave Sarnia on Tuesdays and Fridays, as was necessary under the plaintiffs\u2019 contract, would not have at all paid the amalgamated company, and no such steamer could have been run by them; so that we must come to the conclusion that no such thing had been contemplated in forming the amalgamation, as that a steamer should leave Windsor on Thursday additional to their leaving Sarnia on Tuesdays and Fridays and performing the service which the defendants\u2019 steamer had performed.\nThen, again, we see that what the plaintiffs and defendants used all their influence to obtain for the company when formed was that the Postmaster General would give the $100 per trip to the company to carry a mail from Windsor by a steamer of the company\u2019s line leaving Sarnia on Tuesdays or Fridays, for which such steamer would call at Windsor. In fact, that the company should receive $9,000 per annum instead of $7,000 for the additional service of one of the company calling at Windsor for and carrying a mail from there in one of the steamers that by the contract of 1876 with the plaintiffs they were obliged to start from Sarnia. This would not suit the Postmaster General, whose object in subsidizing the defendants\u2019 line was to get the additional service, and on a different day from those on which the steamers of the plaintiffs\u2019 line were obliged to leave Sarnia; but a service otherwise than in the manner proposed by the plaintiffs and defendants on behalf of the company would not suit the company. The amalgamation plainly was effected for the express purpose of doing away with the three trips per week which the separate lines had between them made, and so the loss of the benefit of the contract, whatever might have been its terms which the defendants had in 1876, must, as it appears to me, have been foreseen and contemplated as a necessary consequence upon the formation of the joint stock company. All the efforts of the parties to procure the Post Office Department to give the subsidy of $100 per trip, for a totally different service from that for which it had been given to the defendants, supports this view.\nNow, although the plaintiffs whose interest it was to get allowed to themselves shares to the amount of the capitalised value of their contract, assuming it to continue in existence for its full period, although it was, in fact, terminable at any moment at the will and pleasure of the Post Office Department, did obtain for themselves this advantage, it by no means follows as a just inference, that the defendants should receive a like benefit in respect of a contract, the terms of which the plaintiffs and the company they were forming could not and would not have fulfilled. The conduct also of the parties in giving to the defendants yearly their dividends upon the whole number of the shares allotted to them in which the plaintiffs, as directors of the company and as shareholders therein, must be taken to have concurred, is quite inconsistent with the idea that a portion of these shares had been allotted to them only upon the faith of a consideration which had wholly failed. The whole weight of the evidence leads to the opposite conclusion, and the appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: MacLaren, MacDonald, Merritt and Shepley.\nSolicitors for respondents: Miller, Cox and Yale.\n[1] 12 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nFarm crossing\u2014Liability of Railway Company to provide\u2014Agreement with agent of company\u201414 and 15 Vic. cap. 51 sec. 13\u2014Substitution of \u201cat\u201d for \u201cand\u201d in Consolidated Statutes of Canada cap. 66 sec. 13.\nThe C.S. R. Co. having taken for the purposes of their railway the lands of C., made a verbal agreement with C., through their agent T., for the purchase of such lands, for which they agreed to pay $662, and they also agreed to make five farm crossings across the railway on C.\u2019s farm, three level crossings and two under crossings; that one of such under crossings should be of sufficient height and width to admit of the passage through it, from one part of the farm to the other, of loads of grain and hay, reaping and mowing machines; and that such crossings should be kept and maintained by the company for all time for the use of C, his heirs and assigns. C. wished the agreement to be reduced to writing, and particularly requested the agent to reduce to writing and sign that part of it relative to the farm crossings, but he was assured that the law would compel the company to build and maintain such crossings without an agreement in writing. C. having received advice to the same effect from a lawyer whom he consulted in the matter, the land was sold to the company without a written agreement and the purchase money paid.\nThe farm crossings agreed upon were furnished and maintained for a number of years until the company determined to fill up the portion of their road on which were the under crossings used by C.; who thereupon brought a suit against the company for damages for the injury sustained by such proceeding and for an injunction. Held, reversing the judgment of the court below, Ritchie C.J. dissenting, that the evidence showed that the plaintiff relied upon the law to secure for him the crossings to which he considered himself entitled, and not upon any contract with the company, and he could not, therefore, compel the company to provide an under crossing through the solid embankment formed by the filling up of the road, the cost of which would be altogether disproportionate to his own estimate of its value and of the value of the farm.\nHeld also, that the company were bound to provide such farm crossings as might be necessary for the beneficial enjoyment by C. of his farm, the nature, location, and number of said crossings to be determined on a reference to the Master of the court below.\nThe substitution of the word \u201cat\u201d in sec. 13 of cap. 66 of the Con solidated Statutes of Canada, for the word \u201cand\u201d in sec. 13 of cap, 51 of 14 and 15 Vic. is the mere correction of an error and was made to render more apparent the meaning of the latter section, the construction of which it does not alter nor affect.\nBrown v. The Toronto and Nipissing Ry. Co., 26 U.C.C.P. 206 over-ruled.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] varying the decree of Mr. Justice Proudfoot in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice[2].\nThe facts of the case are as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff in his statement of claim alleges that in the month of March, 1871, he entered into a verbal agreement with the defendants through their agent, John Avery Tracey, for the sale by the plaintiff to the defendants of 721\/100 acres of land of the plaintiff\u2019s taken by the defendants for the purposes of their railway for which it was then agreed that the defendants should pay the plaintiff $662.00 and should make five farm crossings across the railway on plaintiff\u2019s farm; that three of such crossings should be level crossings and the other two under crossings; and that one of such under crossings should be of sufficient height and width to admit of this passage through it from one part of plaintiffs farm to the other, of loads of grain and hay, reaping and mowing machines, and that such crossings should be kept and maintained by the defendants for all time for the use of the plaintiff, his heirs and assigns; that at the time when said agreement was entered into the plaintiff was desirous that the same should be reduced to writing and signed by himself and the said Tracey for and on behalf of the defendants, and that he particularly requested said Tracey to reduce to writing and sign that part of the said agreement relating to the farm crossings to be made and maintained by defendants for the use of the plaintiff, but that said Tracey assured the plaintiff that a writing was unnecessary and that the law would compel defendants to build and maintain said crossings although the agreement with reference thereto was not in writing, and the plaintiff believing such representations, and relying thereon, did not further insist upon the said agreement being reduced to writing; that in pursuance of said agreement the plaintiff, by indenture bearing date the 16th day of March, 1871, duly conveyed the said 721\/100 acres of land to defendants, and the defendants took possession of the same and paid the plaintiff the money consideration agreed upon therefor, and built their railway upon and along said parcel of land and furnished the several level and under crossings so stipulated for and agreed upon between plaintiff and defendants as aforesaid, and have maintained the same for the use of the plaintiff who has used the same without any interruption or hindrance from the time the said railway was built until the 8th of October, 1881, on which day the defendants caused the larger of the said two under crossings to be boarded up so as to render it impossible by, and useless to, the plaintiff, and on several occasions since the defendants have caused the said under crossings to be partly filled up with earth and rubbish, and the plaintiff has been put to great trouble and expense in removing such earth and other obstacles from the said under crossings, and rendering them fit for use by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff claimed: 1. Damages for the wrongs complained of. 2 An order restraining the defendants from any repetition of any of the acts complained of. 3. Such further relief as the nature of the case might require.\nThe defendants, in their statement of defence, admit that Tracey was a purchasing agent of theirs for right of way; but they say that the sum paid to the plaintiff was not merely for the expropriation of his land, but was also for all damages to his property through which the right of way was taken, in so far as it was injuriously affected. They deny that Tracey made any bargain or contract with the plaintiffs for three level and two under-crossings, as alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim; that if he did he had no authority from the defendants to make the alleged promises, and that the defendants are not bound thereby; and they deny that the plaintiff is entitled to the larger under-crossing, in respect of which the action is brought, or to any under-crossing, or that the defendants are liable to furnish and maintain the same. They also deny that they furnished the under-crossings in the plaintiff\u2019s claim mentioned in pursuance of any agreement; that at the places where the two alleged under-crossings are there were depressions in the ground which the defendants bridged over instead of filling up, for economy, intending that these and similar other depressions along the line of their railway should be filled up with earth as soon as they should have the means to do so, and the superstructures over such depressions should require renewal; and that, although they were always ready and willing to allow land owners to use these places as under-crossings, and afforded them facilities for using them as such, it never was the intention of the defendants that the plaintiff, or persons similarly situated, should have the right to use these crossings permanently, and they averred that they had furnished the plaintiff with good and suitable over-crossings, and they denied that they are legally bound to furnish him with any others; and they finally pleaded the statute of frauds as a bar to the action.\nMr. Justice Proudfoot made a decree in the plaintiffs favour, granting to him a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with, hindering or obstructing the plaintiff in his possession, use and enjoyment of the under crossing under the defendants\u2019 railway, and lots numbers 10 & 11 in the 8th concession of the Township of Townsend. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from this decree and that court varied the decree making it as varied read as a decree granting the plaintiff an injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with, hindering or obstructing the plaintiff in the use and enjoyment of the under crossing under the defendant\u2019s railway, &c., until compensation shall have been made, in pursuance of the provisions of the statutes in that behalf, for the additional injury to the plaintiff\u2019s farm from any further exercise of the power of the company by which the plaintiff may be deprived of the said under crossing, and with these variations and directions the defendants\u2019 appeal was dismissed without costs.\nFrom the decree so varied both parties appeal, the defendants insisting that the plaintiff\u2019s action should have been wholly dismissed, and the plaintiff that the original decree as made by Mr. Justice Proudfoot should not have been varied.\nCattanach for appellants.\nThe respondent having preferred to stand on his statutory rights under the impression that he might get more in that way than by agreement, he could only be entitled to such crossings as the law gave him. The learned counsel cited and referred to Reist v. G.T. Ry. Co.[3]; Burke v. G.T. Ry. Co.[4]; Brown v. Toronto & Nipissing Ry.[5]; Hodges on Railways[6].\nAdmitting there was an agreement, as alleged, specific performance would not be the appropriate remedy.\nCiting Sayers v. Collyer[7]; Fry on Specific Performance[8]; Pierce on Railways[9]; Raphael v. Thomas Valley Ry.[10]; See Gardner v. London C. &. D. Ry.[11]. This last case has been followed in Canada in various cases. In Simpson v. Ottawa &c. Ry. Co.[12]; the late Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal when in the Chancery Division, says that the legislature has confided to the company, and not to the courts, the discharge of all functions which have relation to public safety and convenience, &c.\nMcCarthy Q.C., and Robb for respondent.\nThe agreement alleged was clearly proved and so far performed as to get over the objection of the Statute of Frauds. The judge at the trial having believed the witnesses for the plaintiff, his finding should not be disturbed. Grasett v. Carter[13]; Berthier Election[14].\nThe most the Railway Company can obtain is either recission of the whole bargain and a restitutio in integrum\u2014or an option to take what we meant to give viz, our strip of land through the middle of our farm, less a perpetual right to an under crossing.\nWe put the company upon either horn of the dilemma.\nThe covenants are such as run with the land. Spencer\u2019s case[15]; Tulk v. Moxhay[16]; Cooke v. Chilcotte[17].\nThe plaintiffs case can be subjected to the test of specific performance under the circumstances and the law applicable to the subject, and the plea that the remedy of damages is sufficient under Lord Cairns\u2019 Act and R.S.O. c. 40, s. 40 would not be entertained; as in both these cases the acts of part performance have been such as to irretrievably change the condition and circum stances of the parties and to give the defendants full benefit of their contract in specie. That being so the court will go any length to make them perform their part of the agreement in specie.\nPer Wigram V.C., in Price v. Corporation of Penzance[18]; Storer v. G.W. Ry. Co.[19]; Lyttog v. G.N. Ry. Co.[20]; Wilson v. Furness Railway[21]; Green v. West Cheshire[22].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think it clear that at the time the agreement was entered into the erection of a trestle bridge only was in the contemplation of the company, and the agreement was made in reference to that. If the defendants had intended the agreement to be only temporary that should have been stipulated for; or if they intended to reserve to themselves the right to dispense with the trestle bridge at their own free will and pleasure, and substitute a solid embankment in lieu thereof, that should have been provided for; not having done so, I think plaintiff should have his under crossing. If it is more to the interest of the defendants that there should be a new embankment in lieu of a trestle bridge, they must so construct the embankment as to preserve the plaintiff\u2019s subway, or adopt such proceedings as will deprive the plaintiff of his under crossing and compensate him therefor.\nI cannot think that having obtained the plaintiff\u2019s land at a reduced price by reason of the agreement that he should have one pass under the bridge it could have been intended by either party that the company were, the next day, at their own will and pleasure, to abandon the trestle bridge and adopt a solid embankment, and so deprive the plaintiff of his pass, he having accepted a reduced price for his land under a clear agreement that he was to have an underground crossing. I think if the defendants find it more to their interest to change the trestle bridge and substitute an embankment, they must so construct the embankment as to give the plaintiff what he, by taking a reduced sum for his land, has paid for it, even though the change and substitution mentioned should thereby involve an increased expenditure.\nIt is admitted that Tracey was the agent to secure the land for the right of way for the company, and I think, as incidental to that, he was clothed with authority to make agreements with the parties whose lands he was negotiating for with reference to crossings in connection therewith, not only with reference to their location, but also as to their natures. I think the evidence in this case very clearly shows that he did so; that the result of his dealings with the plaintiff was communicated to the officers of the company and acted upon by the company and the plaintiff; that to carry out the agreement, and enable the plaintiff to use and enjoy the privilege agreed on, a change was made in the construction of the trestle bridge by the company, and the plaintiff entered on the enjoyment of the way thus agreed on and arranged by the company, and has used the same, without interruption, for a number of years. I think there was evidence of the agreement and of its ratification by the company, and that the Vice Chancellor was right in holding that there was a concluded agreement for an under crossing. This crossing would appear to be a necessity for the plaintiff; he has bought it and paid for it by the reduced price of his land, and should not now be deprived of it because the defendants wish to change the trestle bridge to an embankment. If they do so they will be J obliged to incur extra expense to furnish the plaintiff with his under crossing. Plaintiff has a right to the enjoyment of his under crossing until it is taken from him by legal means.\nThis, in my opinion, is the state of the case as it now stands. I do not think it necessary to enter on any discussion as to what the railway company might or might not do if they think it desirable to change from a trestle to an absolutely solid embankment, under the 11th section of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, ch. 66. As suggested by Mr. Justice Patterson, they have not taken any steps in that direction.\nIt being abundantly clear that the under crossing was taken into consideration in fixing the amount the plaintiff was to receive and the company to pay, if the company find it desirable to build a close embankment and so make a complete severance of the plaintiff\u2019s farm for which they have paid him no compensation they must, by legal means, obtain the right and pay for it before altering the existing state of things.\nI think there is no objections to vary the decree as suggested by Mr. Justice Patterson, and that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of opinion that the agent had authority from the company to make special arrangements to a certain extent, but the ratification of his agreement only carried out the object of the company in making the contract with Clouse. They undertook to put up a trestle bridge and they did so. It was no object to them to have the use of an underground passage. They merely authorized the agent to arrange with parties for the damages which they had sustained and I do not think it amounted to the extent of authorizing him to bind the company to give the party a useless crossing and one which the law would not supply, and therefore I am rather of the opinion that Clouse is not entitled to the crossing.\nThe law provides in such a case for the appointment of arbitrators and I do not think that arbitrators would have power under the act to award an under crossing under these circumstances. I do not think the law would give them any such power.\nThe condition of these lands have altered since this agreement was made. A crossing for a two hundred acre lot would be very different in the eye of the law from that required for a fifty acre lot. A party has a two hundred acre lot divided into lots of fifty acres each and if he remains owner of the two hundred acre lot the necessity of a crossing for each fifty acres would not be so apparent as it is now when he only has the fifty acres. He should have an agreement for a special crossing.\nI concur in the judgment of my brother Gwynne and think the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I have come to the same conclusion on the same grounds. I think the plaintiff is not entitled to an under crossing. The appeal should be allowed and the cross appeal dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In order to arrive at a just conclusion as to what should be done in this case, it is necessary to consider what were the rights of the parties, and what their position towards each other was at the time of the promise being made, if any was made, by Tracey, as the defendant\u2019s agent, in respect of the under cross- ings, the right to the perpetual enjoyment of which the plaintiff claims, what was the extent of Tracey\u2019s authority as the defendant\u2019s agent? What was the promise which in fact, if any, was made by him and what was the actual consideration for such promise? It was not disputed, but was rather assumed, that the defendants had filed a map or plan of their proposed railway, with a book of reference, as required by the statute, preliminary to their taking measures to acquire the land required by them for their railway and works by compulsory expropriation under the statute, and that they were in a position therefore to enter into an agreement with him touching the compensation to be paid to him for the land intended to be taken, and for any damage which might be sustained by him from the manner in which they should exercise the powers vested in them In order to proceed by compulsory expropriation it was necessary that they should have served on the plaintiff a notice containing a description of the lands to be taken and of the powers intended to be exercised with regard to the lands, and a declaration of readiness to pay some certain sum as compensation for the land to be taken and for such damages as might be occasioned to the plaintiff by the manner in which they proposed to construct their railway upon the lands so taken. The plaintiff had no power to resist the acquisition by the defendants of so much of the plaintiffs land as they required for the purposes of their railway, provided only that the land required was within the limits authorized by the statute, nor had the plaintiff any right to impose upon the defendants any obligation as a condition upon which alone he would consent to their having the land they required. The plaintiff\u2019s sole right at the time the agreement was made with Tracey consisted in the right of determining, by agreement inter partes if possible, and if not, of having determined by arbitration under the statute, the amount he should receive by way of compensation for the land taken from him and for such damage, if any, as the construction of the defendants railway through his farm might occasion to him over and above the mere value of the land taken. This latter value might possibly be easily agreed upon, but the amount of compensation to be paid for the damage, if any, which might be occasioned to the plaintiff by the manner in which the defendants proposed to construct their railway through his farm might not be so easy of adjustment. In order to enable a land owner to make a fair estimate of the damage thus occasioned to him it is but reasonable that the Railway Company should show him in what manner, and with what description of work, it is proposed that the railway should be carried through his land, namely, whether on the level throughout, or partly on the level and partly on an embankment, or in a deep cutting; and what mode of crossing is proposed to be supplied to enable the land owner to have access to his land on both sides, namely, whether by farm crossings on the level or by under or over crossings, or in one place by one kind, and in another by one of the other kind; unless information upon these particulars should be afforded, the land owner could not, although willing to come to terms with the company, nor, in case he should prefer submitting his case to arbitration under the statute, could arbitrators, form an accurate judgment as to the amount of compensation the land owner should receive for the damage which might be occasioned to him by the railway. The plaintiff here could not have imposed upon the defendants the obligation that they should give him at the place indicated here a permanent under crossing as a condition of their acquiring the land required for roadway through his farm. If the defendants thought that they could not conveniently, or consistently with a proper regard to their own interests, in view, for example, of the great expense of such a work, grant him such an under crossing, but that they could give him a surface crossing, or surface crossings, which, although not as convenient as the undercrossing he desires to have might be, still would afford some degree of convenience, all, if anything, that the plaintiff could claim would be reasonable compensation in money for the damage, if any, which might be occasioned to him by the difference in the convenience afforded to him by the surface crossings and in that which the under crossing, if granted, would afford to him. The defendants admit that Tracey was their agent for acquiring right of way. He had their authority to agree with the plaintiff upon the price to be paid for the land taken and also upon the amount to be paid by way of compensation for such damage as might be occasioned by the manner in which it was intended that the railway should be constructed through his farm. For this purpose it was necessary that he should be in a position to show in what manner the work was intended to be constructed. The defendants had put Tracey in such a position as their agent to deal with the plaintiff as to the amount of compensation to be paid to him that although he had not, and I think it clear that he had not, any authority vested in him to bind the defendants to give to the plaintiff a permanent under crossing, as claimed by him, still it was necessary that the defendants\u2019 agent should be in a position to show the nature of the works contemplated by the defendants to enable the plaintiff intelligently to estimate the amount of damage done to him for which he might be entitled to receive compensation, and to enable him to determine whether he should himself conclude an agreement with the defendants, or should, in preference, have recourse to the measures provided by law for obtaining satisfaction in the absence of agreement. As to surface crossings there does not appear to have been any difficulty; one has been given on each fifty acres, into which the plaintiff has divided his lot of two hundred acres, one of which divisions of fifty acres, and only one, he retains as his own, having apportioned the others among his children. A depression in a portion of the fifty acres retained by the plaintiff, which the railway would have to cross, indicated that an embankment would have to be constructed at some time, the expense of constructing an under crossing through which might be so great that the defendants might reasonably be expected to be unwilling to give such a crossing. The plaintiff, I think, seems to have entertained some such idea, for when asked by Tracey what he wanted for right of way, he replied, as appears by his own evidence, \u201cthat the farm was so cut up that he did not see how he could have anything handy.\u201d The evidence shows that the defendants\u2019 intention was to cross this depression in the land at first by trestle work with a bridge on it across a little stream which ran there through the lot, as a temporary expedient, such trestle work to be replaced at some subsequent time when the defendants should be better able to afford the expense, by a solid embankment, with a culvert in it sufficiently large for the waters of the little stream to pass through it. That a trestle work was the mode designed to be adopted in the first instance Tracey knew, as probably also did the plaintiff. Boughner, who is the witness to the agree ment subsequently signed by the plaintiff, says that he was present when the plaintiff and Tracey were negotiating about the price to be paid to the plaintiff, and that Tracey suggested that there would be a good chance for an under crossing on the banks of the creek. Tracey himself, while he swears that he had no authority to agree, and that ho never did agree with the plaintiff that he should have a permanent under crossing, admits that he did say that there was a chance for the plaintiff to pass under the bridge, and that he also said that the law gave all necessary crossings and that plaintiff would get all necessary crossings. He admits also that he entered in his private memorandum book the words: \u201cSettled with Clouse he can have one pass under bridge,\u201d which he says he so entered because, knowing of the trestle work intended to be constructed, he knew there was a chance for a pass under the bridge; and he swears that he had nothing to do with the crossing business except upon three or four occasions for which he received special instructions from Mr. Courtwright, who appears to have been a contractor for building the road. He never received any instructions from the board of directors nor from any one but Mr. Courtwright. In the view which I take, nothing turns upon any contradiction there may be in the evidence of the witnesses or any of them. In the actual facts which occurred, there does not appear to be much substantial difference, it was in the view which each took of what did take place that the difference exists. Tracey\u2019s view of the question of crossings appears to have been that this was a subject with which he, as agent merely for acquiring right of way, had nothing to do; that the law would give the plaintiff all necessary crossings; and I can well understand that in pointing out that by reason of the trestle work which was intended to be put up the plaintiff might get, or have an opportunity to get, the under crossing he wanted to have, he never contemplated by this suggestion, or by anything he said or by the memorandum entered in his book, that he should be understood as making, or as having made, any contract on behalf of the defendants that the plaintiff should have such a crossing or that he was imposing any obligation upon the defendants to give it. In the view which I take, the case may be determined upon what appears to me to be the true construction of the result of the evidence as given by the plaintiff himself.\nIn his letter of the 18th July, 1882, to the chief engineer of the defendants company, he says that his original demand was $1,000 for right of way and damages. I take this sum to be more accurate than the sum of $1,200, which the plaintiff on his examination in chief in the cause states to be the amount he first demanded when, as he says, his farm was so cut up that he did not see how he could have anything handy. It was then, according to plaintiff\u2019s evidence, that Tracey suggested that plaintiff could have this under crossing. Plaintiff says that he suggested that he should have some writing to that effect, but that Tracey said there was no need of it, that the law provided that people should have such crossings as were necessary to cross their farms and that Mr. Boughner lived handy and would see that plaintiff should get it all right; before finally closing with Tracey, the plaintiff consulted his lawyer, a Mr. Duncombe, who also told him that it was not necessary to have an agreement about crossings in writing, and that he would get them all right, that the law would give the crossings, that the statute provided for it.\nThat the plaintiff consulted Mr. Duncombe with a view to govern his conduct in negotiating with Tracey for the land taken there can be no doubt upon the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence; and Mr. Duncombe advised him that there was no necessity for any writing as to crossings, for that the law would give them. This appears to have been the general opinion. Tracey admits that he was of that opinion also, and that he so expressed himself. So advised, the plaintiff finally entered into an agreement with Tracey bearing date the 23rd of January, 1871, which was signed by the plaintiff whereby he agreed to convey to the defendants, by a proper deed with bar of dower, so much of lots 10 & 11 in the 8th concession of the Township of Towns- end, in the County of Norfolk as is taken by the company for its line of railway containing 7 21\/100 acres for the sum of $650.00 to be paid within thirty days from the date of the said agreement, being for price of land $540.75 and for price of damages $109.25, and the plaintiff thereby granted leave to the defendants to take possession at once for the purpose of prosecuting the work of grading.\nNow, the true inference to be drawn from the above is that the plaintiff being advised by his counsel that there was no necessity for any writing relating to crossings, and that the law sufficiently made provision for them, deducted from the amount which he originally asked, upon the assumption that he was not to have the particular under crossing in question, the sum of $350,00 intending to rest upon his legal rights to secure him the crossings he required. The plaintiff very probably considered that what Tracey had said constituted a sufficient location for an under crossing, or he may have thought, under the legal opinion he had taken, that he had the right to locate his farm crossings, but it is clear, I think, that he relied upon the law to secure them to him and not upon any contract made with the defendants through Tracey as their agent, and he concluded his bargain for right of way and damages, which was reduced to writing and signed by him as a transaction wholly independent of all consideration of farm crossings and his rights thereto whatever they might be under the statute; and upon the 16th March following, he executed a deed whereby, in consideration of $662 then paid to him, he granted and confirmed to the defendants, their successors and assigns forever, the lands taken for their railway. Under these circumstances the plaintiff cannot, in my opinion, be now heard to say that he executed this deed upon condition of his having a permanent under crossing at the place in question or elsewhere; or even that a verbal agree- ment that he should have it constituted part of the consideration for his executing the deed granting the land for the railway the two things constitute quite distinct transactions and were understood so to be\u2014the one relating to the land required for the railway which was complete for the consideration stated in the agreement, and the other relating to crossings of the railway on the plaintiff\u2019s farm, as to which the plaintiff relied upon the law to secure them to him wholly apart from, and independently of, the agreement for the land. The plaintiffs case cannot either, in my opinion, be rested upon the allegation that the plaintiff was prevented by any fraud of the defendants, acting through their agent, from having an agreement verbally complete reduced to writing and signed, nor upon the contention that a verbal agreement was entered into which should be enforced against the defendants upon the ground that the plaintiff, upon the faith of the defendants performing their part, had faithfully performed his part of the same agreement. The plaintiff\u2019s legal and equitable right, if he has any, as to this under crossing cannot under the circumstances appearing in evidence be rested upon contract, but must be determined upon view of the statute law in virtue of which alone the defendants acquired the right of interfering in any manner with the plaintiff\u2019s property. What those rights are involves the necessity of reviewing the decision of the Court of Common Pleas for Ontario in Brown v. Toronto and Nipissing Ry. Co.[23]; I was a party to that judgment, but I must confess that on further consideration I do not think it can be supported. I do not think that the substitution of the word \u201cat\u201d in section 13 of chapter 66 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, for the word \u201cand,\u201d which was the word used in section 13 of ch. 51 of 14 and 15 Vic., makes any difference in the construction of the section. In view of the identity of the language of the statute of the State of New York, of 1850, ch. 140, sec. 44, there cannot, I think, be a doubt that sec. 13 of our statute, 14 and 15 Vic. ch. 51, was taken from the statute of the State of New York. So, in like manner, I think that our amended section 13, as consolidated in chapter 66 of the Consolidated Statutes, was taken from the statutes of the State of New York of 1854, ch. 282, sec. 8, substituting the word \u201cat\u201d for \u201cand.\u201d In the courts of the State of New York this amendment has not been considered to make any difference in the construction, and that it should not is, I think, the right conclusion. The amendment, indeed, appears to me to have been made to make the section more perfect than it originally was, and to express what was intended but was omitted in the section as it was. The word \u201cand\u201d being, by inadvertence as I think, used instead of \u201cat,\u201d the section failed to express where the \u201copenings, gates or bars in the fences\u201d were to be. The section ran thus:\u2014\nFences shall be erected and maintained on each side of the railway of the height and strength of an ordinary division fence, with openings or gates or bars therein, and farm crossings for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining the railway.\nNow it will be observed that this sentence fails to express where the \u201copenings or gates or bars\u201d were to be; they were to be in the fences, but in what part is not said, and yet it cannot be doubted that they were intended to be \u201cat the farm crossings of the road for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining the railway.\u201d The substitution of \u201cat\u201d in the Consolidated Statutes for \u201cand\u201d precisely expresses this intention. The statute so amended is, in my opinion, to be construed as regarding \u201cfarm crossings\u201d to be a necessary convenience for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining the railway when one part of a man\u2019s property is separated from the residue by the railway and to which necessary convenience such proprietor is entitled as of right, unless it shall appear that he has released and abandoned his right upon receiving compensation from the railway company in consideration of their depriving him of such necessary convenience. A railway may be so run across a man\u2019s property as to separate only a small angle from the rest of his farm; in such a case a farm crossing might not be necessary; but when a substantial part of a farm is separated by a railway from another substantial part, or a man\u2019s house is separated from his barn or stables or the like, then farm crossings constitute such a necessary requisite to the beneficial enjoyment of his property by the owner that no man can be deprived of them otherwise than by an instrument to that effect voluntarily executed by him or upon receipt of compensation adjudged to him by process of law, and the ordinary courts of the country are the courts wherein all differences between parties as to the nature, location and number of the crossings they are entitled to have, and all other matters incidentally arising are to be adjudicated upon and determined. These courts having jurisdiction to compel the construction of all such crossings as can be reasonably required have jurisdiction over every matter incidentally arising, and can, therefore, award pecuniary compensation also, if it should appear to be more reasonable that the land owner should be supplied with a less convenient crossing, with pecuniary compensation for difference in convenience, than that the railway company should be compelled specifically to give a more convenient crossing, as, for example, an under crossing, which, although it would afford the utmost amount of convenience, could be constructed only at a cost altogether disproportionate to the value of the farm upon which it was desired to be constructed, or disproportionate to the convenience which, when constructed, it would afford. The interests of both parties must in all cases be equitably con- sulted. It would be quite unjust to compel a railway company to construct an under crossing through an embankment, the cost of constructing which would be quite disproportionate to the value of the land separated or in excess of fair compensation for the injury the farmer might sustain from his not having such particular crossing, if a reasonably convenient crossing throgh it may be less convenient can be given elsewhere. The court, no doubt, has the power, in a proper case, to compel by its decree a railway company to construct an under crossing, instead of rendering satisfaction in damages to the farmer for his not having such a crossing, and this power and jurisdiction is founded not upon any contract, but is an inherent power in the court, arising of necessity to enable it to do justice between the parties. Whether the court shall or not exercise this jurisdiction is quite discretionary with it in view of the circumstances of each particular case. The defendants, by giving to the plaintiff for the period of eleven years\u2019 permission to cross the railway under the trestle work which was but a temporary construction, have not, I think, become absolutely bound to give to the plaintiff an under crossing through a permanent embankment substituted now for the trestle work; the question, however, of what would be reasonably sufficient crossings is still open to the court which is bound to weigh in an equal scale the interests of both parties. The learned judge who tried this case has expressed the opinion that from the nature of the ground the undercrossing claimed is of such importance to the plaintiff that adequate compensation cannot be given to him in damages. I must say that I fail to see the evidence upon which this opinion is founded, and I cannot well see how it can be supported in the presence of the evidence of the plaintiff himself, who seems to have valued the want of it at $350.00, the amount by winch he reduced his claim, which was for $1,000 00 when he was under the impression that he could not have this under crossing, to $650.00 when he understood that he could have it, thus, in effect, signifying his own estimate of the injury the want of the undercrossing would do to him to be $350 00. Now, the evidence shows that the cost to the defendants of the crossing under the permanent embankment proposed to be constructed would be from $2,500.00 to $3,000.00, a sum of money so disproportionate to the plaintiff\u2019s own estimate of the amount he should have received on the supposition that he was not to have it (and I cannot but think also to the value of this little farm of the plaintiff\u2019s, consisting only of 50 acres) that I do not think a case is made which justifies the decree which was made in the court of first instance. The defendants, it is admitted, have already supplied one surface crossing upon this little farm; if another, or more, is or are reasonably necessary for the convenient enjoyment of his farm by the plaintiff he is entitled to them, and he is entitled to have that question enquired into and determined by the court in this action, which is so framed that the court can award whatever relief the plaintiff may be entitled to and the nature of the case may require. The court is by the suit in possession of the whole case, and in the suit the rights of the parties must be conclusively determined, instead of remitting the case to the arbitrators to award compensation, the course which is directed by the decree as varied by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe opinion which I have above expressed is founded upon, and is supported by, decisions of the Court of Appeals for the state of New York, in cases upon statutes similarly worded and which (concurring as I do in their soundness) I do not hesitate to adopt. The cases I refer to are Wademan v. Albany and Susquehanna Ry. Co.[24]; Clarke v. Rochester, Lockport & N. F. Ry. Co.[25]; Smith v. N.Y. & Oswego Ry. Co.[26]; Jones v. Sleighman[27].\nThe result at which I have arrived is that the decree of the court of first instance should be varied as follows:\nDeclare that the plaintiff is entitled to have constructed and maintained for him by the defendants all farm crossings reasonably required, as necessary for the beneficial enjoyment of the lands separated by the defendants railway as it passes through his farm of 50 acres in the pleadings mentioned. Refer it to the master to enquire and report whether the one surface crossing already supplied by the defendants is reasonably sufficient for the enjoyment of his farm by the plaintiff, and if not in his opinion so reasonably sufficient then and in that case he is to enquire and report how many crossings, and where situate the defendants are willing to supply, or it would be reasonable to require that they should supply.\nDissolve the interlocutory injunction reserve all further consideration with costs.\nAllow the appeal of the defendants the railway company and dismiss the cross-appeal of the plaintiff with costs.\nAppeal allowed and cross appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellants: Kingsmill, Cattenach & Symons.\nSolicitors for Respondents: Tisdale & Robb.\n[1] 11 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nFarm crossing\u2014Agreement for cattle pass\u2014Construction of\u2014Liability of railway company to maintain\u2014Substitution of solid embankment for trestle bridge.\nIn negotiating for the sale of lands taken by the Canada Southern Railway Company for the purposes of their railway the agent of the agent of the company signed a written agreement with the owner, which contained a clause to the effect that such owner should \u201chave liberty to remove for his own use all buildings on the said right of way, and that in the event of their being constructed on the same lot a trestle bridge of sufficient height to allow the passage of cattle the company will so construct their fence to each side thereof as not to impede the passage thereunder.\u201d\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Ritchie C.J. dissenting, that under this agreement the only obligation on the company was to maintain a cattle pass so long as the trestle bridge was in existence and did not prevent them from discontinuing the use of such bridge and substituting a solid embankment therefor without providing a pass under such embankment.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] varying a decree of Mr. Justice Ferguson in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice.\nThe facts of the case are similar to those of The Canada Southern v. Clouse, and will be found set out in the reports of both cases in the courts below and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nThis appeal was heard at the same time as the appeal in Clouse\u2019s case, the same counsel appearing for the parties respectively.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Patterson that the right of the plaintiff is to have the state of things which has existed for the last ten years maintained, unless and until the company shall proceed under the statute to acquire a right to do what they now propose to do.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This case differs from that of Clouse against the same defendants in this that an agreement was reduced to writing by the solicitor of the company which was witnessed by him and signed by Mr. Tracey at the time that Smith, the then owner of the land of which the plaintiff is now proprietor, executed a deed granting to the defendants the land taken for their railway on lot No. 12 in the 9th concession of Townsend, this agreement is as follows:\u2014\nThe Canada Southern Railway Company by John Avery Tracey, their duly constituted agent for the purchase of right of way, do hereby agree with James H. Smith, the owner of lot twelve in the ninth concession of Townsend, his heirs and assigns as follows:\u2014\nThe said Smith having sold to the said company the right of way over lot number twelve in the ninth concession of the Township of Townsend, containing four acres and seventeen hundreths of an acre at and for the price of one thousand six hundred and fifty dollars and having given a conveyance to the said company for the same, it is hereby, notwithstanding such conveyance, agreed between the said parties that for the period of five years from the date of this agreement the said Smith, his heirs and assigns shall have possesion, undisturbed by the said railway company, of the woodshed and ground on which it is erected at the rear of his house and on the right of way so conveyed, and the fence of the said railway shall be so constructed as to leave a passage of at least five feet wide for the use of the said Smith, his heirs and assigns between the said woodshed and the railway fence and the said fence shall run from a point five feet south of the south-easterly corner of the said woodshed in a straight line to the south-easterly corner of a barn now standing on the fence line of the said railway and shall so remain during the space of five years as aforesaid, and it is hereby agreed that the said company shall give such further assurance as may be deemed necessary to carry out this agreement which is hereby declared part of the consideration for the said conveyance. Dated September 26th, 1871.\nThis instrument was signed by Tracey and witnessed by Mr. Kingsmill, the solicitor of the company. When the agreement was produced Smith objected to it as insufficient in not providing for a cattle pass and other things which he insisted had been agreed upon, accordingly Mr. Kingsmill wrote on the back of the said agreement a further clause which was also signed by Tracey and witnessed by Mr. Kingsmill, which is as follows:\u2014\nIt is further agreed, and it is to be taken as part of the within agreement, that the within named Smith shall have liberty to remove for his own use all buildings on the said right of way and it is also further agreed that in the event of there being constructed on the said lot a trestle bridge of sufficient height to allow of the passage of cattle the said company will so construct their fence on each side thereof as not to impede the passage thereunder. Dated September 26th, 1871.\nNo case for the reformation of this agreement so as to make it an agreement for a perpetual cattle pass under the railway at the place in question, whatever might be the character of the superstructure, has been established in evidence. The plaintiff\u2019s right, therefore, to recover in this suit must depend upon the construction of the agreement as it stands. The parties to the agreement must be regarded as being the best judges of what it was they were intending to provide for. Now it is to be observed that the pass spoken of in the agreement is not a \u201cfarm crossing,\u201d which, as I have already said in Clouse\u2019s case, is, in my opinion, a convenience which, unless a proprietor of lands severed by a railway accepts pecuniary compensation for being deprived of, or voluntarily releases his right thereto, is a necessity for the use and enjoyment of the severed lands which the law provides for apart from any contract. The language of the agreement is that\u2014\nIn the event of there being constructed a trestle bridge of sufficient height to allow of the passage of cattle, the company will so construct their fences on each side as not to impede the passage thereunder.\nAll that such language can be construed as providing for is a passage for cattle only, and that conditional upon there being a trestle bridge of sufficient height to permit of such a passage. This agreement so conditioned cannot be construed as depriving the company of the right to discontinue the trestle bridge, which was erected as a temporary structure, and to construct an embankment in its stead unless they shall construct a cattle pass in the embankment. The agreement does not contemplate that there should be provided a cattle pass under an embankment. As, then, the \u201ccattle pass\u201d can only be claimed under the written agreement, the obligation of the company, which is to construct their fences so as not to impede the passage of cattle under a trestle bridge if such should be erected of sufficient height so as to permit of the passage of cattle under it, cannot have any binding effect if and when the trestle bridge shall no longer exist. The two things are very different, namely, constructing fences so as to permit cattle to pass under a trestle bridge, and constructing an arch, of sufficient dimensions to permit the passage of cattle under an embankment, the cost of which work might be in excess of the whole value of the severed lands. The plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim in this case should, in my opinion, have been dismissed with costs, but such dismissal would not operate against any claim, if any, which the plaintiff may have under the law for such farm crossings or farm crossing, as may be necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the severed lands. The appeal of the defendants therefore, in my opinion, in this case should be allowed with costs, and the state\u00acment of claim of the plaintiff be ordered to be dismissed in the court below with costs.\nFOURNIER, HENRY and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal allowed, and cross appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: Kingsmill, Catanach and Symons.\nSolicitors for respondent: Tisdale & Robb.\n[1] 11 Ont.

J. Ritchie CJ. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE) MONTREAL.\nCharter party\u2014Deficient cargo\u2014Dead freight\u2014Demurrage.\nBy charter party the appellants agreed to load the respondent's ship at Montreal with a cargo of wheat, maize; peas or rye, \u201cas fast as can be received in fine weather.\" and ten days demurage were agreed on over and above lying days at forty pounds per day. Penalty for non-performance of the agreement, was estimated amount of freight. Should ice set in during loading so as to endanger the ship, master to be at liberty to sail with part cargo, and to have leave to fill up at any open port on the way homeward for ship's benefit.\nThe ship was ready to receive cargo on the 15th November, 1880, at 11 a.m., and the appellants began loading at 2 p.m. on the 16th November. After loading a certain quantity of rye in the forward hold, as it would not be safe to load the ship down by the head any further, the captain refused to take any more in the forward hold. No other cargo was ready, and as the appellants would not put the rye anywhere except in the forward hold, the loading stopped. At 8 a.m. on the 19th the loading recommenced and continued night, and day until 6 a.m. Sunday the D 21st, at which time the vessel sailed, in consequence of ice beginning to set in. When she sailed she was 214 1\/2 tons short of a full cargo. If the ice in the canal had not detained \"the barges having grain to be loaded, the vessel could have been loaded on the night of the 19th. The respondent sued appellants because ship had not received full cargo, and claimed 2 1\/2 dais, 15th, 16'th and 17th of November, and freight on 214 tons of \"cargo not shipped, The appellants contended delay was not dui to them but to the ship in not supplying baggers and sewers to bag the grain. That the time lost on the first week was made up by night work, and that mere delay in loading could not sustain claim for dead freight.\nThe Superior Court gave judgment for the respondent for the dead freight but refused to allow demurrage. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side).\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Henry J. dissenting, that as there was evidence that the vessel could have been loaded with a full and complete cargo without night work before she left, had the freighters supplied the cargo as agreed by the charter party, the appellants were liable for damages and that the proper measure of the respondent's claim was the amount of agreed freight which he would have earned upon the deficient cargo.\nThat the demurrage days mentioned in the Charter referred to, and were over and above, the laying days and had no reference to the loading of tie ship.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, for Lower Canada (appeal side).\nThis action was instituted by the respondent, as owner of the S. S. \"Wickham,\" for two and a half days' demurrage (\u00a3100) and for dead freight (\u00a3313).\nThe judgment of the court of the first instance allowed the dead freight (\u00a3313), rejecting the claim for demurrage.\nFrom this judgment an appeal was taken by the appellants to the Court of Queen's Bench, (appeal side), and also a cross appeal for the demurrage by the respondent.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the judgment of the court of first instance, and rejected the cross appeal.\nThe circumstances which gave rise to the action are fully stated in the head note and in the judgments hereinafter given ([1]).\nKerr Q.O. for appellants,\nH. Abbott for respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The respondents (plaintiff) vessel the \" Whickham'' was chartered by the appellants (defendants) for a voyage from Montreal to the United Kingdom or continent. The ship was to load with a. cargo of wheat, maize, peas and rye.\nThe only portion of the charter-party bearing on the present case, is the clause which provides that the ship should be loaded as fast as the cargo can be received in fine weather. The ship was to have an absolute lien on the cargo, dead freight and demurrage. Should ice set in during the loading so as to endanger the safety of the ship, the master to be at liberty to sail with part cargo and have leave to fill up at any open port on his way homeward for the ship's benefit\nThe plaintiff sued for dead freight, claiming that the ship could have been loaded with a full cargo if the defendants had not been negligent in supplying the cargo alongside. He also claimed demurrage two and a half days, the 15th, 16th and a part of the 17th of November. The dead freight claimed is on 214 1\/2 tons of cargo not shipped.\nThe ship left before receiving a full cargo under the provisions of the charter-party, by reason of the danger she was in from ice. The defendants contend that the delay was not due to them, but to the ship. The claim in this case is for dead, freight and. demurrage. The claim for dead freight arises in consequence of the failure to finish a full cargo. Dead freight denotes a sum agreed to be paid in respect of space not filled according to charter-party or damages provided for by the charter-party, in the event of the freighter not loading a full cargo. It is defined to be simply \"an unliquidated compensation recoverable by the ship-owner from the freighter for a deficiency of cargo.' And again for the loss of freight recoverable in the absence, or place of freight.\" In this\u2019 case, the freighter agreed to load a full and complete cargo, and therefore he must have known, that if he failed to perform his agreement, he would be liable to the ship-owner in damages under the name of dead freight which damages however in this case cannot be considered unliquidated, because, by the express terms of the agreement, the proper measure of the ship-owners claim, is to be the amount of the agreed freight which he would have earned upon the deficient cargo Had there been no stipulation as to the measure of damages, then it may well be, as suggested by Lord Westbury in McLean v. Fleming ([2]), that unless a specific sum is fixed for dead freight all reasonable charges should be deducted, and in such a case,\" in a charter-party giving no specific sum as the amount to be recovered by way of compensation for dead freight, the ship-owner becomes entitled only to a reasonable sum which is another phrase for unliquidated damages.\"\nIn this case a specific sum was fixed for dead freight in these terms : \" Penalty for non-performance of this \"agreement, estimated amount of freight.\" If, therefore the ship owner was in fault the estimated amount of freight on the cargo she might have received but for this default would be the estimated amount of freight the ship would have earned but for such default\nThe vessel is to be loaded as fast as the cargo can be received in fine weather; the cargo is to be brought to and taken from alongside the ship at ports of loading and discharge at merchant\u2019s risk and expense. These clauses cast on the charterer the duty of providing the cargo alongside as fast as it could be received in fine weather. The facts sufficiently show, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary that the Port Warden's certificate was sent to the appellants office before noon of the 15th of November, and therefore the loading should have commenced on that day; but assuming that it was received after twelve o'clock of the 15th the charterer did not commence loading until one o'clock p m of the 16th.\nWithout occupying time in going over the evidence in detail, I think it shows that had the cargo been supplied and the vessel loaded, from the time she was ready to take in cargo, or from the sixteenth, as fast as she could have received it she would have been loaded with a full and complete cargo before six a.m. of the twenty-first,' when she sailed. There was ample evidence in my opinion, in fact, to show that had the loading been begun when, and continued, as it should have been by the freighters supplying the cargo as required, a full cargo could have been loaded by Friday the nineteenth without night work, and she did not, in fact, leave until Sunday, the twenty-first. As to the loss of time from two o'clock of the seventeenth when loading was stopped by the Captain\u2019s order, up to eight a. m, on the nineteenth, it arose entirely from the default of the shippers, the captain was justified in refusing to allow any more grain to be put in the forward hold, and the shippers should have been prepared with cargo to go on with the loading in a proper manner, and not being in a position, or willing to do so, the responsibility for the delay must rest with, them; and therefore, I think the judgment right, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs, and costs in the court below except the costs of the respondent's cross appeal which should be dismissed with costs because as to the question of demurrage, the two days on demurrage mentioned and awkwardly interlined in the charter-party clearly refer to and are over and above the laying days which are the running days allowed for discharging cargo, commencing from the time of the ship's being ready to deliver cargo, necessarily at the port of destination and have no reference to the loading of the ship; and therefore, there is no ground whatever, for any claim for demurrage.\nAs to the vessel sailing at the time she did, the provision is,\u2014\nShould ice set in during the loading so as to endanger the ship' the master to be at liberty to sail with part cargo, and to have leave to fill up at any open port on the way homeward, for ship's benefit.\nThis clearly shows that if there were no laches on either side but should ice set in as mentioned, before a full cargo was loaded, then neither party could have any claim on the other, neither party being to blame; and the ship-owner would be entitled to freight on the cargo she was in a position to avail herself of at an open port for ship's benefit. The evidence clearly shows that the ship was entirely justified, from the state of the weather, in leaving, at the time, and under the circumstances she did. I do not think that the exercise of the option to leave without a full cargo by any means absolved the appellants from their obligation fully to load the ship for their failure to do so arose from their own laches.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Par la charte-partie, les aifr\u00e9teurs, Lord et autres s' \u00e9taient engages a fournir a l\u2019intim \u00e9, un chargement de grains pour le steamer Wickham, en livrant le fret aussi promptement qu'il pouvait etre recu dans le beau temps (ship to be loaded as fast as cargo can be received in fine weather). Le steamer fut pr\u00e8t parait-il a recevoir son chargement le 15 november 1880,a 11 heures a. m, mais ii n'est pas prouv\u00e8 que le certificat du maire du havre ait livre a temps pour mettre les chargeurs en demeure de proc\u00e9der ce jour-la m\u00e9me an chargement. II n'est pas contest\u00e9 toutefois qu'ils auraient du commencer le lendemain matin le 16. Cependant ils ne furent prets a commencer qu'a deux heures de l'apr\u0141s-midi. Apres avoir pris une certaine partie de la charge consistant en seigle (rye), dans les compartiments de l'avant, rien n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au centre ni a l'arriere, le steamer se trouvait tellement incline que son avant plongeait de trois ou quatre pieds de plus que le reste. Le commandant crut cju'il n'etait pas prudent pour la s\u00e6ret\u00e9 du navire de laisser mettee plus de fret dans cette partie du vaisseau, avant qu'il n'en eut \u00e9t\u00e9 mis assez dans les autres compartiments pour remettre le vaisseau sur la ligne droite et fit alors defenee d'en mettre davantage dans le compartiment de l'avant. Les affreteuss avaient encoee du seigee (rye) pour continuer le chargement, mais comme ils avaient destine les autres compartimenss a recevoir du ble-diinde et qu'ils n'en avaient pas alors a fournir, ils suspendirent le chargement.\nCes retards dans le chargement, dus a ce que le grain des appelants \u00e9taient dans des barges retenuss par les fflaces dans le canal Lachine, firent perdre au moins une journee et demie a deux jours de temps, c'est-a-dire plus quil nen aurait fallu pour completer le chargement. Ii est prouv\u00e9 que le chargement aurait pu \u00e8tre mis abord le mereredi soir si les glaces n'avaient pas retard\u00e9 l'arrivee des bargres contenant le ffrain des appelants. L'arrimeur John Britt dit qu'il en a charg\u00e9 un de m\u00e8me capacit\u00e8 en 27 ou 28 heures.\nPar suite de ces retards et la saison \u00e8tant tr\u0141s avanc\u00e8e,le commandant du steamer craignatt de se voir retenupar les glaces et oblige d'hiverner en Canada donna] avis aux appelants qu'il laisserait le port dimanche matin, 21 novembre sans attendee plus longtemps pour un chargement complet. Dans ces circonstances le propri\u00e9taire Davidson r\u00e9clame les dominages qui furent stipules par la charte-partie comme suit\nPenalty for non performance of this agreement, estimated, amount of freight.\nLa somme de \u00a3313 repr\u00e8sentant d'apr\u00e8s la charte-partie la difference entre la quantite de chargement recu et le chargement complet lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e8e par la Cour Superieu\u00e8e dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm. Bien que ce ne soit pas par refus ou negligence de leur part que les appelanss n'ont point livre un chargement complet, cependant comme ils ne se sont pas mis en garde contre les accidents et les retards qui pouvaient emp\u00e8cher leur grain d'arriver a temps ils doivent subir la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 a laquelle ils se sont soumis sans condition.\nLes intimes out r\u00e9clame \u00a3100 pour surestarie (demurrage), mais cette somme leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 justement refus\u00e9e. Comme ii n'y avait pas de d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour op\u00e9rer le chargement, ce n'est pas a. titre de surestarie (demurrage) mais a titre de dommage qu'ils auraient Pu r\u00e9clamer une indemnit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9lai dans le chargement mais liindemnite pour dommage ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9glee par Ia convention ii n'y a pas lieu d'en accorder d'autre que celle qui a \u00e8t\u00e8 convenue.\nPar la derniere clause de la charte-partie, ii eat convenu que si durant le chargement, la glace mettait en danger la s\u00e6ret\u00e9 du b\u00e1timent, le commandant aurait la facult\u00e9 de partir avec ce qu'il aurait de chargement, et qu'il lui serai t loisible de le compl\u00e8ter dane son voyage de retour pour le benefice du vaisseau.

Appel renvoy\u00e8 avec d\u00e8pens.\nHENRY J. The respondent, who resides in England, was on the 20th of October, 1880, the owner of a steam-ship called the \"Whickham,\" then on her way with a cargo from Barrow, in England, to Montreal. On that day a charter party of affreightment was entered into between the parties to this action, as follows :\u2014\nCHARTETR PARTY.\nMontreal, 25th. October, 1880.\nIt is this day mutually agreed between T. H. Davison, owner of the good steamship or vessel, called the \"Whickham,\" of the measurement of about quarters capacity, 1,124 tons net register, or thereabouts whereof is master; now on way to this port with cargo from Barrow, and Messrs.

Ten running days, sundays excepted, are to be allowed the same merchant (if the ship be not sooner dispatched) for discharging; commencing from the time of ship being ready to deliver cargo.\nShip to be loaded as fast as can be received in fine weather and ten days on demurrage, over and above the said lying days at forty pounds per day; lighter age if any to be at merchants risk and expense.\nIf the vessel is ordered direct or from a port of call to any port on the continent where she may be prevented from entering owing to insufficiency of water, lay days are to commence from date of arrival in the roads, custom or alleged custom to the contrary notwithstanding. If ordered to London, cargo to be discharged immediately after the arrival of steamer, or the captain has the power to discharge it into craft and i\"or \" land it at expense and risk of the consignees, but no discharge to the place after dark.\nThe ship to be allowed to call at intermediate ports for coaling or other purposes; to sail with or without pilots; to tow and be towed, or otherwise assist vessels, without prejudice to this charter.\nThe cargo to be brought to and taken from alongside the ship, at ports of loading and discharge, at merchant's risk and expense.\nThe captain to sign bills of lading at any rate of frieght without prejudice to this charter, provided all difference of freight to the shin's credit be first paid him in cash.\nThe ship to have absolute lien on the cargo for all freight dead freight and demurrage; due under this charter party, but charterer's responsibility to cease upon shipment of the cargo, provided the cargo be worth the freight, demurrage, &c, on arrival at the port of discharge. The vessel to be addressed at port of loading to Carbray Routh & Co. free of address commission.\nA commission of five per cent, is due by the ship to Carbray Routh & Co., on the amount of freight, demurrage, &c, ship lost or not lost. Penalty for non-performance of this agreement, estimated amount of freight.\nShould ice set in during loading so as to endanger the ship, master to be at liberty to sail with part cargo, and to .have leave to fill up at any open port on the way homeward for ship's benefit.\nThe \"Whickham\" arrived and discharged her cargo at Montreal and is alleged to have been ready to receive her outward cargo on the 15th of November. It is also alleged that a certificate of the Port Warden that she was so ready signed by him was before noon of that day served on the appellants. Such service is denied and there is no evidence to sustain the allegation of service beyond a statement of Mr. Routh, the ship's agent, that he sent it by a messenger before that hour.\nBy the usage and custom of the port the charterer is bound to commence loading on the day the notice is given if served before noon, otherwise the obligation to commence loading is postponed to the following day.\nThe appellants continued the loading until the morning of the 21st, when the master refused, for the reasons that will hereafter appear, to take any more cargo.\nIt is shown that during the loading the weather was cold and stormy, with occasional falls of snow, which, to some extent, delayed the operation. On the 20th the master of the \"Whickham\" gave notice to the appellants, that on account of the threatening state of the weather and ice beginning to set in. he had decided, for the safety of his vessel to start in the morning of the following day, the 21st November, and he did so start. In doing so I think under the circumstances he was \"justified as the evidence shows that had he remained longer there was risk of the vessel being frozen in port for the winter, or of being lost or damaged if she sailed It is shown that she so sailed with a cargo short of her carrying capacity to the extent of two hundred and fourteen and a-half tons amounting to \u00a3313 sterling for the freight. The respondents claim to recover that amount in the present action, together with \u00a3100 for demurrage under the clause in the charter party.\nShip to be loaded as fast as can be in fine weather, and ten days on demurrage. Over and above the said lying days at forty pounds per day.\nIt is generally the custom to insert in a charter party the number of days allowed for loading, and a provision for the rate of demurrage, if beyond the number of days specified. The charter party in this case was made by using a printed one with the necessary blank and filled in and altered by Mr. Rtouth. It seems to me that the provision for demurrage is wholly inapplicable to the circumstances in this case. No number of days was stated or agreed upon, but the ship was to be loaded \"as fast as can be received in fine weather.\" It is clear that the clause in question which provides for \"ten days on demurrage over and above the said lying days\" cannot be reconciled with the provision that the master might sail with part cargo, if ice set in during the loading so as to endanger the ship.\nTaking the whole of the charter party into consideration (which is the proper mode of construing it when the provisions are doubtful or antagonistic), I am of the opinion that demurrage was not intended to be provide 1 for as part of the contract.\nBy the contract appellants undertook to load the ship as fast as she could receive the cargo in fine weather and if the respondent has shown they did not do so and that the master was justified in sailing with part cargo, as I think he was, under the agreement, the respondent is entitled to damages for the cargo short shipped but not to demurrage. Demurrage is but liquidated damages by law or by agreement of parties. The respondent in this case claims both demurrage and loss of freight but it is clear to me that if he is entitled to recover at all it is but damages for the loss arising by the short shipment of cargo.\nThe respondent charges substantially that the appellants thereto had commenced to load on the fifteenth of November and to continue uninterruptedly from such commencement to furnish cargo as fast as the ship could receive the same and that had they done so the full cargo would have been loaded before the ship sailed, and inasmuch as she had to sail with a part cargo and the appellants having undertaken to provide a full cargo and failed to do so, they are liable to pay him for the freight short of what he was entitled to.\nThe appellants by their pleas, after denying everything contained in the respondents declaration, except as admitted by their pleas, allege that they were not obliged to commence loading, according to the usage of the port, until the sixteenth, on which day they commenced and continued during the working hours of that day that, from 7 o'clock a.m. on the seventeenth they proceeded with the loading of rye until two o'clock in the afternoon, when they were stopped by the master that when so stopped they had grain alongside more than sufficient to occupy the whole of said day; that on the eighteenth snow fell from 2 o'clock, a.m. till 3 o'clock in the afternoon; that they had seven thousand bushels of rye then alongside, which the weather prevented their putting on board during that time; that on the nineteenth they worked in loading all day and all night, and the same on the twentieth, up to the time of the vessel's leaving; that they were obliged by the custom of the port to work in loading but .eleven hours a day and that the constant working during the nights of the nineteenth and twentieth more than made up for any loss of time in the loading that might be imputed, to them, and that when the vessel sailed they had alongside sufficient rye and other grain to fill up the vessel.\nThe appellants further pleaded that under the agreement and the custom of the port the ship was bound to supply persons known as \" baggers \" to bag the grain as it was put on board, but did not supply a sufficient number or a sufficient number of stevedores and thereby impeded the loading to the extent of the balance of the cargo unshipped, which was alongside ready to be shipped.\nThe respondent by his replication after a general denial of the allegations contained in the pleas specially denies that the appellants were only to work at loading eleven hours each day but were bound by the charter party and by the custom of trade and port in such cases to load as fast as possible night and day.\nHe also specially denies that he failed to supply the requisite number of baggers and stevedores, and avers that he and his agents did their best and the utmost in their power to supply them, and specially denies that the appellants had alongside the vessel when she left Montreal sufficient rye and grain to fill her. I will deal first with the issues raised by the special denials in the replication. 1st. As to the obligation of the shippers by the charter party and. the custom of the trade and of the port to furnish cargo night and day, it is necessary to look at the evidence, the charter party being silent as to that point. I can find no evidence to sustain the respondent's contention as to the custom of trade or of the port. On the contrary the evidence shows that a master is not bound to receive cargo during the night, and he can refuse to do so at dark. Masters sometimes do so, but it is quite well understood they are not bound to do so. No custom can bind one party to a contract unless both are bound, and no binding custom can exist which depends on the option of one of two parties. Such being the case the appellants cannot be concluded under this contract, and assumed to have agreed to furnish cargo at night in the absence of a special contract to do so. They, when sought to be made answer able for the consequences of failure to ship a certain quantity within a certain number of hours, may fairly say: \"we were only obliged to ship during eleven hours \"each day, and we have shipped during as many hours \"as we would have done had we commenced the fifteenth and supplied cargo eleven hours every day.\" If my deductions from the evidence are correct the appellants made up all the time in shipping the cargo that they were bound to employ, a part of which too was stormy and not the fine weather mentioned in the contract and therefore are not liable for damages for short cargo.\nThe fact may be suggested that the vessel left with only a part of her cargo and that the contract provided for a full one So it did to some extent but we should not fail to consider the provision for the interests of both parties suggested by the lateness of the season, and the chances there were that the vessel might not be able to remain long enough to take in a full cargo. It is obvious that the respondent would not run the risk of the ship being frozen up in the port, or hazard her safety by agreeing to wait long enough under any D circumstances to take in a full cargo. He protected himself by the provision that he was to run no such risk, and stipulated that in case the vessel's safety required her to leave with a short cargo she should have the right to call and fill up her cargo on ships account at any intermediate ports. Provision was therefore, made not only to exonerate the ship for leaving before being fully loaded, but to earn the balance. if any, of freight by calling at any intermediate ports. The respondent by his master availed himself of the license to leave without a full cargo and he had as a compensation for short freight the right otherwise to make it. Suppose he had secured the balance of freight after leaving Montreal, he could not then have had recourse upon the appellants even had they been guilty of delay in loading. I do not say, however, that he was bound to do so or that his failure to do so would exonerate the appellants if otherwise liable, but it is an ingredient in the case to show that both parties felt when the contract was entered into that owing to the lateness of the season the full loading of the ship might and would be impracticable within its provisions. The one party had therefore to run the risk of having only a part of his cargo shipped and the other that of having only a part of his chartered freight. The case is therefore different from one in which both have absolute rights the one under any circumstances to furnish a full cargo and the other to wait a reasonable or stipulated time to take it on board. I admit liabilities in the one case as well as in the other but they are in some points essentially different as to respondent's denial in respect of his alleged failure to supply a sufficient number of baggers and stevedores. His denial is at first positive, but it is materially weakened by the averment \"that he and his agents and employ\u00e9s did their best and the utmost in their power to supply a \"sufficient number.\" Taking the whole together the reasonable deduction is that the baggers and stevedores were not supplied in sufficient numbers but that those representing the respondent did what they could to get them; and the evidence on the part of the appellants most .clearly establishes the allegation in the plea, and I may add that to that evidence there is no substantial contradiction. The rate of taking in cargo as admitted by the witnesses of the respondent corroborates the statements of the witnesses for the appellants, on that point and the whole evidence on both sides leaves do doubt on my mind that if there had been all the time a sufficient number of baggers and stevedores the whole cargo might have been shipped before the vessel sailed. Griffiths the shipping clerk of the appellants, was examined as a witness on the trial and states that the day and night of the twentieth up to the time of the vessel leaving, 19,500 bushels were shipped, and that had there been a sufficient force of baggers and stevedores they could have loaded in that time at least 40000 bushels. He stated\nThe delay was caused by the scarcity of general labour. It was through the small number of bag sewers, and the scarcity of the general labour on the ship of course the labour generally would be regulated by the number of sewers but the first cause is the scarce number of sewers.\nWhen asked :\nIf there had been baggers enough on board the vessel to meet the grain when could the loading have been finished, working as you did ?\nHe replied :\nBy Saturday afternoon.\nHis testimony on this point is sustained by that of several other witnesses. Pierre Boutet states that for five hours during the night of the 19th, the ship took on board 2,433 bushels, and that had there been baggers enough and the necessary labor on the ship they could have loaded 10000 bushels.\nArthur Hitter, an engineer on board one of the elevators employed in loading, the vessel, proves that 2.000 bushels an hour is about the usual rate to be shipped on board a steamship when there are sufficient baggers and others on board to receive it. He also proves they were delayed by the insufficiency of the baggers. He says that from five to nine o'clock of the morning of the 21st, the ship received but 1,318 bushels, and that \" they could have bagged that in an hour if they men \"enough.\"\nW. Routh, the ship's agent, who was actively engaged about the loading being asked as to the delay alleged to have been caused by the small number of baggers, replied that he was continually present at the loading and could not answer that question, but he subsequently added:\nI know we were constantly after the contractor for the baggers to obtain more men to expedite the ship.\nMr. Routh also states that with a sufficient number of baggers 2,000 bushels an hour may be loaded. When asked:\nWas it possible to get more than a single gang of ten men, four boys and a foreman on Saturday night? Replied we were pushing Redden (meaning the contractor) and he assured us it was an impossibility.\nIt is obvious, taking the testimony of the appellants' witnesses sustained as it is by by the statements of Mr. Routh, that delay was caused in the shipments by the ship not being able, through a sufficient number of baggers and others to receive the cargo as fast as it should have done and that to that delay may be ascribed the failure to fill up If the ship was to receive and stow the cargo as is always its duty, and that to perform that duty so as to receive the cargo with due promptitude a certain class and amount of labor is necessary, and that it is not engaged in sufficient Quantity to prevent unnecessary delay, the owner is answerable for the consequences, and it is no answer for him to make, that he did his best but failed to obtain such labor there. In the evidence of Mr. Routh we have the admission of his contractor Redden that sufficient labor could not be procured; it is proved otherwise that the short loading of the ship was due to that failure, and that position is not substantially contradicted. Here then is a delinquency shown on the part of the ship, which, in my opinion, should estop her owner from making the complaint of delay he has done against the appellants.\nIt must not be forgotten that the respondent contends that the appellants were bound to work night and day in loading; they were bound to load within a reasonable time, working during the accustomed hours, and he was equally bound to receive the cargo at the usual rate If by his default the ship did not receive it at such rate of speed and the ship had to leave wanting a part of her cargo, the blame must fall on the ship. He who requires promptness from others should not fail in it himself and I cannot come to any other conclusion after a most careful consideration of the facts and circumstances in evidence than that the short cargo of the ship was caused by the failure of duty on the part of the ship and that but for such, any delay on the part of the appellants would not have prevented the ship from having a full cargo when she sailed. Under the evidence I have referred to the charge at all events of contributory negligence is proved against the respondent. The loss he claims to recover for was at all events largely caused by his own failure to receive promptly, as he was bound to do, the whole cargo having to that extent contributed to the loss he cannot receive damages therefore from another.\nThe evidence has satisfied me that the whole cargo might have been shipped if taken on board as fast as it was tendered, but if I am wrong in that conclusion I am safe in saying that the evidence does not sustain the respondent's claim as one without such reasonable doubts as should be absent to entitle him to recover.\nI am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered for the appellants with costs\nTASCHEREAU J. This action was instituted by the respondent, as owner of the S. S. \" Whickham,\" for two and a half days' demurrage at \u00a340 per day (\u00a3100. 0. 0.) and for dead freight (\u00a3313. 0. 0.) The judgment of the Superior Court allowed the dead freight but rejected the claim for demurrage. The appellants appealed from this judgment to the Court of Queen's Bench, (appeal side), and a cross appeal for the demurrage was taken by the respondent. The Court of Queen's Bench maintained the judgment of the Superior Court for 3313, and rejected the appeal of the respondent for demurrage. From this judgment the appellants have appealed to this court. There is no cross appeal before this court by the respondent from the judgment dismissing his claim for demurrage. The question involved is one of fact that is'. as to whether the loading of the vessel at Montreal was delayed by the acts of the respondent or of the appellants. Whether, by the charter party the lay day or days on demurrage stipulated for therein apply to the loading or only to the discharging of the vessel is also in issue. The following are the facts of the case: The \"Whickham\" was chartered by the appellants by a charter party entered into between them as merchants and the respondent as owner on the twenty-fifth of October, 1880; by which, it was agreed that the steamship then on her way to Montreal should proceed to Montreal and there be loaded by the appellants with a full and complete cargo of wheat or rye or other goods at rates which are not in contestation. The penalty for non-performance of the agreement by the charterers was fixed at the estimate amount of freight or what is called dead freight. The charter contains this clause:\nTen running days, Sunday excepted, are to be allowed the said merchant (if the ship be not sooner dispatched) for discharging commencing from the time of ship being ready to deliver cargo.\nShip to be loaded as fast as can be received in fine weather and ten days on demurrage over and above the said lying days at \u00a340 per day. Lighter age, if any, to be at merchant's risk and expense.\nOwing to the lateness of the season there was a special clause as to the time of the leaving of the ship which read as follows;\nShould ice set in during the loading so as to endanger the ship, the master to be at liberty to sail with part cargo and to have leave to fill up at any open port on the way homeward for ship's benefit.\nThe vessel arrived at Montreal on the eighth of November 1880. A verbal notice of the arrival was given on the following day to the appellants by the captain and Routh, the agent.\nOn the fifteenth the ship, having discharged her inward cargo, was examined by the Port Warden, according to the custom of the port, and his certificate of her readiness for cargo delivered before noon to the appellants who were then bound, according to the custom of the port, to begin loading at noon on that day. They, however, had. no cargo ready, and the loading only began at one o'clock on the following day; one day being thus lost. The cargo brought alongside on this day was rye alone, and was put into the number two hold of the vessel forward at the request of the appellant's foreman. The loading continued up to five o'clock in the afternoon. of that day and was recommenced at seven o'clock on the following morning, the seventeenth\nThe appellants continued loading rye into this forward hold until two o'clock in the afternoon when they were stopped by the captain, the safety of the ship being endangered by her being loaded down by the head. He accordingly refused to Lake any more cargo into this forward hold and the appellants refused to put the rye, which was the only grain that they had, into any other of the holds of the vessel, as they wished to keep them for wheat alone. The appellants having no other grain ready, the loading of the vessel was stopped until eight o'clock on the morning of the nineteenth, when other grain came alongside and the loading was continued at number two and three holds; and went on night and day until six o'clock on the morning of Sunday, the twenty-first, when the vessel sailed from the port in consequence of the setting in of the ice.\nThe respondent claims that the whole of the eighteenth and half of the seventeenth were thus lost by the failure of the appellants to supply grain; and that the loading of the vessel was thus delayed for one day and a half besides the first day already mentioned. The respondent also claims that the vessel was not loaded at any time as fast as she could receive cargo; and had she been loaded from the time she was ready to take in cargo as fast as she could have received it she would have been loaded with a full and complete cargo before sailing. \"When the vessel left she was two hundred and fourteen and a half tons short of a full cargo. The respondent therefore claims the freight upon these two hundred and fourteen and a half tons of cargo at the same rate as though an equal quantity of wheat had been shipped, namely; at the rate of six shillings and three pence a quarter, amounting in all to the said sum of \u00a3313 sterling.\nThe master of the vessel on account of the threatening state of the weather and ice sailed on the morning of Sunday, the 21st. The evidence shows that he was perfectly justified in so doing, It was in fact the last ship from Montreal to get to sea that fall and $100 extra had to be paid to the sea pilot to get her out from Quebec,\nThe plea to the action admitted the charter party and the fact that the appellants were notified at or about mid-day on the fifteenth of November that the vessel was ready to receive cargo; but denied that they were obliged according to the custom of the port to begin loading until the sixteenth. The plea also admits the dates of the loading as given in the declaration, and the fact that the appellants were prohibited by the captain from proceeding with the loading on the seventeenth, inasmuch as he declared that it would be dangerous to continue. The appellants, however, state that at that time they had a large quantity of grain alongside the vessel more than sufficient to occupy the whole of that day; and that on Thursday, the eighteenth, snow fell from two in the morning till three in the afternoon. That they had seven thousand bushels of rye alongside of the vessel ready to be put on board, but that, owing to the weather, and to the danger which might be occasioned to the ship and the grain by putting the rye on board during the snow storm, it was impossible to continue loading on that day. That thereafter, that is from Friday morning, they continued loading the vessel, working day and night although obliged solely, as they allege, to work during ordinary hours from seven A.M. to six P.M. and they claim that by working all Friday and Saturday night, they thereby gave thirteen hours on each of said days, over and above the number of working hours which they were under the charter party obliged to; and that by reason of such night work they made up any loss of time which might be imputed to them. And they allege that they put on board on the nineteenth sixteen thousand seven hundred and fourteen bushels of rye, twenty thousand nine hundred and seventy-four bushels of corn, and on the twentieth up to the morning of the twenty-first, twenty-one thousand eight hundred and six bushels of rye and that when the vessel left on Sunday morning they had alongside sufficient rye and grain to completely fill her up.\nThe appellants also allege that during the progress of loading the vessel was bound to supply baggers, to bag the grain as it was put on board; and that the master and owners entirely failed to supply the requisite number, and the putting on board of the balance of the cargo was thereby impeded.\nOn these grounds they therefore claim that the delay is not to be imputed to them, and that they are not responsible for the damage suffered.\nNow as to the evidence. The Superior Court found that the appellants received the Port Warden's certificate before twelve o'clock on the fifteenth and that they, by their negligence, lost ten working hours in not commencing to load the said vessel before one o'clock on the sixteenth. That finding is fully supported by the evidence.\nWith reference to the question as to upon whom the responsibility should fall for the loss of time from two o'clock On the seventeenth, when the loading was stopped by the captain' s orders, up to eight a.m. on the nineteenth the evidence shows that the responsibility for the delay should fall on the respondent. It is proved by Britt and Routh, that if the loading had begun at noon on Monday, with a the full quantity of all kinds of grain, the ship would have been completely loaded by Wednesday night, or Thursday morning\", without night work and that even if the loading had been continued with all kinds of grain from the time it began on Tuesday, she would have had a full cargo by Friday morning\nThe pretention of the appellants that the loading on the eighteenth was stopped on account of snow is not supported by the evidence. On their pretention as to their having made up the time which was lost by night work it is clear that this extra work was rendered necessary by their former default and want of diligence As to their plea that they were delayed by the insufficient number of baggers, the evidence entirely fails to support it. They never made any complaint of the kind during the loading. It was only when sued by the respondent that they make known for the first time this grievance. They never thought of it before.\nNow, as to the interpretation to be given to the charter party it seems to me clear, as found by the courts below, that no lay days or days for demurrage were allowed for loading, and the advanced period of the season explains why. The ten days are for the discharging only. The appellants themselves understood it to be so when, in the course of the loading of the \"Whickham \" they told the master that they would never thereafter charter a ship for loading without lay days being specified in the charter. There can be no question as to the amount of damages. Art. 1076, C.C.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only question in this case appears to me to be whether the defendants were guilty of neglect in not furnishing the vessel with a full cargo and whether any and, if any, what portion of the quantity by which, the cargo was short should be attributed to plaintiff.\nThe true construction of the contract contained in the charter party I think is that the defendants were bound to furnish the ship with a full and complete cargo. which was to be loaded as fast as it could be received in fine weather, but should ice set in so as to endanger the ship the master should be at liberty to sail with part cargo without the ship incurring any responsibility to the defendants, and for any deficiency in the cargo fairly attributable to the master under such circumstances sailing with a short cargo the defendants should not be responsible. The evidence sufficiently establishes that the master was perfectly justified in sailing when he did and the sole question is: Have the defendants been guilty of such default as subjects them to liability for freight upon the whole of the quantity by which the cargo was short, or is the deficiency fairly to be attributed, and if so, in what proportions to the plaintiff and the defendants ?\nI do not think it has been established that the Port \"Warden's certificate of the readiness of the shit) to receive her cargo was served upon the defendants before noon of the fifteenth November. David Shaw a ship agent, called by the plaintiff, said that in his opinion the proper way to serve it was for the captain to send a notice accompanying it to the charterers and that it must be served before noon to make the rest of the day count, and the only evidence of its delivery that we have is the evidence of Mr. Routh who says that it was delivered at the defendant's office at or before noon on the fifteenth November that it was sent under an envelope addressed to Lord & Munn by messenger to their office, but the messenger was not called nor any other evidence of the time of its delivery given than the above which leaves it in doubt\" whether or not the certificate was delivered before noon; The defendants' plea admits only that it was delivered at or about, (which might be after) noon, and contends that such a delivery did not put the defendants in default for not beginning, to load on the same day, and I cannot say that I think this default has been sufficiently established. That the defendants were in default on the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth November there can, I think, be no doubt hut the defendants contend that the fact of the vessel not having been laden to the full capacity before she left the port of Montreal is attributable to the default of the plaintiff, whose duty it was to provide baggers, in not providing a sufficient number of competent persons; that there was a difficulty in getting baggers at that season, and that the plaintiff failed in getting as many as were required, and that the captain tried to get and that those whom he did get were chiefly, if not wholly, boys, the evidence I think does establish, and the difficulty appears to me to consist in determining whether the whole of the deficiency in the freight is to be attributed to the default of the defendants, or whether some, and if any, what portion of it is to be attributed to the default of the plaintiff. The default of the plaintiff is charged as having occurred upon Saturday, the twentieth, and there is evidence that but for the default of the defendants on the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth, the vessel might have been completely laden on the eighteenth, and the plaintiff contends that notwithstanding any default of the captain in not supplying a sufficient number of competent baggers the vessel might at any rate have been completely laden before she left on the Sunday morning until which day she was detained by the default of the defendant on the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth November so for the convenience of the defendants. If this be so then the defendants are I think, liable to the full amount of the deficiency, for their contract was to furnish the vessel with a full and complete cargo as fast as it could be received on board in fine weather, of which contract their neglect to furnish a sufficient quantity of grain on the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth November, constituted a clear breach and they cannot be relieved from their responsibility for the natural consequence of this breach by reason of default in the captain to supply a sufficient number of badgers on the twentieth.\nThe learned judges in both of the courts below who have pronounced their judgment in favor of the plaintiff were of opinion that, as matter of fact, the vessel might have been completely loaded long before the morning of the twenty-first November, when she left port but for the default of the defendants on the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth November, and I cannot undertake to say that this is an erroneous conclusion. I must concur, therefore, in dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Kerr, Carter & Goldstein,\nSolicitors for respondents: Abbott, Tait & Abbott.\n[1] See also M.L.R. 1 Q.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry, agreed and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE) DISTRICT OF MONTREAL.\nSubstitution, Curator to\u2014Rights of action\u2014 Intervention by a, plaintiff in another capacity, when irregular\u2014Art 154 C.C.P. Cross-Appeal.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that a curator to a substitution has no right of action to recover from a curator in whese stead he has been appointed any moneys due by the latter and belonging to institutes.\nAlso, on cross-appeal, reversing the judgment of the court below, that inasmuch as no final judgment could have been obtained in the suit brought by the appellant, as curator, against the respondent which could impair the legal rights of the institutes the said curator's intervention in said suit brought in his capacity of assignee of the institutes should have been dismissed. Art 154 C.C.P.\nAppeal and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side)([1])\nOne Moreau, as curator to the substitution created by the will of the late Jacques Dorion, brought an action \u2022against the respondent, who had ceased to be curator to the substitution created by the said will alleging that the respondent retained in his possession large sums of money belonging to the estate, and prayed for an account, and that, should the respondent fail to render the account, he be condemned personally to pay to the said plaintiff in his said capacity the sum of $120000 and interest.\nThe respondent by his pleas acknowledged his indebtedness to the estate in a certain sum which he declared he was willing to pay to plaintiff if he had authority to receive it.\nOn 4th January, 1865, d\u00e9bats de compte were filed by Moreau and subsequently the present appellant took Moreau's place as curator to the substitution, and took up the instance as curator to the substitution. On the 14th September, 1881, he moved that the respondent should be compelled to constitute new attornies\nOn the 11th september, 1881, the appellant in his quality of curator produced the following declaration :\n\" Le dit Demandeur \u00e8s-quahit\u00e9 par reprise d'instance \" demandant acte de la d\u00e9claration faite par le dit J. B. \" T. Dorion, en sa reddition de compte qu'il eat d\u00e9biteur \" de la succession de la somme de huit mille quatre c cent vingt-sept piastres et soixante-treize centins d declare qu'il accepte la reddition de compte telle que \" produite par le dit d\u00e9fendeur ainsi que les conclusions de sa defense, et en demande acte.\"\nThis was preparatory to an inscription for final hearing on the merits for the 13th December, 1881. On the 12th a motion was presented to ask delay to plead\u2014(a) that defendant was not obliged to account (b) new facts. The court granted defendant leave to plead new facts, and refused leave to replead as to the right of plaintiff to demand an account inasmuch as defendant \" ne peut revenir sur cette admission et reconnaissance de sa part\" i.e., contained in his first plea. The present respondent then asked for leave to appeal from this judgment because of the limitation as to the re-pleader but leave was refused.\nThe defendant then filed a plea containing a variety of allegations. To this, a special answer was made and the case was inscribed for hearing and was heard.\nWhen the record was en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, the appellant filed an intervention as the representative of all the gr\u00e9v\u00e9s, setting up a right to the balance of the money in the hands of the respondent as representative by cession and otherwise of all the gr\u00e9v\u00e9s.\nThe respondent pleaded to this intervention and prayed for its dismissal\nJudgment was rendered on this intervention by the Superior Court inter alia condemning the respondent to pay the appellant a sum of $14,282.72. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) brought by the present respondent, that court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and condemned the respondent to pay to the appellant, as representing C. Dorion, E. Dorion, F. Dorion and J. B. T. Dorion, the gr\u00e9v\u00e9s, the said sum of $525.37 with interest thereon from the 27th June, 1882, and to pay costs to appellant upon the intervention and the contestation thereon. The said court condemning the appellant to pay the costs of the appeal.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench ordered also the record to be sent down to the Superior Court to invest in the name of the said substitution the sum that the respondent acknowledged he had in his possession, and as it may be ordered by the court of the first instance; reserving to the appellant whatever rights he may have to claim the money paid for the respondent; reserving likewise to respondent the right to claim the sum that he is condemned to pay to the appellant by this judgment in the event the respondent gets the deed of transfer of the 25th April 1882, annulled; reserving also to the appel\u00e9s of the said substitution whatever right they may have to contest the account rendered by the said respondent or to ask another account; reserving also to the superior court to decide about the costs other then the costs of intervention and contestation thereof\nMadore for appellant and respondent on cross-appeal.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court should be confirmed in full and the amount increased according to the conclusions of the intervention. [TASCHEREAU J.-You did not appeal from the judgment of the superior court and how can you ask this court to allow you more than the amount granted by the superior court ?] I submit the whole case is open on the appeal to this court.\nThe first question on this appeal is whether the appellant, as curator, had a right in law to have the defendant who was a debtor of the substitution, condemned to pay the capital sum he had in his possession, belonging to the substitution, without any security, particularly when the appellant represents as cessionaries all the greves of the substitution, The article 945 C. C. and the amendment of the same by 38 Victoria chap. 13 which amendment makes no change as far as the power of the curator is concerned, say that the curator \" attends to the substitute's interest, i in all inventories and partitions and other circumstances in which his intervention is requisite or \" proper.\"\nThe article 947, C. C. says:\nThe institute performs all the acts that are necessary for the preservation of the property.\nHe makes all payments, he receives moneys due and reimbursements, invests \" capital sums and exercise before the court all powers necessary for these purposes.\nThe court below having confirmed the right of the appellant as cessionnaire of all the grev\u00e9s de substitution, as well as the Superior Court on that point it follows that under that above articles 947 and 945 C. C. the appellant, as intervenant, had full power to receive the capital the respondent had in his possession.\nBut, moreover, in the present case, the appellant as curator to the said substitution, had also the legal capacity under the said article 945 C. C. to sue the respondent on behalf of the substitutes, for the money the respondent had in his possession unsecured, as being the legal representative of the substitutes.\nSee Thevenot d'Essaule on Substitution ([2]); Pothier Substitution ([3]) * Guyot Vo. Substitution ([4]); Dorioti v. Jones ([5]).\nOn the question of prescription the learned counsel relied on Philipp v. Joseph ([6]), McKenzie v. Taylor ([7]). Arts. 1043 1714, 295, 296, 0. C.\nThe learned counsel also contended that the appellant was entitled to the interest the respondent had offered. to pay on $8,427.63, from the 14th of August, 1858, which he has not paid or was not prescribed by law.\nPagnuelo Q.C. for respondent and appellant on cross appeal.\nThe curator to a substitution has no right of action to claim the capital or the interest belonging to the substitutes. His duty is to watch the acts of the \u2022institutes, Arts. 945, 946, 959 C. C. The. respondent in this case can only be asked to render an account as a negotiorum gestor, and this he has been willing to do. He could not be sued in the capacity of curator, for as such he had no right to administer the estate. Had the intervention not been allowed there can be no doubt the appellant's action would have been dismissed. I contend that the intervention should not have been admitted,' but that judgment should have been given on the merits. Arts 413 435 200, 1119, C. C. P.; Dalloz, Rep. ([8]); Carter v. Molson ([9]). 0n' the question of interest the learned counsel referred to art. 295 1714 C.C. Denizart ([10]); Troplong ([11]); Aubry & Rau ([12]); Pothier ([13]); Dalloz ([14]); Sirey ([15]).\nMadore, in reply, contended that. the pleadings \u2022 admitted the right of the appellant to iutervene. Art. 1245 C. C.\nSir W. J. RItchie C. J. and Henry and Gwynne JJ. concurred in the conclusion arrived at by Fournier and Taschereau JJ.\nFournier J.\u2014Dans ses notes sur cette cause qu'il a eu l'obligeance de me communiquer, l'honorable Juge Taschereau ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait un expose complet non seulement des faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent litige, mais aussi des questions do droit a r\u00e9soudre, je crois devoir me borner \u00e0 quelques observations pour exprimer mon concours dans ses conclusions\nDeux questions principales s' \u00e9l\u00e9vett en cette cause: la premi\u00e8re est de savoir si un curateur a la substitution a droit do porter une action pour se faire rendre compte par le possesseur des biens substitutes; Ia deuxi\u00e8me, Si une telle action ne lui appartient pas, \u00e9tait-il en son pouvoir, par une intervention fond\u00e9e sur des cessions des droits des grev\u00e9s obtenues pendant Pinstance de l'action en reddition de compte d'am\u00e9liorer sa position en changeant la cause d'action pour emp\u00eacher le renvoi de sa demande.\nLes conclusions de l'action sont \u00e0 l'effet d'obtenir un compte de la gestion et administration que l'intim\u00e9 a ene en sa qualit\u00e9 de curateur \u00e0 la substitution creee par le testament de feu Jacques Dorion et des biens d'icelui, avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les int\u00e9r\u00eats des \u00e9pargnes, a compter du jour du paiement des diff\u00e9rent s sommes d'argent re\u00e7ues par le dit intim\u00e9, en sa dite qualit\u00e9, en outre a produire avec le dit compte et \u00e0 son soutien toutes les pieces justificatives d'icelui, comme aussi et \u00e0 mettre le dit demandeur (present appelant) en sa dite qualit\u00e9, (curateur \u00e0 la m\u00eame substitution) en possession de tons les titres, papiers, pieces et renseignements qui regardent Ia dite succession, etc., etc, etc. que le dit demandeur a en sa dite qualit\u00e9, droit d'avoir du d\u00e9fendeur, sinon et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par le dit d\u00e9fendeur (intim\u00e9) de satisfaire imm\u00e9diatement a tout ce que dessus, pour se voir condamne personnellement \u00e0 payer au dit demandeur, en sa dite qualit\u00e9, une somme de douze mille livres du cours actuel, pour tenir lieu du dit compte, do Ia remise des titres, pi\u00e8ces et renseignements, etc\nL'appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame curateur \u00e0 cette substitution en remplacement do l'intim\u00e9, et c'est en cette qualit\u00e9 qu'il a repris l'instance introduite par M. Pierre Moreau qui avait aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 curateur \u00e0 la m\u00eame substitution en 1859.\nComme curateur \u00e0 une substitution l'intim\u00e9 avait-il le droit de porter une action de la nature de celle dont les conclusions sont rapport\u00e9es ci-haut ? Il est certain que non. Tine telle action n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e au curateur \u00e0 une substitution, ni dans l'ancien droit, ni sous le Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nL'art. 945 C. C. qui n'a rien chang\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ancien droit sous ce rapport ne donne an curateur \u00e0 la substitution que des fonctions tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9es. Elles se bornent \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter les appel\u00e9s non n\u00e9s lors de la mort du substituant \u00e0 veiller \u00e0. leur int\u00e9r\u00eat en tons inventaires et partages et dans les autres cas o\u00f9 son intervention est requise on peut avoir lieu. L'amendement fait plus tard \u00e0 cet article par le 38me Vie ch. 13, n'affecte aucunement la question en cette cause.\nLes appel\u00e9s n\u00e9s et incapables sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme dans les cas ordinaires. Ce curateur n'ayant aucun droit ni \u00e0 la possession ni \u00e0 l'administration des biens de la substitution ne peut en consequence avoir droit d'action pour s'en faire rendre compte on s'en faire mettre en possession.\nIl en \u00e9tait de m\u00eame sous l'ancien droit. \"L'ordonnance, dit Merlin ([16]), n'exige la nomination d'un tuteur \"ou curateur \u00e0 la substitution que dans deux cas savoir: \" Pour assister \u00e0 l'inventaire des biens du substituant \"quand le premier substitu\u00e9 n'est pas n\u00e9; et pour assister dans le m\u00eame cas, \u00e0 l'emploi des deniers. Voil\u00e0 donne, \"conclut Thevenot. toute la charge du tuteur suivant l'ordonnance.\"\nLors de la nomination de l'appelant comme curateur tous les grev\u00e9s de substitution \u00e9taient n\u00e9s et capables de se repr\u00e9senter eux-m\u00eames, de sorte que l'appelant n'avait aucun droit do s'immiscer dans les affaires de la substitution. Son action n'ayant d'autre but quo de s'en faire rendre compte, elle doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e. 11 est vrai que 1 intime a reconnu, par une reddition de compte qu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 l'action, devoir la somme de \u00a32,106.18.2, mais ce n'est pas envers l'appelant qu'il s'est reconnu d\u00e9biteur, c'est envers ceux qui sont avec lui les grev\u00e9s do substitution. Cette reconnaissance ne peut donc lui servir pour obtenir ses conclusions, car la cour no peut rien statuer sur les conclusions d'une action quo la loi ne reconnait pas.\nL'intervention est-elle mieux fond\u00e9e que l'action principale ? 11 est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s los faits de la cause quo ce n'est que dans l'espoir de soutenir l'action dans laquelle ii devait n\u00e9cessairement succomber, que i\u2019 intim\u00e9 a eu recours \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9dient do cette intervention qui, d'ailleurs, a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite tr\u00e8s irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. 11 n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'insister sur les irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s quoiqu'elles soient certainement suffisantes pour faire d\u00e9clarer l'intervention inadmissible, mais ii y a encore une raison plus forte pour la faire rejeter. C'est quo l'on ne peut pas avoir droit d'intervenir dans une action dont Ia loi ne reconna\u00eet pas l'existence. Aucune partie no peut avoir d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 intervenir dans un semblable cas. Pour exercer ce droit ii faut suivant l'art 154 C. P. C., avoir dos int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 faire valoir L'intervenant telle quo l'a fait clairement voir i'hon.

Molson ([17]) cit\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, dans laiquelle le Conseil Priv\u00e9 de Sa Maiest\u00e9 s'est exprim\u00e9 comme suit:\nThe event of the suit can only refer to the operative decree which may ultimately be given in favour of one or other of the parties to it, and not to the views of fact or law which may influence the court in giving decree. Section 154 appears to have been framed for the very purpose of limiting the right of intervention to the persons who can show that a final judgment may possibly be obtained n the suit which will enable the party who obtains it to possess himself of the estate, or otherwise to impair their legal rights.\nCette autorit\u00e9 qui est d'une \u00e9videnee application aux faits de la cause doit suffire pour faire decider que l'in-tervention doit subir le m\u00eame sort que l'action principale.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In March, 1821, Jacques Dorion by his will, bequeathed his estate to his brother Charles with substitution in favor of the said Charles' children and the children of his children, so long as there would be any of the name\nJacques Dorion died, Charles then came into possession of the estate. He sometime after also died J. B. J. Dorion, the present respondent, appears then to have been named curator to the substitution created by the will of Jacques Dorion, and to have been in that quality, as alleged by the appellant in his declaration, in possession of the said estate from the 20th of August 1840 to the 14th of August, 1858. It is evident that, as curator, the respondent had no right whatever to the possession of this estate However, he was allowed to take and hold it.\nIn August, 1858, one Pierre Moreau was appointed to replace the said respondent as curator to the said substitution and, as such, in June, 1839, brought the present action against the respondent. The present appellant having subsequently replaced the said Moreau as curator, the action now stands in his name.\nThe declaration. alleging that the said respondent had in his hands large sums of money belonging to the said estate claims an account of his administration of the said estate from August, 1840, to August, 1858, and concludes as follows :\u2014\n\" That the defendant (now respondent) be condemned to render an exact and faithful account under \" oath of his gestion and administration in his capacity \" of curator to the said substitution and of all the property thereof with the interests and the interest of the \"savings from the day the said sums of money were \" paid to the said defendant in his said quality, and \" moreover to produce with the said account all v vouchers in support thereof, and that, should the said d defendant fail to do so, he be condemned personally \"to pay to the said plaintiff in his said capacity the \" sum of twelve thousand pounds.\"\nThe respondent, in answer to this action, appears to have rendered an account in which he acknowledged his indebtedness to the said estate in certain amounts which he declared himself ready and willing to pay to the said plaintiff provided the said plaintiff had authority to receive them.\nThe appellant's first contention is that by such a plea, the respondent has acknowledged his indebtedness to him and is now debarred from questioning his right. This objection cannot be sustained. The respondent acknowledged his indebtedness to the estate, not to the plaintiff, and has declared himself ready to pay the plaintiff if the plaintiff can establish his right to these moneys, and in that case only.\nSo that the first question submitted for our determination is as to the authority of the plaintiff, in his said quality of curator to this substitution, to receive and the right to claim the payment into his hands of what the respondent may owe to this estate.\nThe solution of this question presents no difficulty. The plaintiff, as curator, has no such right. At the death of Charles Dorion the whole of this estate reverted to his sons as institutes under Jacques Dorion's will, the revenues thereof to be used or abused of at their will and pleasure, the capital sums to be held by them subject to transmission to their children. The curator as such, has no right whatever either to one or the other. This action is consequently unfounded in law, and must be dismissed.\nNow as to the intervention. This intervention was filed under the following circumstances. The case had been argued on the merits, and was standing for judgment. The appellant then, evidently to prevent a judgment being given and, it may fairly be assumed. not expecting a favorable one, went to another judge of the same court and obtained leave to file an intervention in his own personal name as assignee of the institutes, Charles Dorion's children, in virtue of certain deeds of assignment or transfer by which the said institutes had assigned to him all the rights accruing to them under the will of Jacques Dorion. The intervention\u2019s conclusions are :\u2014\n\"Therefore the said intervening party prays that he \" may be allowed to intervene in this case, to agree as \" the only representative of the grev\u00e9s de substitution a and to unite with the plaintiff, is qualit\u00e9, inasmuch, \"as it might be useful, to accept defendant's account a and his confession of judgment, and give to the said \" plaintiff, \u00e9s qualit\u00e9, all authorization and the approbation wanted from the grev\u00e9s de substitution; that the \" said petitioner may be received as intervening party, \" and the said defendant condemned to pay to the said \" Achille Adelard Dorion, as well in his capacity of c curator and administrator of the said estate as the \" only representative of all the grev\u00e9s de substitution, \" the amount he has confessed to owe in his account and plea, with interest as alleged, amounting this day \" to $26,403088, the whole according to the conclusions \"of the declaration and costs.\"\nA more irregular proceeding I have never heard of. Here is a party who, it is evident, to prevent his adversary from getting a judgment to which he has an acquired right from the judge before whom the case has been argued, goes to another judge and obtains leave to file an intervention in which he virtually says, \" Well, \" my original action is unfounded in law and must be \" dismissed, but I personally have rights against the \" defendant under other titles, as assignee of certain \" third parties, and I claim the right to intervene in \" this case not only to prevent the defendant from obtaining the dismissal of my action, unfounded though i it be, but also to get for myself personally, as such a assignee, a judgment against the defendant.\"\nHad the appellant the right to so intervene in this case ? I pass over to the question of procedure raised before us, as to the period of the case and the way in which this intervention was filed. Though the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Ramsay in the Court of Queen's Bench were of opinion, and I fully agree with them, that the filing of it was totally irregular, yet the court did not feel authorized to dismiss it on that ground\nThe right in law of the appellant so to intervene is however, denied by the respondent, and has to be determined.\nIt appears to me that, under the circumstances of this case, the appellant had no right to this intervention\nThat it was nothing else but a new action against the defendant is undeniable. That it was filed to prevent the dismissal of the principal action and so snatch away from his adversary a judgment he had an acquired right to is plain. For this purpose, and for this purpose alone, does Mr, P, A. A. Dorion, the assignee, come to the rescue of Mr. P. A. A. Dorion the curator Could this be done? Article 154 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacts the rule on the subject : \" Every person,\" says this article \" interested in the event of a pending \" suit is entitled to be admitted a party thereto in order \" to maintain his rights.\"\nThese are clear terms To be allowed to intervene a party must be interested in the event of the suit and it can only be to maintain his rights, not anybody else's rights, that he can be allowed to intervene. Or to put it on the highest possible authority:\nThe event of the suit can only refer to the operative decree which may ultimately be given in favour of one or other of the parties to it, and not to the views of fact or law which may influence the court in giving decree Section 154 appears to have been framed for the very purpose of limiting the right of intervention to persons who can show that a final judgment may possibly be obtained in the suit which will enable the party who obtains it to possess himself of their estate or otherwise to impair their legal rights ([18]).\nNow, here, it appears on the very face of the proceedings that no final judgment could possibly be obtained in this suit which could have enabled the plaintiff to possess himself of this estate or would otherwise impair the legal rights of the institutes or of their assignee. Where, then, is the assignee's interest in the event of the suit and it is his own suit it must not be lost sight of ? The only interest, it is plain, is the curator's, the principal plaintiff's interest, not the assignee's, the intervening interest. The very allegation of the intervention shows that the principal action must be dismissed, and that it is to prevent such judgment that the intervention is filed. That is to say the institute, or in their name Dorion, their assignee, intervene, not to protect their rights, which the dismissal of the action would leave intact and unimpaired, but to protect Dorion's, the curator's rights.\n[Page 207].\nThe intervening party has, then, no interest in the event of the action, his rights are not endangered, he did not intervene in order to maintain his rights This intervention should then be dismissed.\nThe judgment appealed from maintained the intervention, and though apparently admitting that the action was unfounded, failed to dismiss it. I think there is error in this, and that the cross appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal to be dismissed with costs Cross appeal allowed with costs. Action. and intervention dismissed with costs in the two courts below against the appellant, P. A. A, Dorion, personally. Distraits to Messrs.

C. (P. Q.)\nOn the 25th September, 1875, a steam barge, loaded with sand, sank while at anchor near Chateauguay, in the river St. Lawrence. The barge was raised and floated within a week after the disaster. It was shown that on the starboard side there was an auger hole in the bilge of the barge which had been plugged up with a little wooden plug, and that the plug had come out. The vessel was raised by the insurers under the salvage clause of the policy.\nOn the first October there was a formal protest, made at the request of the master and officers of the barge setting forth all the details of the wreck.\nOn the 6th December, 1875, the insurers were notified that the vessel was abandoned, the notice of abandonment concluding with the words; \" It is hardly necessary for me, after your taking \" possession of the vessel, to make any further declaration of a abandonment, but I now do so in order to put that fact \u201cformally of record, and now again give you notice thereof.\"\nThe vessel was eventually sold by consent of all parties interested for $150.\nIn an action on the policy for a total loss,\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that there was not sufficient evidence to enable plaintiffs to recover as for a total or constructive total loss of the vessel.\nPer Fournier J.\u2014That the notice of abandonment was not given in conformity with the Art 2544 of the Civil Code, and not made within a reasonable time. Art. 2541 C C.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench Montreal confirming a judgment of the Superior Court by which the appellants were condemned to pay as for total loss of the steam barge \" Westport\" insured under policy No. 8,019 for the sum Of $3,300, viz. $2,000 to the respondent O'Connor as the party to whom so much was made payable by the policy and the balance to respondent Scanlan proprietor of the vessel, with interest from 13th June, 1876, and costs.\nThe following special case was stated for the opinion and decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\" The action is founded upon a policy of insurance issued by the appellants, dated the 1st May, 1875, whereby it is declared that the appellants, in consideration of a premium of one hundred and forty-eight dollars and fifty cents, insured respondent Scanlan's steam barge \" Westport,\" in the sum of three thousand three hundred dollars, from noon of the said date, the 1st May, 1875, to noon on the 20th. November 1875.\n\" The policy stipulates that the company insures, on account of Michael Scanlan, loss, if any, payable to. Edward O'Connor to the extent of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) the said steam barge for the said period unless sooner terminated.\n\" That the said barge should be employed exclusively in the freighting and passenger business, and to navigate only between Montreal and Chateauguay and Papineauville on the Ottawa River\n\" That the perils insured against are those of the lakes rivers, canals, fires, jettisons, that shall come to the damage of the said vessel or any part thereof, subject to the exceptions mentioned in said policy.\n\" On or about the 28th of September 1875 the said steam barge sank in the River St Lawrence at Chateauguay, and a claim was made on the insurers by the respondent Scanlan, for the amount of said policy.\n\" The appellants resisted payment, claiming that they were not liable in the circumstances upon which the respondent Scanlan entered action praying that the appellants be condemned to pay to him the said sum of three thousand three hundred dollars ($3,300.00) with interest\n\" The appellants, besides a general answer, pleaddd by different pleas, inter alia, breach of warranty, want of competent master, engineer and crew; that the vessel sank from inherent defects, and by acts of owner or crew, or both.\n\" The appellants submit:\n1st. That there was no legal evidence of record to support a condemnation as for total loss and none as to the extent of the injury done to the vessel, and that no judgment whatsoever ought to have been given against Appellants.\n2nd. That it is established that the vessel in any case sank from inherent defects or the acts or conduct of owner or crew, or both, for which appellants are not responsible.\n3rd. That respondent's evidence is contradictory and unreliable and insufficient to support the judgment appealed from.\n\"The respondents, by their answers to appellants' pleas, resist these pretentions.\n\" The respondent O'Connor, intervened in the case, alleging that by the terms of the policy the loss, if any, was payable to him to the extent of two thousand doll lars ($2,000.00).\n\"The intervention was admitted by the respondent Scanlan, but resisted by the appellants on the same grounds as the principal demand and by consent of the parties the evidence and documents of record were made common to both issues.\n\" The Superior Court on the 9th March, 1883, rendered judgment in favor of the respondents for the full amount claimed by them respectively with interest and costs.\n\" From this judgment an appeal was taken to the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) by the judgment of which rendered on the 29th May, 1885, the judgment of the court below was confirmed.\n\" From this judgment the present appeal is taken.\n\"The question submitted to this court is whether the appellants are, under the pleadings, facts and circumstances, entitled to have the judgment ,of the Superior Court and Queen's Bench reversed.\"\nThe material facts as disclosed by the evidence are as follows: The vessel sank, at a place, where it was 10 or 12 feet deep, when at anchor and in comparatively smooth weather.\nAfter the sinking of the Vessel the appellants raised her under the salvage clause of the policy; the vessel having sand in her at the time she sank this had to be pumped out, but she was raised within a fortnight and put in a place of safety in the Lachine Canal and respondent Scanlan was notified that she was there subject to his order.\nAt the trial it was proved that there was in starboard side an auger hole in the bilge of the barge; this hole had been made where a pipe had gone through the side of the vessel to supply water to the engine and boiler; the pipe had been shifted over from that place to another place a little distance from where that hole was and the hole had been plugged up with a little wooden peg, this plug of course had come out.\nNearly two months after the vessel had been so raised under the salvage clause of the policy and respondent Scanlon had been notified that she was in the canal and subject to his orders, he, on the 6th December, 1875, delivered to appellants' agent the letter of that date.\nMontreal, 6th December, 1875.\nMessrs. SIMPSON & BETHUNE,\nGreneral Agents of the Western Ass. Co.\nSirs,\u2014I have to ask for an immediate settlement of the claims arising out of the loss of my steam barge \" Westport,\" covered by policy No. 3019, in the Western Assurance Company, on the 1st May, 1875, which vessel was totally lost at Chateauguay on the 28th day of September last, and abandoned by me. It is hardly necessary for me, after your taking possession of the vessel, to make any further declaration of abandonment, but I now do so in order to put that fact formally of record and now again give you notice thereof\nYour obdt. servt.,\n(Sgd.) M. Scanlan.\nThe vessel thereafter lay in the canal for several years, and on a consent being given by the parties a year and a half after this action was instituted, that the vessel should he sold and that the sale should not pre judice the rights of either party in the case which .was \" to be proceeded with to final judgment as if this \" consent had never been made,\" she was sold for $150.\nLaflamme QC. and Trenholme for the appellants.\nThe loss was not occasioned by any of the perils insured against and the onus was on the plaintiff to show that the accident was caused by some external violence forcing the plug out of the hole. Moreover, the hole was not there at the time of the insurance, and there was negligence. Arts. 2509 0.0. and Par son's Marine Insurance ([1]); Arnould ([2]); Dupeyre v. Western Marine and Fire Insurance Company ([3]); Philipps on Insurance ([4]). Even if the vessel was lost by the perils insured against respondent was not entitled to recover, because there was no legal abaudonment. Arts. 2588, 2541, 2544. The facts in evidence did not justify an abandonment. Provincial Insurance Company v. Leduc ([5]); The Sun Mutual insurance Company v. Masson ([6]); Anchor Marine insurance Company v. Keith ([7]).\nThe sale of the vessel cannot be invoked against appel lant as it was made upon consent.\nDavidson Q.C. for respondent:\nThis court should not reverse the decision of the court below on questions of fact.\nThe plaintiff (respondent) urges that the thing insured was \" wholly destroyed or lost,\" and so became an absolute total loss. Art. 2,522 0. 0. The same article defines a constructive total loss as occurring when \" the thing, \" though not wholly destroyed or lost, becomes of little '\"or no value to the insured.\" Only in the latter case is abandonment necessary. Arts. 2,522, 2,538 2,541 C. C. Surely there was practically a total effacement of the thing insured when salvage expenses of $1,930 only produced $150. Surely a vessel valued at $5,000 must be deemed \".wholly destroyed \" when, after such a disbursement, only $150 could be realized from her. She was not even of \" little or no value to the insured, \" when, to have accepted the remains of her, would have imposed upon him a contribution by average adjustment very far beyond what he was receiving.\nNo precise form is required for a notice of abandon ment; it is not even necessary that it should be in writing. Dixon's law of shipping ([8]).\nArnould ([9]) lays do wn the same principle.\nHow appellant can pretend that the loss was not total is difficult to understand. The vessel went down in eighteen feet of water. After efforts, extending over a fortnight, and an expenditure, according to the plea of $1,930 the remains of the vessel were brought to the Lachine canal. She was raised to the surface with her cargo still in her. To go down as she did must have wrenched her badly and dragging her to the surface laden with sand to the extent of one-half or two-thirds of her capacity, completed her destruction as a vessel. Appellants subsequently selling the hulk for $150, in itself is a strikingly conclusive proof of the totality of the loss.\nThe learned counsel cited The Quebec Marine Insurance Co. v. The Merchants' Bank of Canada ([10]) ; Lemelin v. The Mowtreal Insurance Company ([11]) Cam bridge v. Anderton ([12]); Philipps on Insurance ([13]); Roux v. Salvador ([14]). With reference to the time when notice of abandon ment should be given, the English law says, within a reasonable time. French law says within six months twelve months. The courts have to say what a reason able lime is.\nWe also contend that the silence of the company after the receipt of the letter of December the 6th amounts to an acceptance of the abandonment. Hudson v. Har rison ([15]).\nOn the question of negligence the learned counsel Tolied on art 2509 C. C. (P Q.) and Cross v British America Ins.. Co. ([16]) Provincial ins. Co v. Leduc ([17]).\nTrenholme in reply stated the evidence had been taken at enquele, and this court was therefore quite as competent to come to a conclusion as the courts below on the questions of fact as to whether it was a loss falling within any of the perils insured against, citing Phillips v. Barber ([18]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I think, in this case, that the parties have failed to show that there was a total, or constructive total loss, and that there was no ground for sustaining the allegation that the-vessel was lost by the perils of the seas. There was a hole in her bottom, but not a hole caused by the winds and the waves. There was nothing whatever to show that when this vessel was raised, and the hole plugged up, she would not be as good a vessel as ever.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The policy sued upon in this action is not the ordinary marine policy, but one of a very special form, applicable to vessels navigating the inland waters of Oanada,\u2014the River St. Lawrence from Quebec westward, and the Great Lakes. It contains amongst others, the following stipulation: \" Futher, \"the insured shall not have a right to abandon the \" vessel in any case unless the amount the insurers \" would be liable to pay under an adjustment as of a \"c partial loss shall exceed half the amount insured.\" This special clause makes the question of the respondents' right to recover as for a constructive total loss a very different one from that which it would have been under the general law as enacted in the Civil Code if the insurance had been effected by the ordinary marine policy without any special stipulation of this kind. It is manifest that there can be no right to recover as for a constructive total loss unless it is proved that the amount of the loss would, if valued as.a partial average loss exceed the sum of $1650 being one half of the whole amount insured It was for the respondents to have poved that the amount of the loss did exceed this sum but this they have wholly failed to do and as the amount of the loss could only have been the expense of raising the vessel and the restoration of the machinery by repairing the damage caused by he submerging, which could not have amounted to any such sum as that mentioned, it plainly appears that the plaintiff could not have made any such proof. At all events it is sufficient to say that he has not by his proofs brought himself within this condition, and so cannot recover for a constructive total loss\nIt is out of the question to say that the company waived this condition by taking possession and repairing; as they had a right to do this according to the express terms of the policy under the salvage cfause.\nAccording to English practice however, a plaintiff suing on a marine policy for a constructive total loss may if it turns out that he is disentitled to recover for the loss suffered as a total loss fall back on his right to recover as for a partial ox average loss, and I assume, in the respondent's favor, that he would be considered to have the same right in the courts of the province of Quebec. Then is the plaintiff entitled to recover here for a partial loss ? Upon the evidence I am clearly of opinion that he is not. The inevitable conclusion from the evidence must be that the sinking of the barge would not have occurred but for the auger hole in the bottom which had been bored apparently for the purposes of an injection pipe to supply the boiler with water. This might and ought to have been secured otherwise than by a wooden plug, liable to be displaced by the action of the water, as it is shewn that many other devices existed by which this hole might have been securely plugged, and which would have been resorted to by any prudent owner. It is impossible to believe that whilst this hole below the water line in the side or bottom existed in the insecure state disclosed by the evidence the barge was seaworthy. Then the loss being most satisfactorily demonstrated to have been consequent upon this unseaworthy condition of the vessel, it was within the exception of the policy which expressly excludes from the insurance, losses consequent upon \" rotten\" ness, inherent defects, overloading and all other un\" seaworthiness.\"\nI have heard no argument or reason suggested which furnishes an answer to this objection to the plaintiffs right to recover in this action, and I can think of none which could be suggested and it must, therefore, in my judgment prevail. There are other defences pleaded which I think are also maintained but these it is not necessary to notice the foregoing reasons being sufficient grounds for reversing the judgment of the courts below This must be done with costs to the respondent here and in the Court of Queen's Bench and the action and the intervention in the Superior Court must both be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.-The vessel sank in six feet of water ; she was raised by the company under the Salvage clause in the policy, was put in the dock, and the contention now is that the company took possession of the vessel as if she had been regularly abandoned. But that was not the fact; it was only notifying the party that the vessel was raised. Both parties agreed in having her sold.\nThis is certainly not, under the circumstances, a constructive total loss. It was set up that there was an abandonment, but there was no abandonment which the code requires to be made within a reasonable time. Notice was given to the company but not in conformity with the statute All the circumstances must be stated in the notice of abandonment. I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I entirely concur in the view that there was no total loss here, or anything amounting to it. The vessel sank, with every prospect of being raised again. She sustained literally no damage. She was raised and pumped out by the company, and I think the respondent produced no evidence to sustain the claim for a total loss.\nGWYNNE J. concurred with Sir J. W. RITCHIE C.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nLife insurance\u2014Condition in policy\u2014Not to be valid until countersigned\u2014Instructions to agent\u2014Escrow \u2014 Admissibility of evidence\u2014Entry in books of deceased\u2014Not exclusively against interest\u2014New trial.\nIn an action on a policy of life insurance, which was not countersigned according to the terms of a memorandum on its margin, the defence was that the premium was never paid and the policy was never delivered. On the trial the learned judge admitted in evidence an entry in the books of his father, made by the deceased holder of the policy, showing a payment to the agent of the company of an amount equal to the premium, which the evidence showed was paid by money given to deceased by his father. He also admitted the evidence of the agent, who had since died, taken at a former trial of the cause, to the effect that the premium was not paid, and that he would not countersign the policy until it was paid, and that the policy was only given to the deceased to enable him to examine it, and not as a duly executed policy. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, but stated, in answer to a question submitted by the court, that the agent had been instructed not to deliver the policy until it was countersigned. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirmed the verdict. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, per Ritchie C. J. and Gwynne J., that the policy was only delivered to the agent as an escrow, and as it was never duly executed and delivered the company was not liable.\nPer Strong J.\u2014That the memorandum as to countersigning was not a condition of the policy, and the plaintiff was not barred by non-compliance with its terms; but the evidence of the entry in the books of the deceased was improperly admitted, and there should be a new trial.\nPer Fournier and Henry JJ.\u2014That the policy was properly executed and delivered, and as there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict independent of the evidence alleged to have been improperly admitted at the trial, the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Henry J.\u2014Under the present practice the court is bound to uphold a verdict if there is sufficient legal evidence to sustain it independently of evidence improperly received, and cannot take into consideration the effect on the jury of such illegal evidence. Strong J. contra.\nThe court being thus divided in opinion a new trial was granted. Opinions expressed in The Confederation Life Association v. O'Donnell[1] adhered to. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a new trial.\nThis was an action on a policy of life insurance which contained a memorandum on its margin to the effect that it was not to be valid until countersigned by the agent, but which was not, in fact, so countersigned. The policy was in the possession of the deceased at the time of his death and was found among his papers. The company refused to pay the amount on the ground that the premium had never been paid, and that the policy was never duly delivered.\nAt the trial the company tendered in evidence the deposition of the agent who had effected the insurance, taken at a former trial of the cause, the agent having since died, which was received by the court subject to objection. This evidence was to the effect that the premium had not been paid, and that he, the agent refused to countersign the policy without it; that the policy was only delivered to the deceased to enable him to examine it and was to have been returned but was not. To rebut this, the plaintiff offered in evidence, and the court received, an entry in the books of the deceased as follows:\u2014\"November 29th, paid F. Allison $48.06,\" (Allison was the agent). This evidence was objected to as not being against interest. The plaintiff also swore that the agent had admitted the payment of the premium.\nThe jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, but stated, in answer to a question submitted by the court, that the agent had been instructed not to deliver the policy until it was countersigned. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia refused to order a new trial. The company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBeatty Q. C. and C. H. Tupper for the appellants:\nAs the agent had no authority to deliver the policy until it was countersigned the company are not bound by his acts, and the policy has never been delivered as an instrument binding upon us Montreal Ass. Co. v. McGillivray[2]; Xenos v. Wickham[3].\nThe entry in the books of the deceased was clearly inadmissible. There is no case decided in which the written entry of the interested party himself has been so received, it must be an entry by a third person. See Ganton v. Size[4]; Higham v. Ridgway[5]; Bewley v. Atkinson[6]; Massey v. Allen[7].\nWeldon Q.C. and Lyons for the respondent:\nIf the agent chooses to deliver the policy without countersigning it the company are bound. The insured had no notice of the instructions to the agent.\nThen as to admissibility of evidence. The entry in the books was made in the course of business and it is immaterial whether it is for or against interest. See Bewley v. Atkinson (5); Price v. Earl of Torrington[8]; Doe Pattestrall v. Turford[9]; Prince of Wales ins. Co. v. Harding[10]; Marks v. Lahee[11].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I adhere to the opinion I expressed when this case was before this court on a former occasion, namely, that the instrument declared on as a policy of insurance was an incomplete instrument for want of the signature of the agent, and which instrument the agent had no right to deliver, or the deceased to accept, as a binding contract, and this view is confirmed by the finding of the jury on the last trial, the jury having found, as a matter of fact, that Allison, the agent, was instructed by the defendants not to deliver the policy until it was countersigned by him, thus establishing to the satisfaction of the jury that the policy was in Allison's hands as an escrow, not to be delivered until countersigned, and which there is evidence to sustain.\nThe necessity of countersigning appearing on the face of the policy, and there being no evidence whatever to show that Allison had any right or authority to waive or dispense with the countersigning, but the finding of the jury being to the contrary effect, I think the defendants cannot be held bound by this as an instrument executed and delivered as their deed. I think, on this finding, that the judgment should be entered for the defendants.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The plea of non est factum put in issue the due execution of the policy as a deed. If the effect of section 94 of the Revised Stats. (4th series) is to make such a plea inadmissible that point should have been raised by demurrer. As it is, issue is joined on the plea, and that issue had to be disposed of at the trial. To constitute the policy the deed of the defendants, it was essential to show that it had been duly sealed and delivered and the plea must be construed as if it had in extenso denied the sealing and delivering. So that if the plea of non est factum is generally excluded by the enactment in question, abolishing pleas of the general issue, still on this record it is to be read as a plea denying the sealing and delivering. I am however of opinion, that the plea of non est factum is still a proper mode of putting in issue the due execution of a deed declared on in an action, as being a specific denial of the fact of execution, and is not to be considered a general plea like not guilty in an action of trepass.\nI have also to differ from the learned judge who presided at the trial in the view which he took of the law as to delivery of sealed instruments as escrows. The objection here is that there was never any effectual delivery of the deed. And I take the law to be now well settled that an instrument under seal, though handed over to the custody of a party taking under it, may be shewn to have been so delivered subject to a condition until the performance of which it was not to take effect as a deed[12]. Therefore, if it appears that the delivery of a deed already sealed to the grantee was with the intention that it should not take effect as a deed, but in order that he should read and examine it and return it to the grantor, upon which terms and conditions, according to the evidence of Allison, the policy was delivered in the present case, the grantee cannot retain it and insist upon his possession of the instrument as conclusive evidence that it was duly delivered to him as a completed instrument.\nI entirely agree with the court below that the printed memorandum found in the margin of the policy in the following words: This policy is not valid unless countersigned by.................................agent at...................................Countersigned this.................day of........................ Agent.\ndoes not in any way affect the validity of the policy as a deed, though I think it has some weight as a mere fact confirmatory of Allison's evidence. There was no evidence to go to the jury shewing that Allison had been instructed no! to deliver the policy until it was countersigned. The learned judge should not, in my opinion, and as he himself upon further consideration thought, have left to the jury the question which evoked this finding, and the finding itself was therefore rightly disregarded in entering the verdict. Had there been evidence of any instructions from the company to Allison, not to deliver the policy until it was countersigned, and not to countersign it until the premium was paid, it would not affect the validity of the policy, at all events it could not have that effect in the absence of any notice to the assured of such instructions having been given, and the mere existence of the blank, incomplete skeleton memorandum by itself, entirely insensible, would not have been sufficient to establish notice to the assured that the policy was not to be a complete instrument until the memorandum had been filled up and some agent's signature attached to it. If any authority is wanted for this position, the case of the Prince of Wales Assurance Co. v. Harding[13], referred to by Mr. Justice McDonald is amply sufficient for that purpose. The question to be decided at the trial was therefore, in my view, purely one of fact. Was the policy delivered to the assured, as Allison says, merely to be read and examined by him and then to be returned to the agent, to be retained until the premium was paid, or was the premium in fact paid and the policy delivered as a complete instrument to take effect as such. It is manifest that the question of the intent with which the policy was delivered, must now be regarded as altogether dependent on the other fact as to the payment of the premium; and if there was legal evidence of this fact of payment proper for the consideration of the jury, and their finding proceeded upon legal and admissible evidence, it should not now, in my judgment, be disturbed. At the former trial of this action when Allison was examined as a witness, there was no admissible evidence of the payment of the premium beyond the presumption arising from the policy having been in the possession of William O'Donnel at the time of his death and for some time before. Allison gave direct evidence that the premium had not been paid, and he was able to point to the incomplete state of the memorandum in the margin of the policy and the absence of his countersignature as confirming his testimony. I thought sufficient weight had not been given to this, the attention of the jury not having been called to it, and that the great preponderance of this evidence in favor of the defendants, confirmed as it was by this circumstance, entitled them to a new trial. Since the first trial Allison has died and upon the last trial additional evidence was given as to the payment of the premium, some of which would not have been admissible during Allison's life. First there was put in evidence an entry made by the assured in a cash book of his father's, charging himself with the amount of this premium as having been paid by him to Allison on the 29th November, 1872, out of his father's cash. The entry is as follows: \"1872, Nov. 29.\u2014Paid F. Allison \"$48.06.\" This sum, $48.06, is the exact amount of the annual premium payable under the policy. This evidence was, I think, inadmissible, both upon principle and authority. I do not dispute the proposition that an entry against interest, by a deceased person, is admissible in favor of his own personal representatives, his executors or administrators, or others claiming under him. However anomalous such a rule may seem, the cases relating to endorsements upon bonds and notes make it impossible to deny that such is the law. I am of opinion, however, that upon another ground this entry was inadmissible. It does not come within the principles upon which entries of deceased persons are considered evidence as being against interest, for although as between his father and William O'Donnell himself it was an admission against the interest of the latter, yet as regards the present defendants it was in his own interest and favour, and being so was inadmissible. The cases of Ganton v. Size[14] and Massey v. Allen[15] are in point and conclusive as authorities shewing that this evidence ought not to have been admitted. This evidence was tendered at the former trial, but being objected to it appears not to have been pressed by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, and the objection to it therefore prevailed. Other additional evidence of what Allison (who died after the first trial) said when applied to by the plaintiff for a settlement was also given by the plaintiff himself at the last trial in 1885. Whether this evidence was properly receiveable as the admission of an agent of the defendants within the scope of his authority as such, is a point on which I express no opinion. In favor of its admissibility, it might be said that as Allison was the agent of the defendants, to whom the plaintiff had to apply for a settlement of the loss, it was within his authority to recognize the validity of the plaintiff's claim under the policy, and anything he said to that effect was binding on the defendants, at least in the absence of any evidence showing that his authority was restricted. I think, however, the admission of Allison deposed to by the plaintiff was good evidence against the defendants upon the same principle as that on which it was attempted to support the entry in the book, namely, as a declaration of a deceased person against his interest. It is now quite clearly established that the rule of evidence first authoritatively recognized in the case of Higham v. Ridgway[16] that a declaration by a deceased person opposed to his pecuniary or proprietory interest, in respect of a matter which he had no interest to misrepresent, is admissible not only when the declaration is embodied in some entry or memorandum in writing but also when it is merely oral. In the 8 th and last edition of Taylor on Evidence[17] the rule is thus stated:\nIt is now determined both with reference to this exception and also to that which relates to declarations made in the course of business or duty that the term \"declaration\" includes a mere oral statement as well as a written memorandum. The former may indeed be entitled to less weight with the jury than the latter, but the law of England recognizes no distinction between statements made by word of mouth and those made in writing, except when the writing is by deed or is rendered necessary by some statute.\nAnd the learned writer cites numerous authorities to show that his text is a correct deduction from the decided cases. It follows that the plaintiff's testimony of Allison's statement to him that the premium was paid was admissible evidence, and was properly submitted to the jury. The weight to be given to this evidence was, of course, solely a question for the jury, and, therefore, if the illegal evidence of the entry in the cash book had not been let in I should not have been disposed to interfere with the verdict. It is impossible to say, however, that the jury may not have been exclusively influenced by the evidence of the entry in the cash book, which was improperly received, and therefore, although the court has power under Order 38, Rule 10, of the Nova Scotia Judicature Act of 1884, in its discretion, to give judgment now on the legal evidence taken at the trial, rejecting that of the entry in the book, yet for the reason given I think the case not a proper one for the exercise of such a power, but that the case ought to go down to another trial, in order that a jury may pass on the evidence of Allison's admission, as stated by the plaintiff, without the complication of the illegal and inadmissible evidence of the entry.\nI think the rule in the court below should be made absolute for a new trial.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014This case comes up before us for the second time. When the first appeal was before this court, I was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, and my reasons are reported in the 10th Vol. Canada Supreme Courts Reports, page 92. The circumstances under which this case comes up again before this court have not altered my opinion, and I again think the respondent is entitled to succeed, and therefore, the present appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. I gave my reasons in a former appeal, reported in 10 Can. S. C. R. 101, why I consider that it was not necessary for the agent to countersign the policy. The instructions to him not to deliver the policy until it was countersigned I think were directory only, and under all the circumstances I think the evidence conclusive to show that the policy was delivered, not as an escrow, but for the purpose of giving it all the force of a duly executed policy.\nI am of opinion that the verdict should be sustained on the strength of the statute which provides that if the court sees that there is sufficient evidence by other testimony, independent of any effect that might be produced on the jury by evidence that should not have been admitted, they should sustain the verdict. It is, I think, mandatory to the court not to question whether the evidence received has had an effect on the minds of the jury or not, and it is the duty of the court to ascertain if there is sufficient evidence to warrant them in confirming the verdict, and I think the intention of the statute is, that where there is such evidence the verdict should be sustained. Before that statute it was a matter for the consideration of the court whether the evidence improperly admitted had any effect on the minds of the jury, but since the statute it is different.\nI am not sure that the evidence was improperly received. As to that I give no opinion. I entertain the same opinion as in the former case. The plaintiff has shown himself entitled to our judgment, and I think the judgment of the court below should be affirmed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I also remain of the opinion which I announced when this case was before the court on a former occasion as reported in 10 Can. Sup. Co. Rep. 92.\nUpon that occasion the court sent the case back for a new trial upon the ground that the evidence relied upon by the plaintiff was wholly insufficient to support a verdict in his favor in view of what appeared on the face of the document produced as the policy declared upon, and of the evidence of the witness, Allison, who testified that this document had been sent to him at Halifax from the head office of the defendants at Toronto as an escrow not to be issued to Wm. A. O'Donnell named therein, since deceased, and of whose estate the present plaintiff is administrator, until the premium should be paid, and he, Allison, should countersign the policy; he also testified that the premium never had been paid and that for this reason he never did countersign the document or issue it as a policy binding upon the defendants' company, and that in point of fact the policy had never been delivered to the deceased, O'Donnell, as a contract, but that he, Allison, had let him have it merely to read its conditions.\nBefore the recent trial took place the witness Allison had died, but his deposition taken on the former trial was received in evidence at the recent one, and the only additional evidence adduced by the plaintiff consisted of an entry (said by the plaintiff to be in the handwriting of his deceased son,) in a book which the plaintiff said related to the business of himself and his son, and was the only cash book kept between the two of them, and of a statement made by the plaintiff in his evidence that although Allison after the decease of William A. O'Donnell, upon the occasion of being applied to by the plaintiff for payment of the policy, said that he thought the premium never had been paid, yet that on a subsequent occasion, on meeting the plaintiff on the street, he said to him that he (the plaintiff) \"had the policy now and the money was \"paid,\" by which the plaintiff said that he understood Allison to mean that the premium had been paid. The entry in the book was under date Nov. 29th, 1872, as follows, under the word \"Paid,\" at the head of a number of entries chiefly in the handwriting of the plaintiff himself, \"F. Allison, $48.06\" There cannot, I think, be entertained a doubt that this entry was improperly received in evidence as lacking the only element which could have made it admissible, for it was not an entry made by the deceased against his own interest. As to the statement alleged to have been made to the plaintiff by Allison casually on the street, the proper time for the plaintiff to set it up was upon the former trial, when Allison gave his evidence upon oath, and not now after his decease. It is singular that the plaintiff should never, after the making of this alleged statement by Allison, have applied to him for payment of the policy, as he appears never to have done, for the plaintiff says in his evidence, after mentioning the statement as above, \"I did not call at his office after that He \"should have sent me the money.\" But apart from the consideration that, even if admissible, little weight should be attached to evidence of this nature now, after the decease of the witness, offered (for the first time, so far as it appears,) by way of impeachment of evidence given on oath in the plaintiff's presence on the former trial, without any allusion having been made to any such acknowledgment as is now relied upon, I am of opinion that the evidence was inadmissible as being an attempt to bind the defendants by a statement alleged to have been made by Allison at a time when he had no authority to affect the defendants by any statement of his other than one made upon oath and subject to cross examination by the defendants, the parties sought to be affected. Although no action had yet been brought, it is, I think, sufficiently apparent that before and at the time of the making of the alleged statement the defendants were disputing their liability to the plaintiff upon the ground that the premium never had been paid and that the instrument had never lost its character of an escrow in the hands of Allison. The declarations or acknowledgements of an agent are never admitted as evidence against his principal unless they are part of the res gesta and they become admissible, not as admissions, but solely on the ground that they are part of a transaction then being conducted by the agent for his principal. An agent's declaration of a past transaction is not admissible although it may have some relation to an act which the agent may be doing for the principal when he makes the declaration, but if the declaration be made at a time when the agent is not transacting any business for his principal it can not be received, there being in such case no res gesta of which the declaration forms a part. In Fairlie v. Hastings 10 Ves. 126, Sir Wm. Grant thus states the law.\nAs a general proposition what one man says, not upon oath, cannot be evidence against another man. The exception must arise out of some peculiarity of situation coupled with the declarations made by one. An agent may undoubtedly, within the scope of his authority, bind his principal by his agre\u00e9ment and in many cases by his acts. What the agent has said may be what constitutes the agreement of the principal, or the representations or statements made may be the foundation of, or the inducement to, the agreement; therefore, if writing is not necessary by law, evidence must be admitted to prove the agent did make that statement or representation. So with regard to acts done, the words with which those acts are accompanied frequently tend to determine their quality. The party therefore to be bound by the act must be affected by the words, but except in one or other of those ways I do not know how what is said by an agent can be evidence against his principal. The mere assertion of a fact cannot amount to proof of it though it may have some relation to the business in which the person making that assertion was employed as agent. * * * The admission of an agent cannot be assimilated to the admission of the principal. A party is bound by his own admission and is not permitted to contradict it. But it is impossible to say a man is precluded from questioning or contradicting anything any person has asserted as to him as to his contract or agreement merely because that person has been an agent of his. If any fact material to the interest of either party rests in the knowledge of an agent it is to be proved by his testimony, not by his mere assertion.\nIn Betham v. Benson[18], Dallas C.J. says:\nIt is not true that where an agency is established the declarations of the agent are admitted in evidence merely because they are his declarations; they are only evidence where they form part of a contract entered into by the agent on behalf of his principal and in that single case they become admissible. The declarations of an agent at a different time have been decided not to be evidence; indeed the cases on the subject draw the distinction between the declarations of an agent accompanying the making of, and therefore forming a part of the contract, and those declarations which are made either at a subsequent or an antecedent period. The case of Biggs v. Lawrence[19], has been disapproved of by Lord Kenyon; the receipt in that case being merely the written declaration of the agent ought not to have been admitted. Fairlee v. Hastings[20], is the latest authority on the subject, and it was there held by the late Master of the Rolls, on a review of all the decisions, that although an agency is established a declaration of the agent can only be evidence against the principal where it accompanies the transaction about which he is employed, and if made at another time it is not admissible.\nIn Mortimer v. McCallan[21], Lord Abinger C.J. says:\nAs a general principle it is undoubtedly true that conversations with an agent after the transaction are not evidence against his principal, but the question is whether this be or be not a part of the res gesta.\nAnd so the rule is laid down in the text books.\nMr. Phillips in his treatise on evidence[22] says:\nIt is only the statements or representations of the agent made in effecting an agreement or doing an act within the scope of his authority that are evidence against his principal, and the reason is because they may be explanatory of the agreement or determine the quality of the act they accompany.\nNow, at the time of the statement having been made, if it was made by Allison to the plaintiff on the street as alleged by the latter, the former was not engaged in the transaction of any business for the defendants to which the statement could attach. There was no transaction whatever then being conducted by Allison for the defendants of which the statement could form a part. The statement, if made, related wholly to a past transaction, and the evidence offered of its having been made, was therefore inadmissible. Upon the former trial, when Allison gave his evidence upon oath, testifying that in point of fact the premium never had been paid, the plaintiff's evidence, as now offered, could only have been received by way of impeachment of the credit of Allison's evidence, and this only by causing him to be asked on cross-examination whether he had not made the statement which the plaintiff now says he did make, drawing at the same time Allison's attention to the time and place of his having, as is alleged, made the statement, which, if Allison denied, the plaintiff's evidence might have then been received by way of contradiction. The plaintiff thus had then full opportunity of laying the necessary foundation for the introduction of the evidence which he now relies upon and did not do so. Nor does he appear to have then suggested that Allison had ever made such a statement. To permit this evidence now to be received after Allison's death would, in my opinion, be to lay the axe to the root of a well recognized and salutary rule of law and evidence.\nI concur, therefore, in the opinion of the Chief Justice, that the verdict should have been in favour of the defendants upon the evidence which was admissible and the findings of the jury having relation to that evidence, and that our judgment should now be in favor of the defendants upon the issues joined.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for appellants: Charles H.

Railway Act 1879 (42 Vic. ch. 9)\u2014 Application of, to special act\u2014Canadian Pacific Railway incorporation act (44 Vic. ch. 1)\u2014 Powers of company under\u2014Right to build line beyond terminus.\nHeld, Henry J. dissenting, that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company have power, under their charter, to extend their line from Port Moody in British Columbia to English Bay.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia restraining the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from constructing their line from Port Moody to Coal Harbor and English Bay through the land of the plaintiff.\nThis was an application by the plaintiff Major to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to restrain the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from proceeding with the construction of their road beyond Port Moody, the terminus of the road in British Columbia under the charter of the company, through the lands of the plaintiff. A similar application had previously been made by one Edmonds, another land owner whose property was to be affected by the proposed extension, and the court had granted an injunction, holding that the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 applied to this company and that, under section 7 sub-section 19 of that act, the company could not build their line beyond the terminus named in their charter. Under the practice in British Columbia a motion for an injunction is an interlocutory proceeding, and, therefore, not appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada. In Edmonds case, therefore, the proceedings ended with the order for an injunction, but in Major's case, in order to enable the company to appeal, the motion for an injunction was, by consent, turned into a motion for a decree, and the court having adhered to their former decision, and decided in favor of the plaintiff, Mr. Justice Gray dissenting, on the ground that the Railway Act of 1879 does not apply to this company except where it is beneficial to the charter, but is over-ruled by the Act of Incorporation, the company brought this appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRobinson Q.C., and Tait Q.C. for the appellants.\nThe question to be decided is : Does the restriction in section 7, sub-section 19 of the Railway Act, 1879, apply to this company? It is claimed that the Railway Act, by its terms, is made applicable to the charter of the company unless expressly excepted. But the charter itself says, by section 22 of the contract with the company, which is made a part of the act, and by section 17 of the act itself, under the title \"powers,\" that the Railway Act shall only apply in so far as it is not inconsistent with, or contrary to, the provisions of the act or of the contract. This is the later act, and must override the Railway Act, and it is to the charter alone that we must look to see if the company have the powers that are claimed in this case.\nSection 14 of the contract gives the company the largest possible powers. The learned Chief Justice of the court below thought it could not have been the intention to allow the company to go to any portion of the Dominion, but this section says that they can.\nSection 15 of the act is clear, and undoubtedly gives us the power to do this work. That section, after setting out the termini of the road in its different directions, and certain branches already constructed or contracted for, declares that the main line and the said branches, and any other branches to be constructed, and any extensions of the said main line thereafter to be constructed or acquired, shall constitute the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nIt seems unreasonable that any restrictions as to termini should be placed upon such a company as this in a country like British Columbia, especially when it is remembered that the declared intention was to carry the line to the Pacific coast and thus carry out the terms of union of the Province with the Dominion. The counsel cited The Atlantic and Pacific Railway Company v. St. Louis[1].\nEberts for the respondent.\nPort Moody is made the terminus by the charter, and the line cannot go beyond it without express authority. The Railway Act cannot be varied or excepted in the special act by implication.\nRichards Q. C., counsel in a similar case pending against the company, asked leave to be heard as amicus curice. By consent of counsel for the appellants such leave was granted.\nRichards Q. C. The company are seeking to exercise the right of eminent domain, and must have express authority to do so.\nSection 25 of the charter shows what extension means. And see Pierce on Railways[2] ; Morawitz on Private Corporations[3].\nThe company can build the road to Port Moody, and build branches, but there is no authority to extend the road beyond Port Moody. Large sums of money have been expended by property owners at Port Moody on the strength of its being the terminus of the road.\nThe learned counsel referred to the case of Plattville v. The Galena, &c., Railway Company[4], cited in Morawitz, p. 360.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The real and only point in controversy in this case is, as to the right of the Canadian Pacific railway Co. to extend, or to make branches extending, their line in British Columbia beyond Port Moody. The Canadian Pacific Railway claim the right to do so under their special Act of 1881. Section 22 of that Act, first schedule, is as follows :\n22. The Railway Act of 1879, in so far as the provisions of the same are applicable to the undertaking referred to in this contract, and in so far as they are not inconsistent herewith or inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of the act of incorporation to be granted to the company, shall apply to the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nAnd under the title \" powers \" in the schedule annexed it is provided by section 17 :\n17. \" The Consolidated Railway Act 1879,\" in so far as the provisions of the same are applicable to the undertaking authorized by this charter, and in so far as they are not inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions hereof, and save and except as hereinafter provided, is hereby incorporated herewith.\nTherefore, the provisions of the consolidated Railway Act of 1879, so far as applicable, must be read as in aid of the undertaking authorized by the act of 1881, and as subordinate thereto, and be held to operate only in so far as they are not inconsistent with, or contrary to, the provisions of the act of 1881 ; and when they are inconsistent or contrary the provisions of the act of 1881 must prevail. It is, therefore, to the act of 1881 that we must look to ascertain what the Canadian Pacific Railway can do with reference to branches or extensions.\nThe grave mistake into which, with all respect, I think the learned Chief Justice has fallen is, in my opinion, in not reading the consolidated Railway Act as entirely subordinate to the Canadian Pacific Railway Act of 1881. This is strongly indicated in the view which the learned Chief Justice expresses with reference to the right of the Canadian Pacific Railway to construct branches. He thinks the railway is confined to six miles by virtue of the act of 1879. But by section 14 of the contract included in, and made part of, the act of 1881 it is provided :\nThat the company shall have the right, from time to time, to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion.\nFrom which it is abundantly clear that the right conferred on the railway company from time to time to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion is entirely inconsistent with any such limitation ; and, therefore, I think the company had a right to construct a branch from any point or points on the railway to English Bay as well as to any other point or points within the territory of the Dominion. It would, indeed, to my mind, be a most curious and extraordinary anomaly if the company could run a branch starting at any point along the railway, say one, two or half a dozen miles from Port Moody to Coal Harbor or English Bay, and could not construct a branch from Port Moody to the same place, both being, practically, extensions of the railway to the same point. In other words, that they could start from any and every point along the railway and could not start from any and every point on the railway, a distinction, I humbly think, without a difference.\nSo, in like manner, I cannot accede to the learned Chief Justice's construction of section 15 in schedule A in the act of 1881. By section 4 of the act of incorporation it is provided that :\nAll the franchises and powers necessary or useful to the company to enable them to carry out, perform, enforce, use and avail themselves of every condition, stipulation, obligation, duty, right, remedy, privilege and advantage agreed upon, contained or described in the said contract are hereby conferred upon the company. And the enactment of the special provisions hereinafter contained shall not be held to impair or derogate from the generality of the franchises and powers so hereby conferred upon them.\nAnd section 14 provides that :\nThe company shall have the right from time to time to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion, provided always, that before commencing any branch they shall first deposit a map and plan of such branch in the Department of Railways. And the Government shall grant to the company the lands required for the road bed of such branches, and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, work shops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches. in so far as such lands are vested in the Government.\nAnd by the 15th section of schedule A it is provided :\nThat the company may lay out, construct, acquire. equip, maintain and work a continuous line of railway of the guage of four feet eight and one-half inches, which railway shall extend from the terminus of the Canada Central Railway near Lake Nipissing, known as Callander station, to Port Moody, in the Province of British Columbia (and also other branch lines not material to the present inquiry) ; and also other branches to be located by the company from time to time as provided by the said contract, the said branches to be of the guage aforesaid ; and the said main line of railway and the said branch lines of railway shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract ; and together with such other branch lines as shall be hereafter constructed by the said company ; and any extension of the said main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or acquired by the company shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nNo doubt, under the contract provided for by the Act of 1881, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company obligated themselves to build only to Port Moody, but I can discover nothing in the act to indicate that Port Moody was to be the actual and final termination of the Canadian Pacific Railway ; in other words, was to be a fixed terminus, with no powers of extension under the legislation of 1881. On the contrary, the 15th section indicates, in my opinion, directly the contrary, and shows, I think, conclusively that the terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway was not to be fixed at Port Moody, but was to be extended by branches and extensions to be constructed or acquired, if required by the exigency of the road or deemed by the company necessary for the purpose of effectually connecting the waters of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada ; and when so constructed by the Canadian Pacific Railway the road, not to Port Moody, but the road, with such branches and extensions when constructed or acquired, was to constitute the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the construction of which branches and extensions was contemplated by, and provided for in, the act of 1881 and the schedules thereto annexed.\nThe learned Chief Justice repudiates this view, and thinks this section gives the company no power to construct any extension whatever, and no power even to acquire any extension west of Port Moody. But to arrive at this conclusion he has to get over the words, \" and any extension of the main line of railway that \" shall hereafter be constructed or acquired by the com-\" pany shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter \" called the Canadian Pacific Railway.\" This he accomplishes, and can only accomplish, by practically reading them out of the statute, which he does after this fashion. He says the word \" constructed \" in the 15th section must be taken to mean \" lawfully con-\" structed ;\" that is to say, under some subsequent act if the company choose to apply for and obtain it. This certainly, as a mode of construction, has the merit of novelty, and suggests the pertinent question : If no authority was conferred, or intended to be conferred, by these words, and authority to construct was only to be obtained by subsequent legislation, and if, therefore, they are to have no effect in the statute by which they were enacted, why, or for what possible purpose, or to accomplish what, were they inserted ? I confess myself unable to answer this, to my mind, most reasonable inquiry. No court has a right to reject, or refuse to give effect to, the words of the legislature, if a reasonable construction can be placed on the language used, and, therefore, I am constrained so to construe this statute as to give effect, if possible, to this, to my mind, very plain language of the legislature, and I can give no effect to it if it was not the intention of the legislature to authorize such branches and such extensions of the main line as might be found expedient to complete and make available this great national undertaking, the construction of a railway connecting the sea-board of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada, a construction not only reasonable but one which, in my opinion, harmonises with the subject of the enactment and the object which the legislature had in view.\nThe learned Chief Justice has rightly said, as applicable to this case, that there is no magic in words, or I should say in names, so that whether this is called or treated as a branch or as an extension (for I can see no reason why a branch may not be an extension or an extension a branch if consistent with the general scope of the act) the railway company have, under the act of 1881, authority for its construction, subject, of course, to a compliance with all the provisions applicable to the expropriation of lands and other matters connected with the construction and extension of the road and its branches.\nThe Chief Justice says, with reference to the conclusion he has arrived at, \" I do so, necessarily, with regret, because I think the decision contrary to the interests of everybody in the Province including the plaintiffs.\" It will therefore, no doubt, give much pleasure to the Chief Justice, as it is most satisfactory to me to feel, that this court has been enabled to arrive at a conclusion which must be gratifying to everybody within the Province, and which ought to be equally so to the plaintiffs. It is not often, in controversial litigation, that it is made apparent that the interests of all parties, the public included, are identical, and are secured by the judicial determination of the controversy.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Concurred.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I think the point is very clear. The Canadian Pacific Railway Act says that the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 shall be applicable to the company in so far as it is possible, and as far as its provisions are not repugnant. The question is whether we find authority in the Canadian Pacific Act to extend their line of railway, and this seems to me to be given in such plain words that I cannot see how the contrary can be suggested. By the 14th section of the C. P. R. Act the company is. (His Lordship here read the section)[5].\nI think there is very little room for interpretation. The reasoning of Mr. Justice Gray is so convincing that I cannot but adopt his conclusions.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by the Chief Justice. HENRY J.\u2014I intended to read the 15th section of the charter of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, but as it has been so generally referred to I need not do so. I must say that I fail to see the power which the company ascribe to it. It does no more than give them corporate power to extend their line to the eastward as I shall endeavor to show hereafter, and this was necessary because of the power given by the act to acquire lines of railway east of the eastern terminus and consequently, under the head of corporate powers, the necessary authority was given. Now under the head of \" powers \" by section 17 it is declared that :\nThe Consolidated Act, 1879, in so far as the provisions of the same are applicable to the undertaking authorized by this charter, and in so far as they are not inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions hereof, and save and except as hereinafter provided, is hereby incorporated herewith.\nAnd by section 15 the company may lay out, &c.,\nAnd any extension of said main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or acquired shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nBy the 1st section of the schedule to the special act the line is divided into 4 sections, the western section from Kamloops to Port Moody. The latter after much consideration had been finally adopted as the western terminus. Section 15 then was not intended for any extension westward ; but \" the Canadian Pacific Railway \" was constituted to be the line east from Port Moody to Callendar station, including named branches and any extension eastward under the provisions of section 25, and the provisions of the latter section account for the provisions in section 15, that the extension afterwards constructed or acquired by the company should be included as part of the main line. I cannot come to the conclusion that anything else was meant. The western terminus was a subject long debated and finally decided by the legislature in the same act to be Port Moody. That certainly helps us to the conclusion that the provision in section 15 before mentioned was made solely to provide corporate powers for any extensions eastward of Callendar, that by construction or purchase the company should acquire.\nThe power given by the 14th section is to build \" branch lines of railway from points along their main line.\" No person will assume that building branch lines along the main line means an extension from the terminus virtually making another terminus.\nThen sub-section 19 of section 7 of the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, provides that:\nNo railway company shall have any right to extend its line of railway beyond the termini mentioned in the special act.\nUnless these words are to have no effect, or unless special power is given by the act, I cannot understand how it can be said that the company have power to build their proposed extension and change of terminus. The question therefore is, as to the termini of the road, and the right of extension from there. To the eastward the extensions are provided for, but I can see nothing but the bare provision necessary in section 15 to include corporate powers over extensions west.\nBy the sub-section 2, of section 2 of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879, it is provided that :\nThe said sections shall also apply to every railway constructed or to be constructed under the authority of any act passed by the parliament of Canada, and shall, so far as they are applicable to the undertaking, and unless they are expressly varied or excepted by the special act, be incorporated with the special act, form part thereof, and be construed therewith as forming one act.\nAnd by section 3 it is enacted that :\nFor the purpose of excepting from incorporation with the special act any of the sections forming part first of this act, it shall be sufficient in the special act to enact that the sections of this act proposed to be excepted, referring to them by the words forming the headings of such sections respectively, shall not be incorporated with such act, and the special act shall thereupon be construed accordingly.\nThe provision of section 3 was adopted by Parliament in the special act by section 18, which provided that the 11th sub-section of section 8 of the act of 1879 should not apply. Section 21 of the charter provides that sub-sections 1 and 2 of section 22 shall not apply, and by section 23 several other sections and sub-sections are provided not to apply. With the provisions in sub-section 2 of sections 2 and 3 just mentioned, which, it must be presumed were under the eyes of whoever prepared the special act for the government and of the company and the legislature, can it be imagined that any variation from the provision of section 19 before mentioned would not have been expressly made if such were intended?\nSection 22 of the special act also provides that the provisions of the Railway Act of 1879 shall apply to the Canadian Pacific Railway, in so far as applicable to the undertaking, and in so far as they are not inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of their act of incorporation.\nNow, I cannot perceive that there is any inconsistency if we look at the true meaning of the whole special act and read it with the provisions of the act of 1879. The latter enacts, section 2, that its provisions shall apply to all companies \" unless they are expressly varied or excepted by the special act,\" and \" shall be incorporated with the special act, form part thereof and be construed therewith as forming one act.\"\nI feel bound, then, to read the two acts as one and to give effect as far as possible to every part of them. I seek in vain for any express inconsistency so far as relates to any extension of the main line west from Port Moody. If we had not before us in bold relief the fact that the legislature had fixed the terminus at Port Moody, and that section 25 had not been enacted, we might speculate as to what was meant by the words, \" and any extension of the said main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or acquired by the company \" in section 15, but with the knowledge of the legislature that the western terminus had been declared, and that the act had made provisions for extensions eastward, and that the line from Kamloops west to Port Moody was not to be built or completed by the company, but by the government and handed over when so completed to the company, it would be, in my opinion, straining the force and meaning of the provision in section 15 of the charter, intended, in my opinion, to confer corporate powers only, to construe them as giving authority to extend the line ten miles from Port Moody, the settled terminus, to Vancouver city. I have shown that the provisions of section 25 required the provision in section 15 to give corporate powers to include extensions eastward as a part or parts of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nSection 4 of the charter is, in my opinion, but the usual provisions of a company's charter. Every company acquires similar franchises and powers, but the provisions in that section cannot, in any way, extend the operation, in other respects, of the charter.\nUnder the act of 1879, the company might build branches from any station including the terminal ones, but under the special act the company could not build a branch from either terminal station, as the right to do so is limited to start from points along the line. The company in this case occupies this position, that if it invokes the power under the former the right, I take it, must be limited to six miles ; for they cannot invoke one part of the provision made part of their own charter by express legislative enactments and reject the limitations. Some one has said that the act must be construed as giving all that is beneficial to the company and discarding what is not so. I cannot see my way clear to adopt that mode of construction. In my humble opinion the bitter must go with the sweet. Rights and privileges are given to companies, but they are to be enjoyed only by yielding statutory rights and privileges to others. The companies are given facilities for carrying out their chartered rights, but duties and responsibilities are annexed which must be performed and acknowledged. Companies must keep within the powers conferred by their charters, and if they exceed them they must be answerable for wrongs committed.\nI am of the opinion that the company in this case had no legal right to extend the terminus from Port Moody to Vancouver City. I would have preferred to have been able to arrive at a different conclusion, as it is, no doubt, largely in the public interest that the road in question should be speedily finished, and a loss to the company to be delayed in finishing it. In differing from my colleagues, I have at least the satisfaction of feeling that, if I am wrong in my views, they will not affect the result.\nI regret to have been obliged to explain my views without sufficient time to do so as as I could have wished. It was desirable an early decision should be given where such large public as well as private interests are involved.\nI will only then add that I have read very carefully the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the court below and fully concur with him in the reasons he has given for deciding as he did, in favor of the respondent. Entertaining the views I have expressed, I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is, I think, of no importance whether the work proposed to be constructed by the C. P. Ry. Co. be called a \" branch \" or an \" extension.\" I can see no difficulty in a \" branch \" line of railway being constructed from the extremity of a \" main \" line. But whatever may be its most appropriate designation, I concur in the opinion that the company have power under their Act of Incorporation to construct it, subject to the provisious of the Consolidated Railway Act as to acquiring right of way.\nAppeal allowed with costs, and plaintiff's action in the court below dismissed.\nSolicitors for appellants : Drake, Jackson & Helmcken.\nSolicitors for respondent : Eberts & Taylor.\n[1] 66 Miss. 228.\n[2] Pp. 145 and 494.\n[3] 2 ed.

One Cox, a trader, gave a mortgage on his stock to the firm of McCall & Co., and a short time afterwards he assigned all his estate to one Ferguson in trust for the benefit of his creditors. The firm of McDonald & Co., who were simple contract creditors of Cox, brought suit, after the assignment in trust, against the mortgagees and Ferguson to set aside the mortgage, alleging that it was given when Cox knew himself to be insolvent, and with intent to defeat and delay his creditors and give McCall & Co. a fraudulent preference. It was also alleged that the assignment in trust was made at the instance of McCall & Co with intent to prevent any impeachment of the mortgage. McCall & Co. were not made plaintiffs in the suit.\nThe goods covered by the mortgage were the only assets of Cox, and the mortgagees had taken possession of and were selling them. It was agreed that they should all be sold and the proceeds paid into court to abide the results of the suit.\nAt the hearing before Ferguson J. a decree was made in favor of the plaintiffs, the material portion of which was as follows:\n2. This court doth declare that the chattel mortgage made by the defendant Cox in favor of the defendants D. McCall & Co., and bearing date the 22nd day of March, A.D. 1884, was and is fraudulent and void as against the plaintiffs and such other of the creditors of the defendant Cox as may contribute to the expenses of this suit, and doth order and adjudge the same accordingly.\n3. And it appearing that the defendants D. McCall & Co. have, under the chattel mortgage aforesaid, sold the goods and chattels covered thereby, and that, under the terms of an order made in this action and dated the sixteenth day of May, 1884, they have paid into court to the credit of this cause the amount realized under the said sale, to wit, the sum of $5,000; this court doth order and adjudge that the said sum of $5,000, together with interest accrued thereon, be forthwith paid out of court to the defendant Ferguson, to be by him forthwith distributed among the creditors of the defendant Cox, under the terms of the deed of assignment from the defendant Cox to the said defendant Ferguson, having regard to he provision hereinafter contained as to the costs of these proceedings.\nThe Court of Appeal affirmed the decree except as to the disposition of the money in court, which they ordered to be retained in court and paid to the creditors filing claims. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIn addition to the authorities cited in the report of the case 9 O.R. 185 and in the present judgments, the learned counsel for the appellant Robinson Q.C. and Geo. Kerr referred to the following cases:\u2014Wood v. Dixie[3]; Bills v. Smith[4]; Royal Canadian Bank v. Kerr[5]; Johnson v. Fesemeyer[6]; Nunes v. Carter[7]; Ex parte Topham[8]; Newton v.

Swire[25]; Tonkins v. Saffery[26]; Jones v. Kinney[27].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014No sufficient grounds have, in my opinion, been shown for disturbing the finding, on the question of fact, of the court of first instance confirmed, as it has been, by the Court of Appeal; so that the only questions we have to consider are questions of law.\nTwo preliminary objections were urged before Mr, Justice Ferguson. He says:\u2014\nA preliminary objection was taken and urged as to the frame of the suit. It was said that when the simple contract creditor brings a suit to set aside a conveyance, he must sue on behalf of himself and all other creditors, and the exclusion by the plaintiff of McCall & Co., who were creditors, was fatal.\nThere was also another preliminary objection which was renewed at the final argument, namely, that a simple contract creditor could not sustain a suit to set aside a chattel mortgage for fraud in a case where the mortgagor had made an assignment for the benefit of creditors generally; that the simple contract creditors, the plaintiffs in this case, could not sustain the suit as they did not attack the assignment as well as the mortgage.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal says:\u2014\n\u201cSeveral legal questions have been raised. First, the right of these plaintiffs to ask this relief; they are simple contract creditors, suing on behalf of themselves and all other creditors other than the defendants; this has been objected to but I think it fully warranted by the practice in such cases\n\u201cIt has been objected that the plaintiffs cannot sue before judgment. This, he thinks, can be done, and I agree with him that simple contract creditors, suing on behalf of themselves and all other creditors other than the defendants, can maintain a suit to avoid a deed fradulent and void as against creditors.\nThen he says:\u2014\n\u201cThe strongest objection urged was, that as the debtor had made a general assignment of his estate to a trustee for the general benefit a few weeks after he had made the impeached chattel mortgage this, it is contended, puts the plaintiffs out of court in this suit.\n\u201cIt is urged that the mortgage is only void against creditors; that it is good against the mortgagor, and that his assignee has no higher right and now represents him, and that so long as the latter assignment is unimpeached no creditor can be heard to impeach the mortgage.\u201d\nI confess myself wholly unable to understand how the making of this assignment by the mortgagor for the general benefit of his creditors can practically confirm and make good a mortgage which is now admitted to have been fradulent and void as against creditors, and thus, as it is claimed, put the plaintiffs out of court. It is said that the mortgage is good as against the assignee and that he could not contest its validity. Assuming this to be so, so far from its militating against the creditors\u2019 right to intervene and have the mortgage declared, as it has been proved to be, fradulent and void, it seems to me rather to strengthen their position. All they want is, that all the debtor\u2019s property should be fairly distributed among them, and they are therefore willing that the assignment, which they have executed and which provides for such a distribution, should stand. But is that any reason why a mortgage, fradulent and void as against them, should also stand? And because they are willing that there should be a fair and equal distribution of the debtor\u2019s property among all his creditors are they to be shut out from claiming that the property so fradulently conveyed should be included in such distribution as not having been, as against them, legally mortgaged, but on the other hand that by the act of their debtor assigning all his estate for their benefit the fradulent and void mortgage is made good and valid? Instead of such a monstrous result it does seem to me that if the assignee for the creditors could not set aside the fraudulent instrument, every principle of reason and common sense points out that the creditors should be able to have it declared void and of none effect, and so remove it from out of his and their way. It seems to me no better than mockery to say to the creditors, \u201ctrue it is your debtor has made a mortgage fraudulent and void as against you, but as he has conveyed for your benefit all his estate and property, including the very property covered by the mortgage, and without any reference to the mortgage, and to which instrument you are assenting parties, that this makes good the mortgage and renders it valid and binding, unless, indeed, you set aside the assignment which nobody impugns, and still less, you who are parties to it, and which, in fact, you think fair and just, as also fraudulent and void.\nAs the assignment to Ferguson is not attacked, does it not follow, as a matter of course, that the proceeds of the sale would necessarily go to Ferguson for distribution among the creditors of Cox? The mortgage being removed, the property or the proceeds of the property, come to him unincumbered, and why should it not be held by him and be distributed in accordance with the terms of the assignment to him? Putting it in the most favorable way, namely, that the assignment only amounted to a conveyance of the equity of redemption in the mortgaged goods, if Ferguson, on behalf of the creditors, sought to redeem the property, could the mortgagor and the mortgagee, or either of them, set up the claim as against the creditors that the mortgage debt was due and payable, and without payment of which the property could not be redeemed when the mortgage itselt, as against those very creditors on whose behalf Ferguson was seeking to redeem the property, had been declared fraudulent and void, and to the proceeds of which they, the creditors, had therefore become entitled? The moment this mortgage was displaced, and to be treated, as against creditors, as non-existing, the property, in my opinion, necessarily falls into the assignment for their benefit, and thus becomes in a position to be immediately administered for their benefit, thus affording them an effectual and substantial relief against the property. Therefore, the setting aside of this mortgage is no mere barren declaration; on the contrary, the moment the deed is set aside the creditors and others for whom they sue are in a position to obtain, under the assignment, the fruits of the decree, the court having set aside the deed, and the defendant Ferguson, representing the creditors, holding the property for their benefit under an instrument the validity of which neither the mortgagor nor mortgagee can, or do, question. Therefore, no necessity exists, in my opinion, for independent proceedings to obtain execution against the property in the deed, supposing such would have been necessary if no assignment had been made, for the simple reason that if the assignment is good no execution could issue against the goods at the instance of an individual creditor inasmuch as, I take it, it would be competent for Ferguson, under the assignment, on behalf of the general body of creditors to resist any such execution.\nI agree with the learned Chief Justice that there is no difficulty in disposing of all the matters in controversy between the parties before the court; in fact I find but one matter really in controversy, namely, was or was not this mortgage fraudulent and void? If so, then there does not appear to be any further controversy that I can discover. Nobody alleges that if this mortgage is fraudulent and void the assignment is not reasonable and fair and that the proceeds of the mortgaged goods should not be distributed in accordance with its terms. Then, what possible objection can there be to the court ordering the money to be paid out to the creditors through the instrumentality of the deed of assignment? If Ferguson J. had not adjudged the amount to be paid out to the assignee, he being a party before the court and the assignment to him not being disputed or questioned, if he applied for an order to have the money paid over to him as the party legally entitled to it on the face of the proceedings, who could successfully resist his claim? Certainly not Cox nor his mortgagees, still less the creditors who claim to have the mortgage set aside for the very purpose of having the proceeds distributed equally among them. The solution of the whole matter, to my mind, is that so soon as the mortgage is declared fraudulent and void, it is to be treated and dealt with as if it had never existed, as against the creditors as if the mortgage had never been executed.\nThere does not appear to have been any question raised, or objection made, to the money being paid to Ferguson; on the contrary, it appears that all parties are willing that that course should be adopted, and therefore I can see no reason for varying the judgment of Ferguson J. in this particular. If any reason was shown why he should not receive it, then I agree with Chief Justice Haggarty, that the court can deal with the matter and allow each creditor to prove his claim in the master\u2019s office, and therefore, in my opinion, the decree in this case is neither futile nor fruitless.\nI may say generally, that the judgment of Chief Justice Haggarty, and the reasons on which it is founded, commend themselves strongly to my mind.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The plaintiffs\u2019 right to maintain this suit Without having recovered judgment for their debt is, I think, clear upon the authority of Reese River Mining Co. v. Attwell[28]. The Master of the Rolls there points out the distinction between a suit to set aside a deed as a fraud on creditors under the statute of Elizabeth where the relief sought is confined to the mere avoidance of the deed, and such a suit where there is superadded the additional relief of equitable execution. In the latter class of cases for the reasons given by Lord Cottenham in his judgment in Neate v. Duke of Marlborough[29]; and for those assigned for the judgment in Smith v. Hurst[30]; not only was the recovery of a judgment an essential preliminary to the filing of the bill but legal execution must also have been issued and lodged in the sheriff\u2019s hands.\nThere are two cases in which it is laid down generally that a creditor cannot maintain a bill to set aside a deed as being void against creditors without having first recovered a judgment at law, Colman v. Croker[31]; and Lister v. Turner[32]; but those cases may, I think, fairly be attributed to principles governing the exercise of equity jurisdiction which prevailed at the time they were decided, but which have long since become obsolete, both in Ontario and in England. At the date of these decisions the Court of Chancery scrupulously avoided deciding any questions of law; if a legal question arose it was sent to a court of law for decision, if in other respects the suit was maintainable. As the foundation of the creditors\u2019 right to sue was a legal question, namely, the existence of the legal debt which constituted him a creditor, this was treated as a matter for adjudication in a court of law and until it had been there disposed of it was considered that the creditor had no locus standi in equity. Since 1853. at all events, when this practice was abolished by general orders, afterwards confirmed by statute, this rule has not applied (if indeed it ever did apply) to the Ontario Court of Chancery and since the passage of the statute, commonly called from its author \u201cRolfs Act,\u201d and which was enacted long before the Judicature Act, it has ceased to have force in England. I, therefore, adhere in all respects to the judgment delivered in the case of Longeway v. Mitchell[33]\nAs regards the right of assignees for the benefit of creditors to maintain a suit to set aside a deed made by the assignor (the debtor) in fraud of creditors generally, I am of opinion (following what was decided in McMaster v. Clare[34], and in this court in Burland v. Moffatt[35]; and what has frequently been laid down as law in the United States[36]; that the assignee or trustee in such cases must be deemed to claim under the debtor his assignor, and consequently that he cannot, like an assignee in bankruptcy, or one who has a statutory title under an Insolvent Act, be admitted to assert a title paramount to that derived by him from his author, the debtor, who manifestly could not sue for such a purpose. There is, however, no reason so far as I can see for disentitling a creditor who is entitled to the benefit of such a trust deed from suing so long as he has not released his debt or accepted the benefit of the trust as a satisfaction of the debtors liability to him.\nAs regards the merits of this case upon the evidence I have had great doubt whether it establishes the plaintiff\u2019s case. So far as it depends on conflicting testimony in the oral evidence of witnesses who were examined at the trial, I consider myself bound to accept the finding of the learned judge so far as he adopted the facts deposed to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses in preference to those stated on behalf of the defendants. But the case depends to\u2011some extent on other considerations\u2014on inferences to be drawn from undis- puted or established facts, and from written evidence contained in documents and correspondence, to which class of proofs the rule laid down in Gray v. Turnbull[37] and many other cases has no application. I think, however, when a case bas been heard in an intermediate Court of Appeal, and the decision of the judge of first instance has there been confirmed without dissent upon questions purely of fact, though of facts not depending on conflicting testimony, no useful purpose is served by a single judge dissenting in a second Court of Appeal; and, I must add, I doubt if a second Court of Appeal ought, ever, except in a case of the most manifest error, to disturb a concurrent judgment arrived at by a first judge, and a unanimous Court of Appeal, upon any question of fact, even upon one not depending on the credit to be attributed to witnesses, but dependent altogether on inferences to be drawn from documentary evidence or undisputed facts. In making these observations I do so upon the understanding that Mr. Justice Burton, who differed in the Court of Appeal, did not express any positive opinion upon the evidence, but based his dissent altogether on legal points irrespective of the merits.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, TASCHEREAU and GWYNNE JJ. concurred in dismissing the appeal for the reasons given by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, the judgment of the Court of Appeal being varied as to the disposition of the money in court, and the original judgment of Ferguson J, restored.\nSolicitors for appellants McCall & Co.: Kerr & Bull.\nSolicitors for appellant Ferguson: Foster, Clarke & Bowes.\nSolicitors for respondents: MacLaren, MacDonald, Merritt & Shepley.\n[1] 12 Ont.

Was present.\nON APPEAL FROM THE CHANCERY DIVISION OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal direct from court of original jurisdiction\u2014S. C. A.

C. J., was upheld. Up to the time of the judgment rendered by the latter court the proceedings had been carried on in the name of D. by arrangement between him and the church wardens of St. James Cathedral, who contended that they had an interest separate from that of D. in the disposition of the lands and the revenues therefrom, and who had indemnified D. against costs. But upon the church wardens proposing to appeal to the Court of Appeal, D. refused to allow his name to be further used in the proceedings. The Court of Appeal, upon an application being made by the church wardens for leave to appeal, refused to grant such appeal, holding that the church wardens had no interest in the lands or revenues[1]. The church wardens thereupon applied to Strong J. in chambers for leave to appeal per saltern to the Supreme Court of Canada under sec. 6 of the S. C. A. A. 1879 from the judgment of the Chancery Division. The judge held that the church wardens had an interest at least which justified them in appealing. He would not, however, as a judge in chambers, overrule the decision of the Court of Appeal, but grant leave to renew the application to the full court.\nOn the motion coming before the full court it was\nHeld, that the appeal should be allowed upon a proper indemnity being given by the church wardens to D. against all possible costs, the court expressing no opinion on the merits of the case itselt. Henry J. dissenting, on the ground that it was impossible to decide the right to appeal without entering into the merits, and on the merits the church wardens had no interest in the lands or revenues.\nAnd on the main appeal it was\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the courts below, that the lands in question in this case were rectory lands within the meaning of the Act 29 and 30 Vic. c. 16, entitled \"An Act to provide for the sale of rectory lands in this Province.\"\nHeld, also, that the lands were held by the rector of the Church of St. James, in the city of Toronto, as a corporation sole for his own use, and not in trust for the vestry and church wardens or parishioners of the rectory or parish of St. James, and such vestry and churchwarden had therefore no locus standi in curia with respect to said lands.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court of the Chancery division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, pronounced on the 19th day of December, 1884. The appeal was brought per saltern to the Supreme Court, under the circumstances set out in the head note.\nThe facts and pleadings in the case are fully set out in the reports of the case in 7 Ont. Rep. pages 499 and 644, and in the judgment of Gwynne J. hereinafter given.\nHowland & Arnoldi for appellant;\nJames MacLennan, Q.C., for the Township Rectors;\nHector Cameron, Q.C., for the Diocese of Toronto.\nThe argument of counsel and cases and statutes relied on sufficiently appear in the reports of the case in 7 Ont.[2]. Sir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In this case I have had the privilege of reading the notes prepared by Mr. Justice Gwynne and I entirely agree with him as to the proper construction to be put upon the statute. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J., concurred with Gwynne J.\nHENRY J.\u2014I have not had the privilege of reading my brother Gwynne's reasons for judgment, but I concur in dismissing the appeal, and had so made up my mind. When the appeal was asked for I was of opinion that the statute bound the incumbent He himself admitted it, and received what was necessary for his support and was willing that the balance should go to the church. The church wardens, wanting the whole sum for one parish and wanting to force an appeal after there had been an adjudication of a court of justice against them, claimed that the appellant was their trustee. I was of opinion when the application for leave to appeal was made that he was never such trustee. He himself denied it and this court forced an appeal upon him because the church wardens offered to give security for the costs. I was opposed to this at the time, and I see no ground for coming to a different conclusion now.\nIndependently of this the wardens had no interest, and they had no right to bring this appeal, and Mr. Dumoulin having agreed to abide by the judgment appealed from, he should not have been compelled to appeal to this court.\nI am in favor of allowing the judgment in favor of the plaintiff to stand, and of dismissing the appeal with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of the same opinion as to the taking of the appeal. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. GWYNNE J.\u2014This case comes before us by way of appeal direct from the judgment of the chancery division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario. The appeal is taken in the name of the defendant, the rector of the parsonage or rectory of St. James in the city of Toronto, formerly the town of York, but in the interest of the vestry parishoners and church wardens of St. James' Church, who, as the rector declined instituting, on his own behalf, an appeal from the said judgment, obtained an order from this court enabling them to appeal in the name of the rector upon their indemnifying him from all costs. The claim of the vestry end church wardens is, that they and the parishioners of the said rectory are the cestuis que trustent of the lands mentioned in the plaintiff's statement of claim, and that the rector of St James' parsonage, or rectory, holds the same merely as a trustee to their use, and that therefore the lands in respect of which the suit has been instituted do not come within the operation of the statutes in the plaintiff's statement of claim mentioned, that is to say, ch. 16 as amended by ch. 17 of the statutes of the late province of Canada passed in the session held in the 29th and 30th years of Her Majesty's reign, and two acts of the legislature of the province of Ontario, namely, 39 Vic. ch. 109 and 41 Vic. ch. 69. Part of the land in question was granted by letters patent from the Crown bearing date the fourth day of September, 1820, by which certain land therein described was granted unto and to the use of D'Arcv Boulton, then one of the justices of the Court of King's Bench in and for the Province of Upper Canada, John Beverley Robinson, His then Majesty's Attorney General for the said Province, and one William Allan, and to their heirs and assigns, upon trust to hold the same for the sole use and benefit of the resident clergyman of the town of York and his successors appointed or to be appointed rectors of the Episcopal Church therein to which the said land is appurtenant, to make leases of the same with the consent of the incumbent, and to receive the rents due or to grow due therefrom to his own use. The letters patent contained a proviso that whenever the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, or person administering the government of the said province, should erect a parsonage or rectory in the said town of York, and present to such parsonage or rectory an incumbent or minister of the Church of England, who should have been duly ordained according to the rites of the said church, then and whenever the same should happen the said grantees in the said letters patent named, or any succeeding trustees appointed as in the said letters patent was provided, should, by an instrument in writing under the hands and seals of the trustees then being, attested by two or more credible witnesses, transfer and convey all the parcel or tract of land, with the appurtenances by the said letters patent given or granted, to such incumbent or minister being so appointed as aforesaid, and his successors forever, as a sole corporation to and for the same uses and upon the same trusts as before mentioned and expressed; that is to say, to the sole use and benefit of the resident clergyman and his successors appointed or to be appointed rectors of the Episcopal Church in the town of York. The only Episcopal church at this time in the town of York was called St. James' Church, of which the Rev. John Strachan, then and from thenceforth until the month of February, 1847, was the incumbent.\nAnother portion of the land in question, together with a number of other parcels of land, was granted by the Crown by letters patent bearing date the 26th day of April, 1879, unto and to the use of the Honorable William Dummer Powell, then Chief Justice of the Province of Upper Canada, James Baby and the Reverend John Strachan, their heirs and assigns upon certain trusts in the said letters patent declared, and among such trusts upon trust to make conveyances of the parcels or tracts of land by the said letters patent granted or any part thereof to and for such use or uses as the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or person administering the government of the Province of Upper Canada, and the Executive Council thereof for the time being, should from time to time by order in writing appoint.\nThe grantees named in these letters patent, by an indenture bearing date the 4th day of July, 1825, and made between them of the first part and the same persons as were named grantees in the said letters patent of the 4th day of September, 1820, of the second part, (after reciting therein the letters patent of the 26th day of April, 1819, and that His Excellency Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Upper Canada and the Executive Council thereof had, by an order in writing bearing date the 2nd day of December, 1824, required the grantees in the said letters patent named to convey to D'Arcy Boulton, John Beverley Robinson and William Allan for the use of the church in the town of York and of the clergyman incumbent thereof, for the time being, the parcels of land therein described (being part and parcel of the lands by the said letters patent of the 26th of April, 1819, granted to the grantees therein named, the parties to the said indenture of the first part) conveyed, assured and confirmed unto and to the use of the said parties thereto of the second part, their heirs and assigns the same parcels of land in the said order in writing described (being part of the land now in question) upon trust, however, that the said parties to the said indenture of the second part should hold the same for the sole use and benefit of the resident clergyman of the town of York and his successors appointed or to be appointed incumbent of the parsonage or rectory of the Episcopal Church according to the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England in the said town to which the said land is appurtenant, or to make leases of the same with the consent of the said incumbent, and to receive the rents due and to grow due therefrom to his own use. This indenture contained a provision for the appointment of a new trustee, or new trustees in the place of a trustee or trustees dying or becoming incapable to act in the execution of the trust of the said indenture and a proviso to the same effect verbatim as that contained in the said letters patent of the 4th of September, [Illegible Text], in the event of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or person administering the government in the province, erecting a parsonage or rectory in the said town of York. The town of York was incorporated as the city of Toronto in 1834.\nFrom the date of the letters patent of the 4th September, 1820, the grantees therein named and the trustees for the time being of the lands thereby granted, and from the 4th July, 1825, the same persons, as trustees for the time being of the lands in the indenture of tha date mentioned, held the several pieces of land now in question in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Rev. John Strachan as the clergyman who was incumbent of St. James Church, in the town of York (afterwards the city of Toronto) until the 16th day of January, 1836, when by letters patent of that date, under the great seal of the province of Upper Canada, after reciting the provisions of the Imperial statute 31st Geo. 3, authorizing the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or person administering the government of the province, with the advice and consent of his Majesty's executive council within the same, to constitute and erect in every township or parish which then was or thereafter might be formed, constituted or erected within such province one or more parsonage or rectory, or parsonages or rectories, according to the establishment of the church of England, a parsonage or rectory was erected and constituted at the city of Toronto, in the township of York, according to the establishment of the church of England, and by the said letters patent it was declared that such parsonage or rectory should, \"be hereafter known, styled and designated as 'the \"first parsonage or rectory within the said township \"of York, or otherwise known as, the parsonage or \"rectory of St. James.\" By these letters patent certain lands situate in the township of York and therein mentioned, whereof the crown was seized, were set apart as a glebe and endowment to be held appurtenant with the said parsonage or rectory, and by letters patent of the same date the Rev. John Strachan then the clergyman and incumbent of the church of Saint James, in the said city, received the presentation to the said rectory and was duly inducted thereinto, and from thenceforth he became entitled as the rector of the parsonage or rectory of Saint James, not only to the sole use and benefit of himself, as rector of the said parsonage or rectory of the lands mentioned in the said letters patent of the 16th January, 1836, but also to the sole use, benefit, and enjoyment in like manner of the lands mentioned in the letters patent of the 4th September, 1820, and in the indenture of the 4th July, 1825, as the endowment of the said parsonage or rectory; and accordingly the trustees for the time being of the said last mentioned letters patent and indenture, who from the granting of the said letters patent of the 16th January, 1886, constituting the said parsonage or rectory, and the presentation and induction thereinto of the said Rev. John Strachan as the rector thereof, held the said lands in trust for the sole use and benefit of the rector of the said parsonage or rectory and his successors as a corporation sole, by a deed bearing date the 10th of February, 1841, after reciting the letters patent and indentures in virtue of which they held the said lands in trust, and the erection of the said parsonage or rectory, and the presentation and induction thereinto of the said Rev. John Strachan, as the rector thereof, did grant, convey, assure, and transfer unto him, as rector of St. James and his successors in the said rectory as a sole corporation, the said lands, &c., to have and to hold the same as rector of St. James, and his successors in the said rectory forever as a sole corporation to and for the same uses and upon the same trusts as are mentioned and expressed in the said letters patent of the 4th September, 1820, and the said indenture of the 4th July, 1826, therein recited, that is to say, as to the lands in question here to the sole use and benefit of the said rector and his successors as rectors of the said parsonage or rectory. In the month of February, 1847, the Rev Henry James Grasett succeeded the Rev. Dr. Strachan as rector of the said rectory and continued to be such rector, and in the possession and enjoyment of the lands now in question and of the rents, issues and profits thereof to his own sole use and benefit, as such rector until his death in the month of March, 1882.\nFor sixty years, therefore, the lauds now in question have been held and enjoyed to the sole use and benefit of the incumbent, for the time being of the church of St James in the city of Toronto, and for upwards of forty of those years the legal and equitable estate therein has been vested in the same incumbent as rector of the rectory erected by the letters patent of the 16th January, 1839, and his successors as a corporation sole for the sole use and benefit of the rector for the time being of the said rectory, and during all that time no pretension has ever been asserted that any part of the land now in question was held in trust for the use or benefit in any particular of the vestry or churchwardens of, or of the parishioners attending, the parish church of the rectory or parish of Saint James, and I must say that in my opinion there is no foundation whatever for any such pretension, and therefore such vestry, church wardens or parishioners have no locus standi in curi\u00e2 to maintain this appeal. The present rector was well advised not to appeal on his own behalf from the judgment of the Chancery Divisional Court, for I entertain no doubt that whatever may be the proper construction to put upon the words, \"rectory lands,\" as used in the preamble of 29 and 30 Vic. c. 16. the language of the enacting clause is abundantly sufficient to include, and as I think was framed with preciseness ex abundanti cautel\u00e2 for the purpose of including, the lands now in question as lands which had been granted by the Crown as appurtenant to, and belonging to, and appropriated for, the rectory of St. James, equally as it did include within its operation the lands set apart for the like purpose by the letters patent of the 16th January, 1836.\nIf it were necessary to put a construction upon the words \"rectory lands,\" as used in the preamble, I should not feel disposed to put upon them the narrow construction that they apply only to the lands mentioned in the letters patent erecting and constituting the several rectories which were erected under the Imperial statute 31st George III. To my mind it is plain that whether the church, which was known as St. James' Church, in the town of York, had a legally constituted parish attached to it or not, it was in popular phraseology understood to be a parish church, whatever may have been supposed to be the bounds of the parish, and from the language of the letters patent of the 4th September, 1820, I think there is no doubt that the intention of the Government was that, whenever rectories should be established under the provisions of the Imperial statute 31st Geo. Ill, the church of St. James, for whose incumbent the letters patent of September, 1820, made some provision, should be the parish church of a parish or rectory to be so erected and constituted. In this opinion I am confirmed by the language of the letters patent of the 16th day of January, 1836, declaring that thereafter the parsonage or rectory thereby erected should be known as the first parsonage or rectory within the township of York, otherwise known as the parsonage or rectory of St. James.\nThe lands which had been granted and settled by the Crown in trust for the sole use and benefit of the clergyman for the time being incumbent of St. James' Church prior to the letters patent of the 16th of January, 1836 became, upon the issue of those letters patent, as much part of the lands granted by the Crown as an endowment of the rectory and appropriated to the use of the rector of St. James' for the time being as did the lands mentioned in the letters patent of the 16th January, 1836, and came as much within the term \"rectory lands\" as did the latter. Under the circumstances attending the erection of the rectory of St. James and the presentation to that rectory of the incumbent of St. James' Church, in the City of Toronto, which church became the parish church of the rectory, we can well conceive that the provision which the Crown had already made for the sole use and benefit of the incumbent of the Church of St. James before its erection into the parish church of the rectory of that name, operated on the Government in determining what further provision for the endowment of the rectory should be made in the letters patent constituting the rectory. The statute 29th & 30th Vic. ch. 16 was plainly, as I think, passed for supplementing the powers then already vested in the incorporated synods of the several dioceses by placing under their control (as the proper power in the church to have the management and disposition of the temporalities of the church) all lauds granted by the crown for, and forming part of, the endowment of any rectory, as effectually as prior statutes had placed under their control property otherwise acquired for a like purpose. In the view of the very great increase in the value of the property held as an endowment of the rectory of St. James beyond what was at all necessary for the support of its rector, and which endowment was, in fact, sufficient for the support of many clergymen of the church having the cure of souls, and but ill provided for in other parishes, nothing was more natural than that the synods of the dioceses, constituted as they are of the clergy and laity of the church, should, after the decease of any living incumbent having vested interests during his life, have the disposition of the property constituting the endowment of the rectories within the respective dioceses, with the view of providing means for extending the influence and services of the church throughout the poorer parts of the dioceses. Accordingly it was upon the application of the provincial synod that the act 29th and 30th Vic. ch. 16 was passed. The act was passed in the undoubted interest of the church, and the rights of all living persons having vested interests in lands situated as those in question here are, were scrupulously preserved Hitherto the application of the act to the lands in question here has never been doubted, and I am of opinion that there is no room whatever for a doubt as to its application to them.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Frank Arnoldi.\nSolicitors for respondents (plaintiffs): Moss, Falconbridge & Barwick.\nSolicitors for the Rev.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. (On the application to set down the appeal for hearing Strong J. was present.)\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPetition of Right\u2014Intercolonial Railway Contract\u201431 V. c. 13 s. 18\u2014Certificate of engineer a condition precedent to recover money for extra work\u2014Forfeiture and penalty clauses\u2014Setting down Exchequer appeal.\nThe suppliants agreed, by contracts under seal, dated 25th May, 1870, with the Intercolonial Railway Commissioners (authorized by 31 V. c. 13) to build, construct and complete sections three and six of the railway for a lump sum, for section three of $462,444, and for section six of $456,946.43.\nThe contract provided inter alia, that it should be distinctly understood, intended, and agreed that the said lump sum should be the price of, and be held to be full compensation for, all works embraced in or contemplated by the said contract, or which might be required in virtue of any of its provisions or by-laws, and the contractors should not, upon any pretext whatever, be entitled, by reason of any change, alteration or addition made in or to such works, or in the said plans or specifications, or by reason of any of the exercise of any of the powers vested in the Governor in Council by the said Act intituled, \"An Act respecting the construction of the Intercolonial Railway,\" or in the commissioners or engineers by the said contract or by law, to claim or demand any further sum for extra work, or as damages or otherwise, the contractors thereby expressly waiving and abandoning all and every such claim or pretension, to all intents and purposes whatsoever, except as provided in the fourth section of the contract relating to alteration in the grade or line of location; and that the said contract and the said specification should be in all respects subject to the provisions of 31 Vic. ch. 13; that the works embraced in the contracts should be fully and entirely complete in every particular and given up under final certificates and to the satisfaction of the engineers on the 1st of July, 1871 (time being declared to be material and of the essence of the contract), and in default of such completion contractors should forfeit all right, claim, &c., to money due or percentage agreed to be retained, and to pay as liquidated damages $2,000 for each and every week for the time the work might remain uncompleted; that the commissioners upon giving seven clear days' notice, if the works were not progressing so as to ensure their completion within the time stipulated or in accordance with the contract, had power to take the works out of the hands of the contractors and complete the works at their expense; in such case the contractors were to forfeit all right to money due on the works and to the percentage returned.\nOn the 24th May, 1873, the contractors sent to the commissioners of the Intercolonial Railway a statement of claims showing there was due to them a large sum of money for extra work, and that until a satisfactory arrangement was arrived at they would be unable to proceed and complete the work.\nThereupon notices were served upon them, and the contracts were taken out of their hands and completed at the cost of the contractors by the Government.\nIn 1876 the contractors, by petition of right, claimed $523,000 for money bon\u00e2 fide paid, laid out and expended in and about the building and construction of said sections three and six, under the circumstances detailed in their petition.\nThe Crown denied the allegations of the petition, and pleaded that the suppliants were not entitled to any payment, except on the certificate of the engineer, and that the suppliants had been paid all that they obtained the engineer's certificate for, and in addition filed a counter claim for a sum of $159,982.57, as being due to the Crown under the terms of the contract, for moneys expended by the Commissioners over and above the bulk sums of the contract in completing said sections.\nThe case was tried in the Exchequer Court by J. T. Taschereau J., and he held that under the terms of the contract the only sums for which the suppliants might be entitled to relief were, 1st, $5,850 for interest upon and for the forbearance of divers large sums of money due and payable to them, and 2nd, $27,022.58, the value of plant and materials left with the government, but that these sums were forfeited under the terms of the clause three of the contract, and that no claim could be entered for extra work without the certificate of the engineer, and that the Crown were entitled to the sum of $159,953.51, as being the amount expended by the Crown to complete the work.\nAn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada having been taken by the suppliant, it was\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting, 1st. That by their contracts the suppliants had waived all claim for payment of extra work, 2nd. That the contractors not having previously obtained from, or been entitled to, a certificate from the Chief Engineer, as provided by 31 Vic. ch. 13 s. 18, for or on account of the money which they claimed, the petition of the suppliants was properly dismissed. 3rd. Under the terms of the contract, the work not having been completed within the time stipulated, or in accordance with the contract, the Commissioners had the power to take the contract out of the hands of the contractors and charge them with the extra cost of completing the same, but that in making up that amount the court below should have deducted the amount awarded for the value of the plant and materials taken over from the contracts by the Commissioners in June, 1873, viz: $27,022.58.\nThe circumstances under which this appeal was set down for hearing in 1883, although judgment in the Exchequer was delivered in 1877 appear in the judgment of Strong J. hereinafter given[1].\nAppeal from the judgment of J. T. Taschereau J., in the Exchequer Court of Canada. The petition of right, the pleadings, and facts are fully set out in the judgments hereinafter given. The suppliants were represented in the Exchequer Court by M. A. Hearn, Q.C., G. Irvine, Q.C., F. Langelier Q.C., and the respondent by A. McLennan Q.C., Bell Q.C., F. X. Lemieux, A. F. McIntyre and E. Lareau.\nThe following is the judgment of the Exchequer Court delivered by\nJ. T. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014\"The petitioners, Fran\u00e7ois Xavier Berlinguet, architect, and Charlotte Mailloux, his mother, associates and carrying on business under the name and firm of F. X. Berlinguet & Co., made on the 25th of May, 1870, with Her Majesty the Queen, represented by the commissioners appointed in virtue of the act of the parliament of Canada 31st Vic. ch. 13, two contracts for the building of sections Nos. 3 and 6 of the Intercolonial Railway, in consideration of the sum of $462,444 for section No. 3 and the sum of $456,946 for section No. 6. Section No. 3 is represented in the contract as having 24 miles in length or thereabout and section No. 6 as having a length of 21 miles.\n\"The petitioners having given up their contracts for the reasons mentioned in their petition, obtained from Her Majesty the permission to present this petition against the government of the Dominion of Canada. The indemnity they claim amounts to $523,000.\n\"Her Majesty, by and through her Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada, answered this demand by the pleadings which are contained in a document annexed to the present.\n\"The complaints of the petitioners are numerous, but they can be reduced to the following:\u2014\n\"1. That there were no valid contracts between Her Majesty and the petitioners; that if ever such contracts existed, they were annihilated or modified by the fact that the petitioners had no communication of the plans and profiles nor of the bill of works; and, also, that the schedule of prices agreed upon was increased by orders in council;\n\"2. That the petitioners were compelled by the engineers employed by the commissioners to execute works quite different from those mentioned in the contracts, much more costly and much above the stipulations of the contracts:\n\"3. That the monthly estimates of progress made by the engineers were not carefully made and did not represent the quantity of work executed on the two sections, and that consequently their monthly . payments were much below the amounts, to which they were entitled;\n\"4. That they complained frequently to the Minister of Public Works and to the Commissioners and that in consequence of these complaints, the Minister of Public Works promised to indemnify them if they continued the works, assuring them that the abandonment of their works would be a great damage to the government as well as to the petitioners themselves;\n\"5. Moreover the petitioners claimed the said sum of $523,000 under the form of general indebitatus assumpsit for money advanced, materials furnished, labour supplied, &c., &c.\n\"In reply to the various complaints contained in the petition, Her Majesty produced the defence which has just been read and which can be reduced to a general denegation in fact and in law, with certain special allegations which I will mention later on, when I will discuss the complaints of the petitioners.\n\"1. The first question raised in the pleadings of the petitioners, and which I consider a very important one, is that of the existence or modification of the contracts, and also that of knowing whether without these contracts the petitioners have any right whatever against Her Majesty. I do not see any difficulty in deciding these first points.\n\"2. In fact, without being formally admitted by the petitioners as the basis of their petition of right, these contracts are nevertheless mentioned several times in this same petition as having been signed by them and are not actually repudiated by them, but upon the principle that they have not signed the plans which they consider as forming an essential part of these contracts. They nevertheless signed these contracts on the 25th of May, 1870, in presence of witnesses; the principal petitioner, Mr. Berlinguet, examined under oath, acknowledges his signature and that of his mother. Besides this the petitioners, in the whole course of their correspondence with the commissioners and the executive, have never repudiated these contracts nor pretended to repudiate them; they have never complained that the plans had not been signed by them and the commissioners; on the contrary, reference is constantly made to these contracts and these plans in stating that more was exacted from them than these contracts and these plans required.\n\"3. In the receipts which they gave upon the increase of the monthly estimates, they acknowledged that what they received should not be considered as conferring upon them a right to a final amount exceeding the price mentioned in their contract. They accepted the orders in council to that, effect, and touched the amounts without any protest or reservation whatever. All the officers, from Mr. Brydges in his capacity of one of the commissioners of the road, to the Minister of Public Works, the Hon. Mr. Langevin, Mr. Fleming, Chief Engineer, and others, agree in maintaining that it is out of the question to say that the contracts were extinguished or even modified, and that on the contrary they were always considered by themselves and by the petitioners as in full force.\n\"4. It is quite possible that the plans were not signed by the petitioners, or even by the commissioners. But this would not be a cause of nullity of the contracts; for it has been proved to my satisfaction by the evidence of Mr. Fleming himself, that these plans were lithographed and copied in extenso in Book B. Mr. Berlinguet himself testified that he used these lithographed copies to prepare his tender and acted accordingly. All these copies were distributed on the line deposited at the various stations and consulted by the petitioners. They (the petitioners) admit by their tender that they had seen those plans, the contracts they signed expressly mentioned that they signed them. They were bound to sign them, and if through negligence, forgetfulness or any other motive on their part, they have not done so, they have no right to allege this fact as voiding the contract.\n\"5. It is established that the originals of these plans were accidentally destroyed by fire in the office of the engineer-in-chief at the same time as many other public documents. By not signing the plans, the petitioners committed an act of negligence which they covered by accepting the lithographed copies of these plans, by consulting these copies and by using them not only to prepare their tenders and obtain their contracts, but also to execute the greatest part of their contracts. They formally overlooked this slight irregularity and have no interest nor right to take advantage of their own negligence. I therefore consider the contracts as in full force.\n\"6. If these contracts have been annulled, by what law, I ask, could the petitioners expect to succeed in the present case? The Public Works Act, 31st Vic. ch. 12, could not help the petitioners, for section 7 of this statute declares that \"no deeds, contracts, documents or writings shall be deemed to be binding upon the department or shall be held to be acts of the said minister, unless signed and sealed by him or his deputy and countersigned by the secretary.\" The Act 31st Vic. ch. 13 secs. 16, 17 and 18 requires by a formal contract and enacts that no money shall be paid to any contractor until the chief engineer shall have certified that the work for or on account of which the same shall be claimed, has been duly executed nor until such certificate shall have been approved of by the Commissioners.\"\n\"7. The few conversations that the petitioners or their agents and bondsmen may have had with the Hon. Mr. Langevin, Minister of Public Works, cannot be interpreted as constituting new contracts or as modifying the contracts already existing, and especially as confering a right to a claim in the form of quant\u00f9m meruit. I will refer further on to these conversations with the Hon. Mr. Langevin. The circumstances that at a certain time the prices of certain works were increased by an order in council cannot be considered as a renunciation to the same modification, because this increase was only made to come temporarily to the help of the contractors and not at all with the view of changing or modifying the contracts, for it is said in this order in council dated the 28th July, 1871, that the total price of the contracts cannot be affected by this apparent increase.\n\"8. To give to this order in council the signification which the petitioners give to it, would be to place myself in manifest opposition to the Intercolonial Railway Act.\n\"And I say that the Governor in Council, even with the consent of the commissioners, could not increase the schedule of prices of the contracts and that any order in council in this direction would be illegal and unconstitutional. In fact the object of these two statutes, the Public Works Act and the Intercolonial Railway Act, is to prevent any useless expense, to protect government against any possible fraud and to prevent government from binding themselves in any other way than by the observance of certain formalities. Under such conditions only is the opening of the public chest permitted.\n\"In consequence, I consider that I must decide against the petitioners this first point of the annulling of the contracts or even of their mere modification.\n\"9. The second question to be considered is whether the contractors were victims of prejudice on the part of the engineers of their ill-will, and of the fact that these engineers exacted from them not only extra but even useless works, and much above the conditions and provisions of the contracts, and if the petitioners were retarded in their works by the refusal on the part of the government officers and engineers to furnish them the plans and specifications of certain works.\n\"According to the evidence given by Mr. Berlinguet himself, and of several witnesses heard on his behalf, it would at first sight appear that the petitioners have, at least in equity, great reasons for complaint if this evidence is not contradicted, and if the recourse of the petitioners is not taken away from them by the severe stipulations of the contracts and by the law which must govern these matters. I was at first so much impressed by the equitable appearance of the case of the petitioners, and by the peculiar conduct towards them of the district engineer and of several others, that I found in the conduct of the latter something shocking which required refutation and even explanation. I thought that there had been committed against the petitioners what the writers call a tortious breach of contract, even in a case where Her Majesty is interested as on a petition of right, such as refusing the plans, wilfully retarding the petitioners in the execution of the works, and exacting from them extravagant and useless works, and that was the reason why I refused to decide the case of the petitioners in as summary a manner as the defendant demanded by the motion of non suit presented to me nearly at the beginning of the case.\n\"10. I have not regretted the decision that I then gave, and do not regret it now. The authority which I followed in giving that decision is that which is to be found in the case of Churchward v. Queen[2], where Lord Cairns, representing Churchward in his petition of right, said: \"The cause of action alleged is the \"breach of the contract by refusing to employ, and is \"not a mere tort, and the distinction is clear that though \"for a tort, strictly so called, you cannot sue the crown, \"yet for a tortious breach of contract a petition of \"right may be maintained, and the cases of Tobin v. \"Regina[3] and Feather v. Regina[4] are consistent \"with this view. The distinction between tort and \"tort founded on contract has always been kept up.\" To these remarks Sir Alexander Cockburn, Chief Justice, added that with the exception of all that the Attorney-Greneral might say, the court did not wish any other argument on this question. Evidently Chief Justice Cockburn acknowledged by those words a distinction to exist between the action for tort and the action for unjust execution or violation of a contract.\n\"11 I have now to decide the question of the unjust exaction of works and the charges brought against all the engineers, and particularly against Mr. Marcus Smith, who, from 1870 to the month of March, 1872, was district engineer for the sections No. 3 and No. 6, which are the subject of this case.\nI have studied the present case with great care in its minutest details, and I confess that I had at first against Mr. Smith a strong prejudice which was equalled only by the deep sympathy which I felt for the petitioners. To-day I am happy to say that in my belief the charges of flagrant partiality, of ill-will and of personal interest brought against Mr. Smith are not founded, or rather, that these charges are greatly exaggerated.\nMarcus Smith is an old engineer, having in railway building an experience of thirty years, acquired in Europe, Africa and America. He is (according to an irreproachable witness, Mr. Fleming), and according to Mr. Brydges and several others, a clever engineer, enjoying the confidence of his chiefs and incapable of giving himself up to the base and shameful acts imputed to him. All the engineers heard in this case, and even those examined on behalf of the petitioners, agree on this point. He is represented as an irascible but good hearted man. \"His bark is worse than his bite,\" said one of the witnesses. Marcus Smith denied with an appearance of truth which I could not forget, the accusations of ill-will and partiality brought against him.\n\"12. He had to fulfil a duty involving an immense responsibility and on the conscientious execution of the works under his superintendence depended not only his character as an honest man and his reputation as a clever engineer, but perhaps the lives of several hundred persons, and being under this impression he probably thought it his duty to have the stipulations of the contract in question in this case carried out to the letter. He was bound to obey the orders of his chief, Mr. Fleming, with regard to the execution of all the works, and I have remarked and seen with pleasure in the voluminous correspondence which passed between him and his chief, Mr. Fleming, and his sub-engineers, the care which he took not only to foresee what work could be saved to the contractors, but also his desire to carry out the orders of his chief, Mr. Fleming, against whom, as I have already said, the petitioners have not a word of reproach. Mr. Fleming shows his appreciation of Mr. Marcus Smith, as follows: \"A zealous, \"faithful officer, as much so as any one in the service \"of the government. I am aware he endeavored to \"help the contractors as far as he legitimately could do. \"His integrity is beyond question.\" And at page 51 D of his evidence Mr. Fleming, speaking of the difficulties between the contractors and Marcus Smith, says in substance: \"He did not satisfy them, but he satisfied me. \"I found no reason of complaint against him. I am \"aware he endeavored to help them in many ways and \"was not trying to oppress, destroy or break down the \"contractors.\"\n\"13. It is established by the great majority of the engineers whether employed or not on these two sections, and by Mr. Brydges himself, that as a general rule contractors always complain that much more than what the specifications and contract require is demanded of them. There would be nothing wonderful that under the circumstances in which the contractors were placed during the first six months of their works with their expenditures exceeding their receipts, they should have thought that they were victims of the ill-will of Mr. Smith. Having no experience in such gigantic enterprises as that which they had just undertaken, they may have been blinded by fear when they began to realise their financial position and the losses they might incur on their contracts. Later on, on the 26th June, 1872, they sent to the commissioners a letter in which they completely made known their sad position I will by and by refer to this letter. \"14. But as their reproaches from the commencement, were particularly directed against Mr. Smith, I must say that although it is pretty clearly established that Mr Smith had but little sympathy for the contractors, nevertheless the misunderstanding between them is not to be attributed to this lack of sympathy, but to quite another cause. My impression, or I should rather say my conviction, is that the cause of the lack of sympathy displayed by Mr. Smith towards the contractors may be attributed to the well settled opinion which he had formed of the inability of Mr. Berlinguet to execute two contracts undertaken by a man without practical experience and at a very low price. As an experienced engineer, he saw at a glance the false position occupied by Mr. Berlinguet. And as these same contracts had already been abandoned, he easily foresaw the impossibility for Mr Berlinguet to do better than his predecessors; he may have feared that in his capacity of district engineer the fault might be attributed to him Hence these frequent declarations of Mr. Smith: \"The contracts will have to be re-let.\" If Mr. Smith exacted too much, the chief engineer and commissioners could and should have remedied this state of things.\n\"15. However, we see that Mr. Fleming and Mr. Brydges, who was more particularly charged with the superintendence, did not blame Mr. Smith, and agree in stating that the work was as well done as elsewhere, but is not better than on other sections; that in no way does the execution of the works by the contractors surpass what the contracts required, and Mr. Brydges states that several culverts are under what the specifications prescribed, and it is sufficient to say that the number of culverts was considerably reduced and modified, to the great profit of the contractors; to show that if Mr. Smith had wished to exercise an undue pressure on the contractors he only had to insist on the building of all these culverts. And we see in a letter of Mr. Fleming's, dated the 23rd May, 1870, and addressed to Mr. Smith, that the latter should not suppress one single culvert without having the written permission of Mr. Fleming.\n\"16. Mr. Fleming swears that the contractors gained $178,000 by divers reductions. These figures are eloquent and show that the engineers desired to favor the contractors. It is proved by Mr. Fleming, page 47 of his evidence, that he ordered the culverts to be built which were mentioned in the bill of works and which Mr. Smith had suppressed With regard to the culvert called \"Robinson's culvert,\" about which there was so much trouble, Mr. Fleming insisted several times that it should not be suppressed, although the appearances were against its necessity, and in speaking of this culvert Messrs. Fleming and Smith cited a precedent nearly similar, where the suppression of a culvert was the cause of a very lamentable accident. Mr. Fleming swears that he ordered this \"Robinson's culvert\" after mature reflection, and would never consent to its suppression, and gave as his reason for so doing that the nature and conformation of the ground, being a gentle slope, might, as in the case above cited, absorb all the water after a heavy storm and thereby produce a ground slide to the destruction of the road and the great danger of travellers.\nThe opinion of Mr. Fleming is to be accepted as law in this, as in any other similar case. There can be no appeal from his decision to the detriment of Her Majesty. The contractors submitted to this condition in their contract, where it is expressed in very clear words in section No. 2 of this contract.\nIf Mr. Fleming acted in bad faith, there might probably be a recourse against him, and against him alone. Having by their contract accepted Mr. Fleming as their judge in the last resort, they cannot, in the present case, invoke that bad faith as against Her Majesty.\nSuch a stipulation in a contract may appear at first sight exorbitant, but upon consideration it becomes evident that without such a stipulation for the building of a railway of the proportions and importance of the Intercolonial, it could never be brought to a conclusion, as it would be stopped every moment by a dispute of some sort or other. The authorities found in the books, and of which a list is annexed to the present judgment, leave no doubt on this point.\n\"17. Mr. Smith has also been reproached with having exacted from the contractors a finish of the work in the preparation of the stone for the foundation of certain culverts and other structures, of first class instead of second class, requiring that for these structures cut stone should be used instead of hammer dressed. I confess that on this head the evidence is conflicting and may, at first sight, appear unfavorable to the engineers. But the engineers have explained and proved that stone cutters often prefer to use the chisel rather than the hammer in dressing stone for second class masonry, and, also, that certain kinds of stone for second class masonry is dressed with more facility with the chisel than with the hammer, and that these modes of dressing stone may lead to believe that first class masonry was exacted when second class masonry only should have been required. All the engineers state that this reproach is not grounded and that they never required first instead of second class masonry, and that if, now it were possible to discover the difference, it is to the stone cutters employed by the contractors and under their exclusive control that this reproach should be made and not to the engineers. Mr. Fleming and the commissioners saw these works and neither considered nor declared them to exceed the quality or class of work required by the contract\u2014their opinion is law in this matter and must be accepted as such.\n\"18. Other subjects of reproach to the engineers have been their conduct in regard to the choice of the stone, the depth of the excavations necessary for the construction of arch-culverts and bridges, the inutility of break waters, the condemnation of the cement which the contractors desired to use, the building of fences, crossings and sideways; and a mass of more or less contradictory evidence is fyled in this case to prove how, in such cases, testimonial evidence can vary. On the one hand, we have seen the contractors with their friends and bondsmen supplying on these points testimony diametrically opposed to that of the engineers. A gainst the contractors, it may be said and believed that the immense interest they had in the final success of their case may have prejudiced and influenced them, while against the engineers it may be urged that they may have been influenced by the esprit de corps and the fear of being exposed to censure by their superiors. All things being equal, I must place more confidence in the testimony of educated men, having at heart the honor of their profession and, strictly speaking, no pecuniary interest at stake, than in that of the contractors and of their securities, however honorable these persons may be, for the most of them are interested, and it is well known that interest blinds the most honest and the most truthful.\n\"19. As regards the choice of the stone in the quarries, the depth of the excavations required for the masonry works of bridges and arch-culverts, the inutility of breakwaters, and the condemnation of the cement which the contractors desired to use. I must in preference believe the man of art, the engineer, whose noble profession has placed him in a position better to appreciate the requirements of the execution of such works as to the durability and security of the road. Now what do these engineers say? They say that all the complaints of the contractors on these heads are groundless, and, according to me, the engineers have completely justified their opinion. Moreover, the 2nd clause of the contract is there to remind us that the judgment of the commissioners and engineer-in-chief, having approved of the execution of the works, is final. It appeared to me that the choice of the stone, the depth of the excavations, the quality of hydraulic cement, the necessity for the breakwaters, are matters of the highest importance, and are subject to the exclusive control of the engineers in charge of the different sections, acting under the instructions of the chief engineer: any deviation from their instructions might be fatal to the safety of the road, give rise to accidents, considerably increase the expense of repairs and occasion injurious delays to traffic.\n\"20. I understand that an engineer, rather rough, relying on his superior position, would not easily condescend to a discussion in order to convince a contractor of the necessity of such or such a work mentioned in the bill of works by the engineer-in-chief; on the contrary, he would give his orders in a peremptory manner, without appeal and almost in military style; hence, most probably, arose in the minds of the contractors, the idea that Mr. Smith wished to rain them. I cannot deny that this man was overbearing and imperious in ordering even the most ordinary work, but there is a great distance between this and the guilty and well determined desire imputed to him of ruining poor contractors, and all because they were French-Canadians. There is no doubt that Mr. Smith was very hard towards the contractors as regards the building of the fences, cross-roads and avenues to the line. However, these fences, cross-roads and avenues were not beyond the specifications of the contract, since neither the engineer-in-chief nor the commissioners listened with favor to the complaints of the contractors on these points, but declared that none of the works done were in excess of the specifications, and that, on the contrary, there were culverts the backing of which was built of stone of a quality inferior to that mentioned in the specifications. It is true that on some other sections of the Intercolonial section-engineers tolerated things which Mr. Smith and his subordinates would not accept, as regards fences, cross-roads and avenues of the line; this excess of liberality may have been justified by extrinsic circumstances; they may have been blamed. Therefore it may be said that Mr. Smith had not to take for his guidance what was done elsewhere, but that having to superintend the execution of a written contract, for which he was responsible to his superiors, he was justifiable in having it executed to the letter.\n\"21. The contractors have laid great stress on the fact that in consequence of their complaints to the Commissioners one Mr. Schrieber was appointed to enquire into them, and that this gentleman, after visiting the line, made a report, in consequence of which an Order in Council was passed to increase the schedule of prices of certain works and an additional sum of $20,000 above the preceding estimates was paid to the contractors, who inferred from that that Mr. Schrieber had decided in their favor. But they did not then see Vr. Schrieber's report, and it was only lately, after the publication of the printed correspondence, that they discovered their error, and that Mr Schrieber explains the cause of the disappointment of the contractors with regard to the difference between the outlay they incurred and the monthly estimates to which they were entitled.\nHere is an extract from Mr. Schrieber's report, which is to be found at page 110 of the printed correspondence, dated the 11th March, 1871:\u2014\n\"The contractors appear to be willing to do what \"they can; but I fear unless they employ a thoroughly \"experienced agent to manage the details for them, and \"take general charge, they will plunge themselves into \"difficulty. The work in the quarries, it is only too \"transparent, is being carried on at an extravagant \"cost, many men who are cutting stone evidently \"having never before handled a tool, whereas others \"whom I know to be good for stone cutters are employed \"upon granite and vice vers\u00e2. Besides this, there \"are other irregularities, all tending to enhance the \"cost of the work. This certainly is not an indication \"of sound economical management. The certificates \"of the cost of stone cutting and building masonry \"upon these sections hereto attached are rather startling \"documents and tend to explain in some measure \"how it is the expenditure is so far in excess of the \"engineers' monthly certificates. Unless all this is \"changed I fear it would be vain to hope for the contracts \"being carried through satisfactorily. There is \"no margin in the price to allow for this management. \"It is only by the most stringent economy the work \"could be carried out. The contractors by stating they \"can complete the work in time expose their want of \"knowledge of such works, and, I think, lay themselves \"open to the charge of want of experience in such \"works. I, however, believe them to be thoroughly \"honest in their intentions and ready to do all in their \"power to complete the contracts; but, I repeat, they \"need to employ a thoroughly competent honest man \"as agent; one who is prepared to devote his whole \"time and attention to their interest and conduct the \"work with economy. It is a large piece of work, \"requiring a man of considerable capacity to manage \"it.\"\nThe same opinions are again expressed by Mr. Schrieber in his letter of the 23rd of March, 1871, No. 255 of the printed correspondence, where he foresees that the contractors having neglected their works and masonry, will soon be embarrassed and that years must still elapse before they can complete their contracts.\n\"22. As can be seen, this report explains to a great extent the losses suffered and the expenses incurred by the contractors during the short period of six months, dating from the commencement of the works. If this report was not immediately communicated to the contractors, I say that it was a very regrettable omission; but it is hardly credible that the Commissioners did not do so. However, we see that after this report the contractors received pretty considerable sums without the formality of the certificate of the chief engineer, and these sums were over and above the monthly estimates.\n\"23. The contractors have also reproached the engineers with having compelled them three successive times to lay deeper foundations for a considerable and costly structure destined to support an immense weight. They make this reproach as if the engineer charged with the superintendence of the building of that structure could have at first sight finally determined the necessary depth. Common sense teaches that it is only by degrees and by feeling his way that the engineer can arrive at a degree of certainty with regard to the sufficiency of the depth of the foundations. I even say that if he had at first been mistaken, and believed that he had found a sufficient foundation and ordered the building of the structure on such foundation, he had a right to set his first decision aside, order the works done to be removed and the contractors to increase the depth. The stipulations of the contract justify this view and also justify the engineers. I may even say that the engineers were obliged to act in this manner if they were convinced that the depth was not sufficient. I find nothing in the evidence to induce me to say that the engineers acted in bad faith in this case. As professional men and as engineers, they had a right to act in this way with regard to such important structures. I say the same with regard to breakwaters, the building of which at some places, is by some of the witnesses considered as to be perfectly useless, and as putting the contractors to very great expense.\n\"24. With regard to the cement which the contractors desired to use for their works, a long, very contradictory, and for the court, a tolerably embarrassing investigation took place. On several works, the contractors were obliged to use a great quantity of hydraulic cement, an article which fills an important place in the construction of solid foundations destined to bear an immense weight. On its good or bad quality depends the security of those structures. Section 37 of the stipulations of the contract requires that this cement shall be \"fresh ground, of the best brand, and must be \"delivered on the ground and kept, till used, in good \"order. Before being used, satisfactory proof must be \"afforded the engineer of its hydraulic properties, as \"no inferior cement will be allowed.\" The contractors submitted to all these conditions, and according to the contracts, the opinion of the engineers was to settle all difficulties between the contractors and the government with regard to the quality of the cement and to its use. Notwithstanding the conflict of evidence, I do not see that the engineers have in this regard committed any evident injustice. On one occasion the order, or rather the advice, given by the engineer to throw into the water a great number of barrels of this cement, appeared to me rather arbitrary till I had heard the explanations of the defendant, tending to show that after trying several barrels of this cement the engineers were convinced of its bad quality and that notwithstanding the order not to use it, the contractors persisted in doing so, and that in consequence of this, in order to avoid any difficulty, it was suggested to them to throw away this cement, which was already old, having been brought to the spot by the former contractors, and that as an easy way to do it, these barrels of cement were thrown into the water by the contractors themselves. Let us remark that the cement so thrown into the water was not the property of the petitioners, but the property of their predecessors, who had given up their contract. In fact this cement might also be considered as the property of the government according to the stipulations of the contract.\nThe contractors desired to use this cement and purchase it at a cheap price and the government would have sold it, had it not been dangerous to use it. Strictly speaking, the petitioners did of their own accord follow the advice or order to throw away this cement. Nothing obliged them to cast it into the water; they could have put it outside of the line of neutral ground, with the right of using it later on, one way or another. By destroying it as they did, they justified the opinion which the engineers had formed of its bad quality It is proved that it is better not to use hydraulic cement at all than to use such cement of bad quality.\n25 The petitioners have not forgotten to allege that they did extra works; but, besides the fact that I do not consider these extras as proved, there is against them on this point an insuperable obstacle found in sections 4 and 9 of the contract, which declare expressly that no extra shall be admitted in their favor, unless it was demanded in writing and certified and approved by the chief engineer: and there is no such certificate.\nLegally they cannot claim these extras. They have expressly and unconditionally renounced them. How could I come to their rescue without placing myself in direct opposition to the law? But if the petitioners have not forgotten to put forward and claim extras, they have omitted to acknowledge the considerable reduction made in their works by the engineers, such as the suppression of culverts, the substitution of iron tubes for culverts, of wood for iron in the great masses of masonry, and it has been proved that these charges and suppressions were a cause of considerable gain to the contractors, who doubtless forgot these favorable circumstances.\nThe petitioners also forget to acknowledge that the few changes which they made in the height of the grades were compensated by the rock excavations which they would have been obliged to make to maintain the level of the road and that this apparent increase was evidently all to their advantage. Moreover the contract declares that to have a right to claim these extras, the petitioners must obtain, for this end, the certificate of the chief engineer; the engineer would not grant this certificate and the conclusion is that the petitioners had no right to such extras, at least legally speaking.\n\"26. According to the evidence given by Mr. Fleming, engineer-in-chief, the only cases in which the works required of the petitioners exceeded the quantities determined are those of the bridges on the Miramichi and Restigouche rivers; he says that every where else the quantities determined and required to be executed really exceeded what was done, and this was a great benefit for the contractors, as Mr. Fleming says page 540 of his evidence: \"We wanted to err on the right side, in favor of the contractors.\" The petitioners complained of having been delayed in their works in consequence of the engineers not supplying them with the plans of the various constructions. But Mr. Fleming and all the other engineers state that the general plans which the petitioners had to consult, and were at liberty to consult every day, were sufficient for the generality of cases, and that the plans only of structures requiring strong and deep foundations did not exist, and that in fact these latter plans should be prepared only after the excavations have been completed and the nature of the structure well determined, and that the engineer is satisfied when the contractors have materials in sufficient quantity to commence the structure. This is strictly enforced and is well established by several engineers, and it appears to me that there is much in this pretention of the engineers.\n\"27. I now come to the serious reproaches made by the petitioners against Mr. Smith, of having, in a conversation with Captain Armstrong and in another with Mr. John Home, behaved himself in a most singular manner, in a way calculated to throw much discredit on his own honor and honesty. According to Captain Armstrong, Mr. Smith told him in a conversation regarding the small amount of the monthly payments received by the contractors: They got all they deserved or were entitled to.\" Upon Mr. Armstrong remarking to him (Smith) that it was very hard for the contractors to receive barely enough to pay their men, Smith replied: \"I sent in a contract for this same section for my friends \"in England, and if they had got it, they would have \"had plenty of funds to carry on the business without \"drawing on the government until it was finished.\" And Mr. Smith is said to have added: \"These d\u2014\u2014d \"little Canadians are the cause of my not getting it\" (the contract). Mr, Armstrong says that Mr. Smith did not mention to him the names of his friends. Mr. Armstrong asked him besides: \"How could you have acted as engineer?\" Smith replied: \"I should have \"resigned my situation and gone on with the works.\"\nAccording to Mr. John Home, Mr. Smith addressed the following words to him, with regard to the advice he (Smith) gave to the petitioners of employing one Davey as superintendent: \"If Davey is here, it is just \"as easy for him to save you a half million dollars as 'anything at all and without any disparagement to the \"government. The government will not have anything \"to find fault with the road and you will get quit of the \"Frenchmen that don't know anything at all about \"building the road.\" He said \"if they (Berlinguet) \"want to get the credit of the work, let them go to salt \"water and they would have the credit of the work, but \"let them keep their tongue quiet. And he said: \"I \"will not sell myself to the Frenchmen.\"\nIt is only just to say that Mr. Smith denied energetically having used such words as these. It is also certain, as far as I can recollect the evidence, that no tender for these sections was sent out from England. But the accusation is serious, and it appears singular to me that Mr. Smith should have thus, deliberately, expressed such opinions, especially in presence of witnesses who were devoted friends of the contractors and employed by them.\n\"28. Moreover, he must have foreseen that his superiors would ask him for an explanation of his conduct and of his giving up the position of district engineer to take a contract. To suppose that this ignominious conduct on the part of Mr. Smith is possible, we must believe that he would have given up a good reputation of thirty years' standing and a lucrative situation in order to run the risk of certain ruin by such contracts. Such conduct can hardly be reconciled with the highly honorable character which the engineers, Messrs Fleming, Brydges, Grant and other witnesses have given him. \"His honesty is beyond doubt,\" said Mr. Fleming. The idea that an engineer could gain half a million dollars out of such an enterprise seems to me rather exaggerated. Mr. Smith, it is true, may be greatly interested in denying such accusations which affect his moral character if they are well founded. On the other hand, the circumstances which I had occasion to observe in this case led me to believe that Mr. Armstrong, who is a very old man, and Mr. Home may have been completely mistaken as to the bearing of the above mentioned conversations. The repeated reading of their evidence with attention convinces me that there was misunderstanding, although the honorable character of the witnesses is acknowledged.\n\"29. But supposing these conversations were reported verbatim by the witnesses, what do they prove? Undoubtedly they prove that Smith had no sympathy for the contractors; that the contractors had neither the experience nor the aptitude for carrying out this enterprise; that they ruined themselves on it; that an intelligent manager like Mr. Davey could alone have rescued them from their difficulty.\nIn spite of his ill-will, Mr. Smith gave a good advice to the contractors, that of employing Mr. Davey as superintendent and as the only one capable of saving them from shipwreck. Such was the opinion of Mr. Schrieber, which we have read a moment ago, and of more than twenty witnesses heard in the case There is a wide difference between lack of sympathy and a fixed determination to ruin the contractors. The evidence proves that Mr. Berlinguet and Mr. Smith were on the best and most intimate terms; they travelled together, met to spend the night together, exchanged courtesies, joked and laughed pretty frequently, it is true sometimes at Mr. Berlinguet's expense in regard to his capacity and experience in building railways, which Mr. Smith denied even in the presence of Mr. Berlinguet Mr. Bertrand, Mr. Berlinguet's partner, used to join in those jokes, saying that he, Bertrand built churches and that Berlinguet built the occupants thereof, that is to say the statues of saints which were to adorn the churches.\n\"30. The long correspondence between Mr. Smith and the chief engineer, Mr. Fleming, and other engineers, shows a desire to favor the contractors, instead of an intention of ruining them. I say the same of Mr Bell, who, in 1872, succeeded Mr. Smith as district engineer. I sincerely believe that the accusations of ill-will for the contractors on the part of Mr. Smith is groundless, except, as I have already remarked, that he may have been prejudiced against Mr. Berlinguet on account of his (Berlinguet's) absolute want of experience and of the conviction he had of Mr. Berlinguet's inability to carry out his contract.\nThe proof convinces me that Mr. Smith and his colleagues conceded many things to the contractors where they could do so without injuring the road, and that they exacted \"the pound of flesh,\" as one of the witnesses said, that is the full and integral execution of the works, where they thought this full execution necessary. Moreover, they had to superintend the execution of a detailed contract; they were under a chief and a superintendent in the person of Mr. Fleming, chief engineer, and under as many masters as there were commissioners, who were four in number. All these high and learned authorities approved the conduct of Mr. Smith, and I would not dare to say that they acted wrongly, legally speaking.\n\"31 The engineers have been reproached with having obliged the contractors, without necessity and at considerable cost, to macadamise the crossings and sideways of the road. This is denied by the engineers in the most positive manner. The engineer-in-chief did not blame this use of broken stone for crossings if, at all events, it is true that the contractors were compelled to macadamize those crossings, and from this I infer: either that the engineers did not require these roads to be macadamised, or that it was rendered necessary, on account of the nature of the ground, for the solidity of the road, and in this case there might be no recourse against the government, unless the work was certified by the chief engineer.\nThe complaints which the contractors thought proper to prefer to the commissioners have all been considered and decided by the latter, according to the evidence given by Mr. Brydges, and redress was given when the complaints were well founded. Properly speaking, it was only about the month of March, 1872, that the contractors complained with bitterness of Mr. Smith, and it was in consequence of these complaints that the commissioners thought fit to recall Mr. Smith and replace him by Mr. Bell.\nHaving succeeded according to their wishes in obtaining the removal of Mr. Smith as district engineer, the contractors naturally inferred from this that the commissioners were disposed to render them justice, that their complaints were well founded, and that under an engineer more favorably disposed toward them their position and finances would be much improved in the form of monthly estimates. Let us remark, with regard to the recall of Mr. Smith, that on leaving he was promoted to a higher position on the Pacific Railway, with an increase of salary, a position which was inferior only to that of Mr. Fleming, the chief engineer. Therefore, if this was intended to cast blame on Mr. Smith and to punish him for his conduct towards the petitioners, I have reason to believe that such a punishment was not very hard upon him. The Hon. Mr. Langevin said he did not understand from the Commissioners that they had any reproach to make against him.\n\"32. Mr. Smith having been replaced the contractors continued their works with new vigor However, three months after, that is on the 26th of June, 1872, they addressed to the Commissioners a long memorial, which is found under No. 607 of printed documents, in which they describe in lugubrious language their financial position\u2014I might almost say their bankruptcy and incapacity of continuing their works without a grant or increase of their monthly payments These must have been heard, for over and above their monthly estimates they received for the months of August and September, 1872, on account of sections 3 and 6, a sum of $65,000.\nThere is under No. 640 of printed correspondence a letter from the bondsmen of the contractors, Messrs. Glover & Fry and Dunn & Home, in which they complain of the feebleness of their estimates as compared to the quantity of works which they pretended to have considerably increased. Nevertheless, Mr. Smith had left the road over three months, and in order to give an appearance of reason to the contractors regarding this new deficit, we would have to suppose that all the engineers conspired against the contractors in making false returns and diminishing their monthly estimates. In consequence of this letter and of the complaints of the petitioners, an engineer (Mr. Fitzgerald) employed by the government, after visiting the works made, on the 17th of August, 1872, a report intended to establish the quantities of work done. According to this report, in or about August, 1872, there remained only about 34 per cent. of the work to be done, and deducting in favor of the contractors the value of their materials, the work done could be estimated at 75 per cent The perusal of the evidence of Mr. Fitzgerald did not at all convince me of the exactness of his calculations. He made this report at the pressing solicitation of the government, who desired to come to the assistance of the contractors, and the consequence of this report was, 1st. An increase of his salary by the government; 2nd. The payment of a sum of $400 or $500 made to him by the contractors for his report.\n\"33. This engineer is thus paid not only by government who employed him, but also by the contractors, who were not obliged to pay him. There seems to be something irregular in this I think that by overhauling the accounts to date of August, 1872, and by comparing the receipts of the contractors with their estimates, it would be seen that even if there remained only 25 per cent. of the works to be executed, the contractors had already received over and above their monthly estimates. However the contractors, upon the calculations of Mr. Fitzgerald, demanded, on the 4th of September, 1872, a grant of $150,000. The government allowed them only $34,545 for section No. 3, $19,342 for section No. 6 and $42,689 for sections 9 and 10 which are not in question in the present case. These sums were granted upon the report of Mr. Fitzgerald, and despite of the fact that the government might and should have kept back $137,000 at least for the 15 per cent. mentioned in the contract. It is then impossible to admit that the contractors were ill-treated by the commissioners or by the government. On the contrary, they had all the sympathies of both, if I am to judge: 1o. By documents 97 and 98 to which I will refer in a moment and 2o. by the $160,000, which were paid to the contractors in 1871 and 1872 without the certificate of the chief engineer, Mr. Fleming, which was strictly required in virtue of the Intercolonial Railway Act.\n\"34. The petitioners have made an infinity of complaints against the engineers. It would be tiresome to enumerate them; there would be no end to the task. I have carefully examined these complaints, and I find that with very few exceptions, the proof of the petitioners was refuted by the proof made on the part of Her Majesty. But I state it with regret, the contract constitutes the law, the contractors submitted to all its clauses, they renounced every claim for extras, and all damages, they agreed to submit without appeal to all decisions of the commissioners and of the chief engineer, and it is my imperative duty not to make new contracts for the petitioners, but to see that those are executed which they signed, however severe their terms may be. For them as well as for me, dura lex, sed lex.\n\"35. I must not overlook one of the greatest grievances put forward by the petitioners, that is the reproach which they make to the government of Her Majesty with regard to the insufficiency of the quantities and the nature of the works to be executed. This grievance may be partially founded in fact, but it has no foundation in law. For if I am to believe the testimony of Mr. Fleming the quantities mentioned in the bill of works were liberally calculated and this was in the interest of contractors who were to have the benefit of the excess, and it was proved to my satisfaction that with the exception of the works at the Ristigouche and Miramichi rivers, where the works actually executed exceeded the quantities given, which was to the great benefit of the contractors. At law, the contractors cannot demand the value of this excess; they in advance renounced all claims of such a nature and nowhere in the contracts and stipulations do I find on the part of the commissioners any stipulation which would warrant such a claim; on the contrary, we find a formal denial of the right to any such extras.\nI interpret these contracts as having to be executed for a block sum by the contractors, who were to benefit when the quantities should exceed the work and suffer from excess of the work without right to indemnify, should the work exceed the quantities. In order to justify this demand for indemnity on the part of the contractors, it would be necessary to find in the contract an express guarantee of the quantities. The plans, bill of works and specifications are there to attest that the government could and should guarantee no quantities, &c., &c.; they mention that the calculations are merely approximative and without guarantee. All this should have at first put the contractors on their guard. If they were mistaken they were willingly mistaken, and to them we can apply the maxim: Volenti non fit injuria.\n\"36 They must therefore blame themselves, and themselves alone, for the consequence arising from a surplus of quantities of the works to be executed, if such surplus did really exist, which I do not believe. Admitting, for a moment, that the contractors had to execute much more work than the bill of works mentioned and that they suffered damages on account of this, I must declare that I do not find any basis to estimate such damages. On this point the proof is vague and even of no value whatever. Supposing, moreover, that the proof was clear, all indemnity should be refused to the contractors in consequence of the clauses so onerous and so strict of the contract by which they (the contractors) renounced all damages, all extras, and even the balance due to them, if they gave up their contract or did not complete it in the time prescribed. These stipulations are excessively severe; they are the law governing the parties thereto, who submitted to them with their eyes open. Dura lex, sed Lex, as I said above. Nevertheless, in the course of my deliberations the following question often presented itself to me:\u2014\n\"37. \"How is it that the petitioners have suffered so great a loss as they tell us they have experienced by the execution of their contract?\" and I came to the conclusion that the record of the case explains this result:\nI. The petitioners had no practical experience to guide them in their tenders to obtain the contracts, and subsequently in the execution of the works. One of the petitioners is a respectable lady having not the slightest knowledge of the building of a railway; the other, Mr. F. X. Berlinguet, is undoubtedly a man of great intelligence, of physical and mental activity, altogether exceptional, indefatigable, but without theoretical or practical experience of the construction of works so much out of his ordinary line.\n\"38. II. Before tendering Mr. Berlinguet had never been on the line, on the spot where the railway which he tendered was to be built, and had he visited the line he would have acquired only superficial knowledge of the works, as the road was covered with snow and the time for sending in his tender was comparatively very short. Mr. Fleming, page 9 D of his evidence, clearly explains that the shortness of the time prescribed for sending in the tenders deprived the parties who made them of any hope of reasonable calculations, and as to the possibility of completing the works in the time prescribed by the contracts, he says: \"I think it ought \"not to have been attempted. I am not prepared to \"say it was impossible to do it, but it would have \"required a lavish expenditure.\" Wherefore it was imprudent on the part of Mr. Berlinguet to have undertaken such contracts on information so very uncertain. He, however, ran the risk, and the consequence is probably the present contestation.\n\"39. III. The petitioners themselves have taken the trouble to throw light on the causes of their want of success in the execution of their contract through their letter dated the 26th June, 1872 (Nos. 605, 607 of Printed Correspondence), which letter they addressed to the commissioners, and in which they attributed their losses: 1st. To an increase of wages, which in some cases amounted to 50 per cent., and this in consequence of the great demand for workmen in the United States and in Canada, which is an important item when we consider that the contractors had sometimes to employ and pay 2,500 men. 2nd. They attribute their losses, besides this increase of wages, to the inferiority of local workmen, who were inefficient and not accustomed to such works; they represent that these workmen left their work when the time for farming came round, and this at the time when the petitioners were in the greatest need of them, thereby increasing the expenditure by obliging the contractors to keep in continual employ and pay a larger number of workmen. 3rd. They attribute their losses to the fact that not finding skilful workmen in the country, they were obliged to import them at a great cost from without the province, and to pay for their passage hither; and that in many cases these workmen, whose passages they had paid, refused to work after their arrival.\nIV. They attribute their losses to great expenditure incurred on account of shed building and other expenditures on which they were obliged to pay interest.\nV. They attribute their great expenditure to the difficulty they had in finding quarries of good stone, for the great depth of the excavations required to lay the foundations of heavy structures.\nVI. They say that they incurred a heavy loss in consequence of the failure of the crop in 1870, on the purchase of hay and grain required for their horses, which obliged them to import these articles from distances varying from 300 to 500 miles.\nVII. They say that on account of the distance of the locality and want of easy communications, they were obliged to lay in a stock of provisions sometimes 3 or 8 months in advance, which involved a great loss of interest.\nVIII. In this letter they acknowledge that having undertaken the contract during the winter season, they had no opportunity of examining the locality. Mr. Brydges, a man of great practical experience, says: \"The works were carried on extravagantly and that \"necessarily would account to a large extent for their \"getting behind.\" Vide pages 201, 202 of his evidence. Other witnesses speak in plain words of the indolence, laziness and negligence of the foremen employed by the contractors. Walking bosses had to overlook tracts too extensive to enable them to do so efficiently, although they were competent men.\n\"40. We therefore have the important and irrefutable acknowledgment on the part of the petitioners that they suffered heavy losses for the reasons mentioned above and which might alone account for their want of success. It is true that the petitioners also impute their losses to the engineers and masonry inspectors, who, according to the pretentions of the former, exacted first class masonry from the contractors who were only bound to supply second class masonry. Well, we have seen that the chief engineer, the commissioners, a district and division engineers positively denied these ascertions, and I believe, gave sufficient explanation on this point. In virtue of his contract, Mr. Berlinguet was. under heavy penalties, bound to complete his works and deliver them on the 1st of July, 1871. It is proved by Mr. Fleming that it was impossible to do so within the time prescribed without incurring a lavish expenditure. By the way, let us remark that Mr. Fleming had prepared for the information of the government, as his duty required him to do, an estimate of the probable minimum and maximum cost of 3 and 6. The minimum cost was $530,000 for section No. 3 and $493,666 for section No. 6, making a total of $1,023,666, and notwithstanding this, the tenders of the petitioners for these two sections amounted in the aggregate only to $819,390, so that the amount of their tenders was by $104,000 lower than the sum for which the chief engineer believed that the work could be executed, and we also see that the maximum cost was estimated at $1,320,000. I think these figures show the imprudence of the petitioners and account to a large extent for their failure. The petitioners, having no experience, it is true, but desiring to complete their contracts, incurred extraordinary expense and this also would account for their stoppage.\nIt appears to me that Mr. Berlinguet showed an unlimited want of foresight or rather very great ignorance of the cost and difficulty attending the building of a railway.\n\"41. I notice in document 606 the fact that the contractors relied much on the good will and sympathy of the government, and I believe that there is evident proof that neither the one nor the other was withheld from them, for, as we have already seen, upon the report of Mr. Schrieber, which was not at all favorable to the contractors, they succeeded in obtaining a sum of $160,400 without the certificate of the engineer, which was strictly required by the Intercolonial Railway Act. However Mr. Brydges and Mr. Fleming state that at the time of the abandonment of their contracts, the contractors had already received much more than the value of the works which they had executed, and this, notwithstanding the fact of a reduction of $178,000 in their favor, in all the works on sections 3 and 6, less an increase, however, on some bridges and culverts at Miramich and Restigouche rivers.\nNow it is time to enquire to what extent and in what manner the petitioners have proved the amount of their expenditure to the date of the abandonment of their contracts. According to statements produced with their petition of right, the contractors show an expenditure for works on section No. 3 of a sum of $609,482.51, and on section No. 6 $596,022.68, making an aggregate of $1,205,565.14 expended, over and above $88,133.11 which they claim as due to them for interest on the difference between the sums which they monthly received and those which they would have had a right to get if the monthly estimates had been sufficient. As the contracts taken together were to have brought into the petitioners only $919,300. 23, and as it has cost the government the sum of $269,082.60 to complete these contracts, it becomes interesting to know how the petitioners have proved their actual outlay.\n\"42. I must say that regarding the proof from a legal point of view, and without taking into consideration the respectability of the persons examined as witnesses to prove the correctness of these expenditures, the proof of these accounts would be insufficient to warrant me in accepting them as establishing the enormous amounts to which they figure up. This proof is vague and too general; the accounts for the time of workmen employed on the road are proved in block, if I may say so, without the precision required in such cases, particularly with regard to such a large amount. It appears to me that the petitioners should have brought before the court the persons who were in direct contact with the workmen in order to verify the correctness of the accounts and of the payments. The foreman should have been examined. Mr. Blumhart and Mr. Turner could not alone complete the proof. Both of them had to rely too much on the reports of sub-officers and other interested parties who, without any inclination to be dishonest, may have said in presence of Messrs. Blumhart and Turner, what they would not have dared to testify under oath before a court of justice. In a word, the proof is insufficient; legally speaking, it lacks several important connections to deserve such a degree of credibility as the law requires\n\"43. The question here presents itself as to whether the petitioners might not have a right against the Government of Her Majesty in consequence of the numerous promises which, they say, were made to them by the Hon. Mr. Langevin, Minister of Public Works for the Dominion of Canada, in 1871 and 1872. The contractors and their bondsmen, their endorsers and some of their friends, swore before me that in several interviews with Mr. Langevin with regard to their financial embarrassment and their intention of giving up the contracts, Mr. Langevin \"had told them not to give up \"their contracts; that the government did not intend \"to build the Intercolonial at the expense of private \"parties, and that if they carried on the contract to \"completion they would be eventually indemnified for \"their losses.\" Mr. Ross, the advancer to the contractors, swore that \"Mr. Langevin told him that he could \"in all security continue his advances and that he would \"be refunded.\" Messrs Dunn and Home, bondsmen for the contractors, swore the same thing. Mr. L. H. Huot swore that Mr. Langevin told him the same thing, viz.: \"To tell the contractors not to give up their contracts, \"that sooner or later their claims would be settled \"one way or the other by government.\" Mr. Langevin, examined as witness, swore the contrary and merely admitted to have told them that \"it was their \"interest to complete their contracts, which would have \"resulted in causing no delay in the completion of the \"road and would better the chances of the contractors \"to have their claims favorably considered and settled \"by government.\" He denies having used the words cited by the above witnesses. He was right; he would have gravely compromised himself as a member of the government and a public man, and he says that he could not bind the government. We therefore see the immense difference existing between the meaning of Mr. Langevin's expressions and that of the expressions of the above named witnesses In this case, as in all the cases where the witness is interested, his mind may be influenced by interest and induce him to attach to conversations a meaning far different from that which they were intended to bear by him who uttered them.\n\"44. But this question is quite useless at present. Mr. Langevin could not thus pledge the government, he formally declared it, and I confess that one would vainly seek in the Intercolonial Railway Act for legal means to indemnify the petitioners, although their claims might be equitable. This contradiction between the evidence of Mr. Langevin and that of the petitioners, of their advancers and bondsmen, clearly establishes what I said a moment ago about the uncertainty of the testimony of men. Here is a number of educated persons, deservedly enjoying a high reputation for respectability, swearing in a manner diametrically opposed to each other as to the result of their conversations. This can also explain the contradictions which I remark in this case with regard to what the engineer, Mr. Marcus Smith, is alleged to have said to Messrs. Berlinguet Home, Armstrong and others. We must accept with a certain degree of caution the evidence of an interested party.\n\"45. There is one point in the case on which the petitioners should succeed: It is that concerning the manner in which the engineers made their monthly estimates during the first four months following the beginning of the works, in 1870, as established by documents 97 and 98 produced with the official correspondence concerning the construction of the Intercolonial. According to this correspondence and the order in council of the 20th September, 1870, which settled the question, it would appear that the engineers committed errors resulting in a loss to the contractors, for interest, of $5,850.90 or thereabouts. In order to appreciate correctly the intention of the commissioners in their communication to the Privy Council (document 97) and the meaning and signification of the report of the Privy Council, I cite them verbatim, and I believe, although the chief engineer was not of the opinion of the Privy Council and of the commissioners on this point, that the engineers made grave errors in this occasion and that this sum of $5,850.90 should be credited to the petitioners in the final result of the case.\nI must say that if the contractors suffered damages to this amount, which I allow them, they were well indemnified, if, as I have reason to believe, the report which I just read was followed to the letter. I also believe that in law and equity they should be credited with another sum of $27,023, representing the value of materials, (plant, &c.,) which they transferred to government when they gave up their contract in May, 1873. Deducting these sums from that of $159,988 which government paid to the contractors over and above their contract price, and as I see nothing in the proof to warrant me in believing that government deducted these $32,872.23 in making up that balance of $159,882, it follows that the real balance due to Her Majesty would be $127,110.\n\"46. If Her Majesty, in her answer to the petition of right, had demanded the application and the benefit of the section 3 of the contracts which stipulates a penalty of $2,000 per week, payable by the contractors from the 1st of July, 1871, to the day on which they gave up their contracts, I should condemn the petitioners to pay this penalty to Her Majesty under the form of liquidated damages, which penalty would amount to $216,000 for the 108 weeks daring which the contractors were in default.\"\nBut Her Majesty has not, by her written factum, demanded the execution of so severe a stipulation, but only a condemnation for $150,982.57 as a surplus paid by the commissioners to the contractors on their contracts and not at all under the form of penalty or damages. I think I would be adjudging ultra petita if I inflicted the penalty under the form of liquidated damages.\"\n\"On the other hand, if Her Majesty also demanded the execution of this part of the section of the contracts which stipulates that in case of giving up their contracts, the contractors would forfeit all right to any sum, percentage, or other moneys to which they would be entitled in virtue of these contracts, I should deduct these $32,872.23 which I am disposed to award them, and in this case I would give judgment in favor of Her Majesty for the sum of $159,982.54 with costs, in any event, against the petitioners.\"\n\"I shall wait for the advice of the Attorney General of Her Majesty for the dominion of Canada and for this purpose this case is adjourned to the 24th of October instant.\"\nThe formal judgment was as follows:\u2014 The twenty-fourth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven.\"\n\"This court having heard the evidence and the pleadings of parties by their counsel, doth declare.\"\n\"That the said F. Xavier Berlinguet and Marie Charlotte Mailloux are entitled to the sum of five thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars and ninety cents, ($5,850.90) for interest upon and for the forbearance of divers large sums of money due and payable by Her Majesty's government to them the suppliants, and further to the sum of twenty-seven thousand twenty-two dollars and thirty-five cents ($27,022.35), for the value of certain materials to them belonging, and by them left to Her Majesty's government.\"\n\"But inasmuch as by section three of the contracts, the suppliants, having abandoned their said contracts, forfeit all right and claim to these two amounts, to wit, the total sum of thirty-two thousand eight hundred and seventy-three dollars and twenty-five cents, ($32,873.25) the said sum of thirty-two thousand eight hundred and seventy-three dollars and twenty-five cents is hereby declared forfeited;\"\n\"And this court doth further order and adjudge that the said suppliants do pay to Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada the sum of one hundred and fifty-nine thousand, nine hundred and eighty-two dollars and fifty-seven cents ($159,982.57), as money overpaid to the suppliants by Her Majesty's government at the time of their abandoning their contracts;\"\n\"And this court doth moreover order and adjudge that the said suppliants do pay to Her Majesty's government of the Dominion of Canada the costs of the present suit.\n(Signed) Napoleon Legendre\nActing Registrar Court of Exchequer.\"\nFrom this judgment the suppliants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, but no steps were taken by either parties to bring on the appeal until February, 1883, when an application was made to the full court on behalf of the appellants for an order directing the Registrar to set down for hearing the appeal the next session of the court.\nUpon this application the following judgment was delivered by Strong J. on behalf of the court, on the 1st May, 1883, Sir W. J. Ritchie C J. dissenting.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an application for a direction to the Registrar to set down for hearing an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court on a petition of right. This petition of right was a Quebec case and the judgment on it was pronounced at Quebec, where the cause was heard before Mr. Justice J. T. Taschereau on the 17th October, 1877. It has never to this day been drawn up or entered. At the time the judgment was pronounced, the exchequer rule No. 138, which requires that before an appeal can be taken from a judgment in the Exchequer Court, a motion for a new trial must be made to the judge who heard the cause and that the appeal must be from his decision on that motion, that is from the decision on the motion for a rule nisi if the judge refuses to grant the rule, or if he grants a rule nisi, from his decision on the application to make it absolute, did not apply to Quebec cases. On the 12th of February, 1878, exchequer rule No. 203 was passed, and by it rule 138 as well the rules immediately following, to 142 inclusive, were ordered and declared to be and to have been applicable to actions in which the cause of action shall have arisen in the Province of Quebec. On the 9th November, 1877, the deposit of $50 required by section 68 of the Supreme Court Act as security for costs was made with the Registrar.\nOn the 7th January, 1878, an application for a rule nisi to set aside the judgment was made to Mr. Justice Taschereau, who pronounced judgment refusing it on the 7th February following. Since then no step whatever has been taken in the cause, either as regards the appeal or otherwise, with the exception of some proceedings in the exchequer relating to a change of attorney by the suppliant and the taxation of costs between the suppliant's solicitor and his client, the transmission, pursuant to judge's order for the purpose of that taxation, of the papers to an acting Registrar of the court at Quebec, and the return of the same papers to Ottawa.\nAs I before stated the judgment was never drawn up or entered, and the Registrar has never set the appeal down for hearing according to the requirements of section 68. I am of opinion that the suppliant took every step it was obligatory on him to take to bring the appeal to a hearing. The deposit was made in due time. No subsequent deposit after the decision on the application for the rule was, in my view requisite, for I am of opinion that no ex post facto effect ought to be given to order 263, the power to make rules of procedure not authorizing the enactment of orders having a retrospective effect on proceedings already taken,\u2014indeed I do not construe order 263 as intended to apply, so as to affect retroactively proceedings had in pending causes, but as applying to all future proceedings in pending Quebec causes. This being so, the question is whether the deposit for securing the costs having been made, as required by section 68 of the act, and the Registrar not having entered the judgment and not having set down the appeal to be heard as required by section 68, the suppliants appeal is now ipso jure out of court by the operation of rule 44 of the Supreme Court rules That rule provides that unless an appeal shall be brought on for hearing within one year after the security shall have been allowed, it shall be held to have been abandoned without any order to dismiss being required, unless the court or a judge shall otherwise order.\nAccording to the procedure prescribed by section 68 it was impossible for the suppliant to take any step in the cause until the Registrar had set the appeal down to be heard, as required by said section 68. The next step to be taken by the suppliant according to that section was one, consequent on the setting down by the Registrar, and one which could not regularly be taken until the appeal had been set down; the words of the section, after providing for the deposit, being as follows:\nAnd thereupon the Registrar shall set the suit down for hearing before the Supreme Court on the first day of the next session, and the party appealing shall thereupon give to the party or parties affected by the appeal, or their respective attorneys, by whom such parties were represented in the Exchequer Court notice in writing that the case has been so set down to be heard in appeal as aforesaid.\nThus by the express words of the statute the notice was not to be given until after a certain step had been taken by the court or its officer.\nIn my opinion the suppliant is in strictness and of right entitled now to have this motion granted in order that he may proceed with his appeal; he is shown to be in no default, and he is within the equity of the rule that the act of the court can cause no prejudice.\nIt is true he might have made this motion earlier but I apprehend he is not to be prejudiced because he did not earlier invoke the aid of the court to enforce that which it was the statutory duty of the officer of the court to do of his own motion, immediately on receiving the payment of the deposit without any further application from the appellant.\nThe judgment in the Exchequer Court ought also at once to be entered on the judgment book in the Exchequer Court\u2014of course this can and must be done, nunc pro tunc.\nRule 156 of the Exchequer Court is very explicit as to this. That rule says that every judgment shall be entered by the proper officer in the book to be kept for the purpose. This entry is the record of the judgment and the entering of it is to be the act of the court or officer and not of the parties.\nThe entry is to be by the Registrar without waiting for any application from the parties, and if the party in whose favor the judgment is, requires an office copy it is to be delivered to him\nI think the motion to set the appeal down to be heard at the next session of the court should be granted, but without costs, as the point of practice involved in the motion is a new one.\nThe appeal was argued in the Supreme Court of Canada by Irvine Q. C. and Girouard Q. C. for the appellants, and Burbidge Q. C and A. Ferguson for the respondents.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The appellants were contractors, by virtue of two contracts under seal, for the construction of sections of 3 and 6 of the Intercolonial Railway, with Her Majesty represented for that purpose by Commissioners appointed under 31 Vic., cap. 13.\nIn view of the provisions of this Act, 31 Vic., cap. 13, sections 16, 17 and 18, which are as follows:\n16. The Commissioners shall build such railway by tender and contract after the plans and specifications therefor shall have been duly advertised, and they shall accept the tenders of such contractors as shall appear to them to be possessed of sufficient skill, experience and resources to carry on the work of such portions thereof as they shall contract for; provided always, that the Commissioners shall not be obliged to accept the lowest tender in case they should deem it for the public interest not to do so; provided also, that no contract under this section, involving an expense of ten thousand dollars or upwards, shall be concluded by the Commissioners until sanctioned by the Governor in Council.\n17. The contracts to be so entered into shall be guarded by such securities and contain such provisions for retaining a proportion of the contract monies, to be held as a reserve fund for such periods of time, and on such conditions, as may appear to be necessary for the protection of the public, and for securing the due performance of the contract.\n18. No money shall be paid to any contractor until the chief engineer shall have certified that the work, for or on account of which the same shall be claimed, has been duly executed, nor until such certificate hall have been approved by the Commissioners;\nand of 31 Vic., cap. 12, an Act respecting the public works of Canada, by section 7, of which it is enacted that:\u2014\nNo deeds, contracts, documents or writings shall be deemed to be binding on the department, or shall be held to be acts of the said minister, unless signed and sealed by him or his deputy, and countersigned by the secretary;\nand by virtue of the express terms of the contract as indicated in sections 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11 and 12, copies of which I have annexed hereto[5], I think the learned judge who tried this case could not have arrived at any other conclusion than he did; and therefore I think his decision must be affirmed and this appeal dismissed. In the case of Jones v. The Queen[6] I discussed similar provisions, read in connection with these statutes, at great length, and as that case has stood unreversed, and as I am of the same opinion as I was when that judgment was given, I do not think it necessary to go over the same ground again.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le jugement soumis \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de cette cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par l'honorable juge J. T. Taschereau, dans la cour d'Echiquier, le 17 octobre 1877. Ce jugement renvoie la p\u00e9tition de droit par laquelle les Appelants r\u00e9clamaient de Sa Majest\u00e9 une balance de $528,000, comme leur \u00e9tant due par le gouvernement du Canada, sur la construction des sections nos 3 et 6 du chemin de 1er Intercolonial, au sujet desquelles ils avaient fait un contrat avec les commissaires nomm\u00e9s pour la construction de ce chemin. Les p\u00e9titionnaires s'\u00e9taient engag\u00e9s \u00e0 construire ces deux sections par contrat sign\u00e9, le ou vers le 25 mai 1870, mais \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition des commissaires nomm\u00e9s par le gouvernement pour diriger la construction du chemin de fer Intercolonial, l'ouvrage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9 aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s l'acceptation des soumissions des Appelants et avant m\u00eame la signature du contrat. L'ouvrage fut continu\u00e9 jusqu'au 9 juin 1873, \u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle les commissaires donn\u00e8rent avis aux Appelants que leur contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9, que le contr\u00f4le des ouvrages leur \u00e9tait enlev\u00e9 et que les commissaires eux-m\u00eames en compl\u00e8teraient l'ex\u00e9cution.\nApr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 les circonstances dans lesquelles le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, la p\u00e9tition entre dans une exposition d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des sujets de plainte des Appelants, dont les principaux peuvent se r\u00e9sumer comme suit:\u2014\n1o. That there were no valid contracts between Her Majesty and the Petitioners; that if ever such contracts existed, they were annihilated or modified by the fact that the Petitioners had no communication of the plans and profiles nor of the bill of works; and, also, that the schedule of prices agreed upon was increased by orders in council;\n2o. That the Petitioners were compelled by the engineers employed by the Commissioners to execute works quite different from those mentioned in the contracts, much more costly and much above the stipulations of the contracts; and that they were entitled to payment thereof under the order in council.\n3o. That the monthly estimates of progress made by the engineers were not carefully made and did not represent the quantity of work executed on the two sections and that consequently their monthly payments were much below the amounts to which they were entitled;\n4o. That they complained frequently to the minister of Public Works and to the Commissioners and that in consequence of these complaints, the minister of Public Works promised to indemnity them if they continued the works assuring them that the abandonment of their works would be a great damage to the Government as well as to the Petitioners themselves;\n5o. Moreover the Petitioners claimed the said sum of $523,000 under the form of general indebitatus assumpsit for money advanced, materials furnished, labour supplied, &c., &c.\nA cette petition sont annex\u00e9es des comptes d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des montants d\u00e9pens\u00e9s par les Appelants pour l'ex\u00e9cution des ouvrages sur les susdites deux sections, comprenant aussi un \u00e9tat des ouvrages extr\u00e0 pouvant \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s en vertu du contrat.\nLa d\u00e9fense de Sa Majest\u00e9, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la p\u00e9tition, consiste principalement dans une d\u00e9n\u00e9gation en fait et en droit des all\u00e9gations des Appelants. En outre, la d\u00e9fense all\u00e8gue au long le contrat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 le 25 mai 1870 pour la construction des dites sections 3 et 6. Les principales clauses de ce contrat \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer pour la d\u00e9cision de cette cause sont les suivantes: [Reads sections 3, 4, 6, 11[7]]\nLa d\u00e9fense all\u00e8gue que les sujets de plainte des Appelants furent examin\u00e9s avec soin et que, de temps en temps, dans le but de leur venir en aide, les commissaires recommand\u00e8rent des augmentations de prix, mais en ayant toujours soin de ne pas d\u00e9passer la somme en bloc stipul\u00e9e par le contrat pour la totalit\u00e9 des ouvrages.\nQue vers le 21 mai 187 les Appelants pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent aux commissaires une r\u00e9clamation consid\u00e9rable pour des ouvrages extra, en d\u00e9clarant que s'ils n'\u00e9taient, pas pay\u00e9s de cette somme, ils seraient oblig\u00e9s de suspendre les travaux, parce qu'ils ne pouvaient les continuer s'ils n'\u00e9taient point pay\u00e9s; que les Appelants n'ayant pas droit \u00e0 ces sommes, les commissaires leur signifi\u00e8rent avis, conform\u00e9ment au contrat, que le contr\u00f4le des ouvrages leur \u00e9tait enlev\u00e9 et le contrat annul\u00e9.\nQu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la signification de cet avis, il n'\u00e9tait d\u00fb aux con tracteurs que $10,444 sur la section 3 et $73,946 sur la section 6, tandis qu'il restait de l'ouvrage \u00e0 faire pour une somme beaucoup plus consid\u00e9rable.\nQue pour terminer les ouvrages, les commissaires ont d\u00e9pens\u00e9 les sommes suivantes, savoir: sur la section 3, $107, 56.97, et sur la section 6, la somme de $136,915.60, ce qui fait que les Appelants ont re\u00e7u sur les deux contrats $159,983.57 de plus qu'il ne leur \u00e9tait d\u00fb, et cela sans tenir compte des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour lesquelles ils \u00e9taient responsables en vertu du contrat, pour retard dans l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux. Il y a une conclusion pour le remboursement de cette somme de $159,982.57.\nLa d\u00e9fense all\u00e8gue que les Appelants n'avaient droit \u00e0 aucun paiement, \u00e0 moins d'avoir obtenu un certificat de l'ing\u00e9nieur, et qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s de tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi certifi\u00e9.\nSur cette contestation, un nombre consid\u00e9rable de t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s. Leurs t\u00e9moignages imprim\u00e9s forment deux \u00e9normes volumes. La correspondance entre les Appelants, le gouvernement et les commissaires a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 produite, avec un grand nombre de documents, qui forment encore plusieurs autres volumes tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rables.\nC'est cette masse de t\u00e9moignages et de documents que l'honorable juge a eu \u00e0 examiner pour en arriver \u00e0 la conclusion de renvoyer la p\u00e9tition. J'avoue que ce n'est pas sans beaucoup d'h\u00e9sitations que j'ai abord\u00e9 cette t\u00e2che difficile. Mais apr\u00e8s avoir, comme l'honorable juge, fait un s\u00e9rieux examen de cette preuve et de ces documents, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9 d'arriver \u00e0 une conclusion contraire \u00e0 la sienne.\nUn des premiers moyens invoqu\u00e9s par les Appelants \u00e9tant qu'il n'y avait pas de contrat valable entre eux et Sa Majest\u00e9; que s'il en avait exist\u00e9 un, savoir, celui qu'ils avaient sign\u00e9 le 25 mai 1870, ce contrat \u00e9tait incomplet, les plans n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s; de plus, qu'il avait, de fait, \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 du consentement des deux parties ou du moins tellement modifi\u00e9 qu'il avait cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler les obligations respectives des parties contractantes, il \u00e9tait tout naturel dans ce cas pour l'honorable juge de d\u00e9cider d'abord la question concernant la validit\u00e9 du contrat all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la Couronne. C'est aussi par l'examen des faits se rapportant \u00e0 cette question que je commencerai l'\u00e9tude de cette cause, apr\u00e8s avoir toutefois fait sommairement allusion aux circonstances qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la signature du contrat en question.\nM Fleming, l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef charg\u00e9 par le gouvernement de la direction des travaux de construction du chemin de fer Intercolonial, et sous la direction duquel le devis des ouvrages a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9, constate (1) qu'une exploration de ces deux sections avait eu lieu et que les mesurages et quantit\u00e9s d'ouvrages avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis approximativement, et imprim\u00e9s et publi\u00e9s afin de donner \u00e0 ceux qui voudraient contracter pour la construction de ces deux sections 3 et 6, la connaissance des ouvrages qu'il y aurait \u00e0 faire. Il ajoute qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque les quantit\u00e9s ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre donn\u00e9es avec exactitude, que tout ce qu'il \u00e9tait alors possible de faire c'\u00e9tait d'en donner une information approximative.\nLes plans de d\u00e9tail (special plans) n'\u00e9taient point pr\u00e9par\u00e9s, mais les plans de presque toutes les structures l'\u00e9taient. Il n'y avait aucun plan de fondations. Il ne peut dire si les coupes transversales (cross-sections) avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites; il croit cependant qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas compl\u00e8tes. Quant aux quantit\u00e9s donn\u00e9es dans le (Bill of Works) devis et aux profils indiquant la nature des ouvrages, ils \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s aussi corrects qu'on peut les donner sans avoir fait un mesurage complet. Les profils n'indiquaient pas l'endroit de l'ouvrage, ni si c'\u00e9tait sur le penchant d'une c\u00f4te ou sur un terrain plan; ils n'indiquaient que le contour g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'ouvrage \u00e0 faire. M. Fleming dit qu'il n'avait fait qu'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s (rough estimate) l'estim\u00e9 du co\u00fbt des travaux, fixant le maximum et le minimum des prix. D'apr\u00e8s un document qui lui est attribu\u00e9 le minimum pour le n\u00b0 6 \u00e9tait de $493,666\u2014et le maximum $615,000 pour la section 3, le minimum appara\u00eet \u00eatre $530,000 et le maximum $705,000.\nComme le fait voir ce t\u00e9moignage, le gouvernement n'\u00e9tait pas dans la position d'offrir aux soumissionnaires pour ces contrats des informations suffisantes pour adopter le syst\u00e8me de contrats \u00e0 forfaits; il n'\u00e9tait pas en \u00e9tat de garantir les quantit\u00e9s d'ouvrage \u00e0 faire. Les soumissionnaires n'avaient rien pour se guider puisque le gouvernement ne pouvait pas garantir les quantit\u00e9s d'ouvrage \u00e0 faire et qu'il n'offrait que des donn\u00e9es reconnues imparfaites sur la valeur et la quantit\u00e9 des travaux \u00e0 faire. Mais le gouvernement press\u00e9, pour des motifs d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public d'ex\u00e9cuter au plus t\u00f4t les grands travaux qu'il s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 faire en vertu de l'Apte de Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, n'avait pas eu le temps de se procurer de plus amples informations que celles qu'il avait mises \u00e0 la disposition des contracteurs qui eurent \u00e0 s'en contenter.\nBerlinguet apr\u00e8s avoir fait une \u00e9tude tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8re des plans, profils et devis qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s avoir aussi obtenu beaucoup d'informations utiles de MM. Jobin et Cie, qui avaient abandonn\u00e9 le contrat qu'ils avaient eu de ces sections 3 et 6,\u2014fit ses soumissions pour les m\u00eames travaux. On lui a fait \u00e0 ce sujet le reproche de s'\u00eatre lanc\u00e9 t\u00e9m\u00e9rairement dans une entreprise pour laquelle il manquait d'exp\u00e9rience et on a pr\u00e9tendu expliquer son insucc\u00e8s par cette consid\u00e9ration. Je ne m'attacherai pas \u00e0 refuter cette accusation, me contentant de ref\u00e9rer \u00e0 ce sujet au factum des appelants qui en d\u00e9montre toute Fin justice. Toutefois le gouvernement par ses commissaires accepta ses soumissions et requit les contracteurs de se mettre imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 l'\u0153uvre, m\u00eame avant la signature du contrat qui ne le fut que plus tard, le 25 mai 1870, mais les plans ne le furent jamais et furent d\u00e9truits dans un incendie. Un contrat semblable fut sign\u00e9 pour la section No. 3.\nIl est \u00e0 peine n\u00e9cessaire de dire que l'insuffisance des donn\u00e9es fournies aux contracteurs n'est pas invoqu\u00e9e comme moyen de se soustraire \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat. Mais il est important d'y r\u00e9f\u00e9rer pour faire voir que dans l'ex\u00e9cution d'ouvrages aussi mal d\u00e9finis que l'\u00e9taient ceux dont il s'agit, le gouvernement, aussi bien que les contracteurs, a d\u00fb bient\u00f4t s'apercevoir de la difficult\u00e9 pour ne pas dire de l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuter un pareil contrat. Aussi ce contrat n'a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme obligatoire que pendant un court espace de temps.\nPresque toutes ses clauses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les unes apr\u00e8s les autres annul\u00e9es et mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par les deux parties. On verra par les faits rapport\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s qu'il ne restait de ce contrat aucune autre obligation pour les contracteurs que celle de faire les travaux des deux sections et pour le gouvernement l'obligation de les payer aux prix d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par des ordres en conseil. Il y a eu renonciation de celui-ci \u00e0 toutes les autres conditions, comme celle de l'obligation de terminer les ouvrages pour le 1er juillet 1871\u2014le temps \u00e9tant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 de l'essence du contrat; celle comportant confiscation de toute somme d'argent ou percentage retenu comme garantie de l'ex\u00e9cution des ouvrages, et aussi de toutes autres sommes dues aux contracteurs au cas o\u00f9 ils ne termineraient pas les ouvrages dans le temps fix\u00e9; celle comportant une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de $2,000 pour chaque semaine de retard apport\u00e9 \u00e0 la livraison des ouvrages dans le temps fix\u00e9; celle donnant aux commissaires pouvoir d'annuler le contrat en donnant aux contracteurs sept jours d'avis; celle fixant le prix en Bloc pour la section 6, \u00e0 la somme de $456,946 et \u00e0 celle de $462,444 pour la section n\u00b0 3 enfin la 4me section d\u00e9clarant que les paiements mensuels ne seraient faits que sur des certificats d'ing\u00e9nieurs. Ce sont toutes les conditions importantes du contrat, les autres le sont peu, ou ne sont que de pure forme.\nSi, comme j'ai confiance de pouvoir le d\u00e9montrer par l'exposition des faits il r\u00e9sulte un abandon ou une renonciation formelle de la part du gouvernement, \u00e0 toutes ces conditions, que reste-il alors du contrat, sinon comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, l'obligation pour les contracteurs de faire les ouvrages, et pour le gouvernement celle de les payer conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses ordres en conseil.\nL'honorable juge Taschereau adoptant pour point de d\u00e9part de son examen des faits de cette cause, l'existence du contrat sign\u00e9 le 25 mai 1870 y a subordonn\u00e9 tous les autres faits constatant les nombreux changements et modifications qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s, bien que ces faits amplement prouv\u00e9s soient de nature \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il y a eu de la part du gouvernement une renonciation l\u00e9gale \u00e0 la plupart des conditions du contrat. Sur un point seulement a-t-il donn\u00e9 gain de cause aux Appelants.\nPar son jugement du 17 octobre 1877, il reconna\u00eet qu'il y a de la part du gouvernement violation de la condition concernant le mode de paiements et d\u00e9clare \u00e0 ce sujet:\nThat the said Mr. Xavier Berlinguet and Marie Charlotte Mailloux are entitled to the sum of five thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars and 90 cents for interest upon and for the forbearance of divers large sums of money due and payable by Her Majesty's Government to them the Suppliants.\nA l'appui de cette partie de son jugement l'honorable juge a exprim\u00e9 comme suit les motifs qui l'ont induit \u00e0 adopter cette conclusion:\nXLV. There is one point in the case on which the Petitioners should succeed: it is that concerning the manner in which the engineers made their monthly estimates during the first four months following the beginning of the works, in 1870, as established by Documents 97 and 98 produced with the official correspondence concerning the construction of the Intercolonial. According to this correspondence and the order in council of the 20th September 1870, which settled the question, it would appear that the engineers committed errors resulting in a loss to the contractors, for interest, of $5,850.90 or thereabouts. In order to appreciate correctly the intention of the Commissioners in their communication to the Privy Council (Document 97) and the meaning and signification of the report of the Privy Council, I cite them verbatim, and I believe, although the chief engineer was not of the opinion of the Privy Council and of the Commissioners on this point, that the engineers made grave errors in this occasion and that this sum of $5,850.90 should be credited to the Petitioners in the final result of the case.\nDans cette partie de son jugement on voit que l'honorable juge donne raison aux Appelants, sur un des griefs importants de leur p\u00e9tition, le 17me, dans lequel ils se plaignent que les estim\u00e9s mensuels de l'ouvrage fait \u00e9taient incorrects et que les paiements faits sur ces rapports injustes \u00e9taient insuffisants pour couvrir leurs l\u00e9gitimes d\u00e9penses. Cette partie du jugement \u00e9tant favorable aux Appelants, ils n'en mettent pas en question la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 ni le bien jug\u00e9.\nL'Intim\u00e9e seule aurait pu le faire, mais elle n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de prendre un contre-appel pour soumettre cette partie du jugement \u00e0 la revision de cette cour. Les d\u00e9lais d'appel sont expir\u00e9s depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, et cette partie du jugement \u00e9tant pass\u00e9e en force de chose jug\u00e9e, il faut, de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, consid\u00e9rer comme un point r\u00e9gl\u00e9, que, d\u00e8s les premiers mois de l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux, le gouvernement lui-m\u00eame, par ses agents, mettait de grands obstacles \u00e0 l'avancement des travaux en retardant le paiement de sommes consid\u00e9rables dues aux contracteurs.\nLa renonciation du gouvernement au droit d'exiger que les travaux fussent termin\u00e9s dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le contrat du 25 mai, savoir, au 1er juillet 1871, ainsi qu'aux p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s et confiscations stipul\u00e9es pour inex\u00e9cution de cette condition, r\u00e9sulte n\u00e9cessairement des diverses transactions qui ont eu lieu entre les contracteurs et le gouvernement apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le contrat.\nAvant de citer quelques-unes de ces transactions, il est bon de faire observer que l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef, M. Fleming, dont le t\u00e9moignage est cit\u00e9 par l'honorable juge, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux \u00e9tait trop court; il dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\nI think it ought not to have been attempted.\nI am not prepared to say it was impossible to do it, but it would have required a lavish expenditure.\nLa conclusion qu'en tire l'honorable juge, c'est que Berlinguet a \u00e9t\u00e9 imprudent d'entreprendre avec des informations aussi incertaines et qu'il doit en subir les cons\u00e9quences. Bien que cette condition soit reconnue comme impossible d'ex\u00e9cution, l'honorable juge n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 tenir rigoureusement les Appelants \u00e0 l'obligation de l'ex\u00e9cuter. Cette conclusion ne peut s'expliquer que par le fait que l'honorable juge a compl\u00e8tement omis de prendre en consid\u00e9ration les faits nombreux par lesquels le gouvernement s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 de cette condition. Quelle autre conclusion tirer de l'ordre en conseil du 27 juillet 1871, apr\u00e8s l'expiration du terme fatal mentionn\u00e9 dans le contrat, accordant aux Appelants, pour les mettre en \u00e9tat de continuer les travaux, une augmentation de 20 pour cent par verge cube sur les travaux en terre et d'une piastre par verge cube sur les ouvrages en ma\u00e7onnerie. Plus tard, le 28 septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, un autre ordre en conseil s'exprimait ainsi:\nHaving reference to the expediency of extending to the Contractors on the line every reasonable facility in the prosecution of their work, &c., &c., advise that the recommendation submitted on the said memorandum be approved......\nLe rapport ainsi approuv\u00e9 accordait aux Appelants une avance de $25,000 par chaque section et cela pr\u00e8s de trois mois apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai dans lequel les ouvrages devaient \u00eatre finis.\nSur un rapport en date du 18 janvier 1872, sign\u00e9 par tous les commissaires et adress\u00e9 au gouvernement repr\u00e9sentant sur la recommandation de l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef M. Fleming\u2014\nThat these Contractors have pushed forward their work since last winter with a great deal of energy, having accomplished a great deal more than was expected, and that the character of the work generally is quite satisfactory\";\nThat he is quite satisfied from the statement both of the Contractors and Engineers in charge, that the work has been executed at a heavy loss;\nThat from all he can learn the certificates fall far short of the actual expenditure, and unless they be increased the work must stop;\nThat the work could not come to a stand without resulting in serious difficulties, and in all probability very large additional cost and, therefore, should be avoided if possible;\nUn ordre en conseil fut adopt\u00e9 le 20 janvier 1872 approuvant et adoptant la suggestion des commissaires d'augmenter encore le prix du contrat.\nUn autre ordre en conseil en date du 10 f\u00e9vrier 1872 rendu sur le rapport des commissaires approuve leur suggestion de faire les paiements aux taux augment\u00e9s par des ordres en conseil pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment rendus.\nLe 5 avril 1872 un ordre en conseil au m\u00eame effet que le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent est rendu pour le paiement des ouvrages faits jusqu'\u00e0 la fin du mois de mars 1872.\nAfin de permettre aux contracteurs de continuer les travaux, le gouvernement rendit encore le 11 juin 1872 un ordre en conseil continuant les paiements aux m\u00eames taux jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de juin.\nBeaucoup d'autres documents que ceux ci-dessus cit\u00e9s constatent de la mani\u00e8re la plus positive qu'apr\u00e8s le 1er juillet 1871, le gouvernement a consenti \u00e0 la continuation des travaux sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la stipulation qui faisait de l'\u00e9poque de leur terminaison une condition essentielle. Mais ceux mentionn\u00e9s plus haut sont certainement plus que suffisants pour faire voir que le gouvernement s'est volontiers d\u00e9parti de cette condition et constituent une preuve l\u00e9gale d'une renonciation au droit de s'en pr\u00e9valoir. Lorsque Ton se rappelle le t\u00e9moignage de M. Fleming d\u00e9clarant qu'il \u00e9tait impossible de faire ces travaux dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, on comprend de suite le sentiment de justice qui a port\u00e9 le gouvernement, sur les recommandations de son ing\u00e9nieur et celle des commissaires, \u00e0 laisser les contracteurs continuer l'ouvrage apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9. En pr\u00e9sence de ces faits il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 plus logique et certainement plus l\u00e9gal, comme le feront voir les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s, de conclure que cette condition avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nUne autre cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9vitable de ces faits c'est qu'il en r\u00e9sulte que la condition donnant aux commissaires le pouvoir d'annuler le contrat en donnant aux contracteurs sept jours d'avis a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e (waived) comme les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. On a vu par tous les documents ci-dessus cit\u00e9s que les travaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 continu\u00e9s pendant tout pr\u00e8s de deux ans apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour leur ex\u00e9cution. Il n'\u00e9tait plus possible alors au gouvernement de se pr\u00e9valoir du privil\u00e8ge d'annuler le contrat. Un privil\u00e8ge aussi exorbitant ne pouvait plus \u00eatre exerc\u00e9, apr\u00e8s une prolongation de d\u00e9lai aussi consid\u00e9rable, sans qu'il en r\u00e9sult\u00e2t une grave injustice contre les contracteurs. Les circonstances dans lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 font voir que le gouvernement s'en est servi pour se constituer seul arbitre du diff\u00e9rend survenu entre lui et les contracteurs, et apr\u00e8s des d\u00e9lais et des rapports d'affaires qui justifiaient ceux-ci de croire que le gouvernement avait renonc\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette clause. Les contracteurs ayant alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux commissaires leur pr\u00e9sente r\u00e9clamation se montant \u00e0 la somme de $543,540 et ne recevant pas de r\u00e9ponse, inform\u00e8rent le gouvernement qu'\u00e0 moins qu'ils ne fussent pay\u00e9s de leurs avances les travaux ne pourraient pas \u00eatre conduits avec autant de vigueur que le d\u00e9siraient les commissaires. Sur cette r\u00e9ponse les commissaires demand\u00e8rent l'autorisation d'annuler le contrat (Voir ordre en conseil, p. 24) et donn\u00e8rent en cons\u00e9quence un avis \u00e0 cet effet. Cet ordre en conseil d\u00e9montre que le contrat n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 volontairement abandonn\u00e9, mais fait voir qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 aux contracteurs qui, faute de paiement de leur r\u00e9clamation, d\u00e9claraient ne pouvoir proc\u00e9der au gr\u00e9 des commissaires. Pour d\u00e9cider si les commissaires avaient droit d'en agir ainsi, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'entrer maintenant dans le m\u00e9rite de la r\u00e9clamation qui leur \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e; la seule question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans le moment est de savoir si le pouvoir d'annuler le contrat pouvait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le contrat, savoir le 1er juillet 1871. Je soumets qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus alors au pouvoir du gouvernement d'exercer ce privil\u00e8ge. Il est de principe qu'une condition aussi rigoureuse ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e que dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, et comme c'est pr\u00e8s de deux ans apr\u00e8s son expiration que les commissaires ont donn\u00e9 l'avis requis par le contrat, il \u00e9tait alors trop tard pour s'en pr\u00e9valoir. Cette condition avait alors cess\u00e9 d'avoir aucun effet et il s'ensuit que les rapports entre les parties contractantes doivent se r\u00e9gler comme si cette stipulation n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e au contrat. Ce point est \u00e9tabli par l'autorit\u00e9 suivante qui s'applique \u00e9galement au cas o\u00f9 il y a des stipulations de confiscation et de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 comme dans le contrat dont il s'agit. Elles doivent aussi \u00eatre mises en force avant l'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9.\nDans la cause de Walker and others v. The London and North Western Railway Company[8], o\u00f9 des difficult\u00e9s se sont \u00e9lev\u00e9es au sujet de l'interpr\u00e9tation de clauses analogues \u00e0 celle dont il s'agit en cette cause, d\u00e9clarant que si les ouvrages n'\u00e9taient pas termin\u00e9s dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, ou conduits \u00e0 la satisfaction de l'ing\u00e9nieur qui en avait la direction, le contrat serait \u00e0 l'option de la compagnie consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme nul pour tout ce qui resterait \u00e0 faire, et que toutes les sommes alors dues aux contracteurs, ainsi que tous les mat\u00e9riaux et l'outillage et toutes sommes stipul\u00e9es comme p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s pour l'inex\u00e9cution du contrat seraient forfaits en faveur de la compagnie, si les ouvrages n'\u00e9taient pas termin\u00e9s avant le 31 avril 1873. Ils ne le furent point. Le sommaire de la d\u00e9cision est comme suit:\nHeld, upon the true construction of the contract the clause above set forth, with reference to the evidence of the contract and the forfeiture of the contractor's implements and materials, could only been forced before the time originally fixed for the completion of the works had expired.\nArchibald, J., fait au sujet du d\u00e9lai dans lequel une telle clause peut \u00eatre mise en force, la remarque suivante:\nThe clause in our opinion can only be acted on and enforced within the time fixed for the completion of the works, for the time is clearly of the essence of contract, and it is only with reference to the time so agreed that this rate of progress can be determined. If, as happened, the time has been extended, there may be a new contract to complete in a reasonable time; but to give the clause in question any application to a reasonable time after the time originally fixed has expired, would be, without any express provision, to make the company judge in their own case of what was a reasonable time, and to enable them in their own favor to avail themselves of a most stringent and penal clause......\nHere there was a disregard of the time of completion by mutual consent, and a negotiation was on foot for allowing a longer time and enhanced prices to the contractor, but we do not decide the case on that ground, but upon what we consider to be the legal construction of the clause which could only be enforced before the time originally fixed for completion of the work had expired, and we therefore think the notice of the 22nd January 1874, was not effectual for all or any of the purposes mentioned in the question put to us, and that the contract was not avoided.\nWe think the defendants were not justified in point of law in taking possession of the plaintiffs implements and materials.\nEmdens, dans son ouvrage intitul\u00e9 \"Law of Building\"[9], fait au sujet de cette d\u00e9cision les observations suivantes approuvant la doctrine qui y est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e.\nWhen there is a clause similar to that in Walker vs. London and North Western Railvay, providing for the avoidance of the contract, and the forfeiture of the Contractor's implements and materials if he fails to proceed with the work at the rate of progress required in order to complete the works within the period limited for the purpose, or upon certain other events, such a clause can only be acted on, and enforced, before the time originally fixed for the completion of the works has expired. And the exercise of the right of election to rescind a building contract, on the ground of delay, or that the works cannot be completed within the given time, must be signified in an unqualified manner, and at all events, not after the builder has gone to expense in the belief that the right of election not being exercised, or has altered his position to his prejudice.\nIt follows, therefore, that as courts of law always lean against forfeitures, whenever it is intended to take advantage of any breach of covenant or condition in a building lease, or contract, so that it should operate as a forfeiture, the land owner or employer must take care not to do anything which may be deemed to be an acknowledgment of the continuance of the tenancy, or contract, and so operate as a waiver of the forfeiture.\nDans la cause de Holmer vs. Guppy[10] dans laquelle s'est aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9e la question de savoir dans quel d\u00e9lai devait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 le droit de forfaiture stipul\u00e9 au cas d'inex\u00e9cution d'ouvrages dans le temps fix\u00e9 par le contrat, Parke B fait les remarques suivantes:\nThen it appears that they were disabled by the act of the Defendants from the performance of that contract; and there are clear authorities, that if the party be prevented, by the refusal of the other contracting party, from completing the contract within the time limited, he is not liable in law for the default. It is clear, therefore, that the plaintiffs were excused from performing the contract contained in the original contract, and there is nothing to show that they entered into a new contract by which to perform the work in four months and a half, ending at a later period; The Plaintiffs were therefore left at large, and consequently they are not to forfeit anything for the delay.\nDans la cause de Westwood and others vs. The Secretary of State for India[11], o\u00f9 il s'agissait d'opposer en compensation des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s stipul\u00e9es pour d\u00e9faut de livrer les ouvrages dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le contrat, la cour d\u00e9clara:\nAs to the set-off for penalties, they were clearly of opinion that it could not be sustained, because it must be taken, on the demurrer, however it might be disproved in point of fact, that the Defendant's engineers had ordered additions and alterations which has rendered it impossible to complete the work within the time and that he knew that they could not be so completed. That being so, it would be unjust and unreasonable to allow the Defendant to claim penalty for the delay.\nJ'ai cit\u00e9 les ordres en conseil prouvant de la mani\u00e8re la plus positive que la condition du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour la terminaison des ouvrages avait \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e, que des prolongations de d\u00e9lais avaient eu lieu de consentement mutuel apr\u00e8s le 1er juillet 1871, et que le gouvernement n'a jamais eu un seul instant l'intention de mettre \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution cette condition, non plus que d'exiger les confiscations et p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s dont il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans leur correspondance. Mon but en faisant ces citations n'\u00e9tait pas seulement de prouver comme question de fait qu'il y avait eu un abandon volontaire (waiver), de ces conditions ci-dessus \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es, mais je tenais aussi \u00e0 faire voir que les parties contractantes avaient toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en excellents rapports jusqu'\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de la r\u00e9clamation des Appelants qui a fourni aux commissaires le pr\u00e9texte de demander l'annulation du contrat.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de la renonciation volontaire r\u00e9sultant des faits ci-dessus rapport\u00e9s, toutes les conditions de d\u00e9lai, de confiscations, de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s et d'annulation du contrat sont devenues caduqnes et sans effet par l'expiration du d\u00e9lai du contrat, suivant les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es plus haut \u00e9tablissant clairement qu'elles ne peuvent \u00eatre mises en force qu'avant l'expiration du d\u00e9lai convenu.\nSentant toute la force de l'argument sur la question de l'annulation du contrat apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai, on a essay\u00e9 d'y trouver une r\u00e9ponse en pr\u00e9tendant qu'il y avait entre la troisi\u00e8me clause du contrat, au sujet de la confiscation et des p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s que la loi d\u00e9cr\u00e8te, au sujet de l'annulation du contrat et de la prise de possession des travaux, une diff\u00e9rence essentielle, consistant en ce que dans la premi\u00e8re, le d\u00e9lai est absolu et fatal\u2014et que dans la derni\u00e8re, le privil\u00e8ge d'annuler le contrat et de prendre possession des travaux est facultatif, et peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 indistinctement soit avant soit apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai pass\u00e9. En comparant les deux clauses on voit clairement que cette distinction n'est pas fond\u00e9e et que dans l'une comme dans l'autre l'expiration du d\u00e9lai doit produire le m\u00eame effet. La clause 6me, apr\u00e8s avoir pourvu au droit de faire suspendre les travaux, s'exprime au sujet du droit d'annulation et de prise de possession, dans les termes suivants:\nIf at any time during the progress of the works, it should appear that the force employed, or the rate of progress then being made, or the general character of the work being performed, or the material supplied or furnished are not such as to ensure the completion of the said works within the time stipulated, or in accordance with this contract, the commissioners shall be at liberty to take any part of the whole works out of the hands of the contractors, and employ such means as they may see fit to complete the works at the expense of the contractors, and they shall be liable for all extra expenditure incurred thereby; or the commissioners shall have power at their discretion to annul this contract. Whenever it may become necessary to take any portion or the whole work out of the hands of the contractors, or to annul this contract, the commissioners shall give contractors seven clear days' notice in writing of their intention to do so, such notice being signed by the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners, or by any other person authorized by the commissioners, and the contractors shall thereupon give up quiet and peaceable possession of all the works and materials as they then exist; and without any other or further notice or process or suit at law, other legal proceedings of any kind whatever, or without its being necessary to place the contractors en demeure, the commissioners in the event of their annulling the contract may forthwith, or at their discretion, proceed to re-let the same or any part thereof, or employ additional workmen, tools and materials, as the case may be, and complete the works at the expense of the contractors, who shall be liable fer all extra expenditure which may be incurred thereby, and the contractors and their assigns or creditors shall forfeit all right to the percentage retained, and to all money which may be due on the works.\nCette facult\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e, comme le dit la clause, que si les commissaires ont lieu de croire que les ouvrages ne seront pas compl\u00e9t\u00e9s dans le d\u00e9lai convenu:\nNot such as to ensure the completion of the said works within the time stipulated; or the commissioners shall have power, at their discretion, to annul their contract.\nLe pouvoir est donn\u00e9 dans l'alternative, et le d\u00e9lai dans lequel il doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9, within the time stipulated, s'applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'exercice soit de la facult\u00e9 de prendre possession soit de celle d'annuler le contrat.\nIl ne se trouve aucun terme dans cette clause qui puisse permettre de l'interpr\u00e9ter comme si elle avait dit que cette facult\u00e9 pourrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e en tout temps, soit avant, soit apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9; elle dit, tout au contraire qu'elle ne pourra l'\u00eatre que within the time stipulated.\nCette clause est d'un caract\u00e8re tout aussi p\u00e9nal que le 3me, au sujet de la confiscation et des penalit\u00e9s; elle comporte la peine de payer toutes les d\u00e9penses extra que les commissaires pourront encourir en faisant terminer les travaux. Il n'y a donc pas de diff\u00e9rence \u00e0 faire entre l'interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner \u00e0 ces deux clauses. Ce serait aller directement contre les termes du contrat que de dire que ces pouvoirs pouvaient \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai.\nD'ailleurs c'est l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette clause par les commissaires eux-m\u00eames, et par le gouvernement, comme le font voir les documents cit\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s. Apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la r\u00e9clamation des appelants (p. 320, vol. de correspondance) sur laquelle il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de rapport, ni statu\u00e9 en aucune mani\u00e8re par le gouvernement, les appelants dans leur lettre accompagnant cette r\u00e9clamation et demandant un prompt r\u00e8glement pour \u00e9viter la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de suspendre les travaux, ajoutent:\nOur securities have already made sacrifices and incurred liabilities beyond any precedent in their desire to aid us in having the works contracted for faithfully carried out. Nothing further can be done by them or us without any action on your part to afford us the substantial relief sought for.\nCette r\u00e9clamation ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise pour examen \u00e0 M. Fleming, l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef, il fit rapport qu'il n'avait pas en sa possession les informations n\u00e9cessaires to enable him to make an immediate or early report thereon. C'est sur cette r\u00e9ponse que les commissaires se bas\u00e8rent pour demander l'autorisation d'annuler le contrat et prendre possession des travaux\u2014ce que le gouvernement leur permit de faire par son ordre en conseil du 30 mai 1873, dans ces termes:\nOn a report dated 29th May, 1873, from the commissioners appointed to construct the Intercolonial Railway, stating in reference to the work upon Sections Nos. 3, 6, 9 and 15 of the Intercolonial Railway, that the contractors of these sections, fyled with the commissioners on the 24th inst., statements of works executed, claimed to be extra, amounting in the aggregate to $543,554;\nThat these statements were submitted to the Chief Engineer for examination, but that he had not the information in his possession to enable him to make an immediate and early report thereon;\nThat the contractors upon being informed that payments could not be made upon these claims until the same should have been reported on and approved, informed the commissioners that in the absence of such payments they could not proceed with the works with as much vigor as the commissioners require;\nThe commissioners therefore recommend that they be authorized to take these respective sections out of the contractors' hands, and as the advertising and re-letting of the work remaining to execute would involve the loss of the greater part of the present working season, the commissioners also recommend that they be authorized (in terms of the contracts) to \"employ such means as they may see fit to complete the works at the expense of the contractors.\"\nOn the recommendation of the Honorable the Minister of Public Works, the Committee advise that the authority requested be granted.\nSe fondant sur cette autorisation les commissaires donn\u00e8rent aux Appelants l'avis requis par la section 6 du contrat (Voir p. 327, Vol. de Corr.), en invoquant les motifs suivants:\nAnd whereas the force employed, the rate of progress being made, the general character of the work being performed, and the materials supplied and being furnished, are not such as to insure the completion of the works within the time stipulated, and are not in accordance with your contract.\nSi les commissaires avaient consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'ils avaient en tout temps le pouvoir d'annuler le contrat, auraient-ils invoqu\u00e9 le motif que l'ouvrage n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, lorsque ce d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait expir\u00e9 depuis pr\u00e8s de deux ans. Ils n'ont donc, dans tous les cas, voulu qu'exercer et n'ont de fait, exerc\u00e9 que la facult\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e, se trompant toutefois sur l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle ils auraient d\u00fb agir pour se pr\u00e9valoir de ce droit. On a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au lieu d'ajuster la r\u00e9clamation des Appelants pour extras. Ces explications me paraissent suffisantes pour faire voir que la clause 6 ne diff\u00e8re pas de la 3me quant au d\u00e9lai dans lequel les pouvoirs stipul\u00e9s devaient \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence.\nFaisant application au jugement de l'honorable juge Taschereau du principe que les forfaitures ne peuvent \u00eatre prononc\u00e9es apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait dans ce cas, le 1er juillet 1871, son jugement pronon\u00e7ant la confiscation de la somme de $5,850.90 repr\u00e9sentant l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur les sommes qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es aux \u00e9poques o\u00f9 elles auraient d\u00fb l'\u00eatre, est \u00e9videmment contraire \u00e0 la jurisprudence et doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre r\u00e9form\u00e9.\nEn outre des $5,850.90 dus pour int\u00e9r\u00eat le jugement qui a maintenant force de chose jug\u00e9e pour la partie favorable aux Appelants, d\u00e9clare le gouvernement leur d\u00e9biteur pour l\u00e0 valeur de l'outillage et des mat\u00e9riaux leur appartenant et au sujet desquels l'honorable juge s'exprime ainsi:\ni also believe that in law and equity they (plff.) should be credited with another sum of $27,023, representing the value of materials which they transferred to Government when they gave up their contract in May 1873.\nMais il en prononce aussi la confiscation au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du gouvernement parce que les ouvrages n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9s dans le temps voulu. Cette confiscation doit n\u00e9cessairement tomber comme la premi\u00e8re, parce que l'honorable juge n'avait aucun pouvoir de la prononcer apr\u00e8s le 1er juillet 1871. Ainsi, au lieu d'adjuger au gouvernement le b\u00e9nefice de la somme de $32,873.90 qu'il enlevait aux Appelants, c'est le gouvernement qu'il aurait d\u00fb condamner \u00e0 leur payer cette somme, et le jugement doit encore \u00eatre r\u00e9form\u00e9 sur ce point.\nL'effet des autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus est donc d'abord d'annuler la partie du jugement pronon\u00e7ant la confiscation; d'annuler la condition du d\u00e9lai pour l'ex\u00e9cution des ouvrages\u2014comme \u00e9tant de l'essence du contrat\u2014de rendre caduque et sans effet la condition comportant confiscation du percentage retenu et aussi de toutes autres sommes dues aux contracteurs, ainsi que la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de $2,000.00 pour chaque semaine de retard, d'annuler aussi les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s adopt\u00e9s par les commissaires et le gouvernement pour faire consid\u00e9rer le contrat comme annul\u00e9, tels proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 1er juillet.\nComme on le voit le contrat est r\u00e9duit \u00e0 peu de chose, et si comme j'esp\u00e8re le prouver la seule clause importante qui reste encore debout, celle fixant le prix en bloc des sections No 3 et 6, doit dispara\u00eetre sur le principe qu'elle a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e par le gouvernement, il en r\u00e9sultera que le contrat sign\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 en entier et remplac\u00e9 par celui qui r\u00e9sulte de l'acceptation des soumissions des Appelants et de toutes les modifications qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites du consentement des parties dans le cours des ouvrages pour en d\u00e9terminer la quantit\u00e9 et le prix.\nDans le but d'\u00e9tablir qu'il y avait eu abandon des conditions de d\u00e9lai, de confiscations et de p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 donn\u00e9 des citations des ordres en conseil adopt\u00e9s au sujet de l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux des deux sections Nos 3 et 6; mais je n'en ai donn\u00e9 que les parties faisant voir qu'il y avait eu abandon de certaines conditions; je vais maintenant r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux parties de ces m\u00eames ordres en conseil, portant particuli\u00e8rement sur la modification du prix stipul\u00e9 par le contrat sign\u00e9. Je r\u00e9f\u00e9rerai aussi \u00e0 la correspondance et aux t\u00e9moignages dans le m\u00eame but.\nLe plus important de tous ces ordres en conseil est sans contredit celui du 20 septembre 1870, ainsi con\u00e7u:\nThe Committee of Council have had under consideration the communication dated 20th September, 1870, from the Intercolonial Railway Commissioners, representing the hardships to the contractors of the present system upon which the monthly estimates of work done on the several sections are made up, and the heavy percentage unnecessarily retained from them, and recommending that the Engineer be instructed to make the returns of quantities actually executed fully equal to the work actually done each month, and that no deduction of 10 per cent. from the schedule prices be made for errors, omissions and contingencies.\nThe Committee, on the recommendation of the Hon. the Minister of Public Works, advise that the foregoing recommendations be approved and acted on; and that in the certificate required to be given by the Chief Engineer, that officer be at liberty to state that the percentage is relinquished in compliance with instructions from the Commissioners.\nCet ordre d'un caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et permanent autorise l'ing\u00e9nieur \u00e0 faire rapport des quantit\u00e9s d'ouvrages actuellement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, sans d\u00e9duction de 10 p. c. de la c\u00e9dule de prix, pour erreurs, omissions ou autres circonstances. C'\u00e9tait une d\u00e9rogation manifeste aux prix du contrat, introduisant le syst\u00e8me de payer la valeur des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s et rev\u00eatant ainsi les contracteurs de l'autorisation du gouvernement pour tous les ouvrages faits, sans \u00e9gard aux conditions du contrat. Il n'est gu\u00e8re possible de lui donner une autre interpr\u00e9tation. C'est d'ailleurs ainsi que l'ont compris les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es qui s'y sont conform\u00e9es jusqu'au moment du diff\u00e9rend qui a amen\u00e9 la suspension des ouvrages. Les ordres en conseil subs\u00e9quents au lieu de r\u00e9voquer ce nouvel arrangement n'ont fait que le confirmer en faisant d'autres changements d'une nature encore plus favorable aux Appelants.\nComme on l'a vu par le jugement de l'honorable juge les Appelants avaient eu raison de se plaindre de l'insuffisance des rapports des ing\u00e9nieurs au sujet des quantit\u00e9s d'ouvrage ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s devant servir de base au paiement. L'absence de plans devant servir de guide aux contracteurs pour d\u00e9terminer les quantit\u00e9s et la qualit\u00e9 des ouvrages entrepris, fut la cause que les difficult\u00e9s continu\u00e8rent entre les ing\u00e9nieurs et les contracteurs; ces derniers se plaignaient que les premiers exigeaient des ouvrages plus dispendieux que ceux qu'ils eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de faire d'apr\u00e8s les plans qui devaient faire partie du contrat. Afin d'en arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement de ces difficult\u00e9s, M. Fleming, \u00e0 la demande de plusieurs contracteurs et entre autres les Appelants, repr\u00e9senta au gouvernement que les certificats mensuels \u00e9taient insuffisants pour payer les d\u00e9penses actuellement encourues, et s'exprimait ainsi dans sa lettre du 27 septembre 1871:\nWith regard to the monthly certificates not furnishing the Contractors with sufficient funds to pay current expenses, I may observe that as these certificates are made up by computing the actual quantities of work executed at prices established by Order in Council, I have no power to vary them in any manner, and the only way to increase the certificates is for the Government to increase the prices which govern them. I reported at some length on the whole subject on 26th May last and again on 26th July, to which letters I beg to refer. Some assistance was then granted to the Contractors, and this assistance has undoubtedly been of great service in enabling them to push on the work with much greater vigor than previously, and I have much pleasure in stating that the work executed so far has, with very few exceptions indeed, been done in a satisfactory manner. In the letters referred to, I submitted the reasons why I thought it would be much better, under all the circumstances, for the Government to come to the assistance of the present contractors than to take the work out of their hands and re-let it to others. I am still very much of the same opinion, and in order to secure the completion of the railway with the least difficulty and delay having regard at the same time to economy, I would recommend still further aid to those Contractors who have special difficulties to contend with.\nSe fondant sur cette lettre les commissaires firent rapport au Conseil Priv\u00e9 sur les r\u00e9clamations des contracteurs et repr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent qu'une grande partie des travaux se faisaient dans un pays peu habit\u00e9 et difficile d'acc\u00e8s; que plusieurs de ces contrats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s lorsque les prix du travail et des mat\u00e9riaux \u00e9taient beaucoup plus bas; que les d\u00e9penses pr\u00e9liminaires, b\u00e2tisses, outillage, etc., avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9rables; qu'ils avaient discut\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement les questions avec l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef; qu'il \u00e9tait clair que si les contrats \u00e9taient donn\u00e9s de nouveau ils co\u00fbteraient beaucoup plus que les contrats actuels, sans compter les longs d\u00e9lais qui s'ensuivraient; que l'ouvrage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante et recommandait une nouvelle aide aux contracteurs qui avaient \u00e0 lutter contre des difficult\u00e9s particuli\u00e8res.\nLes commissaires, apr\u00e8s m\u00fbre consid\u00e9ration, recommand\u00e8rent que pour les contrats entre Metis et Bathurst et la section n\u00b0 12, il serait pr\u00e9par\u00e9 avec soin un estim\u00e9 de l'ouvrage qu'il restait encore \u00e0 faire pour terminer les entreprises; et que d'apr\u00e8s les quantit\u00e9s ainsi v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es une nouvelle c\u00e9dule de prix serait faite pour les quantit\u00e9s. Le lendemain de ce rapport, le 28 septembre 1871, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 adopta un ordre en conseil confirmant ce rapport et accordant l'autorit\u00e9 de\" mand\u00e9e en ces termes: \"Having reference to the expediency \"of extending to the contractors on the line \"every reasonable facility in the prosecution of their \"work, advised, &c.\"\nEn cons\u00e9quence de cet ordre en conseil une nouvelle c\u00e9dule augmentant consid\u00e9rablement les prix fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9e pour servir de base aux paiements qui devaient \u00eatre faits. De temps en temps de nouvelles augmentations de prix furent d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9es par d'autres ordres en conseil, que l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef mit \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution en informant le gouvernement que la cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire de ces augmentations auraient pour effet d'exc\u00e9der la somme totale mentionn\u00e9e au contrat. Dans son t\u00e9moignage (p. 20 et 21) M. Fleming dit \u00e0 propos des nouveaux prix:\u2014\nI think they were continued from the date of an Order in Council to that of the other without any reduction. I believe so. I acted upon the Orders of Council in every case so far as I can remember.\nLa demande des contracteurs pour les augmentations de prix, recommand\u00e9e par l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef et les commissaires et accept\u00e9e par l'ordre en conseil du 23 septembre 1871 et ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus apr\u00e8s cette \u00e9poque, dans le but de permettre aux contracteurs d'ex\u00e9cuter leurs entreprises et d'\u00e9viter des d\u00e9lais, ne forme-telle pas un contrat complet qui doit lier le gouvernement? C'est comme le dit M. Fleming, l'in\u00e9vitable cons\u00e9quence de l'adoption de cet ordre en conseil au sujet duquel il s'exprime ainsi:\u2014\nQuestion.\u2014Did you not yourself inform those contractors that you considered this new payment as a new basis, or new departure, as intended to increase the bulk sum of the contracts?\nAnswer.\u2014The moment the Order in Council was passed, without knowing its legal effect, I felt that in the common sense point of view it entirely altered the contract.\nQuestion.\u2014It practically altered the contract then?\nAnswer.\u2014Yes, and so far as I was concerned in making out the certificates, it was an entirely new contract to me.\nQuestion.\u2014Do you know yourself, or have you any means of knowing whether these additional payments made the contractors, was an inducement to them to go on with the work at the period when they were on the point of giving it up?\nAnswer.\u2014The increase was undoubtedly to induce them to go on.\nDans une lettre adress\u00e9e par lui \u00e0 M. John S. Fry, l'une des cautions des Appelants, il dit encore: \"I \"invariably acted on those Orders in Council considering \"them in the light of new contracts as far as making \"out my certificates were concerned.\"\nLes prix augment\u00e9s par les ordres en conseil furent communiqu\u00e9s aux Appelants sans aucune restriction et ils avaient le droit d'interpr\u00e9ter cette action du gouvernement comme un acquiescement absolu \u00e0 leur demande. Les ordres en conseil eux-m\u00eames ne leur furent point communiqu\u00e9s, comme le dit positivement M. Berlinguet, de sorte qu'ils ne furent jamais en position de s'assurer si l'un de ces ordres, en date du 27 juillet 1871 et l'autre du 20 janvier 1872, contenait la r\u00e9serve que l'augmentation des prix n'aurait cependant pas l'effet de d\u00e9passer la somme totale du contrat. Celui du 28 septembre 1871, qui avait fait droit \u00e0 leur demande, ne contenait aucune restriction de ce genre. A moins d'en informer les Appelants, le gouvernement ne pouvait pas changer la position qu'il leur avait faite. Il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 contraire \u00e0 la bonne foi de les laisser continuer les travaux sous l'impression qu'on avait fait droit \u00e0 leurs demandes, tandis que les ordres contenaient une condition qui n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e, si elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e. Ce serait faire injure au gouvernement que de supposer qu'il e\u00fbt voulu tendre un pi\u00e8ge \u00e0 des contracteurs, qu'il avait, dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat, encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 continuer leurs travaux. Bien que cette r\u00e9serve se trouve dans les ordres du 27 juillet 1871 et du 20 janvier 1872, le gouvernement n'en ayant jamais donn\u00e9 communication aux Appelants, il faut en conclure qu'il s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9serve comme \u00e9tant contraire \u00e0 sa d\u00e9termination de venir au secours des contracteurs. Tous les ordres changeant les prix doivent donc recevoir leur plein et entier effet comme si cette r\u00e9serve n'y e\u00fbt jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 ins\u00e9r\u00e9e. S'il en \u00e9tait autrement, le gouvernement, apr\u00e8s avoir emp\u00each\u00e9 les Appelants de renoncer \u00e0 leur entreprise pour \u00e9viter une ruine compl\u00e8te, se trouverait \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de sommes consid\u00e9rables par un moyen contraire \u00e0 la bonne foi. Il me semble que la seule conclusion \u00e0 tirer de ces documents et de l'action du gouvernement, c'est que les prix ont \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9s, comme le comporte les ordres en conseil, en vertu d'engagements obligatoires et qui doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s comme un contrat. L'honorable juge Taschereau objecte \u00e0 cette conclusion comme contraire \u00e0 l'acte 31 Vic., chap. 13, r\u00e9glant la mani\u00e8re de faire les contrats pour la construction de l'Intercolonial; mais le gouvernement s'y est conform\u00e9 autant qu'il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible. Si les circonstances l'ont forc\u00e9 d'adopter certaines modifications au contrat pass\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'acte en question, n'est-il pas prouv\u00e9, comme justification, par la correspondance, par les ordres en conseil et par le t\u00e9moignage de M. Fleming, que ces modifications \u00e9taient indispensables dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public; qu'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 plus dispendieux de chercher d'autres contracteurs que de laisser continuer ceux qui, d'apr\u00e8s les nombreux rapports de l'ing\u00e9nieur et des commissaires, donn\u00e8rent une si grande satisfaction; qu'un tel changement aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais consid\u00e9rables dans l'ex\u00e9cution d'une entreprise que le gouvernement consid\u00e9rait comme du plus grand int\u00e9r\u00eat public de r\u00e9aliser le plus t\u00f4t possible. Si la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 a forc\u00e9 le gouvernement de d\u00e9roger aux prescriptions du statut, qui en doit \u00eatre responsable? Ce n'est certes pas les contracteurs. N'est-ce pas le gouvernement plut\u00f4t que les contracteurs qui n'ont fait qu'ex\u00e9cuter ses ordres?\nDe plus ces travaux ont continu\u00e9 pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es et le parlement chaque ann\u00e9e en votant les sommes pay\u00e9es aux contracteurs a bien et duement approuv\u00e9 ces modifications au contrat pass\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment au statut.\nLes Appelants ont fait entendre plusieurs t\u00e9moins pour prouver que sir Hector Langevin, alors ministre des travaux publics, avait, dans diff\u00e9rentes entrevues avec les Appelants, MM. Dunn et Home, MM. Glover et Fry, leurs cautions, en r\u00e9ponse aux repr\u00e9sentations qu'ils lui firent sur leurs embarras financiers, recommand\u00e9 aux Appelants de ne pas abandonner leur contrat, que le gouvernement n'avait pas l'intention de construire l'Intercolonial aux d\u00e9pens des particuliers, et que s'ils terminaient leur contrat, ils seraient indemnis\u00e9s de leurs pertes. M. John Ross qui avan\u00e7ait les fonds aux Appelants jure positivement que sir Hector Langevin lui a dit qu'il pouvait en toute s\u00fbret\u00e9 continuer ses avances et qu'il en serait rembours\u00e9. Ce t\u00e9moignage est confirm\u00e9 par au moins cinq autres t\u00e9moins.\nSir Hector, entendu comme t\u00e9moin, a ni\u00e9 cette conversation et en a donn\u00e9 la version suivante,\u2014il reconna\u00eet avoir dit seulement qu'il \u00e9tait de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des contracteurs de finir leurs contrats, ce qui \u00e9viterait des retards dans l'ex\u00e9cution des ouvrages et augmenterait les chances de voir leur r\u00e9clamation favorablement accord\u00e9e et r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par le gouvernement. Tous les t\u00e9moins qui ont rapport\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration ainsi contredite sont de la plus haute respectabilit\u00e9 et auraient d\u00fb, par leur nombre, faire pencher la balance de la preuve en faveur des Appelants. Mais peu importe. Ceux-ci ne pr\u00e9tendent pas que si l'autre version pr\u00e9valait, elle \u00e9tablissait un contrat. Pour servir leur objet, la version de sir Hector leur suffit, car ils ont principalement en vue de prouver que les changements faits par les ordres en conseil n'\u00e9taient pas seulement une aide temporaire, mais un r\u00e8glement des difficult\u00e9s s\u00e9rieuses qui \u00e9taient soumises au gouvernement. L'admission de sir Hector confirme cette mani\u00e8re de voir, en faisant conna\u00eetre les dispositions du gouvernement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des Appelants. Tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de me porte \u00e0 conclure que l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux devaient \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s le contrat qui r\u00e9sulte des ordres en conseil.\nMais, en supposant que le contrat sign\u00e9 le 25 mai 1870, doive d\u00e9terminer les obligations respectives des parties, ne faudrait-il pas au moins prouver que les ing\u00e9nieurs et autres agents du gouvernement charg\u00e9s de la surveillance et de la conduite des travaux, n'ont point syst\u00e9matiquement commis d'infractions \u00e0 ce contrat dans le but de nuire aux Appelants. Une des clauses du contrat donne \u00e0 l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef la direction des travaux, et oblige les Appelants \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision, ainsi qu'\u00e0 celle de tous ceux qui agissent d'apr\u00e8s ses ordres. On con\u00e7oit qu'en l'absence de plans, et lorsque, comme il est amplement prouv\u00e9, les plans des principales structures n'\u00e9taient faits que pendant la construction et souvent livr\u00e9s aux contracteurs qu'apr\u00e8s bien des demandes r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es et de longs d\u00e9lais, il \u00e9tait facile \u00e0 un ing\u00e9nieur hostile aux contracteurs de leur rendre impossible l'ex\u00e9cution de leur contrat. Il est reconnu qu'\u00e0 moins qu'un ing\u00e9nieur ne soit d'une grande impartialit\u00e9, les contracteurs sont toujours \u00e0 sa merci et peuvent \u00eatre facilement ruin\u00e9s par lui.\nLes Appelants se plaignent que M. Marcus Smith, ing\u00e9nieur en charge des deux sections Nos 3 et 6, a, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, fait preuve \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard de sentiments hostiles et de violents pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s qui se sont manifest\u00e9s par de continuelles injustices, constituant une violation syst\u00e9matique et volontaire du contrat (tortious breach), rendant le gouvernement responsable des cons\u00e9quences qui en sont r\u00e9sult\u00e9es. Malgr\u00e9 une preuve compl\u00e8te, je puis dire, de ces griefs, l'honorable juge a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cette question de faits contre les Appelants, bien que la direction des travaux e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e \u00e0 Smith, en cons\u00e9quence de leurs justes plaintes. Apr\u00e8s examen de la preuve, je suis forc\u00e9 d'en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que l'honorable juge n'a pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette preuve l'importance qu'elle m\u00e9ritait et qu'il a bas\u00e9 son opinion sur une preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, insuffisante et d'un caract\u00e8re moins d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 que celle faite par les Appelants.\nL'ing\u00e9nieur M. Smith, qui est prouv\u00e9 \u00eatre d'un caract\u00e8re tr\u00e8s irascible, avait une cause toute particuli\u00e8re d'animosit\u00e9 contre les Appelants, parce que ceux-ci, en prenant les contrats des sections 3 et 6, qu'il avait voulu faire avoir \u00e0 quelques amis d'Angleterre, \u00e9taient la cause qu'il avait \u00e9prouv\u00e9 un grand d\u00e9sappointement qu'il manifesta devant le t\u00e9moin C. Lorgie Armstrong, qui rapporta une conversation avec M. Smith \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 l'occasion d'une observation faite par Armstrong sur l'insuffisance des paiements dont se plaignait Berlinguet:\nAnswer.\u2014He said they had got all they deserved or entitled to. I remarked, it is rather a hard case; they scarcely get money enough to pay their hands. He observed\u2014I sent in a contract for that same section for my friends in England, and if they had got it they would have had plenty of funds to carry on the business without drawing on the Government until it was finished. He added\u2014these d\u2014\u2014d little Canadians are the cause of my not getting it.\nQuestion.\u2014Did he tell you the names of his friends in England?\nAnswer.\u2014No; I asked, how could you act as an engineer in that case? He answered\u2014I should have resigned my situation and gone on with these works.\nCe t\u00e9moin, qui est \u00e2g\u00e9 et d'une grande respectabilit\u00e9, ne saurait \u00eatre accus\u00e9 d'avoir invent\u00e9 de toute pi\u00e8ce une conversation de ce genre. Un autre t\u00e9moin en rapporte une autre d'un genre diff\u00e9rent, mais d\u00e9montrant que Smith n'oubliait pas son d\u00e9sappointement:\nQuestion.\u2014Did you ever hear Marcus Smith say anything regarding these contractors?\nAnswer.\u2014Yes\u2014that they were nothing but d\u2014\u2014d French fools that would not be long on the works?\nQuestion\u2014Where did you hear him say this?\nAnswer.\u2014In Dan Delaney's, in a private room, it was in company with John Hamilton of Dalhousie, and a few more.\nDans une autre circonstance rapport\u00e9e par L. H. Honor\u00e9 Huot, t\u00e9moin de la plus grande respectabilit\u00e9, M. Smith s'est laiss\u00e9 aller contre Berlinguet \u00e0 de tels exc\u00e8s de paroles que les personnes pr\u00e9sentes furent oblig\u00e9es d'entrer dans la maison. Il s'agissait d'une visite que M. Davey d\u00e9sirait faire des sections 3 et 6. Le t\u00e9moin rapporte ainsi la sc\u00e8ne.\nM. Smith voulait que ce fut M. Berlinguet lui-m\u00eame qui lui fit visiter ces sections. M. Berlinguet lui r\u00e9pondit que c'\u00e9tait le capitaine Armstrong qui devait lui faire visiter ces sections et qu'une voiture \u00e9tait pr\u00eate pour cela. M. Smith s'est alors f\u00e2ch\u00e9, et s'est servi de telles expressions que nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s de rentrer dans la maison et nous avons laiss\u00e9 M. Berlinguet vider seul la querelle avec M. Smith.\nAjoutez \u00e0 toutes ces manifestations violentes le t\u00e9moignage de M. John Home qui prouve des faits tels qu'on h\u00e9siterait \u00e0 les croire, si l'honorabilit\u00e9 de ce t\u00e9moin n'\u00e9tait pas si g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement connue. Il n'y a rien de prouv\u00e9 qui puisse diminuer la foi due \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage. C'est un homme tr\u00e8s intelligent, vers\u00e9 dans les affaires et poss\u00e9dant la confiance d'hommes de la plus haute responsabilit\u00e9 dans Qu\u00e9bec, Il rapporte que dans un entretien chez lui avec Smith, celui-ci lui dit:\nIf Davey is here it is just as easy for him to save you a half a million dollars as anything at all, says he, and without any disparagement to the Government. The Government will not have anything to find fault with the road, and you will get quit of the Frenchmen that don't know anything at all about building roads.\nSmith a ni\u00e9 cette conversation, et l'honorable juge, il est vrai, a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 croire la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation de Smith qui a \u00e9galement ni\u00e9 ses conversations avec Armstrong et autres t\u00e9moins qui ont fait preuve de ses dispositions hostiles \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des contracteurs. Est-il possible d'ajouter foi \u00e0 ses d\u00e9n\u00e9gations, lorsque tant de t\u00e9moins irr\u00e9prochables affirment ce qu'il a dit.\nIl est inutile d'entrer dans de plus grands d\u00e9tails sur ce sujet, car la lecture de la preuve fera voir que ces reproches contre Smith sont prouv\u00e9s de la mani\u00e8re la plus satisfaisante. Ces dispositions qui ont inspir\u00e9 Smith dans sa conduite \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des contracteurs, l'ont port\u00e9 \u00e0 des exigences de nature \u00e0 amener leur ruine. On comprend mieux apr\u00e8s cela sa lettre du 23 ao\u00fbt 1870, donnant des instructions \u00e0 l'ing\u00e9nieur de section, Lawson, et se terminant par les lignes suivantes:\n\"You must, however, do all that is necessary, regardless of quantities, \"as there is a large amount for contingencies, and, anyhow, \"the contract will probably have to be re-let.\"\nPlus loin, il fait rapport aux commissaires qu'il n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucun progr\u00e8s dans les ouvrages de ma\u00e7onnerie, et qu'en proportion du progr\u00e8s fait, cela prendrait vingt et un ans pour terminer la ma\u00e7onnerie des sections 3, 6 et 9, et que les contrats ne peuvent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s\u2014\"the contract must fail.\" Cependant, les rapports des commissaires et les ordres en conseil dont de nombreux extraits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s plus haut, constatent \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que les travaux progressaient d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante. De nombreux t\u00e9moins entendus de la part d\u00e8s Appelants ont aussi prouv\u00e9 ce fait. Etait-il possible de contredire plus positivement les assertions de Smith. Si son hostilit\u00e9 ne se fut manifest\u00e9e qu'en paroles, il n'y aurait que peu de chose \u00e0 en dire, mais elle se traduisait par des faits de la plus haute gravit\u00e9, soit en ne faisant pas faire rapport correctement des quantit\u00e9s de travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, ainsi que le jugement le reconna\u00eet en accordant une indemnit\u00e9 en se basant sur ces motifs, soit en faisant faire des travaux beaucoup plus dispendieux que ceux voulus par le contrat, ou m\u00eame des ouvrages inutiles, en n\u00e9gligeant de fournir les plans des ouvrages et causant ainsi des retards tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9judiciables, en condamnant des carri\u00e8res de pierre, approuv\u00e9es plus tard, en rejetant le ciment et d'autres mat\u00e9riaux pour des motifs futiles. Il y a \u00e0 ce sujet une preuve consid\u00e9rable dans les \u00e9normes volumes qui contiennent les t\u00e9moignages en cette cause. Lors de l'audition, les conseils des Appelants ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils n'entraient pas dans les d\u00e9tails de cette preuve, et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aussi qu'ils ne consid\u00e9raient pas la Cour oblig\u00e9e pour le pr\u00e9sent d'en faire une \u00e9tude particuli\u00e8re. En effet, cet examen ne peut devenir n\u00e9cessaire que dans le cas o\u00f9 la cour serait d'avis, soit que le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 ou modifi\u00e9 du consentement des parties, ou qu'il y a eu a tortious breach donnant aux Appelants droit d'\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 de leurs travaux. Il y a encore une autre raison pour ne pas entrer maintenant dans ces d\u00e9tails, c'est que la preuve a \u00e9tabli positivement qu'il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu compte des travaux extr\u00e0 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9s pour les d\u00e9viations ou changements de niveau de la voie et au sujet desquels il faudra, dans tous les cas, ordonner une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 experts.\nAu sujet de ces extr\u00e0, le jugement de la cour d'Echiquier contient une erreur si palpable et d'une cons\u00e9quence si importante pour les Appelants que seule, elle suffirait pour le faire infirmer.\nL'honorable juge dans le parapraphe 34 de son jugement dit:\nBut I state it with regret: The contract constitutes the law, the contractors submitted to all its clauses, they renounced every claim for extras, all damages, &c.\nAu paragraphe 36, l'honorable juge r\u00e9p\u00e8te cette assertion en disant:\nSupposing moreover that the proof was clear, all indemnity should be refused to the contractors in consequence of the clauses so onerous and so strict of the contract by which they (the contractors) renounced all damages, all extr\u00e0s, and even the balance due to them if they gave up their contract or did not complete it in time prescribed.\nL'honorable juge n'a pu en venir \u00e0 cette conclusion que parce que son attention n'a peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisamment attir\u00e9e sur l'effet que la continuation des travaux, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le contrat, avec l'approbation du gouvernement et la promesse r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e du gouvernement d'en payer la pleine valeur comme le d\u00e9montre les rapports et les ordres en conseils devait avoir sur les clauses concernant la confiscation et l'annulation du contrat. On ne trouve pas \u00e0 ce sujet une seule observation dans son jugement. Apr\u00e8s avoir vu par les autorit\u00e9s ci-dessus, que le gouvernement n'ayant pas dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le contrat exerc\u00e9 les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e9raient ces clauses, il n'\u00e9tait plus en son pouvoir de le faire, il faut en arriver \u00e0 une conclusion contraire \u00e0 celle de l'honorable juge. L'annulation ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement prononc\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai convenu, elle ne peut produire aucun effet, elle ne peut op\u00e9rer ni confiscation ni renonciation aux extr\u00e0. Comme le d\u00e9montrent les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es, le d\u00e9lai pass\u00e9, le gouvernement ne pouvait plus annuler le contrat et s'emparer des travaux comme il l'a fait. Il ne lui restait plus que le recours ordinaire aux tribunaux pour faire ordonner aux contracteurs que les travaux seraient termines dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable que, dans les circonstances o\u00f9 se trouvaient les parties, la cour avait seule alors le pouvoir de fixer.\nAinsi, la renonciation pr\u00e9tendue aux extras n'ayant aucun effet, les Appelants avaient droit \u00e0 tous les extras que la clause 4 du contrat permet de r\u00e9clamer. Apr\u00e8s avoir autoris\u00e9 certains changements qui ne devaient pas donner lieu \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer des indemnit\u00e9s, la clause continue:\nAnd the contractors shall not be entitled to any allowance by reason of such changes unless such changes consist in alterations in the grades or the line of location, &c., &c......\nLa confiscation prononc\u00e9e par le jugement \u00e9tant ill\u00e9gale, il faut examiner la preuve faite au sujet du changement de niveau et de location de la ligne du chemin de (change of grade and location of the line). La preuve de ces changements et leur estimation d'apr\u00e8s le devis (bill of works) constate qu'il y en a eu pour environ $28,000 auxquelles les Appelants auraient droit d'apr\u00e8s la stipulation du contrat. On peut v\u00e9rifier cette estimation en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux appendices A, p.p. 2 et 8; B, p. 2; C, p. 1; D, 1, Book of correspondence, p. 271a, p. 323, et aux t\u00e9moignages suivants:\nAPPELLANT'S EVIDENCE,\u2014Berlinguet: p. 5, l. 5; 27, l. 22; Fleming: pp. 46d, l. 30; 47d, l. 20; Fitzgerald: pp. 59d, l. 30; 60d, l. 1, 26; 61d, l. 4, 32; 62d, l. 1; 63d, l. 1, 12; Report.

La Couronne, dans cette cause, a acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 mon jugement, et comme les faits sont semblables dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, je suis d'opinion que les p\u00e9titionnaires ont le m\u00eame droit d'obtenir une expertise.\nMais comme il est en preuve qu'il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu par les ing\u00e9nieurs aucun compte de ces extras, qu'ils ont fait rapport des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s sans jamais faire la distinction entre ceux du contrat et ceux qui \u00e9taient des extras, concernant les changements de niveau et de location de la ligne, la valeur de ces travaux se trouve avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e \u00e0 m\u00eame le prix du contrat, au lieu d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en outre de ce prix. La d\u00e9fense a essay\u00e9 de faire une preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu'il y avait eu dans le cours des travaux une compensation d'op\u00e9r\u00e9e en tenant compte des augmentations et des diminutions; mais cet avanc\u00e9 n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 imagin\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s coup par certains ing\u00e9nieurs pour pallier l'injustice et l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de leur conduite. Ils sont tous forc\u00e9s d'admettre qu'ils n'ont jamais, dans leurs rapports, fait la distinction entre les travaux qui devaient \u00eatre pay\u00e9s extr\u00e0 et ceux qui devaient l'\u00eatre \u00e0 m\u00eame le prix du contrat. Il est \u00e9vident que leur explication est fausse et qu'ils n'ont pas \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard rendu justice aux contracteurs.\nAu sujet de ces pr\u00e9tendues diminutions qui auraient compens\u00e9 les augmentations, un avanc\u00e9 de M. Fleming m\u00e9rite une attention particuli\u00e8re. Se fondant sur son t\u00e9moignage, le juge a pris pour av\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il y a eu en faveur des contracteurs une diminution d'ouvrage qu'ils auraient d\u00fb faire en vertu de leur contrat, se montant \u00e0 la somme de $178,000. Le t\u00e9moin ne s'est pas clairement exprim\u00e9, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cause de l'erreur commise par l'honorable juge. Quoique un peu longue, je citerai une partie de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce sujet. Question.\u2014So in this instance the operation consisted in not charging the contractors with the occasional deductions?\nAnswer.\u2014That is a matter of fact. The changes were with scarcely an exception, in the shape of deductions, and not of increase, and for the benefit of the Contractors. There is no exception to the rule in the case of these two sections. With regard to the reductions we succeeded in making in the works, I can only refer to what may be called works, such as masonry, clearing, grubbing, fencing, rock excavations and so on; the original schedule of quantities, moneyed out at certain prices made these works amount in all to $380,659 on Contract 3. The same works actually executed, and moneyed out at the same prices, comes to $265,659, in other words there was a saving effected, at those prices, of $115,000.\nQuestion.\u2014That shows the difference between the work that the Bill of Works called for and the amount performed.\nAnswer.\u2014Assuming these calculations correct, it shows a very considerable reduction. On Contract 6 the reduction is not so great, but still it amounts to $63,000 arrived at in the same way.\nQuestion.\u2014So the saving by these reductions would be about $178,000.\nAnswer.\u2014Yes. The last returns of quantities I received, dated July '70. There may have been some changes since that would affect the amounts named, but to what extent I can't tell.\nOn voit que M. Fleming a bas\u00e9 cette assertion sur la c\u00e9dule des quantit\u00e9s, estim\u00e9es \u00e0 des prix qui donnaient en tout la somme de $380,659 pour le contrat n\u00b0 3. Ces ouvrages ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, estim\u00e9s aux m\u00eames prix, ne se montent qu'\u00e0 la somme de $265,659. Pour se faire bien comprendre, M Fleming aurait d\u00fb faire ici une distinction essentielle, et dire que les quantit\u00e9s estim\u00e9es par lui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la base des contrats. Les contracteurs ne se sont nullement oblig\u00e9s de remplir les quantit\u00e9s qu'il avait, comme il le dit lui-m\u00eame, estim\u00e9es \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s:\u2014\nWe could not pretend to give exact quantities. In most cases, they were a good deal greater than strictly necessary.\nLeur contrat \u00e9tait de construire 45 milles de chemin de fer, suivant les plans et devis, sans aucune obligation de se conformer au (bill of works) \u00e0 la c\u00e9dule des quantit\u00e9s. Ainsi, la pr\u00e9tendue r\u00e9duction n'est pas faite sur les ouvrages du contrat, mais elle est simplement la diff\u00e9rence entre l'estim\u00e9 probable des quantit\u00e9s fait (bill of works) par M. Fleming, et les quantit\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour la construction du chemin de fer d'apr\u00e8s les plans et devis. M. Fleming savait mieux que qui que ce soit que les contracteurs n'\u00e9taient pas oblig\u00e9s de remplir ces quantit\u00e9s; que, par cons\u00e9quent, ce qu'il pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre une r\u00e9duction de $178,000 n'en est pas une sur les ouvrages du contrat. Il aurait d\u00fb dire plus clairement que cette somme de $178,000 ne repr\u00e9sentait que le surplus de son estimation, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'erreur qu'il avait commise en voulant errer du bon c\u00f4t\u00e9. M Brydges a commis la m\u00eame erreur. Ainsi, cette pr\u00e9tendue r\u00e9duction n'est qu'un leurre et ne repr\u00e9sente pas une diminution d'un centin. Cependant, cette assertion a produit un grand effet sur l'honorable juge qui a pens\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu une r\u00e9duction r\u00e9elle de ce montant, et en a conclu qu'il devait y avoir compensation des r\u00e9clamations des Appelants jusqu'au moins \u00e0 concurrence des $178,000. Cette erreur \u00e9vidente dans le jugement doit \u00eatre reform\u00e9e, et les Appelants d\u00e9clar\u00e9s avoir droit au prix de leurs ouvrages extras.\nLe gouvernement ayant ill\u00e9galement annul\u00e9 le contrat, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 plus haut, pour s'emparer des travaux, aurait d\u00fb tout au moins prendre les pr\u00e9cautions qu'exigeait de lui la prudence la plus ordinaire. M\u00eame si cette annulation e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, la plus simple justice demandait encore que l'on f\u00eet dans ce cas un \u00e9tat exact des travaux jusqu'alors accomplis par les contracteurs, afin de constater avec exactitude ce qui restait \u00e0 faire pour terminer le contrat; rien de cela n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Il n'a pas m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu compte des ouvrages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits sous la direction de M. Brydges pour terminer le chemin tel qu'il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 par le gouvernement. Un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des ouvrages ainsi faits, n'ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, il est tout \u00e0 fait impossible de savoir s'ils sont conformes au contrat. Il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucune preuve l\u00e9gale des ouvrages et de leurs prix.\nL'honorable juge s'est content\u00e9 du seul t\u00e9moignage de M. Brydges qui a donn\u00e9 son estimation du co\u00fbt des ouvrages, sans avoir aucune connaissance personnelle de leur ex\u00e9cution et sans avoir pris aucun des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour s'assurer de leurs quantit\u00e9s.\nQuestion. Have you got a statement of the amount of money that was paid by the Government to complete it?\nAnswer. It is in the book, I think. I think it is $197,000.\nQuestion. Altogether 3 and 6?\nAnswer. The Government expended on No. 3, $107,556.97, and on section 6,136, $915.60.\nQuestion. That was besides what had been paid to the contractors?\nAnswer. Yes.\nQuestion. What is the amount then expended by the Government over and above the contract price?\nAnswer. Including sums paid to the contractors and what the Government expended in finishing the excess over the lump sum of the contract on section 3, $197,127.60, and on No. 6, $62,959.60.\nIl est prouv\u00e9 par un document dans la cause que les contracteurs, le 30 septembre 1872, huit mois avant la prise de possession des travaux, par les commissaires ont fait faire un estim\u00e9 des ouvrages qui restaient \u00e0 faire d'apr\u00e8s le contrat. Cet estim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 sur des quantit\u00e9s fournies par le gouvernement et d\u00e9termin\u00e9es en la pr\u00e9sence des commissaires Walsh et Brydges et de l'ing\u00e9nieur, M. Bell et d'apr\u00e8s cet estim\u00e9 il restait des ouvrages pour un montant de $200,000. Il est vrai que dans le livre de correspondance (p. 303) on trouve un autre document produit par la d\u00e9fense, constatant qu'un estim\u00e9 des quantit\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en d\u00e9cembre 1872, et qui contredit le premier \u00e9tat, mais on n'a pas pris la peine de prouver par qui il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Bell dit bien qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par ses employ\u00e9s mais il ne peut jurer s'il est correct. Ses employ\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus comme t\u00e9moins, et on ne peut dire s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait d'apr\u00e8s les mesurages n\u00e9cessaires pour s'assurer des quantit\u00e9s, Les contracteurs n'en ont certainement pas eu connaissance.\nIl est aussi en preuve que du moment que les commissaires ont pris possession des travaux, on a cess\u00e9 de faire des rapports (comme ci-devant) des quantit\u00e9s d'ouvrages ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s et de l'endroit o\u00f9 l'ouvrage se faisait. Il \u00e9tait suffisant pour ordonner les paiements de recevoir la feuille de paye certifi\u00e9e par un conducteur. Ajoutez \u00e0 cela que les t\u00e9moins Stevenson, Townsend, Carmichael et d'autres s'accordent tous \u00e0 dire que la d\u00e9pense faite par le gouvernement \u00e0 partir de cette date a \u00e9t\u00e9 on ne peut plus extravagante.\nDans ces circonstances et malgr\u00e9 le fait que les contracteurs r\u00e9pudient toute responsabilit\u00e9 pour aucun paiement fait par le gouvernement, l'honorable juge a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir prononc\u00e9 la confiscation des montants qu'il reconnaissait \u00eatre dus par le gouvernement aux contracteurs, que ces derniers \u00e9taient endett\u00e9s envers Sa Majest\u00e9 en la somme de $159,000. Je n'h\u00e9sit\u0259 pas \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que je suis d'avis qu'il n'y a aucune preuve l\u00e9gale qui puisse justifier une telle condamnation et par cons\u00e9quent son jugement sur ce point important devrait \u00eatre infirm\u00e9, et une expertise ordonn\u00e9e, pour s'assurer par des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers, des quantit\u00e9s d'ouvrage qui restaient \u00e0 faire sur les travaux d'apr\u00e8s le contrat, le 11 juin 1873.\nL'honorable juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus difficile sur la nature de la preuve que les Appelants devaient faire de leur r\u00e9clamation. Il me semble avoir exig\u00e9 d'eux plus que la preuve ordinairement suffisante pour justifier une r\u00e9clamation de ce genre. Les Appelants ont fait preuve de leurs paiements par MM Blumhart, Turner, Bosteed, Woodside et par toutes les autres personnes qui ont pay\u00e9 le prix des ouvrages et mat\u00e9riaux qui forment le montant de cette r\u00e9clamation Tous ces t\u00e9moins en ont attest\u00e9 l'exactitude. Il est impossible d'entrer dans plus de d\u00e9tails et d'\u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis que l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les Appelants dans cette preuve \u00e0 laquelle, d'ailleurs, il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucune objection de la part de la couronne. La preuve me para\u00eet compl\u00e8te. La conclusion contraire de l'honorable juge est une erreur \u00e9vidente. Mais comme je suis d'avis qu'il doit y avoir, pour op\u00e9rer un r\u00e8glement complet, une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 experts sur certains points, je ne conclus pas maintenant \u00e0 une adjudication finale.\nUn des principaux chefs de la d\u00e9fense est ainsi formul\u00e9:\n29. The Suppliants are not entitled to any payment, except on certificate of the Engineer, and they, the Suppliants have been paid all that they have obtained the Engineer's certificate for.\nQuoique cette condition de fournir pr\u00e9alablement le certificat de l'ing\u00e9nieur n'est pas obligatoire pour ce qui peut \u00eatre d\u00fb pour dommages (breach of contract) ou pour la valeur des outillages, elle serait obligatoire pour une partie de la demande (condition precedent,) si le gouvernement, par la prise de possession ill\u00e9gale des travaux, n'avait lui-m\u00eame rendu impossible l'ex\u00e9cution de cette condition pr\u00e9alable En outre il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait un rapport par l'ing\u00e9nieur qu'il lui \u00e9tait impossible de certifier le montant d\u00fb aux contracteurs, parce qu'il n'avait pas d'information suffisante, Cependant il est pourvu par le contrat que les contracteurs ont droit \u00e0 un certificat bas\u00e9 sur des mesurages des ouvrages faits, ces mesurages n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faits n'\u00e9tait-il pas du devoir du gouvernement de les ordonner? De plus, je suis encore d'opinion comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit dans les causes de Isbester vs. La Reine,[13] que lors de la production de la pr\u00e9sente p\u00e9tition de droit, le gouvernement s'\u00e9tait mis dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'insister sur la production d'un certificat final de l'ing\u00e9nieur en chef, par le fait d'avoir aboli cet office par statut.\nDans la cause de Jones vs. Queen, cit\u00e9e pour \u00e9tablir la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de la production d'un tel certificat, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que le contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 en entier par le contracteur, qui avait produit sa r\u00e9clamation devant les commissaires, que ces derniers apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu le rapport et le certificat de l'ing\u00e9nieur recommand\u00e8rent qu'il fut pay\u00e9 au contractenr une somme, en sus du prix en bloc mentionn\u00e9 dans le contrat, pour extra, de $31,091.85 et firent rapport que le certificat de l'ing\u00e9nieur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 pour le surplus. Dans ce cas le gouvernement s'est conform\u00e9 en tout point aux termes de son contrat et je concours volontiers dans la d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en cette cause par l'honorable juge en chef.\nMais dans la pr\u00e9sente cause les faits sont bien diff\u00e9rents, il est prouv\u00e9 1\u00b0 que le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 par le gouvernement apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9; 2\u00b0 que le gouvernement avant et apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai pour terminer le contrat a autoris\u00e9 le paiement en plein de la valeur des ouvrages ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s par les appelants et qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en partie pay\u00e9s sans faire la distinction des ouvrages qui pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie du contrat et ceux qui \u00e9taient des ouvrages extr\u00e0; 3\u00b0 qu'avant que le contrat f\u00fbt annul\u00e9 les appelants ont produit une r\u00e9clamation pour ouvrages ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s et non pay\u00e9s, y compris les ouvrages extr\u00e0 sur lesquels d'apr\u00e8s les termes m\u00eames du contrat ils avaient le droit d'avoir la d\u00e9cision de l'ing\u00e9nieur; 4\u00b0 que par le fait du gouvernement ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir ce certificat; et 5\u00b0 que le gouvernement a admis en n'appelant pas de la d\u00e9cision de l'honorable juge Taschereau qu'ils \u00e9taient responsables pour breach of contract. Dans ces circonstances, je ne crois pas \u00eatre en contradiction avec la d\u00e9cision de l'honorable sir W. J. Ritchie dans la cause de Jones vs. La Reine en d\u00e9clarant que dans mon opinion la p\u00e9tition des Appelants devrait \u00eatre admise.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je crois avoir d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il y a dans le jugement soumis \u00e0 la revision de cette cour des erreurs qui en rendent l'infirmation in\u00e9vitable; le juge n'avait pas le pouvoir, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai du contrat expir\u00e9, de prononcer la confiscation des sommes suivantes: 1\u00b0 de $6,040 pour outillage vendu au gouvernement sur la section 3; 2\u00b0 la somme de $20,982, aussi pour outillage et mat\u00e9riaux vendus sur la section 6; 3\u00b0 celle de $5,850.90 qu'il avait accord\u00e9e comme indemnit\u00e9 pour les retards injustes que les Appelants avaient \u00e9prouv\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9ception de leurs paiements. Ces diverses sommes donnent un total de $32,873.25, auquel les Appelants ont un droit incontestable.\n2\u00b0 Il y a eu aussi erreur en consid\u00e9rant le contrat comme l\u00e9galement annul\u00e9 par le gouvernement, faute par les contracteurs d'avoir termin\u00e9 les travaux dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9. Cette annulation prononc\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le contrat aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e ill\u00e9gale et sans aucun effet quelconque.\n3\u00b0 Il y a encore erreur en d\u00e9clarant que la r\u00e9duction illusoire de $178,000 a d\u00fb op\u00e9rer la compensation des r\u00e9clamations des Appelants et en particulier des extras, tandis que les Appelants avaient droit \u00e0 certains extras. dont le compte n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n4\u00b0. Il y a une erreur manifeste dans l'adjudication de la somme de $159,000 comme \u00e9tant le montant d\u00e9pens\u00e9 par le gouvernement pour terminer les travaux, en sus des sommes d'argent qui devaient \u00eatre au cr\u00e9dit des contracteurs lors de l'annulation du contrat, tandis qu'il n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucune preuve l\u00e9gale.\n5\u00b0. Une autre erreur \u00e9vidente c'est la d\u00e9claration de l'honorable juge que les Appelants n'ont pas fait une preuve satisfaisante des items d\u00e9taill\u00e9s de leur r\u00e9clamation, tandis qu'il \u00e9tait impossible d'en faire une plus directe et plus compl\u00e8te.\n6\u00b0. Qu'enfin il y a erreur dans le jugement dont il est appel parce qu'il n'ordonne pas une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour d\u00e9terminer la quantit\u00e9 d'ouvrages extra faits pour changement de location, et de niveau dont il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu aucun compte mais dont la valeur s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve d'apr\u00e8s la preuve faite en cette cause \u00e0 environ $28,000. En cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9, que les appelants ont droit \u00e0 une adjudication en leur faveur, de la somme de $32,873.25; qu'une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 experts devrait avoir lieu 1o pour s'assurer, apr\u00e8s que les quantit\u00e9s auront \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es par mesurages, des paiements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits en \u00e0 compte des ouvrages compris dans le contrat, 2o. pour d\u00e9terminer la quantit\u00e9 d'ouvrages extr\u00e0 faits d'apr\u00e8s les ordres des ing\u00e9nieurs et dont le paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par l'ordre en conseil ordonnant le paiement de la valeur de tout ouvrage ex\u00e9cut\u00e9, 3o. pour d\u00e9terminer le co\u00fbt extr\u00e0 des ouvrages faits sur l'ordre des ing\u00e9nieurs que les contracteurs n'\u00e9taient pas tenus de faire sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, et 4o. enfin pour d\u00e9terminer la valeur des ouvrages qui restaient \u00e0 faire pour compl\u00e9ter le contrat lors de l'annulation du dit contrat par le gouvernement en juin 1878, le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY J.\u2014I concur in the views just expressed in this case by Mr. Justice Fournier, having had the opportunity of reading his notes, which are very exhaustive.\nSome of the enactments referred to by the learned Chief Justice I do not think apply. Where the government receives value in work done and they get it done after they were informed that they could not get it so done unless the fair value was paid, and subsequently accept it and use it, it is hardly necessary to say that I think the government ought to be made answerable for it. In the position we occupy here, it is known as matter of fact, that there was a great deal of looseness in the construction of the Intercolonial railway. The contractors were called upon through the engineers relying on the power given to them through the contract to do a great deal of extra work and the parties were bound to perform it. In this case we have reason to know it caused a great deal of injury to the contractors. I have carefully read over the evidence bearing on the circumstances under which the government finally took possession of the works, and I am of opinion that there was no power to forfeit any moneys then due to the contractors. The government had the power up to a certain time to enforce the forfeiture clause of the contract, but by their action they waived it. When the time for completion arrived, they said \"go on, we \"will increase your rates,\" and they did go on and suddenly the government say, \"we will not pay you for \"any extra work, because you did not complete the \"contract within the time specified.\" Under such circumstances, I am of opinion that to exact forfeitures would be doing a serious wrong, and such a conclusion is not warranted by authority. The parties were entitled to have their works measured and reported upon. True, estimates were made, but I cannot presume, after reading the evidence, that they were in favour of the contractors or in any way reliable, as measurements were not made.\nI think with my brother Fournier that it is a fair case for an expertise, and that therefore the appellants are entitled to a judgment of the court, but to what extent I am not prepared to say.\nI concur in the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Justice Fournier.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree in the judgment to be read by my brother Gwynne.\nAs to section four of the contract which has been referred to, I think there is no doubt that under that clause the contractors were entitled to no allowance.\nHis Lordship read section 4[14].\nThere is no contention that the contractors have ever obtained any certificate of the engineer for which they have not received money. On the contrary Mr. Berlinguet in his evidence admits that Mr. No\u00ebl, their agent at Ottawa, had received all moneys coming to them under the certificates of the engineer. Then under section 6 of the contract the commissoners were authorised (whenever it became necessary) to take any portion of the whole work out of the hands of the contractors and to complete it at the cost of the contractors. Now the suppliants seem to say \"because you \"have not taken the works out of our hands in 1871 \"you have no right to do so in 1873.\" How long would they then have to complete the works, two years, three, five, ten? I do not think this correct. In my opinion the commissioners had a perfect right to do what they did; they gave the contractors more delay than they were entitled to, and I cannot see how they can now complain. I find that they themselves in May, 1873, sent a letter to the commissioners stating that they were unable to proceed with the work. I have never heard it contended during the argument that the contractors complained that the contract had been unduly taken out of their hands, and I cannot see how they could have had any reason to complain. This being so it follows that the government have expended a large amount, and it was never objected that the monies paid out had been unduly paid. The evidence on this point being uncontradicted, I think it is sufficient, and therefore the judgment of the court below, finding that it cost, over the contract price, a sum of $159,000, should be affirmed. I have, however, no objection to agree with Mr. Justice Gwynne and vary the judgment by deducting from the amount awarded to the Crown the value of the plant.\nAs to the question of forfeiture, granting the suppliants are right in saying there can be no forfeiture under clause 3 of the contract, I think that under clause 6 the government are entitled to be paid whatever amount they paid out in order to complete the works.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The gist of the suppliants' petition of right is that certain orders in council passed during the progress of construction by the suppliants for the Dominion Government of sections three and six of the Intercolonial Railway, under a contract which had been executed by the suppliants, constituted a new contract, and wholly did away with and set aside the previous contract which had been executed by the suppliants.\nAfter referring to the orders in council relied upon, and the circumstances under which the suppliants alleged they came to be made, the petition of right proceeds, paragraph 28:\u2014\"That the said orders in council constituted a new basis of contract, were a fresh departure as explained to your suppliants by the chief engineer appointed by your Majesty for the building of the said Intercolonial railway, and that the said orders in council were, with the consent and under the instructions of your Majesty's government, communicated to your suppliants to give them an inducement to the prosecution until completion of the works of the said section.\n\"29. That owing to the persistence of the Queen's own engineer to harass and obstruct your suppliants in the execution of the works, and owing tohis determination to drive off your suppliants, Her Majesty's representatives, the said commissioners, in justice to your suppliants, did finally remove the said district engineer.\n\"30. That your suppliants were induced to continue the prosecution of the said works by the declaration aforesaid of your Majesty's chief engineer; that the advances and increase in prices provided by the said orders in council, were a departure from what he styled your suppliants contract, and not a mere change in the progress estimates or a mere temporary arrangement.\n\"31. That your suppliants were further induced to proceed with the said works by the assurance of your Majesty's Minister of Public Works, and of the members of your Majesty's government of the time being, to the effect that your Majesty's government were very anxious, in the public interest, that your suppliants should go on with the execution of the said works, and that should your suppliants complete the execution of the said works, your Majesty's government should see that your suppliant was paid in full their past and future advances for the said work.\n\"32. That there is now due and owing to your suppliants by Her Majesty's government, for money bon\u00e2 fide paid, laid out, and expended, in and about the building and constructing of the said sections three and six, under the circumstances above mentioned, a sum of five hundred and twenty-three thousand dollars.\"\nThe petition contained a count wherein the suppliants claimed the said sum on a quantum meruit for work and labor.\nThe Attorney General by his answer to the above petition of right, set out a contract executed by the suppliants, whereby they bound themselves to complete the said section number three for the bulk sum of $462,444 dollars, and said section number 6 for the bulk sum of $456,946.23 dollars. The answer further alleged that: On the 24th May, 1873, the suppliants addressed a letter to the Commissioners claiming for extra work large sums therein specified and stating that without receiving those sums they must stop all works, as they could not proceed any further, and the suppliants not being entitled to any such sums, and declaring that unless they received them immediately they could not proceed with the works, notices were served upon them in terms of the contract that the completion would be taken out of their hands, in which notices they acquiesced; that at the time of serving this notice, namely, on or about the 9th June, 1873, so generously had the suppliants been treated that there was unpaid on the contract price of section 3 the sum of $10,444 only, and on the contract price of section 6 the sum of $73,946 only, while on the other hand a large amount of work remained to be done far exceeding what those sums would pay for.\nThat the Commissioners thereupon proceeded to complete the said works under their own engineers and foremen, and necessarily expended in doing so the following sums, namely: On section 3, $107,556.97, and on section 6 the sum of $136,915 60, the result being that the suppliants have been overpaid in the two contracts the sum of $159,982.57.\nThe answer then denies the several special charges of wrong and injustice in the petition of right alleged to have been committed upon and obstruction caused to the suppliants in the petition of right alleged, or that any new contract had been entered into by the Government with the suppliants, and concluded by denying that there is now due and owing to the suppliants by Her Majesty's Government any sum whatever for any works executed, money paid out or otherwise, with respect to the said sections 3 and 6, but that on the contrary the suppliants have been overpaid the sum of $159,982.57, for which, under the terms of their contract, they are liable and chargeable, and the Attorney General claimed that the said sum is justly due to Her Majesty under the terms of the said contract, and that the suppliants should be ordered to pay the same.\nThe Attorney General also submitted and contended that the suppliants were not entitled to any payment except on the certificate of the engineer, and alleged that they had been paid all sums for which they had obtained the engineer's certificate. After a most patient and thorough investigation of every charge and complaint made by the suppliants in their petition of right, the learned judge before whom the case was tried in the Exchequer Court found every item of their complaint against the suppliants, and in a most exhaustive judgment, pronounced judgment for the Crown in the sum of $159,982.57 From this judgment the suppliants have appealed.\nMr. Girouard, one of the learned counsel for the appellants, in his argument before us, thus put the case: 1st. That a new contract had by the Orders in Council been made and substituted for the old one; and 2nd, he claimed for changes in grade and location as extra work.\nAs to the first of these claims he admitted that unless decided in the suppliants' favor the petition of right could not be sustained, but if decided in his favor then he claimed a reference as to the amount due.\nIn the very elaborate judgment of the learned judge who tried the case, to the effect that the claim, as asserted in the petition of right, is without foundation, I entirely concur. Indeed the claim that a new contract was in the manner stated substituted for the old contract could not be entertained without an utter disregard of the provisions of the Dominion Statutes 31 Vic. ch 12 and 13. If, therefore, a counter claim had not been set up in the answer of the Attorney General the only judgment which would have been warranted by the evidence upon the claim as made in the petition of right would have been that it should be dismissed with costs. But the answer of the Attorney General required that the counter claim, set up by him on behalf of the government, should be adjudicated upon.\nThe claim was simply for the difference between the full contract price for which the suppliants contracted to execute the works and the amount which, in excess of that sum, they cost the government, who completed them under a provision in the sixth paragraph of the contract, which provided that:\nThe learned judge read the 6th paragraph[15].\nThe contractors, having refused to proceed with the works unless a wholly unjustifiable demand for payment to them of a sum of about $540,000 should be complied with, repudiated their contract and refused to proceed to completion of the works in accordance with their contract; it, therefore, became necessary in the language of the above 6th paragraph of the contract, to take the works out of the hands of the contractors, upon giving the seven days' notice as required by the contract, and to proceed to complete the works at the cost of the contractors. Such notice was given, the contractors acquiesced therein and, as provided in the contract, gave up to the commissioners peaceable possession of the works and of all materials, plant, &c., which they had on the ground for proceeding with the work. There is, I think, no intention expressed in this clause of the contract under which the government proceeded to complete the works, contracted for by the suppliants that they should forfeit their plant in addition to paying the increased cost of the works\nIt was the contractors' interest to let the government have the use of their plant, for otherwise the government must have themselves supplied all necessary plant, the cost of which the contractors in the terms of their contract must have paid. But there is, I think, no provision made that the contractors should forfeit their plant in addition to paying the increased cost of the works. When, therefore, the works were completed, what I think the contractors entitled to in the absence of any other special contract relating to the plant, was the return of their plant in its then condition, or in such condition as it should be by a reasonable use and care of it during the progress of the works to completion.\nThe only forfeiture spoken of in this sixth paragraph of the contract, is a forfeiture of the percentage retained, and of all moneys which might be then due on the works. The question whether these sums could be insisted on as forfeited, the works having been carried on without the interference of the government for about two years after the 1st July, 1871, which in the third paragraph of the contract was named as the day by which the works should be finally completed, does not arise in the present case, for as to the percentage which was by the contract agreed to be retained the government made no claim, in fact there was none, for the contention of the government is, and has been established, that they had not insisted on this term of the contract made in their interest, but on the contrary had paid largely in excess of what they were entitled to under the contract, and indeed almost the whole of the contract price not retaining the percentage, as they might have done under the contract, and in fact there was no money due to the contractors under the contract when they abandoned the works and refused to proceed further with them, so that no question arises here as did in Walker v. L. & N. W. Co.[16], whether such sums, if any there were, could be claimed as forfeited in addition to the liability of the contractors to pay the cost of the completion of the works, in excess of the contract price.\nThe learned judge in his judgment finds that the contractors are entitled to the sum of $5,850 99 for interest upon and for the forbearance of divers large sums of money due and payable to them, and further, the sum of $27,022.35 the value of the materials by them left to Her Majesty's government. But, he adds, that inasmuch as by section three of the contract the suppliants having abandoned the contract, forfeit all right and claim to these two amounts, to wit: $32,873.25 the said sum is hereby declared forfeited; and he further adjudged, that the suppliants do pay to Her Majesty's government of the Dominion of Canada, the sum of $159,982.57, as money overpaid by Her Majesty's government to the suppliants, at the time of their abandoning their contract. Now as to these items with reference first to the $5,850.90, the learned judge in his motiv\u00e9 accompanying the above judgment says that it arises in this way:\n\"There is one point in the case in which the petitioners \"should succeed. It is that concerning the \"manner in which the engineers made their monthly \"estimates during the first four months following the \"beginning of the works in 1870, as established by \"documents 97 and 98, produced with the official correspondence, \"concerning the construction of the Intercolonial. \"According to this correspondence and the \"Order in Council of the 28th September, 1870, which \"settled the question, it would appear that the engineers \"committed errors resulting in a loss to the contractors \"for interest of $5,850 90, or thereabouts. In \"order to appreciate correctly the intention of the Commissioners \"in their communications to the Privy Council \"document 97, and the meaning and signification of \"the Privy Council, I cite them verbatim, and I believe, \"although the chief engineer was not of the opinion of \"the Privy Council and of the Commissioners on this \"point, that the engineer made grave errors on this \"occasion and that this sum of $5,850.90 should be \"credited to the petitioners on the final result of the \"case.\n\"I must say that if the contractors suffered damages \"to this amount which I allow them, they were well \"indemnified, if, as I have reason to believe, the report \"which I just read was followed to the letter.\n\"I also believe that in law and equity they should \"be credited with another sum of $27,023, representing \"the value of materials (plant, &c.), which they transferred \"to the Government when they gave up their \"contract in May, 1873.\"\nAs to the first of the above items of $5,850.90, it will be observed that the learned judge admits that if the contractors had suffered the damages it was fully indemnified to them by the report of the Privy Council, which he says he has reason to believe was followed up to the letter. But, besides having been thus indemnified, the item does not come within the claim of the suppliants as presented in their petition of right. Their claims as there presented are, that the document relied upon by the Government, as the contract was wholly abandoned and set aside by the Orders in Council, relied upon in the petition as constituting a wholly new contract upon which, as the only contract existing or upon a quantum meruit the suppliants wholly rest their claim, whereas $5,850.90 is allowed as for errors, said by the learned judge to have been committed injurious to the right of the suppliants under the contract which the Government rely upon, but which the suppliants repudiate; while under the contract the suppliants can recover nothing except upon the certificate of the engineer which the suppliants have not to warrant the allowance of this $5,850.90, but on the contrary, as the motiv\u00e9 of the learned judge shews, the chief engineer repudiates the justice of the imputation of the errors which the learned judge has imputed to his subordinates and for which the learned judge has allowed this $5,850.90.\nThen as to the $27,023 which I take to be wholly for plant to be used in carrying on the works to completion, other than material to be used in the work, as to which latter no deduction should be made, but taking it to be the fair value of the plant used for carrying on the works apart from materials used in the work, in the absence of a special agreement to the effect, I think the Government would not be entitled to retain the amount and at the same time to charge the suppliants with the full cost of the work in excess of the contract price. In view of the frame of the petition of right and the claims there asserted, it can only be by way of reduction of the amounts of the Government's counter claim that any allowance can be made to the contractors in respect of this sum of $27,023 as for value of plant placed in the hands of the Government to enable them to complete the work.\nHowever as to this plant the contractors when they abandoned their contract and gave it up to the Government to be completed by them, sold and transferred this plant to the Railway Commissioners by deed executed 11th June, 1873, in consideration of their agreeing to pay certain arrears of wages due to the laborers which had been employed by the contractors on the work. There is, however, a clause in that deed, the conditions of which appear to me to be that the contractors should be credited the value of the plant, on a final settlement to be made on the completion of the work by the Government, under the sixth paragraph of the contract, so that inasmuch as the learned judge has not deducted this sum from the $159,982.57 which he has found to be due the Government, as he would have done if he had not considered it to be forfeited under the terms of the contract, which I think it is not, it should now be deducted and the result will be to vary the judgment of the learned judge by reducing the sum found by him to be due to the Government of Canada to $132,959.\nThe form of the judgment should, in my opinion, be varied and should be to dismiss the petition of right with costs and to render judgment for the Crown on the counter claim for the sum of $132,959 as for money expended by the Government in completing the works in excess of the price for which the suppliants contracted to complete them, and this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.

But nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the contractors to provide the right of way for the construction of railway.\n(2) The contractes shall perform and execute all the works required to be performed by this contract and the said specification, in a good, faithful, substantial and workmanlike manner, and in strict accordance with the plans and specifications thereof, and with such instructions as may be from time to time given by the engineer, and shall be under the direction and constant supervision of such district, division and assistant engineers and inspectors as may be appointed. Should any work, material, or thing of any description whatsoever, be ommitted from the said specification or the contract, which, in the opinion of the engineer, is necessary or expedient to be executed or furnished, the contractors shall, notwithstanding such omission, upon receiving written directions to that effect from the engineer, perform and furnish the same. All the works are to be executed and materials supplied, to the entire satisfaction of commissioners and engineer; and the commissioners shall be the sole judges of the work and material, and their decision on all questions in dispute with regard to the works or materials, or as to the meaning or interpretation of the specification or the plans, or upon points not provided for, or not sufficiently explained in the plans or specifications, is to be final and binding on all parties.\n3. The contractors shall commence the works embraced in this contract within thirty days from and after the date hereof, and shall diligently and continuously prosecute and continue the same, and the same respectively and every part thereof shall be fully and entirely completed in every particular and given up under final certificate and to the satisfaction of the Commissioners and engineer on or before the first day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one (time being declared to be material and of the essence of this contract), and in default of such completion as aforesaid on or before the last mentioned day, the contractors shall forfeit all right, claim or demand to the sum of money or percentage hereinafter agreed to be retained by the Commissioners, and any and every part thereof, as also to any moneys whatever which may be at the time of the failure of the completion as aforesaid, due or owing to the contractors, and the contractors shall also pay to Her Majesty, as liquidated damages, and not by way of fine or penalty, the sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each and every week, and the proportionate fractional part of such sum for every part of a week, during which the works embraced within this contract, or any portion thereof, shall remain incomplete, or for which the certificate of the engineer, approved by the engineers, shall be withheld, and the Commissioners may deduct and retain in their hands the such sums as may become due as liquidated damages, from any sum of money then due or payable or to become due or payable thereafter to the contractors.\n4. The engineer shall be at liberty, at any time before the commencement or during the constructions of any portion of the work, to make any changes or alterations which he may deem expedient in the grades, the line of location of the railway, the width of cutting or fillings, the dimensions or character of structures, or in any other thing connected with the works, whether or not such changes increase or diminish the work to be done or the expense of doing the same, and the contractors shall not be entitled to any allowance by reason of such changes unless such changes consist in alterations in the grades or the line of location, in which case the contractors shall be subject to such deductions for any diminution of work, or entitled to such allowance for increased work (as the case may be), as the Commissioners may deem reasonable, their decision being final in the matter.\n(6) If at any time during the progress of the works, it should appear that the force employed, or the rate of progress then being made, or the general character of the work being performed, or the material supplied or furnished are not such as to ensure the completion of the said works within the time stipulated, or in accordance with this contract, the commissioners shall be at liberty to take any part or the whole works out of the hands of the contractors, and employ such means as may see fit to complete the works at the expense of the contractors, and they shall be liable for all extra expenditure incurred thereby, or the commissioners shall have power at their discretion to annul this contract. Whenever it may become necessary to take any portion or the whole works out of the hands of the contractors, or to annull this contract, the commissioners shall give the contractors seven clear days' notice in writing of their intention to do so, such notice being signed by the chairman of the board of commissioners, or by any other person authorized by the commissioners, and the contractors shall thereupon give up quiet and peaceable possession of all the works and materials as they then exist; and without any other or further notice or process or suit at law, other legal proceedings of any kind whatever, or without its being necessary to place the contractors en demeure, the commissioners in the event of their annulling the contract may forthwith, or at their discretion, proceed to re-let the same or any part thereof, or employ additional workmen, tools and materials, as the case may be, and complete the work at the expense of the contractors, who shall be liable for all extra expenditure which may be incurred thereby, and the contractors and their assigns or creditors shall forfeit all right to the percentage retained, and to all money which may be due on the works, and they shall not molest or hinder the men, agents or officers of the commissioners from entering upon and completing the said works as the commissioners may deem expedient.\n9. It is distinctly understood, intended and agreed, that the said price or consideration of four hundred and fifty-six thousand nine hundred and forty-six dollars ($456,946.00) shall be the price of, and be held to be full compensation for all the works embraced in, or contemplated by this contract, or which may be required in virtue of any of its provisions or by law, and that the contractor shall not upon any pretext whatever, be entitled by reason of any change, alterations or addition made in or to such work or in the said plans and specification, or by reason of the exercise of any of the powers vested in the governor in council by the the said Act intituled, \"An Act respecting the construction of the Intercolonial Railway,\" or in the commissioners or engineer, by this contract or by the law, to claim or demand any further or additional sum, for extra work or as damages or otherwise, the contractors, hereby expressly waiving and abandoning all and any such claim or pretention to all intents and purposes whatsoever except as provided in the fourth section of this contact.\n11. And it is further mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto, that cash payments, equal to eighty-five per cent. of the value of the work done, approximately made up from returns of progress measurements, will be made monthly on the certificate of the engineer, that the work for or on account of which the sum shall be certified has been duly executed, and upon approval of such certificate by the commissioners, on the completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the engineer, a certificate to that effect will be given, but the final and closing certificate, including the fifteen per cent. retained, will not be granted for a period of two months thereafter. The progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work or release of the contractor from his responsibility in respect thereof, but he shall, at the conclusion of the work, deliver over the same in good order according to the true intent and meaning of this contract and of the said specification.\n12. This contract and the said specification shall be in all respects subject to the provisions of the herein first cited Act, intituled \"An Act respecting the construction of the Intercolonial Railway,\" and also, in so far as they may be applicable to the provisions of \"The Railway Act, 1868.\"\n[6] 7 Can.

J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nInsurance against fire\u2014Condition\u2014Production of magistrate's certificate\u2014Waiver of condition.\nA policy of insurance against fire contained the following conditions:\u2014\n\"The assured must procure a certificate under the hands of two magistrates most contiguous to the place of fire, and not concerned or directly or indirectly interested in the loss or assurance as creditors or otherwise, or related to the assured or sufferers, that they are acquainted with the character and circumstances of the assured, and have made diligent inquiry into the facts set forth in the statement and account of the assured, and know, or verily believe, that the assured really, by misfortune, and without fraud or evil practice, hath or have sustained by such fire loss or damage to the amount therein mentioned.\n\"No one of the foregoing conditions or stipulations, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by or on the part of the company, unless the waiver be clearly expressed in writing by indorsement upon this policy, signed by the agents of the company at Halifax, N.S.\"\nThe insured premises having been destroyed by fire he applied to two magistrates contiguous to the place of the fire for the required certificate, which they refused, and he finally obtained such certificate from two magistrates residing at a distance from such place. The proofs of loss, accompanied by the certificate, were sent to the agent, who subsequently made an offer of payment to compromise the claim, stating that if such offer was not accepted the claim would be contested. The agent, on a subsequent occasion, told the assured that he objected to the claim, as he \"did not think it was a square loss.\"\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the non-production of the certificate, required by the above condition, prevented the assured from recovering on the policy.\nHeld also, that even if such condition could be waived without indorsement on the policy, the acts of the agent did not amount to a waiver.\nSemble, that the condition could not be so waived.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] setting aside a verdict at nisi prius for the plaintiff.\nThe above head-note contains a sufficient statement of the facts upon which this appeal was decided.\nSedgwick Q.C. for the appellants.\nCondition 19, relating to waiver, does not refer to matters arising after the loss. Franklin Fire Insurance Co. v. Chicago Ice Co.[2].\nIf the agent had said that the proofs of loss were defective in respect to the magistrate's certificate, we could have procured it. He was aware of the defect when he told Logan that the proofs were satisfactory. Pitney v. Glens Falls Insurance Co.[3].\nHenry Q.C. for the respondents\nThere can be no estoppel in the case of persons insured under this policy. See Walsh v. Hartford Insurance Co.[4]; Merserau V. Ph\u00e6nix Mutual Life Insurance Co.[5].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was clearly right. There was, unquestionably, a non-compliance with the 14th condition of the policy, which provides that:\nThe assured must also procure a certificate under the hands of two magistrates most contiguous to the place of fire, and not concerned or directly or indirectly interested in the loss or the assurance as creditor or otherwise, or related to the assured or sufferers, that they are acquainted with the character and circumstances of the assured, and have made diligent inquiry into the facts set forth in the statement and account of the assured, and know or verily believe that the assured really, by misfortune, and without fraud or evil practice, hath or have sustained by such fire loss or damage to the amount therein mentioned.\nInstead of producing a certificate under the hands of two justices of the peace most contiguous to the place of the fire, &c., the evidence showed that application had been made to two such justices who had refused to give the required certificate. But it is alleged that the respondents had waived the production of such certificate. There is not, in my opinion, any sufficient evidence of waiver in this case, supposing the want of the certificate could be waived without writing indorsed on the policy. The only evidence bearing on this question of waiver is as follows: On the 19th of March Salter, defendant's agent at Halifax, wrote the plaintiff as follows:\u2014\nEXHIBIT D. T.\nCommercial Union Assurance Company Of London, England.\nCapital .................................................................. \u00a32.500,000 stg.\nAddress\u2014P. O. Box 64, Halifax.\nHALIFAX, N.S., 19th March, 1884.\nWM. N. LOGAN, TRURO.\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of the 17th inst. received and noted. I sent up the papers re your case to Truro, but Mr. Corey won't be there for some time, so I have sent to get them returned, when I will adjust the case myself and see what I can do.\nYours faithfully,\nWM. S. SALTER.\nAnd on the 22nd of March he wrote again:\nCommercial Union Assurance Company Of London, England.\nCapital .................................................................. \u00a32,500,000 stg.\nAddress\u2014P. O. Box 64, Halifax.\nHALIFAX, N.S., 22nd March, 1884.\nWM. N. LOGAN, TRURO, N.S.\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours 20th inst. received and noted. Papers re your case have been returned, and I have looked into them. If you care to compromise the matter for $300 without prejudice I will pay, otherwise will contest the case.\nYours faithfully,\n(Sgd.) WM. S. SALTER.\nThe plaintiff says: Last of February I went to Halifax again and said to Salter, How are things progressing in my case? He replied, \"Your papers and every thing are quite satisfactory, there are one or two cases ahead of yours and when they are settled yours will be.\" After waiting awhile I wrote to Salter and got D. T. in reply; wrote to him again and got E. T. in reply (D. T. and E. T. put in;) I then went to Halifax and saw Salter, with McCully, my attorney; McCully asked why he objected to pay the full amount; he said he did not like the loss; McCully asked if that was the only objection; he replied he did not think it was a square loss and made some reference to the location of the building.\nAnd Mr. McCully says:\nWent to Halifax in March as agent of plaintiff; latter end; on a Saturday and on Monday went with plaintiff who had just got the letter with the offer; we went to plaintiff's office; I asked what his objections were and he shrugged his shoulders and said he did not like the loss; I asked what he meant and he replied; I do not think it is a square loss; I asked if there were any other objections; he replied the same as in Murphy's case, the premises are not accurately described, you are not entitled to anything, but rather than have trouble I will pay $300.\nSo far from this being a waiver, the very reason assigned for not paying the loss, namely, that the agent did not think it a square loss, may have been, and probably was, based on the rumors the witness Ryan who, though not residing near the fire sent a certificate, said were afloat. His language was \"I was there shortly after the fire and heard a great deal about it; some people said the place had been set afire.\" Or, at any rate, the very fact of the plaintiff's neighbors, two Justices of the Peace contiguous to the fire, refusing to sign the certificate, or even the fact of the plaintiff not producing such a certificate, would be quite sufficient to raise the agent's suspicion that it was not a square loss, and assigning such a reason, so far from being evidence of a waiver of the condition, shows, on the contrary, inferentially, that it would be relied on. But apart from this, the 19th condition is conclusive against the plaintiff. It is as follows:\n19. No one of the foregoing conditions or stipulations, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by or on the part of the company, unless the waiver be clearly expressed in writing by endorsement upon this policy signed by the agents of the company at Halifax (N.S.)\nThere is no pretence for saying that this condition was complied with, nor does it appear to have been in any way, directly or indirectly, referred to by either party. I think, therefore, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The appeal in this case is from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia making absolute a rule for a new trial. The action is brought on a policy of insurance against fire, granted by the respondents in favour of the appellant on property described as a \"Stock of Liquors, &c. contained in the bar\" in a building occupied by the appellant near Wallace, in Cumberland County, N.S.\nThe policy was subject to several conditions, twenty in number, of which, however, two only require notice for the purposes of the present decision. By one of the stipulations contained in the 14th condition it was provided that, in case of loss,\nThe assured must also procure a certificate under the hands of two magistrates most contiguous to the place of fire, and not concerned or directly or indirectly interested in the loss or the assurance as creditor or otherwise, or related to the assured or sufferers, that they are acquainted with the character and circumstances of the assured, and have made diligent enquiry into the facts set forth in the statement and account of the assured, and know or verily believe that the assured really, by misfortune, and without fraud or evil practice, hath or have sustained by such fire loss or damage to the amount therein mentioned.\nThe 19th condition was as follows:\u2014\nNo one of the foregoing conditions or stipulations, either in whole or in part, shall be deemed to have been waived by or on the part of the company, unless the waiver be clearly expressed in writing by endorsement upon this policy, signed by the agents of the company at Halifax, N.S.\nBy the 9th plea the respondents pleaded non-performance of the provision requiring the certificate of two justices of the peace contained in that portion of the 14th condition already stated. This the appellant answered by two replications\u2014the first taking issue on the plea, and the second alleging that before action brought the respondents, by express renunciation and waiver, waived the performance of the condition. To this the respondents rejoined that by the 19th condition waiver could only be by writing endorsed on the policy, and that there had been no such written waiver. This the appellant met by taking issue on the rejoinder and by a sur-rejoinder that the 19th condition itself had been waived by the respondents. At the trial which took place before Mr. Justice Thompson and a jury at Truro the appellant, being examined on his own behalf, deposed that in an interview with Crowe, who was the local agent of the respondents at Truro, subordinate as such to Salter, the agent at Halifax, the following conversation took place:\nI said he must not delay me, as I had to get a certificate from the two J.P.'s nearest the fire. He said that was of no consequence, as any two responsible J.P.'s would do.\nThe appellant also proved and put in a certificate to the effect required by the condition, signed by two justices of the peace, Ryan and Sutherland, who were not, however, the justices living most contiguous to the premises. Mr. McCully, the plaintiff's attorney, proved that application had been made to Messrs. Clarke and Logan, two justices of the peace residing near the place of the fire, and, as I gather from the judgment, more contiguous than Messrs. Ryan and Sutherland, but they refused to certify. The appellant also swore that having gone twice to Halifax to see Salter, the agent of respondents there, who granted and signed the policy, on the second occasion and when Salter had had in his hands for some time the papers furnished by the appellant as proofs of loss, the following conversation took place:\nI said to Salter, \"How are things progressing in my case?\" He replied, \"Your papers and everything are quite satisfactory. There \"are one or two cases ahead of yours, and when they are settled \"yours will be.\"\nThis conversation was denied by Salter, who says in his evidence:\nI did not tell him his papers were right.\nThis was all that could be put forward as evidence of waiver. The learned judge refused to non-suit, although he was of opinion there was no evidence of waiver of the 19th condition, and left three questions to the jury as follows:\nDid the agent of the defendant company waive the requirement of a certificate under the hands of two magistrates, as stated in the 14th condition on the back of the policy?\nDid the agent of defendant company waive the 19th condition?\nDo you accept the account of the conversation between plaintiff and the agent (in February) as testified to by the plaintiff, or as testified to by the agent?\nUpon all three of these questions the jury found in favour of the appellant. A new trial was moved for on several grounds, one of these grounds being \"that \"there was no evidence of waiver of the conditions of \"the policy to go to the jury.\" And a rule nisi having been granted it was, after argument, made absolute.\nI am of opinion that, irrespective altogether of the requirement of the 19th condition requiring that any waiver should be in writing, there was no evidence showing that the stipulations as to the magistrate's certificate required by the 14th condition had been, in fact, waived in such a way as to bind the respondents, even if a verbal waiver had not been provided against. Salter, as agent, apart from the authority expressly conferred on him to waive in writing, had no power so to bind the respondents, and granting that the plaintiffs account of what passed at the interview at Halifax was, as the jury found, the true one, what was then said could not in any way have precluded the company from setting up the want of the certificate as a defence, simply for the reason given that Salter was exceeding his powers in assuming (even if the plaintiff's evidence is to be so construed) to dispense with it. Further, even if there could have been any doubt of this in the absence of the 19th condition, that condition clearly excludes any authority in the agent to waive otherwise than according to its terms. Lastly, there was not the slightest evidence of any waiver of the 19th condition itself, and moreover it is manifest that nothing Salter, the agent, might have said, could have had the effect of enlarging the limited powers to waive which the company had thought fit to impose upon him. The appeal is therefore totally unfounded, and should be dismissed with costs.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. I think the appellant is clearly not entitled to recover, and that there is not the slightest evidence of waiver. I think the waiver must be indorsed on the policy.\nFOURNIER and GWYNNE JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Sedgewick, Ross & Sedgewick.\nSolicitors for respondent: Henry, Ritchie & Weston.\n[1] 6 Russ. & Geld. 209.\n[2] 11 Am.

That no insurance shall be made by any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, on the life or lives of any person or persons, or on any other event or events whatever, wherein the person or persons for whose use or benefit, or on whose account, such policy or policies shall be made, shall have no interest, or by way of gaming or wagering; and that every insurance made contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act shall be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\n2. That it shall not be lawful to make any policy or policies on the life or lives of any person or persons, or other event or events, without inserting in such policy or policies the name or names of the person or persons interested therein, or for what use, benefit, or on whose account, such policy is so made or underwritten.\n3. That in all cases when the insured hath an interest in such life or lives, event or events, no greater sum shall be recovered or received from the insurer or insurers than the amount or value of the interest of the insured in such life or lives, or other event or events.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that this statute never was intended to prevent a person from effecting a bon\u00e2 fide insurance on his own life, and making the sum insured payable to whom he pleases, such insurance not being \"By way of gaming or wagering\" within the meaning of the first section of the act.\nHeld also, that section 2 of the said act applies only to a policy on the life of another, not to a policy by a man on his own life. Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the decision of the Court of Equity, dismissing the plaintiffs' bill.\nThe facts of the case pertinent to the present appeal are as follows:\u2014\nThe action was brought to have cancelled a policy of life insurance, issued by the plaintiff company to Edmund Francheville Russell, in the sum of one thousand dollars, dated the 29th day of December, 1881, payable to the respondent.\nRussell was a merchant in Halifax in 1881. The respondent was an intimate friend of his wife, and he desired to make some provision for her after his death. She had no pecuniary interest in his life, either at the time the policy was effected or at the time of Russell's death.\nThe application for the policy was made by said Edmund Francheville Russell, and dated 17th December, 1881; it applied for a policy for the sum of ten thousand dollars, payable to the estate of the applicant. On the 24th December, 1881, Edmund Francheville Russell wrote the following letter to J. S. Belcher, Esquire, agent of the plaintiff company:\n\"Halifax, N.S., December 24th, 1881.\n\"J. S. Belcher, Esq.,\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014You will please make policies for the ten thousand dollars insureds in the North American Mutual Life Insurance Company on my life as follows: one policy for four thousand dollars in favor of Captain James E. Hadley, of Gruysboro; one policy for four thousand dollars in favor of Miss Jessie Richardson, of Sydney, Cape Breton; one policy of one thousand dollars in favor of Elizabeth Jane Craigen, of Halifax, N.S.; one policy for one thousand dollars in favor of## Annie Handford Craigen, of Halifax, N.S.\n\"Yours truly,\n(Sgd.) \"E. F. Russell.\"\nThe appellant company accepted the said proposal for insurance, and issued a policy of insurance to said Russell, insuring his life for the benefit of the said Elizabeth Jane Craigen in the sum of one thousand dollars. By the terms of the policy the company \"insures the life of Edmund Francheville Russell, here\" inafter called the assured, and promises to pay at its \"said office in the city of Toronto to Elizabeth Jane \"Craigen, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, her executors, \"administrators or assigns, one thousand dollars,\" &c.\nThe appellant company was aware when the policy was effected that the respondent had no pecuniary interest in the life of Edmund Francheville Russell. On January 4th, 1882, Belcher, agent at Halifax of appellant company, wrote to the managing director at Toronto of appellant company a letter containing the following words: \"I may say that Mr. \"Russell is insuring for the benefit of these people\u2014 \"his brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and two friends of \"his wife. They do not know anything of his intention, \"and he would not ask them to sign the documents \"sent, as he does not wish them to know; \"merely a favor on his part; he owes them nil; he \"says in case of death he wants these amounts paid \"without going through the hands of his executors.\"\nOn the 15th July, 1883, the company brought this action to have the policy delivered up to be cancelled, alleging in their bill that they first knew the want of interest in the defendant after the death of the assured, whereupon they immediately tendered a repayment of the premium and demanded the policy which was refused.\nMr. Justice Thompson dismissed the bill with costs. From this decision the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, which gave judgment dismissing the appeal and confirming the judgment appealed from. The present appeal was then taken.\nJ. K. Kerr Q.C. for the appellants.\nWe contend that the policy is within the terms of the statute of Geo. 3, and void as a wager policy. See Evans v. Bignold[1]; Hodson v. Observer Life Assurance Soc.[2]; Dowker v. Canada Life[3]; Shilling v. Accidental Ins. Co.[4].\nThe defendant must occupy one of two positions; either the policy was one effected for her benefit, which the statute forbids, or it is issued to Russell whose name is not in the policy in the manner contemplated by section 2.\nWhen the application was made the company called Russell's attention to the want of interest in the beneficiary, and he replied that he was acting under advice and would take the policy as directed.\nThe following cases were cited: Vezina v. New York Life[5]; Etna Ins. Co. v. France[6]; Warnock v. Davis[7]; Connecticut Mutual v. Sctwenk[8]; Sadler's Co. v. Badcock[9].\nGraham Q.C. for the respondent.\nIt will not be contended that a party cannot insure his own life. See 32 Albany L. J. 386, Nov. 14, 1885, commenting on the case of Warnock v. Davis. The writer of this article cites Triston v. Hardey[10] to show that a policy is valid, even if the premium is paid by the beneficiary.\nThe company contract with Russell that they will pay Craigen. McQueen v. Ph\u00e6nix Mutual[11].\nThe company had knowledge of all the facts and cannot succeed unless the policy is absolutely void.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The bill in this case sets out that one Edmund Francheville Russell, on or about December 17th, 1881, made a proposition to the plaintiffs to insure his life in the sum of $10,000, and accompanied said proposal with a letter directed to the plaintiffs, through their agent at Halifax, dated the 24th day of said December, directing that the said sum of $10,000 be written in four policies, of which one was to be in favor of the defendant for $1,000; that the plaintiffs accepted such proposal and issued a policy insuring the life of the said Russell for the benefit of the defendant in the sum of $1,000; that the said Russell died, and the defendant having been called upon so to do made due proof of his death, but admitted that she had no interest whatever, beneficial, pecuniary or otherwise, either at the time of the making and executing such policy or at the time of the death of said Russell; that at the time the plaintiffs issued said policy they had no knowledge that the defendant had no beneficial or pecuniary interest in the life of the said Russell, and that on being fully satisfied of that fact they immediately tendered back to the defendant the premium paid on said policy, and informed her that they would not be bound by said policy to pay her any amount thereunder, and the defendant refused to accept the said premium or to deliver up the said policy; and the bill prayed that the policy should be declared null and void, and that the same be delivered up to the plaintiffs to be cancelled, and that the defendant be restrained by injunction from proceeding in any action at law upon the said policy against the plaintiffs, or assigning or disposing of said policy, and for other relief as may seem meet.\nThis bill was, in my opinion, properly dismissed. The injunction said to have been granted was, in my opinion, most improperly granted, as I have not the slightest doubt as to the liability of the company in this case. The policy was issued on the 29th of December, 1881, whereby the company, in consideration of the application for this policy, and the statements and agreements therein contained hereby made a part of this contract, and of the annual premium, $39.50, to be paid in advance to the company at its head office in the city of Toronto on the delivery of their policy, and thereafter on the 20th day of December in every year during the term of 19 years, insures the life of Russell, hereinafter called the insured, of Halifax, in the county of Halifax and province of Nova Scotia, and promises to pay at its said office, in the city of Toronto, to Elizabeth Jane Craigen, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, her executors, administrators or assigns, one thousand dollars with profits, first deducting therefrom the balance of the current year's premium, if any, and all loans on account of this policy, in sixty days after satisfactory proof at its said office of the death of the insured, during the continuance of this policy, under the following provisions. (Here follows certain conditions which are of no importance in this case.)\nThere is no pretence for saying that Russell did not insure his own life and pay the premium with his own money, making the loss payable on his death to Elizabeth J. Craigen, without her knowledge. I am clearly of opinion that he had a perfect right to insure his own life; that his interest supports the policy, and that the policy was not, in any sense of the term, a wager policy. It was obtained, and the premium paid, by a person who unquestionably had an interest in his own life, and was not obtained by the party now claiming the money, but was obtained without collusion with, or even the knowledge of, the party whom the assured designated to receive the amount upon his death.\nCraigen's first connection with the policy appears to have occurred thus: Russell, about the 21st of January, 1882, delivered to her a sealed envelope directed to her, and requested her to use the contents for her own benefit in the event of his death, and after his death she opened the envelope and found the policy which had been effected by Russell on his own life, with his own means, and, as she says, without any direction from her and without any procurement or solicitation on her part and, in fact, without her previous knowledge.\nCan it be doubted that a man has an insurable interest in his own life on which he may effect a bon\u00e2 fide insurance? And can it be that he cannot appoint any one to receive the money in the case of his death during the existence of the policy?\nAgainst his doing so the statute 14 Geo. 3 cap. 48 has been invoked, which enacts:\nFirst\u2014That no insurance shall be made by any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, on the life or lives of any person or persons, or on any other event or events whatever, wherein the person or persons for whose use or benefit, or on whose account, such policy or policies shall be made shall have no interest, or by way of gaming or wagering, and that every insurance made contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act shall be null and void to all intents and purposes whatever.\nSecond.\u2014That it shall not be lawful to make any policy or policies on the life or lives of any person or persons, or other event or events, without inserting in such policy or policies the name or names of the person or persons interested therein, or for what use, benefit, or on whose account such policy is so made or underwritten.\nThird.\u2014That in all cases where the insured hath an interest in such life or lives, event or events, no, greater sum shall be recovered or received from the insurer or insurers than the amount or value of the interest of the insured in such life or lives or other event or events. This act never was intended to prevent persons from effecting bon\u00e2 fide insurance on their own lives; when once so effected the insured is at liberty to assign the policy to whom he pleases, and the assignee may recover without showing interest or payment of consideration, resting on the rights of the persons who effected the insurance, the statute applying only to the original parties to the policy. See Ashley v. Ashley[12].\nIt is quite another matter where an evasion of the statute is attempted by a person procuring one in whose life he has no legal interest to insure it with his money and for his benefit, though ostensibly for the advantage of the party insuring. In this case, as I have said, there was no attempt to evade the statute. Russell applied for the insurance on his own life, paid the premium out of his own money, and the company, with full knowledge of all the circumstances, issued to him a policy; the contract thus made with Russell not having the semblance of a wager policy, but being made in good faith, what possible objection, in law or in principle, can there be to his requiring the amount, in case of his death, to be paid, not to his personal representatives, but to a specific person whom he designates to receive the same? The loss could not be paid to Russell himself because it is not payable until he is dead and gone. What is there to justify the principle that the statement in the policy of the name of the person to whom he wishes the money to be paid on his death Vitiates the policy? What rule or principle of law is invaded by the parties, by mutual agreement, designating who shall be entitled to receive the proceeds when due instead of the personal representatives of the deceased? He could assign the policy; he could bequeath the policy; and I have yet to learn that he could not make it payable to trustees for the benefit of particular individuals. If he could, why could he not make it payable to the assignee, devisee or individual himself or herself?\nSection 2 which has been so much relied on has, it appears to me, been entirely misapprehended on the argument. It applies only to a policy on the life of another, not to a policy by a man on his own life. The statute only requires that where a party makes an insurance on the life of another the policy shall contain the name of the person for whose use, benefit, or on whose account the policy is made; therefore where a third person is a person interested in the policy the name of that person so interested must, no doubt, be inserted. Section 3, read in connection with section 2, shows very clearly that section 2 refers to insurance on the lives of others, not to insurance by a party on his own life. But if section 2 be applied to a case like the present I do not see what the defendants have to complain of. The name of the party for whose benefit the assured caused the insurance to be effected, in other words, the party intended by the assured to be benefitted by the insurance on his death, does appear.\nNo English case has been cited nor, I think I can safely say, can be found, to sustain the plaintiffs' contention. In the United States of America decisions in different States of the Union are in direct opposition. I will refer to a few of them.\nIn Campbell v. The New England Mutual Life Insurance Co.[13], the marginal note says:\nAn action may be maintained on a policy of life insurance obtained by a man on his own life, without proving an insurable interest therein in the person for whose benefit it is declared on its face to be made.\nAnd in the same case[14] Wells J. says:\nThe policy in this case is upon the life of Andrew Campbell. It was made upon his application; it issued to him as \"the assured,\" the premium was paid by him; and he thereby became a member of the defendant corporation. It is the interest of Andrew Campbell in his own life that supports the policy. The plaintiff did not, by virtue of the clause declaring the policy to be for her benefit, become the assured. She is merely the person designated by agreement of the parties to receive the proceeds of the policy upon the death of the assured. The contract, (so long as it remains executory), the interest by which it is supported, and the relation of membership, all continue the same as if no such clause were inserted. Fogg vs. Middlesex Insurance Co.[15]; Sanford vs. Mechanic's Insurance Co.[16]; Hale vs. Mechanic's Insurance Co.[17]; Campbell vs. Charter Oak Insurance Co.[18]; Forbes vs. American Insurance Co.[19].\nIt was not necessary, therefore, that the plaintiff should show that she had an interest in the life of Andrew Campbell by which the policy could be supported as a policy to herself as the assured. The defendants raise no question as to her right to bring this action if the policy can be supported for her benefit.\nIn Hogle vs. The Guardian Life Insurance Company[20] the marginal note reads:\n4. Any person has the right to insure his own life though he does it for the benefit of another; and he may have the loss payable to the assured or to his own assignee or appointee.\n5. A policy of insurance effected by a person upon his own life may be disposed of as the insured sees fit.\nGarvin J.:\nThe contract was with Warner, whose life was insured for her (the plaintiff's) benefit, and the promise is to pay her. The action is properly brought in her name. Lawrence v. Fox[21] But whether this is so or not the plaintiff is the real party in interest and can maintain the action. (Code sec. 111). The insurance Was effected by Warner. He applied for it, paid the premium, took all the initiatory steps for proving it. It was delivered to Warner, and nothing is clearer than that Warner could make the loss payable to whom he pleased. He did so, making it payable to her. Therefore the question of whether she had an insurable interest in the life of her father does not and cannot arise. Any person has a right to insure his own life though he does it for the benefit of another. Rawls v. The American Ins. Co.[22]. He may have the loss payable to the assured, or to his own assignee or appointee; and whichever be the form his interest in his own life is the same. There is therefore no question as to the plaintiff's interest in his own life. That question does not arise. St. John v. American Mutual Ins. Co.[23]; Ruse v. Mutual Benefit Life Ins. Co.[24].\nA policy of insurance effected on one's own life may be disposed of as the insured sees fit. It is not material that the beneficiary, appointee, or assignee, have an interest in the life of the insured at the inception of the policy. A valid policy once made, it so remains if the conditions are complied with, Valton v. National Fund Life Ass. Co[25]. On the termination of the life the sum insured is payable absolutely[26].\nIn Olmstead v. Keyes[27] Earl J., after referring to the insurance authorities, says:\nThe rules, as gathered from these authorities, is that where one takes out a policy upon his own life as an honest and bon\u00e2 fide transaction, and the amount insured is made payable to a person having no interest in the life, or where such a policy is assigned to one having no interest in the life, the beneficiary in the one case, and the assignee in the other, may hold and enforce the policy if it was valid at its inception and the policy was not procured, or the assignment made, as a contrivance to circumvent the law against betting, gaming and wagering policies.\nAnd in The Provident Life Insurance & Investment Co. v. Baum[28] Ray J. says:\nIn consideration of eighteen dollars, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, The Provident Life Insurance and Investment Company do hereby insure Americus Baum against loss of life in the sum of $3,000, to be paid to Napoleon Baum or his legal representatives within ninety days after sufficient proof that the assured, at any time after the date hereof and before the expiration of this policy, shall have sustained personal injury caused by any accident within the meaning of this policy and the conditions hereunto annexed, and such injuries shall occasion death within ninety days from the happening thereof; sufficient proof being furnished to this company. And he goes on to say[29]:\nThe position assumed by the appellant in argument that this policy is one of indemnity, and that the appellant must show an interest in the life of the assured, does not, we think, arise in this case. The policy in terms declares that the company insure Americus Baum against loss of life in the sum of three thousand dollars. It cannot be questioned that a person has an insurable interest in his own life, and that he may effect such insurance and appoint any one to receive the money in case of his death during the existence of such policy. It is not for the insurance company, after executing such a contract and agreeing to the appointment so made, to question the right of such appointee to maintain the action. If there should be any controversy as to the distribution among the heirs of the deceased of the sum so contracted to be paid it does not concern the insurers. The appellants contracted with the insured to pay the money to the appellee, and upon such payment being made they will be discharged from all responsibility. So far as the insurance company is interested the contract is effective as an appointment of the appellee to receive the sum insured.\nThe law, then, of this case is against the defendants, and I do not know that I have ever adjudicated on a case where the defendants had so little merits. The company appear to have suggested that the law would not allow a policy to be made payable to a person having no present insurable interest in the life of the assured, and yet, with the following letter from their agent,\nWm. McCabe Esq., Toronto:\u2014\nDear Sir\u2014I have at hand your favors of 27th and 29th ults., also policies for Mr. Russell; they all came together. I have also received your favor of 31st., with paper and envelopes to-day. I have read over your letters of 29th very carefully, and understand that Mr. Russell can not insure for the benefit of others, and that I am authorized to hand him his policies, which I have done; expected to have seen him to day but have not. I may say that Mr. Russell is insuring for the benefit of these people\u2014his brother-in-law, his sister-in-law, and two friends of his wife. They do not know anything of his intention, and he would not ask them to sign the documents sent as he does not wish them to know, merely a favor on his part, he owes them nil; he says in case of death he wants these amounts paid without going through the hands of his executors.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) Joseph S. Belcher.\nand with this full knowledge they have a policy made out as Mr. Russell wished and received his premium. Could it be that with this knowledge they wickedly took Russell's money for what they thought would be a valueless policy and intended, in case of death, to repudiate it? And yet such is the only inference that can be drawn from this most unjust at tempt to defeat a righteous claim.\nWith all the circumstances as above detailed, there being no allegation, or pretence for saying, on this record that there was any concealment, fraud or evasion practised on the part of the insured or on that of the defendant in this case, it is difficult to understand how they could bring themselves to resist this claim. They have neither law, merits, nor justice on their side, and therefore, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs[30].\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is a suit in equity to have a policy of life assurance delivered up to be cancelled upon the ground that it was a wager policy, effected by or on behalf of a person having no interest in the life, and so void under the provisions of the Stat. 14 Geo. III. chu 48. The assurance was effected by Russell, whose life was the subject of it, and who paid the premium, there being nothing to show that at or before that time the defendant knew anything about the matter. The contract of the company contained in the policy was with Russell, and with Russell alone, and by the proper construction of the instrument the premiums were to be paid by Russell. Russell, it is true, afterwards handed over the policy to the defendant, but this, if it had any legal effect, operated only as a subsequent assignment. The well known rule of the law of contracts, that when a contract or covenant is made between two persons for the benefit of a third that third person is not to be considered a party to the contract and cannot sue upon it, applies here. The policy was, it is true, made payable to the defendant, but the defendant was not for that reason in a position to recover upon it, there being no privity of contract between her and the company, unless she has become entitled to sue by reason of some valid and effectual transfer made by Russell to her. It would be premature now to say whether there has been an effectual gift of the policy to the defendant or not. It is sufficient for the purpose of this appeal to say that the contract of insurance intended to be carried out by the policy, was at its inception an insurance effected by Russell on his own life and, as such, entirely unobjectionable. No statute or rule of law that I am aware of prohibits a policy of this kind. It is not one which the statute 14 Geo. 3 was designed to prevent. Every man has an insurable interest in his own life and he may, either by will or by act inter vivos by way of assignment, direct the payment of the sum assured to be made, at his death, to a third person, and as he may clearly do this by an assignment of the policy, subsequent to its being effected, so he may do the same by an instrument contemporaneous with the policy; and if he can do this by a contemporaneous instrument collateral to the policy, there is no reason why he may not effect the same end by a provision embodied in the policy itself, which is all that has been done here.\nOf course, if it is made to appear by evidence that the undertaking of the person whose life is assured to pay the premiums is colorable, and that the premiums are in reality to be paid by a third person who has no insurable interest in the life and who is to have the benefit of the insurance, the policy will be a wager policy and so within the statute and void, but nothing of the kind appears here.\nThe statute 14 Geo. 3 no doubt applies and the validity of the policy is to be determined by it, for the contract of insurance must be considered as having been made at Toronto, the domicile of the defendants, and the law of Ontario has been properly put in evidence by proof or admission of the statute of the late Province of Upper Canada, establishing the law of England as it stood in 1791 as the rule of decision, which, it cannot be doubted, had the effect of introducing the statute in question as a governing enactment into the law of that province. But for the reasons already stated I am of opinion that the statute does not invalidate the policy. I attach no importance to the pretended variation of the policy by converting it into one effected by the defendant; inasmuch as for the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Thompson in his judgment in the court below such variation never took effect.\nThe law applicable to this case is well stated in Olmstead v. Keyes[31], for although neither the statute of Geo. III. nor any similar statutory enactment is in force in New York, yet the courts of that state have repeatedly held that the common law had the same effect in forbidding wager policies on the lives of third parties as the statute had in England.\nI may add that if this policy had been made in Nova Scotia, or if by reason of there being no proof of the lex loci\u2014the law of Ontario\u2014we had been called upon to determine the case by the law of Nova Scotia, where the statute is not in force, I should, had the facts warranted it, have felt no difficulty in adopting the New York rule, that a wager policy effected by a person having no interest in the life was, at common Jaw, against public policy and so void. There is a further reason for holding that this appeal must fail. This is a bill in equity, and the decision appealed from was pronounced before the Nova Scotia Judicature Act came into force. It is well established that a Court of Equity will not decree cancellation for matters of avoidance apparent on the face of the instrument impeached. The whole ground of equity insisted on by the appellants in the present case is that the policy is void on its face. This point was alluded to but not decided in Desborough v. Curlewis[32]. It is manifest, however, that the inclination of the court in that case was in favour of the objection, which I think well founded in the present case, and a sufficient ground for the dismissal of this appeal if other and more substantial reasons were not also applicable.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I entirely concur in the opinion of His Lordship the Chief Justice, and especially in his last observation.\nHENRY J.\u2014The case as presented by the evidence here is that of a company who, with full knowledge of all the circumstances, enters into a contract, and after the contract has been performed by the insured goes into a Court of Equity and asks for an injunction against the parties entitled to be paid to restrain them from bringing an action. This is a most unjust proceeding, and I do not understand it; I am clearly of opinion that a man can insure his own life and, with the consent of the company, can make the insurance payable to whom he pleases. This is totally different from a wager policy, which means a party insuring another person's life to make money out of it. The statute is not applicable to a case of this kind, and the company has no right to ask any court to restrain the defendant from bringing an action. It is a most unrighteous proceeding on the part of the company.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons just given by His Lordship, the Chief Justice. I desire particularly to add that I also fully agree in all that has been said by His Lordship as to the nature of the contestation raised by the company against this claim. Such contestations by these companies are very much to be regretted, and are of a nature to prove a serious blow to the whole system of life insurance.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: W.

Ritchie C.J., Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Sale of lumber\u2014Acceptance of part\u2014Right to reject remainder.\nT. contracted for the purchase from D. of 200,000 feet of lumber of a certain size and quality, which D. agreed to furnish. No place was named for the delivery of the lumber, and it was shipped from the mills where it was sawed to T. at Hamilton. T. accepted a number of carloads at Hamilton, but rejected some because a portion of the lumber in each of them was not, as he alleged, of the size and quality contracted for.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting, that T. under the circumstances of the case had no right to reject the lumber, his only remedy for the deficiency being to obtain a reduction of the price or damages for non\u2011delivery according to the contract.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas Division[2] in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts of the case are as follows:\nThe defendant, Thomson, was a dealer in lumber at Hamilton, Ont., and previous to the year 1884, he had purchased lumber from the plaintiff. In January, 1884, he received a letter from the plaintiff containing the following offer: \u201cI am informed you want 200,000 feet 2 inch plank, 18 feet; I will furnish it for same price and terms as last summer.\u201d On January 26th, 1884, he answered said letter as follows: \u201cI will take 200,000 feet 2 inches, 18 feet, 6 inches up to 12 inches, good, sound, square edge, fit for car flooring, at $10, 3 months.\u201d On February 2nd, 1884, the defendant received the following: \u201cI could not furnish the 200,000 feet 2 inch plank, 18 feet, for less than $10.50 per thousand,\u201d On February 20th, he wrote as follows: \u201cI will take 200,000 feet cut as follows, 2 x 6, 2 x 8, 2 x 9, 2 x 10, 2 x 12, 18 feet, at $10.25, 3 months. It must be good, sound, square-edged stuff red and white pine.\u201d On February 23rd, he received the following answer: \u201cI will accept your offer for the 200,000 feet of 18 feet plank, from 6 to 12 wide, quality same as I supplied you last year, your acceptance at three months from date of shipments.\u201d\nOn the strength of this correspondence the plaintiff began in June, 1884, to ship the lumber from his mills on the line of the Hamilton & North Western Railway to the defendant at Hamilton, who accepted a number of car loads, but refused to accept others on the ground that a portion of the lumber in them was not up to the standard of his letter of February 20th. All the lumber had been sent to Hamilton except one car load which, by defendant\u2019s orders, was sent to London.\nThe plaintiff sued for the whole amount shipped, and defendant in his statement of defence offered to pay for the portion which was of the proper size and quality.\nThe plaintiff recovered a verdict at the trial for the full amount, and both the Common Pleas Division and the Court of Appeal refused to disturb it. Both these courts held that the defendant had no right to reject the lumber, his only remedy being to proceed against the plaintiff for damages for non-delivery according to contract. From the decision of the Court of Appeal the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBain Q.C. and Cappelle for the appellant, as to right of inspection and rejection, and when and where it must be exercised, in addition to cases cited in the court below, referred to Towers v. Dominion Iron and Metal Co[3]; Campbell on Sales[4]; Chitty on Contracts[5]; Morton v. Tibbett[6].\nAs to rights of buyer to reject goods on ground of difference in kind or quality see Benjamin on Sales[7]; Barr v. Gibson[8]; Gompertz v. Barllett[9]; Behn v. Burness[10].\nThe vendor is bound to give opportunity to inspect goods. Benjamin on Sales[11]. Delivery to carrier is delivery to purchaser, but carrier can only receive not accept goods. Benjamin on Sales[12].\nIn a severable contract the buyer is bound to accept such parts as are in accordance with the contract, but has a right to reject such as are not, Couston v. Chapman[13]; Borrowman v. Free[14]; Highlands Chemical Co. v. Matthews[15].\nThe question of goods being or not being according to the contract is for the jury. Weiler v. Schilizzi[16]; Bannerman v. White[17].\nMcCarthy Q.C., for the respondent, contended that under the circumstances the appellant had not the right of rejection as claimed, but his remedy was either by a reduction in the price claimed or by cross-action or counter claim. He referred to Benjamin on Sales[18] and to Campbell v. Mersey Docks[19]; Rohde v. Thwaites[20].\nBain Q.C. in reply cited Wait v. Baker[21].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014After a careful consideration of this case I have arrived at the conclusion, on the facts presented, that by the shipments on the railway of lumber which answered generally the kind of lumber contracted for there was a substantial compliance with the contract, and the vendee had no right to reject any number of carloads because of the inferiority in quality of a very small portion in each carload, but that his redress was a claim for reduction in the price, or for damages which would appear, in this case, to have been, comparatively, of a very trifling amount and for which he has been allowed an abatement in the price. Of course, if the article shipped was of an entirely different character the case would be very different, but here the description was substantially satisfied, which resolves the dispute into one of quality; and the verdict establishing that the deficiency in quality only amounted to $90, or about 4\u00bd per cent., an amount insufficient to justify the rejection of the lumber, which, in other respects, answered the terms of the contract, and defendant having been allowed that amount, substantial justice has, in my opinion, been done, and I cannot see any object to be gained by disturbing this verdict, though I must say I cannot very well understand why the evidence as to quality should have been rejected in the first instance as applicable either to the question whether the article supplied accorded with the contract, or as matter in reduction of the price; but I think we must take the verdict as establishing, after defendant was permitted to go into the evidence of the quality and character of the lumber, exactly how defective it was, and therefore there can be no possible object gained by sending the case to another trial by reason of the rejection of the evidence in the first instance.\nFOURNIES J.\u2014Le contrat fait entre les parties r\u00e9sulte de leur correspondance \u00e0 ce sujet. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019obligeait \u00e0 livrer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour le prix convenu 200,000 pieds de bois de la qualit\u00e9 et des dimensions mentionn\u00e9es dans la correspondance. Le bois s\u2019\u00e9tant trouv\u00e9 de dimensions plus petites que celles convenues et de mauvaise qualit\u00e9,\u201414 charges de chars furent refus\u00e9es \u00e0 leur arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Hamilton, parce que les madriers n\u2019avaient pas 18 pieds de longueur, 2 pouces d\u2019\u00e9paisseur, et de 6 \u00e0 12 pouces de largeur,\u2014\nAnd was not \u201cgood sound square edge stuff and of the same quality\u201d as was shipped the previous year by plaintiff to the defendant.\nApr\u00e8s une correspondance entre les parties \u00e0 ce sujet, l\u2019appelant offrit la somme pour la qualit\u00e9 de bois qui s\u2019\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9e conforme au contrat. Dyment fit suivre le refus de cette offre d\u2019une action. Au proc\u00e8s, et apr\u00e8s l\u2019enqu\u00eate du demandeur close, M. Lount, conseil du d\u00e9fendeur, fit entendre celui-ci pour prouver \u2018que le bois rejet\u00e9 a Hamilton n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme au contrat. Il avait 8 autres t\u00e9moins pour prouver ce fait\u00bb Le conseil du d\u00e9fendeur objecta \u00e0 cette preuve, pr\u00e9tendant que l\u2019appelant aurait d\u00fb inspecter le bois abord des chars, aux moulins du demandeur, que ne l\u2019ayant pas fait, il ne pouvait plus l\u2019inspecter et le rejeter \u00e0 Hamilton; qu\u2019il ne pouvait plus alors exercer que son action en dommages ou prouver l\u2019inf\u00e9riorit\u00e9 de la qualit\u00e9 en d\u00e9duction du prix du contrat. Cette objection fut maintenue par l\u2019hon, juge qui d\u00e9clara que la preuve offerte \u00e9tait inadmissible comme d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019action et ne pouvait servir qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00e9tablir une r\u00e9clamation de dommages ou en r\u00e9duction du prix du contrat.\nEn cons\u00e9quence de la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019hon. juge, aucun des huit autres t\u00e9moins pr\u00eats \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le fait que le bois n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme au contrat ne fut entendu, et il s\u2019ensuivit entre les conseils un arrangement par lequel on convint de suspendre le proc\u00e8s et de laisser entrer un jugement pour $1,325 et les frais, sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits du d\u00e9fendeur de faire motion pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du jug\u00e9. Par cet arrangement, tout ce qui aurait eu lieu apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme non avenu, si la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait annul\u00e9e. Le montant de la r\u00e9duction mentionn\u00e9e alors ne repr\u00e9sentait pas la valeur de la diff\u00e9rence entre le bois mentionn\u00e9 au contrat et celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9 puisque la preuve en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interdite.\nLa principale question que soul\u00e8ve cet appel est de savoir si la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019hon. juge d\u00e9clarant que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait aucun droit d\u2019inspecter et de rejeter le bois \u00e0 Hamilton est fond\u00e9e en loi.\nCette question doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e et d\u00e9cid\u00e9e sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de $90 consentie par l\u2019appelant. Il est \u00e9vident que ce montant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis que parce que l\u2019appelant avait confiance de faire casser la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019hon. juge, et avait aussi la conviction que s\u2019il r\u00e9ussissait \u00e0 faire entendre ses t\u00e9moins il \u00e9tablirait la suffisance de ses offres. Peut-on maintenant s\u2019appuyer sur cet arrangement pour en conclure comme l\u2019a fait la Cour d\u2019Appel que l\u2019insignifiance de la r\u00e9duction $90, est une preuve que le contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli? C\u2019est oublier que cette admission n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e que pour un but particulier, et c\u2019est violer la convention des parties que de s\u2019en servir pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019examen de la question que cette admission avait pour but unique de soumettre \u00e0 la revision d\u2019un autre tribunal.\nCes arrangements entre les parties, en face de la cour, lorsqu\u2019elle y donne son approbation, ont la force d\u2019un contrat judiciaire qui est aussi obligatoire que la chose jug\u00e9e. La partie qui y a donn\u00e9 son consentement ne peut plus le r\u00e9tracter.[22]\nLe contrat de vente dont il s\u2019agit n\u2019a rien d\u00e9termin\u00e9 au sujet du lieu de l\u2019inspection. L\u2019intim\u00e9 devait fournir du bois venant de trois \u00e9tablissements diff\u00e9rents. Il l\u2019a exp\u00e9di\u00e9 en diff\u00e9rents temps et sans en donner avis \u00e0 l\u2019appelant qui n\u2019a jamais eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019en faire l\u2019inspection ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 Hamilton.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9, qu\u2019il devait le livrer \u00e0 bord des chars est contredite et par lui-m\u00eame et par la correspondance et par le fait qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une seule charge de char tout le bois a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Hamilton.\nDans le silence des parties \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il faut en conclure que l\u2019appelant avait droit d\u2019inspecter et de rejeter le bois \u00e0 Hamilton.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de cela, la vente d\u2019articles non encore en existence, lors m\u00eame que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 est pass\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur, ne lui enl\u00e8ve pas le droit de les ins- pecter et de les rejeter, dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable. La loi \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est clairement expos\u00e9e dans la cause de Pope vs. AIlis[23]:\nThe authorities cited sustained this proposition, that when a vendor sells goods of a specified quality, but not in existence or ascertained, and undertakes to ship them to a distant buyer when made or ascertained, and delivers them to the carrier for the purchaser, the latter is not bound to accept them without examination. The mere delivery of the goods by the vendor to the carrier does not necessarily bind the vendee to accept them. On their arrival he has the right to inspect them to ascertain whether they conform to the contract, and the right to inspect implies the right to reject them if they are not of the quality required by the contract.\nCette d\u00e9cision doit avoir d\u2019autant plus d\u2019application \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause qu\u2019elle est fond\u00e9e sur les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents anglais qui y sont cit\u00e9s, et que les circonstances de la cause sont parfaitement analogues \u00e0 celles mentionn\u00e9es dans cette d\u00e9cision. Les jugements contraires de la Cour d\u2019Appel ne saurait pr\u00e9valoir contre cette autorit\u00e9 ni contre celle de. Grimoldby v. Wells[24] o\u00f9 Brett J. s\u2019exprime ainsi au sujet du droit d\u2019inspection:\nThere is here a contract for the sale of goods, and by agreement they are to be delivered before a fair opportunity for inspection arises, for it cannot properly be said that it would be reasonable to hold the defendant bound to examine where they were delivered to him at half way of the journey.\nLa doctrine \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans cette autorit\u00e9 par l\u2019hon. juge est sans doute celle qui devait r\u00e9gler l\u2019effet du contrat en question dans cette cause. Pour cela il faudrait permettre la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 refuse\u00e9, car ce n\u2019est que par ce moyen que l\u2019appelant pouvait \u00e9tablir si le bois livr\u00e9 \u00e0 Hamilton \u00e9tait des description et qualit\u00e9 d\u00e9finies par le contrat. Je suis d\u2019opinion qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre permise. Je dois ajouter que je concours enti\u00e8rement dans l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par l\u2019hon. juge Henry dans les notes qu\u2019il a eu l\u2019obligeance de me communiquer. L\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9 et un nouveau proc\u00e8s ordonn\u00e9. HENRY J.\u2014By means of a correspondence entered into between the parties to this suit, the respondent, in 1884, agreed to sell to the appellant certain dimension lumber to be shipped to Hamilton, where the appellant resided.\nThe defence set up is that certain shipments, in whole or in part, were inferior in quality and not according to the contract, and that the appellant declined to receive the same. Some shipments were accepted.\nWhen at the trial the counsel of the appellant was proceeding to adduce evidence to sustain the defence, the counsel of the respondent objected to any evidence to sustain it, but agreed that evidence in reduction of damages should be received, and his contention was sustained by the presiding judge. The contention of the respondent\u2019s counsel was that the appellant had no right of inspection at Hamilton but that it should have been made when the lumber was put on board the cars. It is shown that the lumber was shipped from three different mills of the respondent and from time to time. No notice was given the appellant of any of those shipments. How then could it be assumed that the appellant could have by any possibility made any inspection? It may be gathered from the correspondence and otherwise that the appellant was to pay the railway charges, but that, in my opinion, does not affect the contract otherwise. Such payment only affects the price. Suppose the respondent had agreed to deliver the lumber free of all expense at Hamilton, would not the right of inspection there be at once admitted, and when we consider that if the cost of transit was agreed to be paid by the appellant the respondent sold to that extent at a lower rate. The respondent agreed to put free on board the cars consigned to the appellant a particular quality and description of lumber, and the substantial question is: Did he do so? How can he claim that the appellant accepted the lumber shipped when he knew that the latter not only had not accepted the inferior lumber but was not given an opportunity of doing so?\nIt is shown that the appellant required and contracted for a particularly described article and the respondent agreed to supply that to him. Suppose a builder having a contract for the erection of a house is required to use dimension material and another agrees to supply the same and to put it free on board the cars of a railway; he ships it but without any notice to the party purchasing it, and when it reaches the place of delivery, and is found wholly unsuitable, would it not be monstrous to decide that the builder was bound to receive it and pay for an article he neither wanted or contracted for? The proposition would be monstrous, illegal and inequitable, and what have we here but substantially that same proposition?\nI will put another case. A merchant in Halifax undertakes to ship to another at Montreal a quantity, say one hundred barrels, of herrings, sound and of good quality, and agrees to put them free on board the cars at the price agreed upon. The number of barrels of herrings are shipped, but on reaching Montreal are found to have been unsound when shipped and of inferior quality. Is the consignee in such a case obliged to accept the consignment? Is he required to take what he did not want or purchase? Who can be found to contend that he would, and yet it is contended the appellant is bound here. Would not the merchant in Montreal be entitled to refuse acceptance of the fish? And could he not claim to be reimbursed for the freight if he paid it and such damages for the breach of contract as he could prove? So in this case the appellant, in my opinion, is entitled to claim, in respect of any of the shipments that on inspection in Hamilton turned out different from the contract, reinbursement of the freight paid by him and special damage if proved.\nThe contract in this case was, in effect, that the respondent would ship on board the cars the lumber according to the contract, and his right to recover was based on showing that the lumber so shipped was so. He did not attempt on the trial to prove it, but objected to the appellant showing the opposite by evidence that when the lumber reached Hamilton it was not according to the contract. I am of the opinion that such evidence was improperly rejected.\nWe need not speculate on the question of the right of the appellant to claim the property so shipped. It was, no doubt, his, but subject to his right to reject it. He had no doubt an insurable interest in it when shipped, but considerations of such questions do not affect the issues raised in this case.\nOn the part of the appellant it is shown, and uncontradicted, that on the learned judge deciding at the trial that the appellant could not inspect and refuse to accept the lumber alleged to be not according to the contract at Hamilton the right to have that judgment reviewed on appeal was agreed to, but that evidence should be received in reduction of the price agreed upon, or by cross action in case the decision of the learned judge upon that point should be affirmed. That after some evidence was given as to the value of the lumber independently of the question of its being according to the contract, it was agreed that $90 should, in that event, but only in that event, be considered as the sum to be deducted. That agreement does not in any way affect the consideration of the other and more important question. Our judgment is, therefore, required upon the latter subject. It is alleged too in the appellants factum, and tacitly admitted, that he had several witnesses to prove that the lumber was not according to the contract, but that the learned judge having refused to admit evidence on the point they were not examined. We must, therefore, not fail to mark the distinction between evidence of the value of an article and evidence as to an article being according to contract. A man is bound to accept only what he specifically bargains for, although the article offered is worth in the market even more than that contracted for. The factum of the respondent put the case fairly thus:\u2014\nThe question in issue between the parties is the one simple question of law whether under the circumstances the appellant had the right of rejection at the place and in the manner mentioned above.\nThe contract was to deliver 200,000 feet of plank two inches thick, from six to 12 in width and eighteen feet long, to be good, sound, square edged stuff, red and white pine fit for car flooring. The appellant alleges in his statement of defence, that the lumber refused by him was \u201cneither good, sound square edge stuff\u201d of the size agreed for, nor of the proper quality. Issue was taken thereon and that is the only one legitimately before us. It is no question like that of a purchaser accepting an inferior article and refusing to pay the full contract price. In such a case the supplying party has failed to supply the proper article, and the purchaser may either demand a reduction in price or counter claim for damages. We must not confound the two positions. Where a party refuses to accept an article different from that contracted for, I can find neither any law or equity to force him.\nOn the trial the appellant was prevented by the learned judge from showing that the lumber was not according to the contract.\nIt cannot be denied that if the goods shipped or tendered are not the kind of goods agreed for, or where the description of the goods is not answered by the goods offered, that the right of rejection is still with the buyer, notwithstanding shipment and delivery, as in that case there is a total want of fulfilment of the contract or a breach of a condition precedent on the part of the vendor. See Chanter v. Hopkins[25]; Bowes v. Shand[26]; Benjamin on Sales[27].\nThe appellant was not allowed to prove such a legal defence as every principle of justice requires and the law permits him to do. He is therefore, in my deliberate judgment, entitled to a new trial. I think therefore, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted with costs in all the courts.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed upon two grounds. 1st, Because, under the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence, the property in the goods passed to the vendee at the time of shipment; 2nd, on the ground that the appellant having received, paid for and accepted a substantial part of the goods his right of rejection was gone.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I find it difficult to understand how the misunderstanding in this case, which occasioned this appeal, has arisen.\nThe defendant pleaded a right to reject lumber forwarded to him by the plaintiff under a contract of purchase upon the ground that the lumber so rejected was not sound, good, square edge stuff, fit for car flooring, which, as he said, was the lumber contracted for.\nWhen defendant\u2019s counsel, having called the defendant as a witness on his own behalf, was proceeding to examine him upon the quality of the lumber, counsel for the plaintiff objected to any such evidence being given for the purpose of establishing the defence set up in the statement of defence, insisting that to entitle the defendant to reject the lumber he should have inspected it at the mills before the lumber was forwarded. The learned judge concurred in this view, but said he would receive the evidence subject to the objection, and he ruled that the defendant should have leave to file a counter claim. The counsel for the defendant disputed this point of law, insisting that the contract, which, as he contended, appeared in a letter which he relied upon, did not make the lumber deliverable on the cars, but to the defendant at Hamilton. The court then adjourned. When the court met again next morning, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated that he had decided not to enter a counter claim, and to offer no evidence as to quality, but to go to the jury for the sole purpose of determining what the contract was. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then stated that he was quite willing that the defendant should give evidence that the lumber was not according to contract, and also as to quality with a view to reduction of the price. Defendant\u2019s counsel then stated that he would go on to give evidence as to a reduction in the price and to dispose of the whole case, and accordingly he called the defendant and went largely into evidence as to what the contract was, and as to reduction in the price by reason of defect in quality. Now, I do not see why the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the first instance objected to the evidence as to defect in quality being gone into, for it was given in the result largely, although not, as is now said, to the extent it could have been gone into, as defendant had as he said, many witnesses in court who could have spoken to that point. The evidence of defect in quality offered to reduce the price might have proved sufficient to show that the quality was so utterly defective, and so unsuitable for the purpose for which the lumber was purchased, that it could not be said to have supplied the contract, in which latter case, as was admitted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the defendant might have rejected the lumber as he did. And it was also admitted that it was open to the defendant, if the evidence supported the contention, to have it put to the jury-to determine whether the lumber was so defective in quality that it could not be said to supply the contract. So that in reality there appears to have been no reason why the defendant should not have offered all the evidence he had for the purpose of establishing the lumber to have been so defective in quality. But what took place was that after examining the defendant himself and two or three other witnesses called by the defendant, and after reading certain letters which had passed between the parties, the learned judge expressed the opinion that the contract was not as the defendant contended, but as the plaintiff contended that it was. Counsel for the defendant accepted this opinion which, plainly, materially affected the defendant\u2019s contention as to his right of rejection of the lumber, which he rested chiefly upon the contention that the lumber was purchased for a special purpose, namely, for car flooring, and for which, as was contended, it was wholly unsuitable, but which purpose was not expressed in the contract as it was found to be in the opinion of the learned judge, and the purpose for which, as the defendant contended, the lumber had been purchased not being in the contract might have rendered useless the evidence of the other witnesses which the defendant had in attendance. Under these circumstances defendant\u2019s counsel, not disputing the correctness of the learned judge\u2019s opinion as to the terms of the contract nor asking that the question should be submitted to the jury, agreed with the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that if the defendant was not entitled to reject the lumber as he did a verdict should be rendered for the plaintiff for the amount claimed by him, less the sum of $90.00, as the difference between the value of the lumber delivered and that contracted for, and it was agreed that the defendant\u2019s consenting to such verdict was not to prevent his moving in term against the ruling of the learned judge as to the defendant\u2019s right to reject the lumber. But the verdict must be taken to have been a fair settlement of the difference in value between the lumber delivered and that contracted for, and the plaintiff\u2019s contention as to the terms of the contract, as to which there is now no dispute, must, under the circumstances stated above, be taken to be correct, so that the verdict cannot but have a very material effect upon the question involved in such action for if the reduction in value was no more than $90.00, which amounted to 4\u00bd per cent. such a difference never would have justified a rejection of the lumber, assuming Hamilton to have been the place where it should have been inspected. I think, therefore, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for substantial justice appears to have been done by the deduction of $90.00 from the amount demanded, which sum must be taken to be the true amount of the difference in value between the lumber delivered and that contracted for, so that no useful purpose could be obtained by throwing open the case before another jury whether the lumber should or not have been inspected by the defendant before it was loaded on the cars at the mills, to be forwarded to him at Hamilton. The defendant must be taken to have accepted the opinion of the learned judge as to the terms of the contract, establishing it to be as the plaintiff contended, and not as the defendant contended it to be, and upon the terms of the contract being as the defendant claimed them to be, the whole force of the defendant\u2019s claim of right to reject the lumber was rested.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Bain, Laidlaw & Co.\nSolicitors for respondent: McCarthy, Pepler & McCarthy.\n[1] 12 Ont.

J. Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry Taschereau and Gwynee JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nTutor and minor\u2014Sale prior to 1st Aug. 1866\u2011Action to annul\u2011Prescription\u2011Arts 2243, 2253. C.C.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below Fournier and Henry JJ. dissenting, that the action to annul a sale made in 1855 by a minor emancipated by marriage to her father and ex-tutor (without any account being rendered, but after the making of an inventory of the community existing between her father and mother) of her share in her mother's succession, was prescribed by ten years from the date when the minor became of age ([1]). Moreau v .Motz ([2]) followed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([3]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the appellants (plaintiffs).\nThe appellant Dame Julia Gregoire instituted the present action against her brothers, the respondents, as universal legatees of Joseph Gregoire Sr. their father, to annul and set aside the inventory of community of said Joseph Gregoire Sr. made in 1848, and also to annul and set aside a deed of sale of the 9th July 1855 made by her husband and herself to her father, Joseph Gregoire Sr., of her rights in the estate and succession of her mother and to have the respondents render an account of the administration of her property by the said Joseph Gregoire Sr. as her tutor from 1848 to 1854.\nThe conclusion of the declaration is in substance as follows:\n10. That the pretended inventory prepared by the Notary Lukin be declared null and irregular, and that the respondents be ordered to prepare a new inventory of the property of the community heretofore existing between the said Joseph Gregoire and Sophie Dupuis.\n20. That the deed of the 9th July 1855 be declared null as having been made in violation of art. 311 of the Civil Code.\n30 That Marie Simard (the second wife of the said Joseph Gregorie Sr.) be miss eu cause to hear it declared that the first community heretofore existing between Joseph Gregoire and Sophie Dupuis has never been dis solved, provided the appellants upon the production of a new inventory, and after having deliberated thereon, choose to continue the said community.\n40. That the respondents be condemned to render to the appellant the account of tutorship which Joseph Gregoire should have rendered to her.\nThe respondents to this action pleaded:\n10. That this action being personal, or movable, could not be taken by the wife, the appellant, under the r\u00e9gime of community of property, but only by her husband.\n20. That the said inventory of 1848 is good and valid and that the omission of the signature of Joseph Grresrorie Sr. to the last attendance is immaterial and of no importance, the notary having signed himself and having declared that the Joseph Gregoire has signed, and that such omission is covered or remedied by the closing of the inventory by the said Joseph Gregoire Sr., under oath before the judge;\n30. That the prohibition contained in art. 311 of the Civil Code does not apply to the deed of sale of the 9th July, 1855, as such sale is not made by the appellant alone, but by the appellant and her husband to Joseph 0-regoire, Sr., and as there was community of property between the appellant and her husband the latter had legal authority and full power to make any settlement with Joseph Gregoire Sr., relative to his administration and account as tutor to his wife without a previous detailed account of tutorship;\n40. The demand of the nullity of the deed of sale of the 9th July, 1855, is prescribed by ten years from the date of such deed or from the majority of the appellant\nThe facts of the case, admitted by the parties, are as follows:\nJoseph Gregoire sr., and Sophie Dupuis, the father and mother of the parties in this cause were married on the 22nd September, 1829, under the r\u00e9gime of community of property.\nSophie Dupuis died intestate on the 20th February 18-48, leaving seven children issue of her said marriage all minors, to whom the said Joseph Gregoire, their father, was appointed tutor in. July 1848; forthwith the said Joseph Gregoire had the inventory of the community of property which had existed between him and the Sophie Dupuis made before M. J. B. Lukin, notary, and the said inventory was judicially closed on the 24th October 1848.\nThe appellant, Julie Gregoire, married Thomas Griard on the 20th February, 1854, and there is community of property between them according to the laws of the Province of Quebec. Civ. Code. art. 1260 et seq.\nOn. the 9th July 1855 Thomas Girard and his wife, the appellant, sold to the said Joseph Gregoire, sr., all the rights of the appellant in the estate and succession of her deceased mother.\nOn the 30th June, 1856, Joseph Gregoire, sr., married a second wife Dame Marie Simard, the mise en cause, under the r\u00e9gime of community of property.\nOn the 13th of October, 1881, Joseph Gregoire, sr., died leaving the defendants, respondents, his universal legatees under his last will dated 23rd September, 1881.\nThe principal question which arose on this appeal was whether the action to annul the sale made in 1853 by the appellant, Julie Gregoire, then a minor, emanci pated by marriage, to her father and extutor was pre scribed by ten years or thirty years.\nGeoffrion for appellants.\nParadis for respondents.\nThe authorities and cases cited by counsel are reviewed in the judgments of the courts below, reported in Montreal Law Reports 2 Q. B. p. 229, and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In view of the confessedly contradictory authorities with reference to the prescrip tion of ten or thirty years, as applicable to the matters in controversy, and in view of the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec as enunciated in the case of Moreau v. Mtotz ([4]) decided some 29 years ago and not questioned but acquiesed in since that time, I do not feel myself justified in overruling that case and reversing the judg ment of the Court of appeal.\nFOURNIER J. L'action des Appelants a pour but: 10 De faire declarer nul l'inventaire fait par feu Joseph Grregoire des biens de la communaut\u00e9, qui avait exist\u00e9 entre lui et sa d\u00e9funite \u00e9pouse, Sophie Dupuis, en pr\u00e9senee de nitre Lukin, les 24, 25 et 28 septembre 1848; 2\u00b0 Aussi de faire declarer la nullit\u00e9 d'un acte de vente du 9 juillet 1855, consenti par l'Appelante et son marl en faveur du dit Joseph Gr\u00e9goire, son p\u00e9re et tuteur, de ses droits tant mobiliers qu;immobiliers dans la succession de sa m\u00e8re; et 3\u00b0 subs\u00e9damment de faire condamner les repr\u00e9sen-tants l\u00e9gaux du dit feu Joseph Gr\u00e9goire a lui rendre compte de la grestion et administration que ce dernier a eue des biens de l'Apellante, comme son tuteur, depuis 1848 a 1854.\nLes moyens de nullit\u00e9s all\u00e9gu\u00e9s contre l'inventaire sont:\u2014que la derni\u00e9re et la plus importante des diflferentes vacations de ce pr\u00e9tendu inventaire n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e par le dit Joseph G\u00e9rgoire ni par les estimateurs qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 choisis pour faire l'\u00e9valuation des biens meubles, et que cet acte non termin\u00e9 n'a aucun caractere d'acte authentique, et ne pourrait tout an plus que servir de m\u00e9moire pour la confection de l'inventaire demand\u00e9.\nLa nullit\u00e9 de l'acte de vente du 9 juillet 1855 est demand\u00e9e sur le principe que le dit Joseph Gr\u00e9goire n'ayant jamais rendu compte a l'Appelante, tout contrat ou trait\u00e9 entre lui et sa pupille est frapp\u00e9 de nullit\u00e9 absolue.\nQue dans tous les cas, Joseph Gr\u00e9goire n'ayant jamais rendu compte et le dit acte de vente n'en pouvant tenir lieu, les repr\u00e9sentanss l\u00e9gaux sont tenus d'en rendre un \u00e0 l'Appelante.\nLa declaration all\u00e8gue aussi des menaces faites par Ie dit Joseph Gr\u00e9goire de d\u00e9sh\u00e9riter ceux de ses enfants qui voudraient invoquer la nullit\u00e9 de son inventaire, et des promesses que si on ne le d\u00e9rangeait pas il partagerait ses biens \u00e9galement entre tous ses enfants. La d\u00e9fense a cette action consiste, l a nier le droit d'action de l'Appelante parce qu'elle est commune en biens avec son mari; 2\u00b0 a soutenir que l'inyentaire, quoique non sign\u00e8 dans la derni\u00e8re vacation, est valable et que l'omission de cette signature est r\u00e9par\u00e9e par la cl\u00f4ture en justice; 3\u00b0 que la prohibition de l'art. 311 ne s'applique pas au cas actuel parce que le mani de l'Appelante en sa qualit\u00e9 de commun en biens ayec elle avait droit de faire tous r\u00e9glements quelconques avec le tuteur, Jos. Gregoire, sans aucun compte d\u00e9taille de la tutelle; 4\u00b0 que l'action en nullit\u00e9 de l'acte du 9 juillet est prescrite par dix ans.\nMarie Simard, seconde \u00e9pouse de Joseph Gregoire, mise en cause comme commune en biens, a invoqu\u00e9 les m\u00e9mes moyens de d\u00e9fenee que les repr\u00e9sentanss de son mari.\nLes questions souley\u00e9es en cette cause sont au nombre de quatre; 1\u00b0 l'Appeiante seule, mais ayec I'autorisation de son mari, pouvait-elle intenter l'action en. reddition de comptes; 2\u00b0 la nuflit\u00e9 de l'inventaire; 3\u00b0 la nuflit\u00e9 de iacte de vente du 9 juillot 1885; 4\u00b0 quelle prescription peut couvrir la nullit\u00e9 de linven taire et cells de lacte de vente du 9 juin 1885 ?\nPour obvier a l'objection que i'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par l'Appelante seule ayec lautorisation de son mari, celuici a demand\u00e9 a \u00e9tre recu partie intervenante. Il est certain que cette demands ne peut lui \u00e9tre refus\u00e9e car ii est une des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans cette action en sa qualit\u00e9 de commun en biens ayec son \u00e9pouse; ii est comme tel maitre des actions de la comxnunaut\u00e9 Sa demands d'intervenir a rendu inutile lexamen de la question de savoir si iaction pnise par la femme seule, bien que dument autoris\u00e9e, \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement intent\u00e9e. L'intervention dolt \u00e9tre accord\u00e9e, et en cons\u00e9quence le marl sera demandeur conjointement ayec sa femme, car la presence de celleci est indispensable v\u00fb qu'il s'agit aussi de ses droits immobiliers dans l'action.\n2. L'omsssion d'avoir fait signer par Joseph Grr\u00e9goire, le requ\u00e9rant a l'inventaire et tuteur de ses enfants, deux des vacations de l'inventaire, estelle suffisante pour rendre cet inventaire nul ? D'apr\u00e8s I'article 1307 C. P. C., l'inventaire doit \u00eatre fait en forme authentique; I'article 1308 declare qu'il est compose de deux parties, la premiere, ou le pr\u00e9ambule, \u00e9noncant les noms et qualit\u00e9s des parties a l'inventaire; Ia deuxi\u00e9me partie est l'inventaire proprement dit et contient, 1\u00b0 l'indication du lieu ou l'inventaire est fait; 2\u00b0 la description des biens et des eflets mobiliers et l'estimation qui doit en \u00eatre faite a sa juste valeur par deux estimateurs assermentes; 3\u00b0 la designation des esp\u00e8ces en num\u00e8raire ou autres valeurs; 4\u00b0 la mention des papiers, lesquels doivent \u00eatre cotes par premier et dernier et paraph\u00e9s de la main d'un des notaires; 5\u00b0, 6\u00b0,7\u00b0, etc., ne concementpss la question a decider, Ces articles ne font que r\u00e9umer l'ancien droit sur ce sujet.\nMerlin ([5]), en traitant des formalit\u00e9s de l'inventaire, dit formeliement que chaque vacation de l'inventaire doit \u00e9tre sign\u00e9e; ii s'exprime en ces termes:\nLa minute de l'inventaire doit \u00e9tre sign\u00e9e tant a l'intitul\u00e9 qu'\u00e1 chaque vacation, et a Ia fin, par les officiers qui y ont proc\u00e9de, par les parties et par les t\u00e9moins, lorsqu'il y en a sinon il doit \u00eatre fait men tion du refus de signer et des causes de ce refus.\nLa signature du dit Joseph Gr\u00e9goire, partie principale au dit inventaire en son propre nom et aussi en sa qualit\u00ea de tuteur, \u00e9tait donc indispensable pour la validit\u00e9 des vacations qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9es. 11 avait sign\u00e9 le pr\u00eaambule, qui n'est que de forme et les deux vacations qu'il n'a pas sign\u00e9es sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment comme le dit le Code de Procedure, celles qui forment l'inventaire proprement dit. En effet celle du 25 millet 1848 contenait une liste d'effets, et celle du 28 septembre conte naiL l'enum\u00e9ration des dettes actives et passives immeubles et autres valeur. C'\u00e9tait la tout l'inventaire et il n'a pap \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par Gr\u00e9goire qui avait sans doute ses raisons pour cela. Dans tous les cas ii \u0152tatt de rigueur de faire mention des causes de son refus de signer les vacations qui sont les seules qui\u00e9 tablissaient contre lui les droits de ses enfants. A-t-il refue\u00e9 de le faire parce que sa d\u00e9c.aration des faits \u0152tatt incom pl\u0141te ? On pourrait le croire, Si on en juge par sa conduite subs\u00e9quente; quoi qu'il en soit, c'est un fait in contestable que l'inventaire n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 et qu'en cons\u00e9quence ii n'est pas seulement nul pour irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 mais parce qu'il n'a jamais exist\u00e9.\nOn a pr\u00e9tendu couvrir cette nullit\u00e9 par la production d'un certificat du protonotaire constatant que liinven taire avait Ct\u00e9 clos en justice. L'honorable juge Chagnon dans ses notes a d\u00e9clarC que.cette preuve \u00e9tait insuffsante et qu'un jugement de cloture d'inventaire, pas plus que tout autre jugement, ne pourait \u00e9tre prouv\u00e9 que par la production d'une copie authentique du juge ment m\u0152me. Cette proposition est sans doute parfai tement correcte; mais la production du jugement lui m\u0152me aurait-elle pu faire une difference et couvrir la nullit\u00e9 dont ii s'agiit Ii est evident que non, parce que l'acte de cl\u00f4ture ne pent couvrir l'omission des formalit\u00e9s prescrit\u00e9s pour les inventaires, Merlin be dit positivement an mot \" Cloture d'inventaire.\" Si dit-il, les formalit\u00e9s prescrites pour les inventaires, n'ont point \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, 'lacte de cloture, quoiqu'il soit en bonne forme, ne pent couvrir les omissions. C'est pourquoi par arret du 12 f\u00e9vrier 1682, rendu a la grande Chambre sur les conclusions de M. Talon, ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que la minute de 1'inventaire sign\u00e9e des parties et d'un seul notaire, quoique la clpture eat \u00e9t\u00e9 mise sur la minute n'avait point dissout la communaut\u00e9.\nDans be cas cite c'est un des notaires qui avail omis de signer dans celui dont ii s'agit l'omission est encore plus grave, car c'est la partie principale qui a refuse, ou du moins a neglige de contracter les obligations r\u00e9sultant de l'inventaire en omettant d'y apposer sa signature. Il y a analogie parfaite entre les deux cas, et par consequent m\u0152me raison de dire que la cloture d'inventaire, en la supposant l'\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9e n'aurait Pu couvrir la nullit\u00e9 resultant du d\u00e9faut de signatures.\nEt dans le cas actuel comme dans celui cite par Merlin il faut en con dure qu'il n'y a pas eu de dissolution de communaut\u00e9 entre Joseph Gegoire et ses enfants, si l'action de l'Appelante n'est pas prescrite, ce que nous verrons plus loin.\nLa troisi\u00e9me question au sujet de la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte de venee du 9 juin 1855 ne peut souffrir aucune difficult\u00e9. Lors de la passation de cet acte de vente, Joseph G-r\u00e9goire, p\u00e9re et tuteur de l'Appelante, encore mineure, n'avait pas, comme on vient de le voir, fait inventaire de sa communaut\u00e9 de biens avec Dame Sophie Dupuis, sa d\u00e9funte \u00e9pouse. II n'y avait eu qu'un commencement d'acte rest\u00e9 incomplet et cons\u00e9quemment, sans effet. II n'avait alors rendu aucun compte a l'Appelante et ne lui en a jamais rendu depuis. Cependant par cet acte auquel intervint Thomas Girard le mani de 1'Appelante, Joseph Grregoire acheaa de sa pupille, autoris\u00e9e par son mari, pour la consideration y mentionnee: \" toss les droits successifs mobiliers et immobiliers, fruits et revenus d'iceux, demandes, actions rescindantes et rescisoires que la dite venderesse peut ou pourrait avoir, demander et pr\u00e9tendre dans la succession de fen Sophie Dupuis sa d\u00e9funte mere, en son vivant \u00e9pouee du dit acquer\u00e9ur en quelques lieux et endroits que les dits biens se trouvent \u0152tre assis et situ\u00e9s, en quoi quiIs puissent consister et a quelque somme que le tout puisse se monter sans aucune exception ni reserve de la part des dits vendeurs.\"\nDans cette acquisition de tons les droits mobiliers et immobiliers de l'Appelante dans la succession de sa m\u00e9re, m\u00eame les fruits et revenus, lorsqu'un inventaire n'en avait pas m\u0152me \u00e9t\u00e9 fait r\u00e9gulierement et qu'aucune reddition de compte des dits biens n'avait encore \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, il est evident que l'Appelante \u00e9tait tout a fait a la merci de son tuteur qui devait avoir une connai's sance exacte de la valeur des biens de la succession tandis qu'il la tenait dans une ignorance complete au sujet de ces m\u00eames biens.\nEn cour inf\u00e9rieure pour \u00e9viter l'op\u00e9ration de l'art. 311 C. C., on a pr\u00e9tendu que l'inventaire quoique irr\u00e9gulier et l'acte de venee du 9 juin 1855 pouvaient \u00e9tre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9quivalant a une reddition ee compte informe, afin de pouvoir faire applicaiion a cette cause de l'article 2258; mais cette pr\u00e9tention est tout a fait insoutenable. C'est confondre deux choses bien diff\u00e9rentes 1'inventaire et la reddition de compte ayant chacune d'elles un but special et regl\u00e9es toutes deux particulierement par des articles diff\u00e9rents du Code Civil et du Code de Procedure. Ii est vrai que l'inventaire en le supposant r\u00e9gulier, devrait contenir le d\u00e9tall des biens mobiliers et leur estimation, les dettes passives etc.; mais s'il doit contenir la description des immeubles, ii n'en contient pas l'estimation, et certainement qu'il ne contient rien de la gestion du tuteur depuis le 28 septembre 1848 jusqu'au 9 juin 1855, date de la vente, Ce que ce dernier a Pu d\u00e9penser ou recevoir pendant ces sept ann\u00e9es la rien ne le fait voir. Quel montant a-t-il fait payer a la mineure pour sa part des frais d'inven taire et autres proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pour nominaiion du tuteur, frais d'enterrement, etc.; qu'avaitil alors recu des dettes actives et queules dettes passives avaitil acquittees est impossible de le dire et c'est a tort que la cour a suppose qu'on pouvait facilement en faire l'estimaiion parce qu'il y avait un inventaire et que l'on avait du s'en servir pour cet objet. Cette supposition est contredite par l'acte du 9 juin 1855 qui loin de s'appuyer sur cet inventaire, ne feit meme pas mentioni de son existence. II n'y avait certainement qu'une reddition de compte qui pouvait \u00e9cl\u00c6irer l'Appelante sur sa v\u00e9ritable position. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour empcher des abus semblables a celui dont l'Appelante se plaint que l'article 311 a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9. En \u00e9luder l'effet au moyen de cette confusion d'idoes, qui fait de l'inventaire l'equivalent de la reddition, c'est rendre l'article 311 tout a fait inutile D\u00e9sormais tout tuteur qui aura fait non pas un inventaire irr\u00e9gulier, mais m\u0152me Un inventaire tout a fait en r\u00e9gle, pourra transiger comme bon lui semblera avec son mineur sans rendre compte. I] aura fait un inventaire constatant qu'il avait une succession opulente en mains, il la g\u00e9re pendant sept ans, comme Gr\u00e9goire, en diminee consid\u00e9rablement la valeur par sa mauvaise administrattion; et ne se sentant pas en \u00e9tat de faire une reddition sans faire voirsa maladministration, il aura recours a l'exp\u00e9dient de Gr\u00e9goire, fera une transaction avec son mineur, sans lui donner connaissance de sa position. Ce qu'a fait Gr\u00e9goire tout le monde peut le faire a l'avenir, si ce jugement est confirm\u00e9, et la protection accede aux mineurs par l'article 311 aura cess\u00e9 d'exister. Je ne vois aucun motif de pas donner effet a cet article en d\u00e9clarant nul l'acte du 9 juin 1855.\nLa derni\u00e9re et la plus importante question dans l'ordre que j'ai suivi, est celle de savoir, laquelle des prescriptions de dix ans, on de trente ans, peut couvrir la nullit\u00e9 de l'inventaire et celle de l'absence d'une reddiiion de comr)te et mettre fin a l'action en cette cause. La cour Sup\u00e9rieuee a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qua c'\u00e9tait la prescription de trente ans. Son jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par Ia cour du Banc de la Reine qui a maintenu que ce devait \u00e9tre celle de dix ans. Cette cour n'a touch\u00e9 a aucune des autres questions.\nLes transactions dont ii s'agit ayant eu lieu avant la publication du Code Civil, c'est en vertu de l'art, 2.270 C.C. aux lois ant\u00e9rieures au Code qu'il faut avoir recours pour Ia decision de cette question.\nDans une cause qui a beaucoup d'analogie avec la pr\u00e9sente, cette de Motz vs. Moreau, cette question d prescription a fait le sujet de dissertations tr\u00e9s savantes et a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e contradictoirement par nos cours. La cour Sup\u00e9rieure, compos\u00e9e de trois juges, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les transactions intervenues entre un tuteur et des mineurs devenus majeurs, sans qu'il ait Ct\u00e9 fait un bon et loyal inventaire, sans reddition de coniptes et sans production de pi\u00e9ces justiicatives, sont nulles de plein droit et que l'action pour les faire annuler n'est pres criptible que par 30 ans.\nLa cour du Banc de la Reine pr\u00e9sidee par sir L H. LaFontaine, Baronet, d\u00e9cida que l'action en nullit\u00e9, port\u00e9e par l'Intim\u00e9, \u00e9tait prescrite par le laps de dix ann\u00e9es \u00e9coulees depuis la passation des actes ilicrimin\u00e9s.\nDans l'espoir de mettre fin a ce conflit, la cause fut port\u00e9e au Conseil Priv\u00e9, mais Ia question de pres cription n'y fut pas d\u00e9cided. L'un des honorables juges de la cour du Banc de la Reine commet a ce sujet une erreur qui a du \u00e9tre la raison d\u00e9terminante do son jugement, en d\u00e9clarant s'il est correctement rapport\u00e9, que le jugement de la cour du. Banc de la Reine main-tenant la prescription de dix ans a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9. Cette assertion est certainement erron\u00e9e. La confirmaiion de ce jugement n'a port\u00e9 que sur le fait que I'Appelant Motz avait en une connaissance com plete que l'inventaire n'\u00e9tait pas correcte et qu'il le savait lorsqu'il a fait les transactions attaqu\u00e9es. Lea honorables membres du Conseil Priv\u00e9 s'expriment a cet \u00e9gard comme suit:\nBut although the Appellant may have been entitled to institute the suit it does not follow that he was to succeed in it and seeing that the transaction of 1831 was entered into with full knowledge on the part of the Appellant that the inventory was not correct and was followed by the transaction of 1841 which in their Lordships' judgment was, or was tantamount to, a release, they are of opinion that the Appellant was not so entitled, to succeed.\nLeurs Seigneuries n'ont adop\u00e9e cette conclusion qu'aprss avoir eu le soin de declarer qu'ils \u00e9vitaient de trancher la question de prescription.\nNeither do their Lordships think it necessary, in determining the case, to enter into the question so much discused in these papers, and debated at the argument at the bar, whether the ten years prescription does or does not bar the Appellants' claim. They assume in favour of the Appellant that it does not.\nLeur jugement se termine par le renvoi de l'appel de Motz, sans frais, mais en ajoutant une consideration qui fait voir que Leurs Seigneuries penchaient fortement en faveur de la prescription de trente ans:\nBut their Lordships highly disapprove of transactions of this description entered into by persons standing in confidential relations.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s ces citation il est \u00e9vinent que le ConspilI Priv\u00e9 loin d'avoir adop\u00e9\u00e9 la prescription de dix ans, comme on le fait dire a l'lionorable juge Tessier, penchait plutot en faveur de celle de trente ans, puisqu'il n'a pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 l'action et qu'il a fortement censue\u00e9 des transactions de ce genre.\nLa cause de Sykes v. Shaw ([6]) cit\u00e9e comme une confirmation de l'opinion adop\u00e9ee dans celle de Motz v. Moreatu en diff\u00e9re essentiellement. Les rapports de pupille et de tuteur n'ayant jamais exist\u00e9 entre les parties a l'acte attaqu\u00e9 il ne pouvait y avoir lieu a une reddition de compte de tutelle. L'honorable iuge Meredith s'exprime ainsi a cet \u00e9gard:-\nIn the second place it does not appear that her father was ever appointed tutor.\nAnd thirdly, if the deed impugned had not been passed the account that Noah Shaw would have had to render to his daughter Sarah Caroline Shaw, would have been that of gr\u00e9v\u00e9 de substitution, in favor of the substitu\u00e9e; and not that of a tutor or protutor to a person who had been his ward.\nIl est evident que dans ce cas Ia question dont ii s'agit en cette cause ne se pr\u00e9sente pas dans celle de Sykes v. Shaw. En r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au jugement rapport\u00e9 a la page 320 du L. 0. R., 15 vol., on voit que la cause futd\u00e9cid\u00e9\u00e9e principalement sur motif que Noah Shaw, partie a l'acte attaqu\u00e9, n'avait pas fet\u0152 mis en cause et qu'aucun proc\u00e9d\u00e9 n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adope\u00e9 pour faire prononcer contre lui la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte que l'on opposait \u00e0 Sykes qui n\u00e8'tait qu'un tiers-d\u00e9tenteur. Puisqu'il n'y avait pas de relation de tuteur a pupille, la prescription qui pouvait s'appliquer \u00e9tait done celle de larticle 2258 et non celle de 'larticle 2243.\nLa cause de Pierce v Buttsfs ([7]) citf\u00e8e aussi dans le m\u00e9me but que la pr\u00e8c\u00e8dente n'a, non plus, aucun rapport a la question a d\u00e8cider en cette cause. C'\u00e8tait \u00e8videmment le cas de faire P application de l'article 2258 C. 0., puisque, comme on le voit par les consid\u00e9ranss du jugement, ii y avait eu reddition de compte. A la page 170, 24 L. 0. J., le jugement dans Ia cause de Riendeau v. DeGrosseiler est cite:\nConsid\u00e8rant que le D\u00e9fendeur, appelant, en sa qualit\u00e8 de tuteur de la Demandesesse, intim\u00e8e, a, des longtemps avant l'instutution de l'action en cette cause, rendu a sa dite pupille alors \u00e9mancip\u00e9e par maniage, et assist\u00e8e d'un eurateur l\u00e9galement \u00e9lu a cette charge, compte de son administration des biens de la dite demanderesse, intim\u00e8e, ainsi qu'il appert par le compte rendu du 23 mars 1870, etc.\nUn autre consid\u00e8rant de ce jugement, e'est que la Demanderesee ne pouvait demander au D\u00e9fendeur une reddition de compte sans en meme temps demander a ce que le compte d\u00e9ja rendu par le dit D\u00e9fendeur et accep\u00e9e par la Demanderesse fut mis de cot\u00e9 et qu'elle fat relev\u00e8e de son acceptation. II en fat de m\u0152me dans Ia cause de Pierce v. Butlers (1); l'action fat renvoy\u00e8e, parce qu'il y avait eu une reddition de compte dont l'annulation n'\u00e8tait point demand\u00e9e. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, comme ii n'y a jamais eu de reddition de compte, il n'y avait par consequent pas lieu a en demander l'annulation Mais les conclusions de l'Appelante sont suffisantes pour obvier a cette objection, si elle pouvait s'lever ici, parce qu'elles demandent sp\u00e8cialement l'annulation de l'acte de vente du 9 juin 1855 oppose comme ayant l'effet d'une reddition de compte.\nCe qui precede suffit pour faire voir qu'il n'y a point de jurisprudence \u00e9tablie sur la question en d\u00e9bat, car pour en \u00e9tablir une ii faudrait une suite de jugements uniformes formant un usage sur une m\u00e9me question. Loin de la nous n'avons que la decision isol\u00e8e de Motz et Moreau qui n'a pas recu l'approbation du Conseil Priv\u00e8, comme on vient de le voir.\nC'est donc dans la loi et non dans des decisions pas m\u0152me celles rendues en France qu'il faut aller chercher la solution de la question de savoir si c'est la prescription de trente ans qu'il faut appliquer an cas actuel. Pour savoir quelle \u00e9tait la loi en force a ce sujet avant le Code Civil ii n'est heureusement plus n\u00e9cessaire de compulser les ancennnes autorit\u00e9s, comme l'ont fait avec tant de soin les savants juges dans la cause de Motz et Moreau. Le droit, a ce sujet, avant le Code, a \u00e9t\u00e9 si bien expos\u00e9 dans le factum du savant conseil de l'Appelante, que je me contenterai d'y donner mon adhesion enti\u0141re; mais je dois ajouter que je crois qu'il n'est plus n\u00e9cessaire d'aller aussi loin pour trouver la solution que nous cherchons. Elle est dans le Code Civil.\nJe crois qu'il ne nous reste plus qu'a savoir si le code n'a pas tranch\u00e9 la question taut pour les transactions ant\u00e9rieures a. sa publication que pour celles qui lui sont post\u00e9rieures. L'article 2243 declare que l\u2019action en reddition de compte et des autres actions personnelles du mineur tuteur le tuteur relativement aux faits de la tutelle se prescrivent par trente ans. Cet article est donn\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant la loi ant\u00e9rieure au Code.Lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e8 par les codificateurs, la cause de Motz et Movcau avait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e8e par la cour Sup\u00e8rieure, le 5 septembre 1855; par la cour du Bane de la Reine le 10 mars 1857 et par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 le 8 f\u00e9vrier 1860. Deux des codificateurs, les honorables Caron et Morin avaient pris part au jugement, l'un dans la cour Sup\u00e8rieure et l'autre dans celle du Bane de la Reine, et avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinions differentes sur cette question. Cependant tons deux charges comme codificateurs de declarer queule \u00e9tait la loi en force a cet \u00e9gad, ont declare que la prescription applicable \u00e9tait celle de trente ans. lis paraissent ne l'avoir fait qu'apr\u00e9s beaucoup de consideration, et en ayant pr\u00e9sentes a la m\u00e9moire les opinons qu'iils avaient exprim\u00e9es ace sujet dans la cause de Motz et Moreau, ainsi que celles de leur coll\u00e9gues auxquelles il est sans doute fait allusion dans le paragraphe suivant de leur rapport sur le titre De la Prescription en date du 10 d\u00e9cembre 1862:\nL'article 80 bis est pour faire cesser le doute entretenu par quelques-uns qui regardent les- actions dont ii s'agit comme prescriptibles par dix aus de meme que celle en. restitution. Il n'y a pas de raison particuli\u00e9re de decider ainsi. Au chap. be du \" Teemps requis pour prescrire,\" l'article 8 bis est ainsi concu: \"La prescription de l'action en reddition de compte et des autres actions personnelles du mineur contre letuteur relativement aux faits de la tutelle, a lieu conform\u00e9ment a cette regie et se compte de la majorit\u00e9.\" C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9inent, mot pour mot, le texte de larticle 2243.\nOn voit \"oar ces citations que les codificateurs savaient qu'il y avait eu une difference d'opinion ace sujet etils d\u00e9clarent express\u00e9ment, pour faire cesser ce doute, qu'il n'y avait pas de raison particuli\u00e9re de decider ainsi. Lorsqu'on consid\u00e9re qu'ils avaient mission sp\u00e9ciale de declarer quelle \u00e9tait la loi alors en force; que la clause 6 du chapitre 2 Statuts refondus du Bas-Canada, les obligeait en r\u00e9digeant les codes de n'-y incorporer que les dispositions qu'ils tiendraient pour etre alors r\u00e9ellement en force en leur enioignant de plus de citer les autorit\u00e9s sur lesquelles ils s'appuyaient pour juger qu'elles l'\u00e9taient ainsi; lorsque cet article a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport a la legislature, approuv\u00e9 par elle et que le travail des commissaires a maintenant force de loi, quelle importance peut-on ajouter a la decision de Motz et Moreau et a. celles cit\u00e9es plus haut ? Elles doivent \u00eatre sans effet, comme contraires a la loi. Ceci me parait d'autant plus certain que le statut 29 Vict. chap. 41, passe pour donner a oeuvre de la codification le caract\u00e8re d'acte l\u00e9gislatif, declare positivement dans son pr\u00e8ambule que les codificateurs \" n'ayant incorpor\u00e8 que les dispositions qu'ails ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e9tre actuelleittent en force. Cette declaration est si importante pour la solution de cette question que je crois utile de la citer au long:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que les commsssaires nomm\u00e9s sous l'autorit\u00e9 du se cond chapitre des Statuts Refondus pour le Bas Canada, etc., etc., ont complete cette partie de leur ceuvre appel\u00e9e dans cet acte le Code civil du Bas-.Canada} n'y ayant incorpor\u00e9 que les dispositions quills ont consider\u00e9es \u00e9tre actuellement en force et ayant cite les autorit\u00e9s sur lesquelles ils se sont appuy\u00e9s pour juger qu'elles l'\u00e9taient ainsi, et qu'ils ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 lea amendements qu'ils croient d\u00e9sirables mentiormant ces amendements s\u00e9par\u00e9ment et distinctement, accompagn\u00e9s des raisons sur lesquesles ils sont fond\u00e9s et qu'ils se sont en tous points conformes au dit acte a l'\u00e9gard du code et des amendements; et consid\u00e9rant que le code avecles amendements sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s par les commissaires, a par ordre du gouverneur \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis a la legislature pour qu'il puisse avec les amendements que la legislature pourra adopter, \u00e9tre d\u00e9clcar\u00e9 loi par acte l\u00e9gislatif: et consid\u00e9rant que tels amendements sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s et tels autres amendements qui sont mentionn\u00e9s dans les resolutions contenues dans la c\u00e9dule ci-annex\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement adoptees par les deux Chambres: a ces causes, etc.\nLa section 6 de cet acte pourvoit a la mani\u00e9re de mettre le code en force par proclamation, et declare que depuis la date do la dite proclamation, le dit code aura en cons\u00e9quence foree de loi. Ce code, qui a force de loi est celui que le pr\u00e9ambule declare ne contenir que les lois consid\u00e9r\u00e9es actuellement en force lors de sa publication. S'il \u00e9tait possible d'ajouter quelque chose pour faire voir qu'un article du code declarant le droit avant sa pubiication doit sappliquer a toutes transactions quelles soient ant\u00e9rieures ou post\u00e9rieures a sa date, on pourrait encore invoquer la declaration suivante du Conseil Priv\u00e9: Kierzkowski v. Dorion ([8]).\nDans cette cause ii s'agissait de Ia loi ant\u00e9rieure au code au sujet de l'usure.\nThe Civil Code of Lower Canada, which, though not established in 1866 embodies all such provisions relating to civil matters as were in force at the time of the passing of the act respecting the codification of the laws of that province, may properly be referred to for the law on this point.\nCes autorit\u00e9s me paraissent \u00e9tablir jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence one l'article 2243 nonobstant la decision contraire de la cause de Motz v. Moreau, \u00e9tait et doit \u00e9tre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme la loi en force avant le code au sujet de la \"prescription de trent\u00e9 ans. En \u00e9luder l'application, pour la raison que l'inventaire serait l'\u00e9quivalent de la reddition, afin de pouvoir appliquer a la cause actuelle l'article 2258, me para\u00eet une violation flagrante de la loi. Par tous ces motifs, je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9.\nHENRY J. If there is no special enactment in the code to regulate the prescription of the action which has been brought, it necessarily comes under the thirty years prescription of art 2243, which provides:\nThat the prescription of the action to account and of other personal actions of minors against their tutors, relating to the acts of the tutorship takes place comformable to this rule (that is prescription of thirty years) and is reckoned from the majority.\nThe action here is a personal action of a minor against her tutor. The sale made in this case does not in any wise refer to an inventory having been made, nor does it disclose to what amount the inventory came or in what year it was completed. It seems to me that in this case the question of inventory is confounded with the question of account. The inventory having been made during the plaintiffs' minority, surely he is entitled to an account of the monies administered by his tutor in virtue of that inventory if not entitled to have the inventory itself set aside ? The defendant has never accounted to the plaintiff and does not pretend to have done so but contends that the sale which he has made is a settlement, and after ten years the action is prescribed. Art 2258 relied upon, I do not think, is applicable to this case, for it is not an action to rectify the tutor's account, as none has been rendered and it is not action in restitution for lesion but an action to account. The latter part of art. 2258 does not apply to transactions between wards and tutors as another article of the Code, art. 2243, provides what prescription applies in such a case.\nWe have had the decision of Moreau v. Motz ([9]) brought to our notice but that was decided before the Code; when the Code was enacted, it will be seen by the report of the codifiers, that although Moveau v. Motz had been decided the codifiers did not alter what they believed to be the law and left art. 2243 as it now stands.\nI have not been referred to any other case where the point has been decided authoritatively since the Code. True that case went to the Privy Council but they did not decide the case upon that ground and therefore we are left to decide the question upon the law as we find it in the Civil Code. In my opinion I think the prescripiion of 30 years is alone applicable. I have read the reasons given by my brother Fournier, and agree with his view of the case.\nTASCHEREU J. Was this action prescribed by ten years ? The Court of Appeal has decided that it was and I am of the same opinion. The lav applicable here is the law as it was before the Code. There are certainly a number of authors who are or opinion that the thirty years prescripiion is the only one that can defeat an action of this kind but they have no text of law in their favor, whilst respondent has to support the ten year prescription the express terms of the ordinances of 1516 1535 and 1539 ([10]).\nThe question was always one upon which a great difference of opinion seems to have existed, and the jurisprudence itself on the question seems to have been waivering. The question is consequently not free from doubt, but the judgment of the court below is supported by such strong authorities that it is impossible for me to say that it was clearly erroneous.\nFerri\u00e8re, Trait\u00e8 des tutelles ([11]), says that the jurisprudence at Paris is that the ten years prescription is the one applicable against an action to annul a deed passed by. the minor with his tutor, the ten years to run from his majority if the deed was passed while he was still a minor, and from the date of the deed, if passed since his majority. This author adds that at Toulouse, Dijon and other places, the thirty years prescription is the one held to be applicable. And it is that diversity of jurisprudence between the different parliaments that has, no doubt, given rise to the controversies amongst the authors on the question. This same Ferriere ([12]) adds that, whilst at Paris a simple discharge of the obligation to render an account by the minor to the tutor would have been prescribed by thirty years only, yet a transaction which must be presumed to have been preceded or accompanied with some discussio between the parties on their respective rights was held to be prescried by ten years. The deed of sale in question here clearly falls under the last description.\nIn Bardet Arr\u00eats ([13]) judgment of the Parliament of Paris, of April 7th, 1633, also clearly in point, is reported. It is there held that a contract by a minor with his tutor without an account, cannot be attacked after ten years. In Arr\u00eats de Louet ([14]) not less than six cases are given in which the courts held that the ten years prescription defeated, the action. The other cases there reported are not cases in which transactions between the minor and tutor had taken place but cases in which a discharge pure and simple from rendering an account had been given by the minor, thus supporting the distinction made by Ferri\u00e8re as above noted. In the 1st Vol. of these Arr\u00eats de Louet, Brodeau, its commentator, gives his interpretation of the Arr\u00eats cited at page 738 of the 2nd Vol. in no ambiguous terms (of ten years):\nLa m\u00eame fin de non recevoir a lieu \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des transactionsp pass\u00e9es avec les tuteurs sur Ia reddition du compte, non visis tabulis.\nThere are cited Arr\u00eats of Province and Toulouse where the thirty years prescription is applied.\nIn Henry's treatise ([15]) a case clearly in point is reported. It is there held that if a minor, emancipated by marriage, has discharged by a simple Quittance or a transaction non visis tabulis her tutor from the obligation to render an account, she has only ten years to attack that discharge. And Brodeau, on this Arr\u00eat, says:\nCette jurisprudence est certaine au Parlement de Paris La jurisprudence au Parlement de Toulouse est contraire.\nIn Jurispr. franc, Prev\u00f4st de la Jann\u00e9s ([16]) speaking of the prescription of ten years against the minor, says:\nL'ordonnance du 1539 veut m\u00eame qu'ils se pourvoient dans le m\u00eame temps contre des actes nuls qu'ils auraient passes, si la nullit\u00e9 n'a point d'autre cause quo leur minorit\u00e9.\nIn Lacombe Recueil de Juris fr. ([17]) we read:\nMineur n'est recevable \u00e0 se pourvoir, apr\u00e9s les dix ans de majorit\u00e9 contre Ia transaction faite avec son tuteur avant le compte et non visis tabulis.\nAnd the author cites an arr\u00e9t of 19 Jan. 1602 in which reversing a previous decision there mentioned, it was specially held that the provisions of the ordinance of 1510 and 1539 which enact that all actions in rescision of contracts passed during minority must be brought within the 10 years of majority, apply to contracts or deeds passed by a minor with his tutor in discharge of the obligation to account, even when no inventory has been made by the tutor.\nBretonnier quest. ([18]) verified in Guyot Vo. Rescision; after mentioning that formerly, at Paris, the 30 years rule was held to apply in such cases, says:\nNow, the jurisprudence of the Parliament of Paris is that the minor who wishes to attack the transactions passed between him and his tutor, of any nature whatsoever, must do so within the 10 years of his majority.\nIn Pratique de Lange ([19]) after saying that the discharge granted by a minor to his tutor without an account, is null, adds:\nMass il n'y a en ce cas que dix ans du jour de sa majorit\u00e9 pour se faire restituer, an lieu qu'il aurait eu trente ans pour se faire rendre compte sans cette d\u00e9charge.\nIn Ferri\u00e8re Science des Notaires ([20]).\nQuoique le compte soit clos et arr\u00eat\u00ea, le tuteur est toujours r\u00e9put\u00e9 comptable, nonobstant toutes les transactions qu'ils auraient Pu passer ensembles. Mais suivant la uurisprudence, le mineur doit se pourvoir dans les dix ans de sa majorit\u00e9 contre les transactions qu'il aurait pass\u00e9es avec son tuteur, sans qu'au pr\u00e9alable ii y eut eu de compte pr\u00e9sente, d\u00e9batuu et arr\u00eat\u00e9: en quoi l'ancienne jurisprudence n'est plus suivie, en ce qu'elle donnait au mineur, pour se pourvoir, contre ces sortes de transactions, trente ans, a compter du jour de leur majorit\u00e9.\nThese authorities have received the sanction in more modern times of the highest tribunals in France.\nIn re Chavy in the Court of Appeal of Riom, on the 21st March, 1804, (80 Vent. an. 12) in a case, falling under the law as it was before the code where one of the parties insisted upon the nullity of a transaction between a minor, after he had attained his majority, with his tutor before the tutor had rendered his account: Held that art 475 of the code by which the ten years prescription against such a demand is demand is nothing but a reproduction of the pre-existing law, and specially of the ordinances of 1510 and 1599, and that the right to invoke such nullity is prescribed by the ten years which have elapsed between the demand and the transaction in question.\nOn the 15th November, 1808, in re Vincent ([21]), the same tribunal rendered a similar decision.\nIn re Hermel, ([22]) on the 15th Apriil 1822, in the Court of Cassation, in a case upon the same question, where the appellant asked the reversal of the judgment of the court below, by which the ten years prescription before the Code had been held to defeat such an action:\nHeld, that, as before the Code, the authors and the courts were divided on the question whether it was the 10 or the 30 years that applied to such cases, it was impossible for the Court of Cassation to hold that there was error in the judgment of the court below.\nOn the 3d August 1829, in re Peignot, ([23]) in the Court of Cassation, held:\nThat 'under the ordonnance of 1539 and according to the jurisprudence of the Parliament of Paris during the last period before the revolution minors had only ten years from their majority to attack the transactions made with their tutors, of any nature whatsoever, and visis aut non visis tabulis.\nThe case of Moreau v. Motz ([24]) has been referred to in the court below and I have nothing to add to what the learned judges said as to its ruling. The Privy Council, however, did not decide the point of prescription. As to the law as it is now under the Code, I have not to determine. I feel bound to say however that my not doing so must not be interpreted as if I were of opinion that the result would have been dffierent under the Code or as if I did not agree with what has been said on this point by the learned judges as appears by the report of the case in the Montreal Law reports, 2 Q. B. p. 229.\nThis disposes of the case, since, of course, the sale being held good, the question raised by the appellants as to the inventory falls to the ground for want of interest.\nGWYNNE J. concurred with Taschereau J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants; Greoffrion, Dorion, Lafleur, and Rinfret.\nSolicitors for respondents: Parais and Chass\u00e9.\n[1][1] Arts. 2243, 2253 C.

J. Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau, and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nWill, construction of\u2014Legacy Alienation of properly bequeathed by testator, effect of--Partition\u2014Estoppel\u2014Cross appeal.\nW. F. by his will bearing date 11th February, 1833, inter alia devised to M. his daughter by an Indian woman and to E. and M. his daughters by another woman, a defined portion of the seigniories of Temiscouata and Madawaska, and the balance of said property to his sons W. and E. A short time after making his will, the testator, who was heavily in debt, received an unexpected ofter of \u00a315,000 for the said seigniories, and he therefore sold at once, paid his most pressing debts, amounting to \u00a35,400, and the balance of \u00a39,600 was invested by loaning it on security of real estate.\nAt his death, his estate appearing to be vacant as regards the \u00a39,600, a curator was appointed.\nOn the 27th September, 1839, the parties entitled under the will proceeded to divide and apportion their legacies, basing their calculations upon the approximate area of the seigniories devised and received the collected part of the sums allotted to each by the partition. In an action brought by W. F. the respondent, who was residuary legatee, against the curator in order to make him render an account, the court ordered the curator to render an account, which he did; and he deposited $50,000 and other securities. On a report of distribution being made, W. F., (the respondent) filed an opposition claiming his share under the will. This opposition was contested by J., the appellant, on the grounds: 1st that the legacies were revoked, and that in his capacity of universal legatee to his mother, (the legitimate child, he alleged, of the testator and the Indian woman who was Commune en biens with the testator} he was entitled to one-half of the proceeds of the said \u00a39,600 and 2nd, that in the event of his claim to legitimacy and revocation of the legacy being rejected, as by the will the daughters were exempt from the payment of the debts, he should, as representing one of the daughters, be entitled to her proportion of \u00a315,000, the net proceeds of the sale.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that J. (the appellant). not having at the death of his mother repudiated the partaye to which she was a party, but on the contrary having ratified it and acted under it, was stopped from claiming anything more than what was allotted to his mother.\nPer Strong, Fournier and Taschereau JJ That under the law prior to the Code the sale of the seigniories which were the subject of the legacy in question in this cause, had not, considering the circumstances under which it was made, the effect of defeating the legacy.\nSemble, per Henry J. That there was a revocation of the legacy.\nThe judgment of the court below held that as the testator declared that the daughters should not be liable for the payment of his debts, partition, as regards them, should be made of the sum of \u00a315,000, the price obtained from the sale of the seigniories bequeathed, and not of the \u00a39,600 remaining in his succession at his death.\nOn cross appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld that on the pleadings before the court no adjudication could be made as to the sum of \u00a35,400 paid by the curator for the debts, and that in the distribution of the moneys in court all that J., (the appellant) could claim to be collocated for, was the unpaid balance (if any) of his mother's share in the moneys, securities, interest, and profit of the said sum of \u00a39,600 in accordance with the partage of the 27th September, 1839.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing a judgment of the Superior Court sitting at Quebec. The facts and pleadings are fully stated in the report of the case in Volume 12 Quebcc Law Reports, 327.\nPouliol for the appellant and respondent on cross .appeal. Irvine Q. 0. and Casgrain for respondent and appellant on cross appeal.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J. I have had an opportunity, through the kindness of Mr. Justice Taschereau, of perusing the judgment which he has Witten in this case, and I entirely concur in the conclusion at which he has arrived\nThere are two points on which I do not think it necessary to express any opinion, one as to the validity of the marriage as affecting the legitimacy of the plaintiffs mother, the other, as to the alleged revocation in the will. Mr. Justice Taschereau has made it clear that it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant to raise these questions. If I had thought it necessary to decide them I should have desired to give them further consideration\nSTRONG J. I also concur in the opinion of Mr, Justice Taschereau. and make the same reservations as His Lordship the Chief Justice. As regards the question of the validity of the marriage that, it seems to me, does not arise, and I do not feel called upon to give an opinion concerning it.\nThere is another point which does seem to enter into the case to some extent, and to call for an expression of opinion, and that is the question of the revocation in the will I think there was no revocation of this legacy, but I agree with Mr. Justice Taschereau, that the parties so dealt with each other, in respect to conflicting claims, and with respect to the money under this will, that to apply an English phrase to French law,. they have stopped themselves from raising this question. FOURNIER J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau, with the same reservation as regards the legitimacy of the plaintiff's mother as expressed by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nHENRY J.\u2014I also concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau, with the same reservations. 1 would be inclined to hold that there was a revocation of the legacy, but as the parties, for thirty or forty years have adopted it, and also because, if the will is not sustained the property would revert to the Crown, I am of opinion for tie reasons expressed in the judgment of my brother Taschereau, that the parties are too late now in asking to have it set aside. The other questions, that of res judicata and others, I have not thought it necessary to consider.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case presents no difficulty.\nThe appellant Jones bases his claim to a share of the monies now in court upon the legitimacy of Margaret Fraser, his mother, and upon the revocation of the legacy of the seigniories of Temiscouata and Mada-waska by the sale thereof made by Fraser subsequently to his will.\nIt would obviously be useless for him to succeed on the question of legitimacy, (except as to his grand-mother's share as commune en biens, which I leave aside for a moment) if he failed on his contention that this legacy was revoked, for, if the legacy stands, all of these monies unquestionably go to the legatees. On the other hand, he would not, in any way, benefit by a judgment declaring the legacy revoked, if he failed on the question of legitimacy, for, in that case, all of these monies would escheat to the Crown.\nUnder these circumstances I think it proper to consider first the question of the revocation of the legacy.\nAccording to the law then in force, if this sale of these seigniories was made by Fraser, necessitate urgente, it did not carry revocation of the legacy. The question then resumes itself into a simple one of fact, which., as such, has been found against the appellant by Chief Justice Meredith and the five judges of the Court of Appeal. Upon him therefore rested the onus of establishing that such a finding was clearly erroneous. He has, in my opinion, failed to do so. The disposal Fraser made of these monies is, to my mind, strong evidence that it was as representing these seigniories and, as it were, in exchange and in subrogation of them that he thereafter held these mortgages and as it was then clear law, that where a testator exchanged a property that he had previously bequeathed by his will, even not ex necessitate, the legacy was not revoked but the property received in exchange passed ex the legatee ([1]). We must hold that here likewise, these monies passed to the legatees as the seigniories would themselves have passed under the will. But were it otherwise, can the appellant now be admitted to plead the revocation of this legacy ? Is he not debarred by his own conduct from the right to now assail it? Let us see in what position he stands.\nAt Fraser's death, 49 years ago, Margaret, the appellant's mother, accepted the legacy in question, thereby repudiating the said Fraser's succession. Art. 300 Coutume de Paris; art. 712, CC; Richer v. Voyer ([2]). Subsequently by her own will, she instituted the appellant her universal legatee and, as such, he is now her sole legal representative. How could he, under these circumstances, get over his mother's repudiation of her father's succession ? Arts. 654, 866 C. C. Corn par. Demolombe ([3]); Laurent ([4]). But supposing he could get over that difficulty, how could he get over his own acceptance of his grandfather's legacy ?\nWhen his mother died, 25 years ago, he might have refused the said legacy and treated it as lapsed. But what did he do then and since ? Did he ever renounce it ? Certainly not; but, on the contrary, has accepted it and has received as such legatee and in virtue of his grandfather's will, all he could get of the sums included in his mother's lot by the deed of 1839, and besides this as her universal legatee all the interests that remained unpaid at her death. He now holds and detains these sums And yet when the respondent claims his share of this very same legacy he the appellant retorts to him that it has been revoked. But if not revoked, if good for the appellant, why also not revoked and good for the respondent ? Could the appellant so first pocket his share of it and then impeach its validity ? I do not think so, and his conduct, as I view it, is against the position he now takes a fin de non recevoir, an estoppel, which it would have been no easy matter for him to overcome, had he been otherwise successful on this part of the case.\nAnd there is another remarkable instance where he again clearly did not treat this legacy as revoked. I allude to his petition upon which he obtained from the Crown the abandonment of all claim to these monies on the ground that this legacy stood unrevoked. Would he now say that he misinformed the Crown or that he obtained that abandonment fraudulently ? Would he say that it is fraudulently that he got all the monies he has received as legatee or that it is fraudulentlv that he holds them ?\nI am of opinion that this legacy must be considered as not revoked, and that the monies in question consequently passed in the same manner and proportions as the seigniories would themselves have passed under the will. It is therefore unnecessary for me to determine hypothetically who would be entitled to these monies had there been no legacy. I deem it only proper to add, however that if I therefore do not enter into the question of legitimacy, the appellant must not infer from my silence on this point that I have any doubt upon the correctness of the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench thereupon.\nThe question of res judicata it is also needless for me to determine. I may say, however, that I have not so far heard or read anything in the case which makes it at all doubtful in my mind, 1st, that the principal allegation of Fraser's declaration was that this legacy was not revoked, and that the primary object of his action was to have it so declared; 2nd, that Jones by his defense en fait and other pleas asked for the dismissal of that action on the ground that the legacy was revoked, and 3rd that the Chief Justice determined that it was not revoked. And I have failed to appreciate the soundness of the reasoning, which would give to any court, in face of that judgment, the right, now or ever, to dismiss Fraser's said action and authorize the curator to re-pocket the monies in question. Neither do I understand, as I read the Chief Justice's judgment that he reserved to himself or to any one else the power to do so.\nNow, on Jones' opposition, if the issue, the principal issue as raised by Fraser's plea is not again the revocation or non-revocation of that legacy I have failed to understand the case. For, as I have shown, how can Jones claim any of these monies as part of his grandfather's intestate succession, without first establishing that they fell into that succession, or in other words, that they were not bequeathed by the will ? Bonnier ([5]); Boitard ([6]); Demolombe ([7]); Shaw v. St Louis ([8]) Delvincourt ([9]); Re Billon ([10]); Re Lambin ([11]).\nAs to the partage of 1889, there is no doubt that it\n(l) Nos, 299, 862. (4) 8 Can. S. C. R. 385.\n(2) 2 Vol. 203. (5) 71 1 100.\n(3) 30 Vol. 287, 291, (6) S. V. 73,1, 292.\n(7) S. V. 76, 1, 448. did not then bind the appellant and that he had a perfect right to repudiate it at his mother's death. But it is now clearly too late for him to do so. Demolombe ([12]); Solon, Nullites ([13]); Binet 11th Nullites ([14]).\nNot only did he not repudiate it then, but he unequivocally ratified it by claiming and receiving the capital sums put in his mother's lot by that deed. Only one of these sums besides those received from the curator himself is clearly in evidence, on the part of the record printed upon this appeal (\u00a3150 from Vincent Dube) but that is sufficient. There really was no partage at all necessary at Fraser's death for in a case like this where Creances compose a succession, the law divides them between the heirs or legatees according to their shares in the estate. Art. 1122 C. C. ([15]); Demolombe ([16]); 11 Duranton, ([17]); Pothier, Obligations ([18]).\nIf here, for instance, these seignories were 18 leagues in front the three daughters being given six leagues, they were entitled to one third of each and every one of the capital sums due to Fraser at his death, this one-third being sub-divided between them in equal parts. They however agreed to divide them otherwise, the appellant has acquiesced in it, and he is now debarred from complaining of it. Did he ever at any time during the 25 years that his mother is dead, ask for another partage ? Or has he ever ignored his mother's doings and relied on the division that the law made of these sums ? Never. He has on the contrary acted under and taken advantage of the division then made. He had no right whatsoever to receive, for instance, the \u00a3150, due by Vincent Dube, I have alluded to, if not for that deed of 1839. By the will alone it was only a small portion of that sum that he was in law entitled to. And what is the acquaintance he gave to the Curator in 1873 for if not for his share under that partage ? But, says he, I gave that acquaintance under reserve of all my rights. That is so. But reservations of that kind are of no avail. Facta potentiora sunt verbis, et actus protestationis contrarius tollit protestationem ([19]).\nAs to the community of property between Fraser and the Indian woman, had they been legally married, it would undoubtedly have entitled Margaret Fraser to one-fourth of these .\u00a39600. But here again the deed of 1839 which stands in full force and effect, would preclude her from the right to claim any more than what was thereby allotted to her and accepted by her as her share of these \u00a39600. And the appellant, 1 repeat it, stands in her shoes, is bound by her acts and has moreover unequivocally ratified that deed.\nAs to the contention that the six leagues bequeathed to the daughters were worth more than the rest of the seigniories, it is not proved. The evidence is altogether against it. But were it otherwise here again the appellant is met by the deed of 1839, as his mother's representation, and by his own acts of acquiescence in that deed.\nThere remains the claim made by Jones in relation to the sum of \u00a35,400 paid by the late Fraser himself in settlement of his debts out of the proceeds of the sale of these seigniories. Jones contends that as by the said Fraser's will, his mother's shares was to be free from the payment of all debts, he is entitled to receive from the estate a share of this sum of 54 400. Mr. Irvine has argued with great force on Fraser's part as cross appellant, that Jones' contention is unfounded that, by the express words of the will it was the debts the testator would leave at his death that the daughters were exempted from; that the debts he himself paid were not debts of his estate, and not covered by that clause of the will : that the will speaks from the death, and must be read as bequeathing to his daughters one-third of the \u00a39,600, with exemption from his debts left at his death In support of this contention may be cited a passage in Montvallon, des Suc cessions ([20]) where it is said that if a testator pays debts which by his will he had obliged one of his legatee to pay, he is presumed to have discharged the legatee of the obligation to pay them. Moreover, I do not think that the merit of this part of Jones' claim can be determined in this case and the cross-appeal on this point, as well as on the partition of 1839 should be allowed That amount of \u00a35,460 was not included in the plaintiff's action, never was in the the curator's hands and is not included in Chief Justice Meredith's judgment It is not then in court and does not form part of the monies now in question. We decide whether or not and to what extent Jones is entitled to the \u00a39,600 deposited by the curator, and that ends the case. His claim as to to the \u00a35,400 comes in this case in the nature of an opposition ensousordre which has no raison d\u00e8'tre here. We therefore, express no opinion on this part of Jones' claim, and leave him to exercise whatever rights he may have in relation thereto, if any, by direct action or otherwise as he may think fit.\nThe appeal should be allowed without costs the cross-appeal allowed with costs, and Jones' opposition dismissed with costs, except as to any part of the monies and securities, interest and profit which may still be due to him in virtue of the partition of 1839 in accordance with the partage of the monies in question are to be distributed, if any. for which he must then be collocated.\nThe parties may perhaps agree as to what is the amount of the sum thus remaining due to Jones. Fail ing such understanding, we will see how to get it established, so as, if possible, to get it to form part 01 the judgment of this court, before the minutes are settled.\nGWYNEE J.\u2014In this case I concur in the judgment of my brother Taschereau\u2014that the appeal be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Tessier & Pouliot.\nSolicitors for respondent : Larue, Angers & Casgrain.\n[1] 2Bourjon, 399; 5 Saintesp\u00e8s.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Taschereau JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nRailway contract \u2014 Certificate of engineer-Necessity for Laches.\nMcC et al. appellants entered into a contract with McG., (respondent) the contractor for the construction of the North Shore Railway between Montreal and Quebec to do and perform certain works of construction on a portion of the road and by a clause in his contract agreed \" to keep open at certain times and hours at his own cost and expense the mainline for the passage of traffic or express trains run by McG. without any charge to the latter:\" but there was a proviso that, \"any time occupied on the road over and above what may be required by the hours hereinbefore mentioned, or any expense caused thereby, shall be paid by the contractor (McG.) on a certificate to that effect signed by the superintendent of the contractor,\" On an action brought by appellants against respondent for damages caused by the interruption of the work on said road by the passing of respondent's trains ;\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that it was the duty of the appellants to get the superintendent's certificate within a reasonable time, and not having taken any steps to obtain it until six years after the superintendent had left the respondents' employment, the failure to produce such certificate was sufficient ground for dismissing the appellants action.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the present appellants.\nThe respondent was the contractor for the construction of the North Shore Railway between Quebec and Montreal under a contract with the Provincial Government, and on the 30th March, 1877, by notarial instrument entered into before Samuel J. Glackmeyer, notary public, between the appellants' and the respondent, the appellants undertook, in consideration of the payments and covenants stipulated in the said notaries instrument, to finish the track laying and ballasting for the respondent on the said North Shore Railway from Quebec to Portneuf, and as far beyond as \" Patton's Contract shall begin, \" and also to do and performing all the works, more particularly detailed in the schedule annexed to the said agreement, for the prices therein detailed.\nPrior to the bringing of their present action the appellants had sued the respondent for the sum of $37,000, alleged excess of work done by them and damages they claimed to have suffered.\nIn that suit judgment was rendered against the respondent for $15,423, reserving to appellants their recourse, if any, for an item of $5,290 on the ground that they had not produced the certificate of the respondent's superintendent, as required by the contract.\nThe present action was brought in the Superior Court at Quebec, by the present appellants against the respondent, to recover the sum of $7,970, $5,890 for the amount reserved, and $2,680 for alleged damages caused to the appellants by the interruption of the work upon their section by the passing in excessive numbers and at irregular intervals of appellants' trains. The declaration alleged that since the contract was completed the plaintiffs had demanded a certificate from one D D. MacDonald, the superintendent mentioned in the contract, but that the tatter, at the instigation of respondent, had unjustly and fraudulently refused to deliver said certificate.\nThe other material facts and pleadings fully appear in the report of the case in 12 Q. L R. p. 373.\nThe ninth paragraph of the contract is the only one upon which any controversy between the parties arose, and is as follows :\u2014\nNinth. The said parties of the first part agree and bind themselves to furnish at their own costs and charges all labor and material to work the locomotive and cars; such as water, wood, oil, tools and implements of all kinds, except as otherwise stipulated, \u2022but that they will not have or exercise any control over the movements of trains except of those in use for track-laying and ballasting; on the contrary, will in all such movements be subject to the orders of the party of the second part. They shall also keep open at their own costs and charges the main line for the passage of traffic or express trains run by the said party of the second part, and all turnouts, sidings and switches, as well as the road bed, shall be kept in project order for said traffic, and they will see that their trains are kept off the main line at the hours appointed by the timetable at the respective places, without any charge to the said party of the second part.\nNothing herein contained shall compel the party of the first part to take any precautions or means provided for passage of trains, . except a train leaving Pont Rouge at or before seven o'clock in the morning, and Quebec at or after five o'clock and forty-five minutes in the afternoon; all special or trains required at different hours will be arranged for with the party of the first part and with their consent; any time occupied on the road over and above what may be required by the hours herein before mentioned and stipulated, or any expense caused thereby, shall be paid by party of the second part, on a certificate to that effect signed by the superintendent of the party of the second part.\u201d\nLarue Q.C. for appellants.\nThe appellants were entitled, under their contract to charge for every train that went beyond Pont Rouge, even the regular train, and they had also a right to charge for every train between Quebec and Pont Rouge, except a train leaving Pont Rouge at or before seven o'clock in the morning, and Quebec at or after five o'clock and forty-five minutes in the afternoon.\nThe passage of all these trains imposed upon the appellants a very large increase of wx)rk not included in their contract.\nOn behalf of the respondent it is contended that the appellants cannot claim from the respondent without a certificate of the superintendent, and that they could not demand nor obtain said certificate after the works were finished, or after the superintendent had left McGreevy's employ. We did all we could to obtain it, and we cannot be held responsible for the neglect of duty of respondent's employee.\nSuch an excuse cannot be held sufficient to enable the respondent to get rid of a legitimate debt.\nRedfield Amer. Rly. Gas. ([2]); Scott v. Liverpool ([3]).\nIrvine Q.C. for respondent.\nIt cannot be held that this is any such demand on the superintendent, Macdonald, for a certificate as would excuse the appellants from making the proof which the contract required of them. Macdonald could not be expected after that lapse of time, and whilst engaged in other work at a great distance from the place referred to in the contract, to certify to work of which he could then have had only a very imperfect recollection. No demand had ever been previously made upon him for such certificate, although an action had been brought and had been pending for a number of years covering these same items. The requirement of this certificate is peremptory, and no action can be maintained without it and indeed it would not be possible for the respondent otherwise to obtain reliable information as to claims of this nature.\nThe greater part of the appellant\u2019s claim is in the year 1878. Their contract binds them to complete the works in 1877. There is nothing in the record to show on what terms the time was extended, or whether it was extended at all otherwise than by tacit consent. The right of the respondent to use the railway for the running of his trains without compensation to the appellants, could not be taken away without some express agreement.\nLastly:\u2014The respondent refers the court with confidence to the evidence, and asserts that there is no proof whatever to justify the appellant's demand. There is no evidence of any particular detention causing any particular damage. The majority of the special trains of which complaint is made were run on Sundays, when presumably the appellants were not at work. Others were run at night, and generally there is no particular case shown causing damage to the appellants. This absence of proof without any attempt within any reasonable period to obtain the certificate of the superintendent should be sufficient to dismiss the appellants' action\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J. \u2014There is a very small question in this case. To enable the plaintiff to recover he was bound to produce the certificate of the engineer as 9th the correctness of his accounts. He never obtained these certificates nor did he attempt to obtain them until years afterwards when the party had left the employment and then he did not take, even at that time what I should consider the necessary steps to enable him to get the certificate\nTherefore I think the plaintiff in the suit cannot recover, and in looking at the evidence even if I thought he could recover, I should be greatly puzzled to determine, if any amount, how much. I think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Concurred.\nFOURNIER J. I think the appeal should be dismissed. I agree with the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence shows that during all the time the work was going on the plaintiff never made any effort to obtain the certificate of the engineer and six years afterwards they ask him for it when they are told that it cannot be supplied. I certainly think they have not complied with the condition and they have, therefore, no claim against the defendant.\nHENRY J.\u2014The parties appellant in this case cannot, I think, succeed on their appeal. When a party is to receive compensation consequent on the certificate of a certain engineer, it is to be assumed that the certificate will be obtain l within a reasonable time that is when the party is employed and when the work is going on, and that a person should not wait five or six years when the memory of the engineer cannot be expected to serve him. Here were men making a claim for damages they claim to be entitled to several veers before any claim was made by them. If their right to recover depends upon a certificate they cannot sustain the claim by other evidence without production of that certificate. I think the court below was perfectly right and this appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of the same opinion, and I also think that this is a frivolous appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Larue, Angers and Casgrain.\nSolicitor for respondent: George Irvine.\n[1] 14 Rev.

Adamson, being indebted to the Federal Bank of Canada, conveyed his interest in said lots to Renwick, the manager of that bank, by a deed absolute in form but intended only to operate as a mortgage. The Trustees of Knox Church, in Winnipeg, wishing to purchase the lots Renwick re-conveyed his interest in them to Adamson to enable him to get a legal title from the Hudson Bay Co. Before the sale to the church was completed the Canadian. Bank of Commerce had obtained judgment against Adamson, and placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands an execution which bound Adamson\u2019s lands. The trustees of Knox Church, believing this to be a charge upon the land they wished to purchase, paid the amount of the execution to the sheriff and received from him a certificate that the land was free from execution. The Federal Bank claimed the money so paid to the sheriff and an interpleader order was obtained to determine to whom it belonged. The judge who tried the issue under the interpleader order decided in favor of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench sustained his decision. The Federal Bank of Canada then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for appellants.\nThe issue agreed on by the parties was simply whether the proceeds of the sale of the lots 9, 225 and 226 of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Reserve was the property of the appellants as against the respondents.\nWhether this fund was one subject to the sheriff\u2019s interpleader ([2]) is not now open to argument, for the respondents attended upon the granting of the order, and at least a portion of the order is by consent; the order was allowed to stand and was not moved against; the issue was duly settled between the parties pursuant to the order and was tried, and it is too late now to take objection. Haldan v. Beatty ([3]); Wilson v. Wilson ([4]).\nThe land was not subject to the execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands against Adamson because he had no beneficial interest therein, (2); Adamson was our trustee and he had no right to use the proceeds of this sale to pay off his own debt, and the mere fact of the vendor paying over the money into the sheriff\u2019s hands without our knowledge does not give it to the respondents as against, us. Engelback v. Nixon (1); Duncan v. Cashin (2).\nI also contend that there was a resulting trust. Lewin on Trusts (3); Ex parte James ([5]); Gardner v. Rowe ([6]).\nThe question of voluntary payment does not arise at all. It was to remove a cloud on appellant\u2019s title and the payment in this, case comes within the principles laid down in Valpy v. Manley ([7]); Snowden v. Davis ([8]); Carter v. Carter ([9]).\nRobinson Q.C. for respondents:\nThis is a case not provided for by the statute ([10]); Harrison v. Wright ([11]); and if so there is no right \u201cof appeal to this court, for even if the parties are bound by the consent to the judgment of the tribunal of first instance, it does not give the right of appeal.\nBut admitting there is a right of appeal, the money was voluntarily paid by the vendees on account of the respondent\u2019s execution, and there was no arrangement that the money should be paid to the sheriff as agent for the appellants if they were beneficially entitled to the land. Wilson v. Ray (11); Morgan v. Boyer (12); Moreover the transaction between Adamson and appellants was in effect, a mortgage, and under the evidence the re-conveyance was intended to release the security. Lewin on Trusts (13); Then even if appellants had any title or interest in the land, there is no such trust manifested and proved by the evidence to meet the requirements of the 7 sect of Statute of Frauds. Browne on Statute of Frauds, sect. 89. Gardner v. Rowe ([12]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The Canadian Bank of Commerce, haying obtained judgment against one Robert Adamson on the 4th Aug. 1883, caused a writ of fieri facias de bonis to be issued thereon directed to the sheriff of the Eastern Judicial District of the Province of Manitoba, and placed the same in his hands directing him to levy $3,513.34 and interest at 6 p. c. from the 4th Aug. 1883 and $6 for the writ and warrant thereon, besides sheriff\u2019s poundage, officer\u2019s fees, & c. On the same day the defendants caused to be issued and placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands, on the said judgment, a writ of fieri facias de terris with similar directions. The amount due on these executions was paid to the sheriff, who gives evidence of such payment as follows:\u2014\nQ\u2014You produce executions against Robert Adamson, in whose favour?\nA.\u2014The Canadian Bank of Commerce, fi. fa. goods and lands, dated 4th day of August, 1883, received same day at 11:30 a.m.\nQ.\u2014Did you ever receive any moneys on any executions or on this against Mr. Adamson, and if so, from whom?\nA.\u2014We received from Bain, Blanchard and Mulock $3,648.15 on 14th September, 1883.\nQ.\u2014Why was that paid to you?\nA__I was informed at the time it was paid as owing on some land in the city, being Mr. Adamson\u2019s land.\nQ\u2014It was received as against lands, not as against goods?\nA\u2014We had no goods received. It was understood at the time that it was some land that got into his name in some way.\nQ.\u2014And upon receiving that you gave a certificate that that land was free from execution?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014You refused to give that certificate until that money was received?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Did you or not refuse to give that certificate until that money was paid? A\u2014Yes; and immediately after we were notified by you or your firm that Mr. Renwick claimed the money in our hands as trustee or agent or something.\nThere is really no direct evidence in the case, that I can discover, to show to whom this money belonged, or for whom Bain, Blanchard and Mulock were acting, (beyond the statement of Mr. McKenzie in answer to this question \u201cdo you know who paid the money to the sheriff?\u201d He says \u201cI believe Mr. Blanchard acting for Knox Church,\u201d) though it is assumed, and probably quite correctly, that the money belonged to Knox Church and Blanchard made the payment for and on their account, and this is to be presumed in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. But of this there can be no doubt; that it was paid to relieve lands, standing in the name of the defendant Adamson, from the execution of the Canadian Bank of Commerce against Adamson, and by reason of which payment the sheriff gave a certificate that the land was free from execution, which certificate the sheriff refused to give until that money was received. \u201cWhatever may have been the dealing between Adamson and the Federal Bank or Knox Church, with which the Canadian Bank of Commerce do not appear to have had any connection, and whatever their rights, legal or equitable, as among themselves may be, the Federal Bank has shown nothing whatever, in my opinion, to justify their present claim. The money was paid in discharge of the judgment and execution of the Bank of Commerce with which the Federal Bank is in no way connected. The party who paid the money does not appear to complain, and puts forward no claim. The money, if paid by Knox Church as it appears to have been, was a payment by the purchaser of lands to satisfy an execution which the party paying undoubtedly believed was a charge upon the land. Whether it was so or not is a question not raised by him, he being no party to these proceedings, and it seems to me, so far as the Canadian Bank of Commerce is concerned, a wholly immaterial question.\nAt any rate, the party paying appears to have paid the money and obtained what he sought, the sheriff\u2019s certificate that the land was free from execution. Thus, the money was paid to the sheriff in satisfaction of the execution, and to and for the use of the judgment creditor, by which payment the judgment creditor\u2019s judgment and execution were paid and satisfied. What possible right can this give the Federal Bank to claim this money? Whatever their rights, legal or equitable, if they had any, in the property may have been, or may now be, they have not shown, so far as I can discover, as against the sheriff or the judgment creditors, any right whatever to this money, which was money had and received by the sheriff to and for the use of the judgment creditors. And even if they had established a legal right to, or an equitable interest in, this money, it does not appear to me that any such right or interest could be enforced in this proceeding because, as the Chief Justice of Manitoba observes:\u2014\n\u201cThe Interpleader Act only applies to the proceeds or value of \u201cany lands or tenements taken or sold under any such proceeding, \u201c and, as he says, the money here claimed is not the proceeds of any \u201clands or tenements taken or sold & c. This land was not, in fact, \u201ceither taken or sold.\u201d\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The facts material to be considered on the present appeal are not in any way controverted. They are as follows: On the 29th of August, 1881, the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company contracted to sell to Robert Adamson certain lands in the city of Winnipeg, being lots No\u2019s. 9, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, and 226 in block 4 as shewn in the plan of a certain survey by J. S. Dennis. The purchase money was $15,000, one-fifth of which was paid down, and the residue was to be paid in four equal annual instalments with interest at 7 p. c. This contract was embodied in an agreement under seal, bearing date on the day mentioned, which was executed by Mr. Brydges, the attorney of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company duly authorised in that behalf, and by Adamson. On the 3rd of March, 1883, Adamson being indebted to the plaintiffs and present appellants, the Federal Bank, in a sum amounting to between $5000 and $6000, in order to secure this debt executed an absolute deed purporting to convey lot No. 9 to Mr. Thomas Renwick, who was then the manager of the Federal Bank, at Winnipeg. It is not pretended by the plaintiffs that this deed was intended to operate otherwise than as a mere mortgage security. Mr. Renwick being examined as a witness at the trial, proves this distinctly. On being shewn the deed, exhibit A, and being asked \u201cFor what purpose was that deed given to you,\u2019? he says \u201c I got it for security for the advances made by the Bank to Adamson,\u201d\nThe title being in this state and the trustees of Knox\u2019s Church, in Winnipeg, being desirous of purchasing this lot No. 9 and also lots 225 and 226 comprised in Adamson\u2019s purchase from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, as a site for a church, an agreement to sell to the trustees was come to between Adamson and the trustees, and thereupon Renwick, on the 26th of July, 1883, re-conveyed the lands, by an ordinary deed of grant and quit claim absolute in form without covenants, to Adamson. This deed purports on its face to have been made for the nominal consideration of $1. On the same, day Frederick McKenzie, who had purchased or otherwise acquired Adamson\u2019s interest in lots 225 and 226, also re-conveyed these two lots to Adamson. These re-conveyances are alleged to have been made for the purpose of enabling Adamson to make a title to the trustees of Knox\u2019s Church; in the words of Mr. Renwick \u201cit was to facilitate the transfer from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. to the church people\u201d; and Mr. McKenzie, in answer to an inquiry as to his reason, gives a similar answer. He says \u201cbecause I knew I could not get the deed. They \u201c (meaning the Hudson\u2019s Bay Co.) would not recognise\u201d any one but Adamson, the original purchaser.\u201d\nThese were, of course, entirely inadequate reasons for this roundabout way of making the re-conveyance by Renwick, since Adamson could have conveyed just as as well without it, but the facts are just as stated. The price to be paid by the church trustees for the three lots, this lot 9 and Mr. McKenzie\u2019s two lots, was about $9,000, and Mr. McKenzie says it was agreed that this was to be apportioned \u00bd to lot 9 and \u00bd to his two lots. On the 4th of August, 1883, and previously to the execution of the conveyance by Adamson to the Church trustees, there, was lodged with the sheriff of the Eastern District of Manitoba fi. fa\u2019s against the goods and against the lands of Adamson at the suit of the defendants, the Canadian Bank of Commerce. The fi. fa\u2019s wore indorsed to levy $3513 34\/100 and sheriff\u2019s fees and poundage and expenses of execution.\nThese writs of execution were lodged with the sheriff at 11.30 a. m., on the 4th of August, 1883. On the same day but, as I gather from the judgment of the Chief Justice of Manitoba, (who says the case was argued before the Court in Banc on that assumption) subsequently to the lodging of the writs of Fieri Facias and when the execution had already become a charge upon the lands, Adamson, by a deed of grant duly executed by him for the alleged consideration of $15, 000, conveyed all these lots (9, 225 and 226) to the church trustees in fee.\nThe sheriff having refused to give the solicitors for the purchasers a certificate that the lands were free from execution until the money was paid they, on the 14th Sept., 1883, paid to the sheriff $3, 648.15, in satisfaction of the defendants\u2019 execution, and the sheriff thereupon gave the required certificate. The plaintiffs having claimed this money, the sheriff obtained a judgment order that the parties should interplead; and the interpleader issue so directed having been found in favor of the defendants by Mr. Justice Taylor who tried the case without a jury and a rule nisi to enter a verdict for the plaintiffs having been discharged by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, this appeal has been taken from the last mentioned judgment.\nThe question for the determination of the court is therefore purely one of law as distinguished from fact, and is, I think, easily answered when the rights of the plaintiffs under the conveyances already mentioned and of the defendants under their execution, have been properly considered and defined.\nIt should be premised that the legal title to the lands in question, up to the 14th Sept. 1883, the date at which the money was paid to the sheriff, the latest material date in the case before us, was outstanding in the original vendors the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. They had not been paid their purchase money, and, of course, could not be compelled to convey until they were paid\u2014indeed, they were not bound to receive the last instalment until the 29th of August, 1885. I think it probable that any difficulty which arose in procuring a conveyance from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Co. was not because they would not recognise an assignee of the purchaser, whose rights they could not ignore either under the general law or under the specific form of their contract in which they covenant to convey to the assigns of Adamson) but because, either the parties claiming under Adamson were not prepared to pay the fall amount of the purchase money, or because the officers of the company did not choose to anticipate the dates of payment fixed by the agreement for sale. Be this as it may it is to be borne in mind that the legal estate was always, up to the time the money was paid to the sheriff, in the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, and the several conveyances executed dealt only with purely equitable estates and interests, and the defendants\u2019 execution was in like manner a charge on a mere equitable interest and did not bind any legal interest or estate. This is material inasmuch as equitable interests only being dealt with the priority of incumbrances and charges on such interests must depend on precedence in point of time and on that alone. The conveyance by Adamson to Renwick being, by the explicit admission of the latter, intended only to take effect as a mortgage to secure to the plaintiffs the debt due to them, it was of course competent for Adamson at any time to prove this and to have the deed cut down to and treated as a mere security and to redeem the land. So far therefore Adamson\u2019s equitable interest in these lands, under his contract of purchase, was vested in Renwick as a mortgagee for the benefit of the plaintiffs subject to an equity of redemption by Adamson. Then as regards the effect of the deed of the 26th of July, 1883, by which Hen wick re-conveyed to Adamson for the alleged purpose of facilitating the completion of the sale to the church trustees, I have no difficulty in conceding to the fullest extent the argument of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that the rights of the Federal Bank were not in the least degree prejudiced but remained entirely unaffected, at least as regards the present defendants, by this re-conveyance. I do not think the Statute of Frauds would have been any obstacle to a Court of Equity in affording the plaintiffs relief if Adamson had attempted to make an inequitable use of the estate or interest which was re-vested in him by the re-conveyance, such a breach of trust would have been considered inequitable and fraudulent and numerous cases shew that the Statute of Frauds forms no bar to relief in such a case. It is true that if Adamson had acquired the Legal estate under this re-conveyance and had conveyed that to a purchaser or incumbrancer for value without notice the case would have been different, and the latter obtaining a legal title would have been entitled to priority over the earlier equitable title. But the defendants here are hot in the position of \u201cpurchasers, or chargees for value without notice as regards the lien of their execution for two reasons: First, an-execution creditor can have no better right or title, even when: the execution binds a legal estate, than the execution debtor had, but is subject to the same paramount equities which bind the latter ([13]); and secondly, as already pointed out, the interest of the execution debtor bound by the execution was purely equitable and therefore the lien or charge of the execution was e subject to all equities prior in point of date. Whilst I freely adopt this argument I cannot assent to another mode of arriving at the same conclusion which was also urged on behalf of the plaintiffs. It was said that\u2019 inasmuch as the deed of the 26th of July, 1883, by which Renwick re-conveyed to Adamson, appeared on its face to be a mere voluntary deed for a nominal consideration, there was therefore a resulting trust in favor of Renwick. To this I cannot accede. The doctrine, in question of a resulting trust when no valuable consideration appears on the face of the deed is, no, doubt, applicable to common law conveyances but it does not, in my opinion, apply either to deeds operating under the Statute of Uses or to merely equitable conveyances. Mr. Lewin ([14]) it is true holds the contrary, but in two cases cited by him in a foot note to the text in which he advances the proposition, Lloyd v Spillet ([15]); Young v. Peachy ([16]); Lord Hardwicke expressly decided the contrary, and a very high authority on such a point, Mr. Sanders, in his work on Uses and Trusts maintains the same view. The point is, as it appears to me, of no practical importance in the present case, since the plaintiffs attain the same end in another way, and I only mention the point as it is of some importance as regards titles to lands in Ontario, since it would be a great innovation on the practice of conveyancing which has long prevailed in that province if in every conveyance in which a nominal consideration only was expressed it was to be held that a trust by operation of law resulted to the grantor.\nWe may therefore regard the plaintiffs as having been, at the time when the defendants\u2019 execution was lodged in the sheriff\u2019s hands, in the eyes of a Court of Equity the first incumbrancers\u2014mortgagees\u2014of this lot No 9; and in considering the case from this point of view we concede to the plaintiffs as high an equity as they can possibly pretend to.\nNext to turn to the case of the defendants, we find that their execution debtor Adamson was, on the 4th of August, 188 5, when they lodged their execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands, entitled to the equity of redemption in lot No 9, subject only to the mortgage to the Federal Bank, the plaintiffs.\nWhat then was the effect of the defendant\u2019s execution on Adamson\u2019s interest in this land? It is well known that at common law and without aid from statute or the assistance of a Court of Equity by a decree for equitable execution, a legal execution has no effect on an equitable interest in lands. Here, however, a Statute of Manitoba ([17]) has provided that\nUnder the writ of execution against lands, immediately upon its receipt by the sheriff shall be bound, and after the expiration of the time aforesaid, may be sold and conveyed, all or any lands, tenements, and hereditaments of the judgment debtor, wheresoever the same may be in this Province, both equitable and legal, and all his estate, right, title, and interest therein, of what nature and kind soever, & c.\nIt is therefore manifest that the defendants\u2019 writ of execution against the lands of Adamson bound his interest in this lot No. 9 from the date of its delivery to the sheriff on the morning of the 4th of August, 1883.\nTherefore at the time Adamson sold and conveyed this land to the Trustees of Knox\u2019s Church, on the same 4th of August, 1883, he was the absolute owner of the equitable interest which he originally acquired under the contract of purchase with the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, subject to two incumbrances, which were, first what was in substance if not in form a mortgage to the plaintiffs, and secondly a statutory charge in invitum by force of their execution in favor of the defendants. It cannot be disputed that a purchaser, finding the estate he buys encumbered, has a right to apply the purchase money in paying off the incumbrances, and that this right cannot be interfered with by the vendor. Further, the purchaser may pay off the incumbrances in such order as he may choose, subject, of course, to this, that such as are not paid off are left subsisting as charges upon the estate. Thus the property sold being subject to two successive mortgages the purchaser may, if he thinks fit, pay off the 2nd leaving the 1st unpaid. This in no way prejudices the first mortgagee, who in that case has no right to call upon the second mortgagee to hand over to him the amount received in satisfaction of his debt. And if this is so in the case of a second mortgage no reason can be suggested why it should not apply where the second incumbrance is not a mortgage but a judgment, which, as in the present case, has, by means of an execution issued upon it, become a charge upon the land. The only way in which this right can be controlled is by some contract or agreement on the part of the purchaser. It is not, however, pretended here that the trustees of Knox\u2019s Church ever agreed to apply their purchase money in discharge of the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage. All that is said by Mr. Renwick is that there was an agreement between him and Adamson that the proceeds of the sale should be applied to the payment of the Federal Bank. In answer to the question.\nAs between Mr. Adamson and the Bank who were entitled to the proceeds? Mr. Renwick says \u201cThe Federal Bank were, because that was the express understanding I conveyed to him.\u201d\nBut it is not even suggested that the Trustees of the Church, or the defendants ever had notice of, much less that they were parties to, any such arrangement. And in the absence of contract they were in no way affected by it. The result is that the defendants\u2019 execution was paid off and, if the plaintiffs, as they insist, still retained their first mortgage, it was left remaining as the first incumbrance on Adamson\u2019s interest under the contract, and there is nothing now to prevent the plaintiffs from enforcing it, unless the trustees, having got in the legal estate, are able to shew that they were originally purchasers for valuable consideration without notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights.\nThis is the view of the case taken by Mr. Justice Taylor at the trial and which he has enunciated concisely, but none the less accurately, in the judgment which he then delivered. In this I entirely agree with him, and though I have written more fully it has been only with a view of ascertaining and defining the positions of the parties; for when this is once done all difficulty vanishes and the case can be at once solved by applying very plain and well settled principles.\nIf the re-conveyance to Adamson had been indispensable to have enabled him to convey his interest, and had the fact that that deed was executed only on the understanding that the purchase money should be applied in reduction of the plaintiffs\u2019 debt, and had notice to the defendants of this arrangement been proved, there might then have been some ground for saying that the defendants ought not to be permitted to retain the money\u2014but even in that case I should doubt if the right of the purchaser to apply the money in paying off such incumbrances as he might select could be controlled.\nThe Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Killam reached the same result in another way. They determined that the money having been paid by a person entitled to pay it, the defendants having no notice of the arrangement were entitled to say that they were in the position of purchasers [for valuable consideration, their execution being satisfied by the payment of the money to the sheriff, and the sheriff\u2019s certificate of discharge, The case of Morley v. Pellatt ([18]) entirely supports this view, and I think it furnishes an additional and independent reason for dismissing the appeal.\nA further point suggested by the learned Chief Justice in the Court below was that there was no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from Mr. Justice Taylor\u2019s decision, inasmuch as the case did not come within the 53rd section of the Manitoba Interpleader Act. ([19]) That provision only authorises an interpleader by the sheriff in the case of lands when a claim is made against an execution creditor to the proceeds of lands or tenements \u201c taken and sold \u201d under any process, & c, the words of the statute being precisely the same as those of the C. S.O., chap. 54, sec. 10, I incline to think that this objection was well founded and, if so, the proceedings before Mr Justice Taylor were in the nature of an arbitration by consent and therefore final (1).\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014The plaintiffs, in the interpleader suit, claim that the money paid by the Trustees of Knox Church to the sheriff, under the circumstances, was their money.\nThe Respondents having a judgment against one Adamson, placed an execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands, by which whatever title Adamson had in the lands was bound.\nThe question as to what that title was never arose, nor has it arisen yet under the peculiar circumstances of this case. Then he having some title, the Trustees of Knox Church, wishing to get a certificate from the sheriff that the land was free from execution, undertook to pay, out of their funds, the amount of this execution.\nThe plaintiffs claim that this was their money. Now, to look at it in a business point of view, how could they claim it to be their money? No interest of theirs was taken, no title of theirs was interfered with. It was the mere title of Adamson, whatever it was, whether a legal or equitable estate we have no right nor business to inquire. The sheriff could have sold nothing but the interest of Adamson, and how could a third party come in and claim the money? If a party pays money by fraud he is entitled to relief, but I can see no ground the plaintiffs here have to relief. How can the Federal Bank claim money which they never paid and had no right to charge? How can they ask the Bank of Commerce to repay money to them to which they never had a claim?\nSuppose this land had been sold by the sheriff and the purchasers should claim to be entitled to receive a conveyance of the title of Adamson in the lands purchased by him from the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company; the Federal Bank might have intervened, and said, \u201cAdamson was merely our agent and therefore the purchaser must pay us our equitable claim.\u201d\nBut that is not the case here. The case is one of a very simple nature. The money was paid by Knox Church to the sheriff and he having handed it over to the execution creditors it bars all claims. I think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI may say, in addition, that the statute only affects cases where the land is actually sold, but that it should apply to every case in which an execution is put in the Sheriff\u2019s hands I think was never the intention I also agree with Mr. Justice Strong\u2019s remarks on the case.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I think the appeal must be dismissed upon both of the grounds argued.\n1st that the case is not one for interpleader, and 2nd that the Federal Bank having as they admit conveyed back to Adamson all interest they had in the land for the express purpose of enabling him to perfect his title thereto and then to sell the land to Knox Church Congregation, they the Federal Bank not appearing in that transaction but contenting themselves with Adamson\u2019s promise to pay them out of the monies he should receive on the sale, and the fl. fa. having been paid off and satisfied by the vendees of Adamson for the express purpose of discharging their vendor\u2019s land from the operation of the fi. fa. and to complete their title without the Bank of Commerce, so far as appears, having had any notice of the Federal Bank having ever had, or that they claimed to have any interest in the land, the money so paid to the sheriff was, in my opinion, money paid to the use of the Bank of Commerce and cannot be recovered by the Federal Bank either from the Sheriff or the Bank of Commerce. The Federal Bank must bear the consequences of their own act in enabling Adamson to deal with the property as his own.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Archibald, Howell, Hough & Campbell.\nSolicitors for respondents: Aikins, Culver & Hamilton.\n[1] 2 Man.

Act sec. 25\u2014When time begins to run\u2014Substantial matters to be settled before entry of judgment\u2014Dismissal of plaintiff's bill.\nWhere the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed the judgment of the Vice Chancellor in favor of the plaintiff, and dismissed the action:\nHeld, that in such case no substantial question could remain to be settled before the entry of the judgment, and the time for appealing to the Supreme Court of Canada would therefore run from the pronouncing of the judgment. O'Sullivan v. Harty[1] distinguished.\nMotion to dismiss appeal on the ground that it was not brought within thirty days after the pronouncing of the judgment.\nThe suit in this case was brought for specific performance of an agreement by the defendants, the Griffiths, to sell certain lands to the plaintiff, and by the other defendants, the Oddfellows, to purchase the same lands from the plaintiff at an advance of the purchase price. The bill alleged collusion between the defendants to deprive plaintiff of the benefit of the agreement.\nThe defence of the Griffiths was that plaintiff had been their agent to effect a sale of the property to the other defendants, but by fraudulently representing that he could not effect such sale induced them to sell to himself.\nThe Oddfellows alleged, in their statement of defence, that they had been damnified by the difficulties which had arisen between plaintiff and the Griffiths, and claimed, by way of cross-relief, a rescission of their contract and re-payment of the amount paid thereon. The defendants all denied the existence of any collusion between them as alleged.\nThe Vice Chancellor found that plaintiff was not the agent of the Griffiths, that the two contracts were independent, and decreed a specific performance with costs.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, holding that the plaintiff was guilty of such concealment, or false representation, to the Griffiths as raised an equity against him sufficient to prevent the court from awarding specific performance.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal was rendered on October 15th, 1884. On October 21st, 1884, notice of appeal was served.\nOn the 19th November, notice of filing bond for security, and of an application for its allowance was served. The application was made to Osier J. A. and objection was taken that the thirty days limited for bringing the appeal by section 25 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act had expired.\nOn the 26th November, notice of motion to extend time for appealing under sec. 26 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act was served. This motion was heard by Patterson J. A. On the 3rd December, 1884, the motion was dismissed with costs.\nOn the 16th day of December, 1884, the certificates of the judgment of the Court of Appeal were settled and entered.\nIn the appeal of the Griffiths the certificate of the judgment was to the effect that it was ordered and adjudged that the appeal should be allowed with the sum of $601.06 costs, to be paid by the respondent, Walmsley, to the appellants, the Griffiths, and that the action in the court below be dismissed with costs.\nIn the appeal of the defendants, other than the Griffiths, the certificate was to the effect that it was ordered and adjudged that the appeal should be allowed with $507.26 costs, to be paid by Walmsley to said defendants, and the action dismissed with costs, and that Walmsley should re-pay to the said defendants the sum of $500, the amount of deposit paid by defendants to Walmsley, together with interest at six per cent., from the 17th February, 1882, making the sum of $580.\nOn the 19th December, 1884, the application for leave to give security pursuant to sec. 31 Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, as amended by sec. 14 of the Supreme Court Amendment Act, 1879, was made to Mr. Justice Henry in chambers, who enlarged the application to the 14th January, 1885.\nOn the 14th January, 1885, the application was heard by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in chambers, who dismissed the application with costs, being of opinion that where an application has been made under sec. 26 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act for an extension of time for appealing, alleging \"special circumstances,\" to a judge of the court below who had a full knowledge of all the facts of the case and who had thought proper to dismiss the application made to him, a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada ought not to interfere.\nHis lordship also expressed a doubt as to whether an application could be made at all to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada under sec. 31, as amended, after the expiration of the time limited for appealing by sec. 25. On the 15th January, 1885, the plaintiff made an application to Mr. Justice Burton for leave to pay into court to the credit of the cause, the sum of $1,000 as security for the defendant's costs of appeal to the Supreme Court; $500 as security to the Griffiths, and $500 as security to the defendants other than the Griffiths.\nJudgment was reserved by Mr. Justice Burton till till the 4th November, 1885, when he allowed the application, being of opinion that the Supreme Court had decided in O'Sullivan v. Harty (on the 16th March, 1885,) that in all cases the time for appealing would run from, the entry of the certificate of the judgment.\nThe defendants appealed from the order of Mr. Justice Burton to the full Court of Appeal, which court, on the 24th November, 1885, sustained the order. On the 3rd December, 1885, the case was filed in the Supreme Court of Canada.\nOn the 7th December, 1885, the respondents moved to dismiss the appeal.\nThe question to be decided was whether the time for appealing ran from the date of the pronouncing of the judgment of the Court of Appeal\u2014the 15th October, 1884\u2014or from the date of the entry of the certificates of such judgment\u2014the 16th December, 1884.\nArnoldi for the defendants, the Griffiths, and J. A. Patterson for the other defendants, supported the motion.\nJ. B. Clark contra.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The proceedings in this case which gave rise to the present application were caused by a misunderstanding in the Court of Appeal as to the decision of this court in the case of O'Sullivan v. Harty. In that case the judgment of the Court of Appeal was not entered until November 14, 1884 although judgment had been pronounced on the 30th June, 1884, the delay having been occasioned by a substantial question affecting the rights of the parties having arisen on the settlement of the minutes. Such question was discussed before one of the judges, and subsequently before the full court before being finally determined.\nOn November 27, 1884, the respondent in the Court of Appeal applied to a judge in chambers of the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to give security under section 31 of the Supreme Court Act as amended by section 14 of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879. This application was referred to the full bench which held that the time for appealing in that case, under section 25 of the Supreme Court Act, began to run from the 14th of November, 1884, the date of entry of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nWhat we decided in that case was:\nThat where any substantial matter remains to be determined before the judgment can be entered the time for appealing runs from the entry of the judgment. Where nothing remains to be settled, as for instance in the case of the simple dismissal of a bill, or where no judgment requires to be entered, the time for appealing runs from the pronouncing of the judgment.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, appears to have been under the impression that this court had laid down a cast-iron rule that the time should run in every case from the entry of the judgment.\nIn this case I should have less hesitation in reaffirming the rule, because application to extend the time for appealing was made by the appellants to one of the judges who had heard the case in the Court of Appeal, who refused the application after considering all the circumstances of the case, and came to the conclusion that it was not a case in which the indulgence should be granted, and that the time should not be extended. The appellants then applied to me, and I came to the conclusion that I ought not to interfere with the decision of the judge of the court below, and I refused the application.\nThere being nothing to bring this case within the exception, as in the case of O'Sullivan v. Harty, I think we must act on that decision until some other rule is established. The present appeal comes within the rule heretofore acted on; we must therefore, I think, grant the motions and dismiss the appeal.\nFOURNIER, HENRY, TASCHEREAU and GWYNNE JJ. concurred.\nMotion granted and appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Foster, Clarke & Bowes.\nSolicitors for respondents, the Griffiths: Howland, Arnoldi & Ryerson.\nSolicitors for respondents, Geo.

The land in dispute consisted of a roadway situated between the adjoining properties of the plaintiff and defendant.\nAt the trial P. proved that he had had possession for a year, by closing up the road way with a fence and putting his cattle there, and that at times he allowed the defendant H. and others to use the roadway to get to the river and that when defendant H. took down the fence he immediately restored it and that defendant H. then asked him to let him use it. That it was after the defendant H. had again taken forcible possession of the land that he instituted against him the present action. H. proved he had used the roadway as a passage for a number of years, and put in his title. The courts below held that both parties had proved only an equivocal possession and dismissed the plaintiff's action, ordering that their rights should be tried by an action au petitoire. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Fournier J. dissenting, that as P. had proved a possession animo domini for a year and a day, he should be re-instated and maintained in peaceable possession of the land, and H. forbidden to trouble him by exercising a right of way over the land in question, reserving to the latter his recourse to revendicate au petitoire any right he might have.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), confirming a judgment of the Superior Court for Lower Canada of 19th December, 1881, dismissing appellant's action against respondents.\nThis was a possessory action en r\u00e9int\u00e9grande, brought by the owner of a lot of land on the bank of the river lichelieu, complaining of the invasion of his possession of another piece of land forming part of an old road leading from the front road to the river, and being the continuation of a road called the u Grande Ligne.\"\nThe plaintiff, (appellant,) alleged in his declaration:\nThat for more than a year and a day before the month of October, 1879, and for more than ten years before, and up to the beginning of said October, the plaintiff had continuously occupied as owner, animo domini, the lot of land in dispute. That he had been troubled by the defendants in the possession of said lot of land; that the latter had taken violent possession of the same and have committed a trespass thereon and concluded :\nThat by the judgment to be rendered, he be declared the possessor of the said immovable property; that defendants be forbidden to trouble him in the pos session of said immovable, and that plaintiff be, under the authority of the court reinstated and maintained in peaceable possession of said immovable property; that defendants be condemned jointly and severally to pay plaintiff the sum of $400 with interest and costs.\nThe following is a sketch of the locality and the spot at which the defendants are alleged to have committed the trespass is marked \"Passage.\" a Barri\u00e8re.\nB.

Il all\u00e9gueen avoir eu non seulement la possession annale, mais m\u00eame une possession qui remonte \u00e0 au del\u00e0, de dix ans, et que les intim\u00e9s l'ont trouble dans cette possession et m\u00eame deposed par violence au commencement d'octobre 1879.\nL'un des d\u00e9fendeurs David H\u00e9berr p\u00e9re de l'autre d\u00e9fendeur, a plaid\u00e9 par defense an fonds en fait niant sp\u00e9cialement que l'appelant ait en la possession animo domini du terrain en question. Par son exception ii pretend que c'est au contraire lui-m\u00eame qui a en cette possession qu'il plaide de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\nQue, sur et \u00e0 m\u00eame le dit lot No. 132 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 en Ia declaration du demandeur, dame Aur\u00e9lie Gauvin, \u00e9pouse du d\u00e9fendeur David H\u00e9bert et la mere du dit d\u00e9fendeur Henri H\u00e9bert, conjointement avec les h\u00e9ritiers de feu Joseph Gauvin, oncle du dit d\u00e9fendeurr possede a titre de propri\u00e9taire une largeur do vingt-quatre pieds do terre du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud du dit lot longeant et touchant a Ia ligue do division de la baronnie de Longueill sur toute la profondeur du dit lot, depuis le chemin do Ia grande ligne jusqu'\u00e0 la riviere Richelieu.\nApr\u00e9s avoir all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'appelant ayant ferm\u00e9 l'entr\u00e9e de ce terrain dont ii avait la possession, ii invoque ses titres a cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui consistent en divers actes authentiques dont l'un contient en faveur de sa femme,et d'un des fr\u00e9res de cette derni\u00e9re une reserve sp\u00e9ciale du terrain en question pour leur servir de passage pour communiquer a la riviere Richelieu. Ilajoute qu'il avait droit de passage sur ce terrain reserve a son \u00e9pouse et a Joseph Gauvin et qu'il avait droit d'\u00e9carter et faire dispara\u00eetre tout obstacle l'em p\u0152chant d'exercer ce droit qu'aux \u00e9pques dont se plaint l'appelant dans sa declaration, ii n'a fait qu'user de son droit de passer sur le terrain on passage susdit dont ii a en la jouisance et l'usage sans trouble, ouvertement et publiquement an vu et scu de tous, depuis \u2022au-del\u00e0 trente ans, lequel passage a servi an public pendant la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode de temps, et ce a la connaissance personnelle de l'appelant qui connasssait lors de l'intitution de son action que le terrain en question appareenait a l\u00e8pouse 1 Intim\u00e9 (D. H\u00e9bert).\nHenry H\u00e9bert le fils de l'autre intim\u00e9, a plaid\u00e9 les droits de son p\u00e8re ajoutant que c'\u00e9tait avec la permission de celui-ci qu'il avait pass\u00e9 sur le terrain en question.\nL\u2019appelant a r\u00e9pondu en droit a. la partie de ce plai doyer fond\u00e9e sur les titres de propriet\u00e9 invodu\u00e9s par les d\u00e9fendeuss, et Ia Cour Sup\u00e9rieure 'as, avec raison, rejet\u00e9 cette partie du plaidoyer. Mais tout le reste du plaidoyer subsiste et se resume a dire: 1\u00b0 que l'intim\u00e9 David H\u00e9bert poss\u00e9de a titre de propri\u00e9taire le terrain en litige. 2\u00b0 que depuis au del\u00e0 de trente ans, il a exerc\u00e9 sur son terrain le droit de passage 3\u00b0 que ce n'est que par souffranee qu'il a laiss\u00e9 l'appelant, ainsi que le public se servir du terrain en question;.\nApres une discussion approfondie de la preuve faite par les parties, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9side\u00e9 par l'Hon. Juge Chagnon, en est venu a. la conclusion que ni l'une ni lautre des parties n'avait fait une preuve suffisante pour se faire maintenir en possession a l'exclusion d\u0152 l'autre, et a en consequ\u00e9nce renvoy\u00e9 l'action de l'appelant avec injonction aux parties de se pourvoir au p\u00e9titoire pour faire decider la question de propriet\u00e9 d'apr\u00e9s leurs titres respectifs.\nCe jugement port\u00e9 en appel a la Cour du Banc de Ia Reine y a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 a l'unanimit\u00e9 des six iuges composant la cour ([1]). C'est de ce jugement de cette confirmation don\u2019t appelant se plaint.\nIl ne s'agit en cette cause que d'une question d'ap pr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages pour determiner si l'uneou lautre des parties a eu une possession suffisante du terrain en question pour s'en faire maintenir en possession a l'exclusion de l'autre. Apr\u00e9s une lecture attentive de la preuve, j'en suis venu a la m\u00e9me conclusion que l'Hon. Juge Chagnon sur l'appreciation des faits.\nIl r\u00e9sulte clairement de la preuve qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de part et d'autre des actes indiquant chez les deux parties l'id\u00e9e de faire acte de possession. Ce terrain qui est celui d'un ancien chemin aboli par la, municipalit\u00e9 \u00e9tait encore clotur\u00e9 lorsque le demandeur a demand\u00e9 a la municipalit\u00e9 la permission de sen emparer. Cette .permission lui fut refus\u00e9e. II y fit tout de m\u00eame des actes de possession, comme des reparations aux cl\u00e9tures, v mit des animaux et posa des barri\u00e9res, etc. Mais avant le mois d'octobre 1879, \u00e9poque du trouble dont ii se plaint, l'appelant n'a jamais eu l'id\u00e9e den \u00e9loigner rintim\u00e9 H\u00e9bert, ni les autres personnes qui faisaient usage de ce terrain comme d'un passage. Lorsqu'il fit des reparations aux clotures ii y mit des barri\u00e9res qui continueraient d'en laisser le libre acc\u00e9s l'intim\u00e9 H\u00e9bert et \u00e0 nombre d'autres qui y passaient sans objection de sa part. Ii n'a jamais non plus, avant cette \u00e9poque fait aucune sommation a Fintim\u00e9 de se d\u00e9sister, et c'est sans doute pour la raison qu'il a donn\u00e9e au t\u00e9moin Brun, qu'il n'y avait que la famille Gauvin dont liintim\u00e0 fait partie, qui avait droit de passer sur ce terrain. 11 est evident par cette declaration qu'il n'ignorait pas les droits que H\u00e9bert poss\u00e9dait par sa femme, Aur\u00e9lie Gauvin, admettant par la m\u0152me que ce n'\u00e9tait pas par pure tol\u00e9ranee de sa part qu'il laissait passer H\u00e9bert. H\u00e9bert en faisant ces actes de possession voulait sans doute exercer son droit. Ces actes de possesion de la part d'H\u00e9bert depuis pr\u00e9s de cinquante ans, comme ii le dit, \u00e9taient in trouble qui emp\u00eachatt l'appelant de pr\u00e9ten-dre qu'il a en une possession paisible, non interrompue et non \u00e9quivoque du m\u00eame passage. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la preuve fait par 'lHon. Juge Chagnon se termine par la conclusion suivante :\u2014\nIi appert par la preuve que les deux parties avaient possession concurrente, e'est-a-dire quo si le Demandeur faisait des actes de possession animo domini par le fait qu'il faisait pacager dans ce passage ses animaux, et qu'ill y faisait-des travaux de cl\u00f4ture dans but le d\u00e9fendeur David H\u00e9bert a toujours continu\u00e8 lui aussi de poss\u00e9der cette vole de passage, comme chemin en y passant et re-passant, et que s'il n'y a pas fait de travaux sp\u00e9ciaux, c'\u00e8tait parce que la destination de cc terrain pour lui, \u00e9tait de lui servir de vole de pasaage ou de chemin, et qu'il l'a toujours utilise en conformit\u00e8 a cette destination\nL'hon. juge se demande Si dans le cas d'une possession concurrents comme celle qui est prouv\u00e9e en cette cause, ii n'aurait pas droit de consulter les titres pour determiner le veritable caract\u00e8re de la possession. Ii avait incontestablement ce droit qu'on lui reprochhe d'avoir exerc\u00e8 dans ce cas, parce que les titres avaient \u00e8t\u00e8 rejet\u00e9s du dossier. Je n'ai du constater ce fait mais il est vrai que la partie du plaidoyer fond\u00e9 sur ces titres a \u00e9t\u00e9 reje\u00e9ee et avec raison; toutefois, je ne vois pas que les tirres aient \u00e9t\u00e9 sortis du dossier et s'ils l'eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 c'\u00e9iit Ct\u00e9 a tort. Car le d\u00e9fendeur dans des actions de ce genre, quoiqu'il ne puisse plaider ses titres comme moyen de defense, a cependant le droit de les produire pour \u00e9tablr le caract\u00e9re de sa possession. Les titres \u00e9tant demeur\u00e9s de record i'non. juge a eu raison de les consulter. Voir Bioche vo. Action possessoire ([2]) et les nombreux arrets qui y sont cites. Au n 361 il dit :\n20 Par cela seul que le juge, pour \u00e9clairer la possession, appr\u00e9cie les titres respectivement produits, en d\u00e9clarant quels droits r\u00e9sul tent de ces tirres pour chaque partie, si d'ailleurs le dispositif se restraint a une simple maintenue en possession. Ce n'est pas un titre qu'applique le juge, c'est une indicaiion qu'il consulte : ce n'est pas le p\u00e9titoire qu'il juge, c'est le possessoire qu'il \u00e9claire.\nL'hon. juge a constate par l'examen des titres que Aur\u00e9lie Gauvin \u00e9pouse de liintim\u00e9 H\u00e9bert, pouvait avoir des droits reels et v\u00e9ritables dans ce passage par un titre qui l'avait reserve en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 an b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des h\u00e9ritiers Gauvin. Mais 1'h.on. juge n'a rien d\u00e9cid\u00e9 sur la validit\u00e9 des tirres, il s'en est servi seulement pour en conclure que les actes de possession que faisait David H\u00e9bert dans ce cliemin, tous les ans, depuis au dela de trente ans, \u00e9taient faits animo domini. ii en conclut aussi que la possession de l'appelant :\nAyant \u00e9t\u00e9 dans les 'circonstances,sous l'effet d'un trouble constant apport\u00e9 par la possession concurrent\u00e9 de David H\u00e9bert, l'appelant ne petit rien obtenir sur son action possessoire, mais que les parties doivent vider leur diff\u00e9rend an p\u00e9titoire.\nCette adjudication est suivie du renvoi de laction avec d\u00e9pens.\nNo pouvant attribuer la possession exclusive ni a l'un ni a l'autre des parties \u00e0 cause du caract\u00e0re parti-culier de leur possession respective, n'y avait-il pas un moyen terme a adopter ? Qnoi qu'il soit vrai qu'en principe la possession est exclusive, l'autorit\u00e9 qu'il cite de Troplong admet \" que cette v\u00e9rit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre temf\u00e9r\u00e9e par une modification,\" et Troplong ajoute ([3]) :\nPuisdu'il y a des possessions in\u00e9gales, rien n'emp\u00eache qu'on no les admette \u00e1 concourir eta s'\u00e1chelonrier les unss sur les antr\u00e9s......\nLa regie quo deux possessions s'excluent n'est applicable que lorsou'il s'agit do possessions de m\u00eame genre. \u00e9man\u00e9es do causes oppos\u00e9es et rivales, travaillant chacuce pour un interet prive.\nEt au num\u00e9ro 252 il dit ([4]):\nLorsque deux personnes concourent sur le meme lieu pour le poss\u00e9der, et se livrent a des actes possessoires \u00e8galement caracteristi-ques, il n'y a possession daaucun cot\u00e9, car los deux possessions s'excluent. - C'est par d'autres indices qu'on peut arriver a la con-naissanee do Ia propriete.\nLes actes de possession dont il s'asrit ici n'est pas le m\u00e8me caract\u00e8re de part et d'autre, l'appelant a r\u00e9par\u00e9 les clotures et a mis ses animaux sur le terrain dont l'intime se servait, de son cOt\u00e9, comme d'un passage; ces actes ne sont pas iriconciiiables et pouvaient etre exerc\u00e9s concurremment comme de fait ils l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pendant in grand nombre d'annees. II eit \u00e9t\u00e9 plus conforme peut-\u00e8tre au caract\u00e8re reconnu de ces actes de possession, de maintenrr les parties dans leur possession, respective j ce que l;hon. Juge aurait Pu faire en se fondant sur l'autorite suivanee ([5]) :\nQuid si les deux parties pr\u00e8tendent r\u00e9ciproquement avoir Ia possession annale et quo le d\u00e8fendeur se porte reconvention nellement demandeur ? Le juge peut ordonner le s\u00e9questre et renvoyer lea parties a proc\u00e9der au p\u00e9titoiro; l,art. 1961 qui autorise le s\u00e9questro ne fait aucune distinction entre lee tribunaux ordinaires et d'exception (nombre d'arr\u00eats cites), ou lee maintenir dans la possession respective du terrain contentieux. Case, 28 Avril 1813, S. 13, 392; 14 Nov. 1832 D. 33 5. Il y a lieu de r\u00e9server lee d\u00e9pess do l'instance au possessoire. Case, 31 Juillet 1838.\nAu lieu de s'appuyer sur cette autorit\u00e9, lhon. juge a sans doute pr\u00e9f\u00e9re, apr\u00e8s avoir fait l'examen des titres, comme il en avait le droit, faire application de l'autorit\u00e9 suivante ([6]) :\nJu\u00e9e aussi que lorsque lee deux parties font \u00e9galement preuee d'acte do possession, le juge do paix peut accorder la maintenue \u00e0 celle qui justifie mieux son droit d'apr\u00e8s Papplication des titres sous le rapport de la possession. Cass, 19 Juillet 1830, D. 33,274; 13 Nov. 1839; 9 Dec. 1840, D. 40, 26; 41, 30 Henrion, ch. 51. Ii serait plus prudent de maintenir los parties dans leur possession respective do l'immeuble.\nL'hon. iuge pouvait donc a sa discretion adopter l'une ou l'autre des conclusions sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es, sans se mettre en contradiction avec lee faits do la cause ni avec la loi qui leur est applicable. Par son renvoi de Iaction il a en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 maintenu les droits de posssession de l'intim\u00e9, et ii n'a fait en cela que faire application du principe \u00e9noncC ci-dessus \" que le juge de paix peut accorder la maintenue a celle des parties qui justifie mieux son droit d'apr\u00e8s l'application de titre sous le rapport de la possession.\"\nEn cons\u00e9quence je crois avec la cour du Bane de la Reine qui a confirm\u00e9 a lunanimit\u00e9 l'opinion do l'hon. juge, qu'il n'y a aucun motif suffisant pour reformer son jugement.\nOn fait a la possession de liintim\u00e9 une objection qui serait grave ci elle \u00e9tait fon\u00e9ee en fait. On le compare a celui qui voudrait se faire maintenir dans la posses sion d'une servitude de passage, en invoquant ses actes de possession, et on lui objecte avec raison l'art. 549 C.C.\nBioche Vo. Action possessoire, p. 225. n 325\n[Page 460].\nNulle servitude ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabiie sans titre; la possession m\u00eame imm\u00e9moriale ne suffit pas a cet effet.\nMais telle n'est pas la position d'H\u00e9bert, ii ne pretend pas r\u00e9clamer un droit de passage sur le fond de l'appelant, ii r\u00e9clame le fonds m\u00eame en prouvant l'avoir poss\u00e9d\u00e9 a titre de propri\u00e9taire. Il ne s'agit aucunement de servitude dans le d\u00e9bat pr\u00e9sent\u2014le droit de passage exerc\u00e9 par H\u00e9bert n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'une mani\u00e9re de jouir de sa propri\u00e9te, il s'agit uniquement de la posses sion a titre do propri\u00e9taire du terrain en litige.\nIl est vrai que David H\u00e9bert ne s'est servi du terrain en question qu\u00e9 comme d'un passage\u2014cette partie de sa propriete ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 destin\u00e9e a cet usage comme on le voit par son titre,eil en a joui comme d'un passage mais non a titre de servitude sur Ia propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant; mais comme d'un passage \u00e9tabli sur un terrain dont ii est propri\u00e9taire et en possession depuss un grand nombre d'ann\u00e9es. C'est d\u00e9naturer les faits que de repr\u00e9senter H\u00e9bert comme pr\u00e9tendant exercer une ser vitude sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant. Bien qu'on ne puisse dans cette \u00e9ause decider de la validit\u00e9 des titres, on doit cependant les consulter pour qualifier la posses sion et ii en r\u00e9sulte clairement que la position d'H\u00e9bert est celle que je viens d'exposer. C'est aussi de cette mani\u00e9re que l'a comprise lhon. juge Chagnon, ainsi que tous les jugres de la cour du Banc de la Reine.\nTout en repoussant I'id\u00e9e que David H\u00e9bert invoque sa possession pour r\u00e9clamer une servitude sans titre, je veux bien admettre pour un instant, par forme d'argument, qu'il r\u00e9clame la possession plus que annale d'une servitude, mais il faut ajouter, ce qui saute aux yeux, qu'il fait cette reclamation en se fondant sur un titre authentique. Alors ii devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la position d'une personne en possession d'une servitude fond\u00e9e sur un titre authentique ct qui, \u00e9tant troubl\u00e9, invoque sa possession annale pour se faire maintenir dans la possession de son droit de servitude Une personne dans ce cas a droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de toutes les actions et defenses que la loi accorde pour la protection de la possession. En consequence H\u00e9bert aurait droit dans un tel cas de plaider sa possession annale en produisant son titre. L'autorit\u00e9 suivante est positive \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, Duranton ([7]):\nMais lorsque a l'appui de la possession annale actuelle, all\u00e9gu\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de servitude non susceptible de s'acqu\u00e9rir par prescrip tion, celui qui peut l'invoquer en sa faveur, et qui est trouble, prdduit aussi un titre non pr\u00e9caire. la Cour de Cassation decide que sa complainte est recevable, et que le juge de paix est competent pour discuter le m\u00e9rite et l'appiication du titre, bien qu'il fut con test\u00e9 ([8]); qu'appliquer le titre en pareil cas, ce n'est point annuler le p\u00e9titoire et le possessoire ([9]).\nAinsi, en supposant m\u0152me que David H\u00e9bert n'aurait invoqu\u00e9 que la servitude de passage, en se b\u00e2sant sur sa possession plus que annate et la production dc son titre,\u2014il aurait eu incontestablement d'apr\u00e8s ces auto rites le droit de plaider comme ii l'a fait\u2014et sa possession qualifi\u00e8e par son titre aurait suffi pour le faire maintenir dans sa possession et rejeter laction de son adversaire.\nMais je le r\u00e9pete encore une fois ce n'est pas sa position dans cette cause, ii se dit possesseur dc tout le terrain en litige \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire et qualifie sa possession par la production dun titre authentique. M\u00c6is comme il a laiss\u00e9 faire a l'appelant certains actes de possession, je crois que le juge en premi\u00e8re instance n'a pas en tort de declarer, que la possession qnoique concurrente, resttrait par l'effet dti renvoi de action, a l'intim\u00e9 qui avait qualifi\u00e9 la sienne par des titres authentiques, \u00e9t son jugement ordonnant, selon l'autorit\u00e9 de Pothier qu'il cite, que les parties se . pourvoiront au p\u00e9titoire, devait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9, mais ii en sera autrement, car je suis seul \u00e0 soutenir le bien jug\u00e9. Si je suis dans l'erreur, je me trouve en nombreuse compagnie, celle du juge de premiere instance d'abord, et ensuite celle des six juges de la cour du Banc de la Reine, tandis que lopinion contraire est soutenue pas quatre de mes honorables coll\u00e9gues. Si je mentionne cette particularit\u00e9, ce nest pas que je crois que les opinions doivent se compter, au lieu d'\u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9es suivant leur valeur, mais seulement parce que dans cette cour d\u00e9j\u00e0, et aussi dans un tribunal sup\u00e9rieur au n\u00f4tre, on a cru trouver dans le nombre un argument pour fortifier une opinion controvers\u00e9e. Suivant moi, l'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Action possessore, avec allegations et conclusions requises pour la complainte et conclusions additionnelles en r\u00e9int\u00e9grande. Le d\u00e9fendeur nie la possession du demandeur; plaide que sa femme poss\u00e9de le terrain en question a titre de propri\u00e9taire; que l\u00e9 demandeur en ayant ferm\u00e9 lentr\u00e9e, lui, le d\u00e9fendeur, \u00e9carrt la barri\u0141re; qu'il avait droit de passage sur le dit terrain; qu'il n'a fait qu'user de son droit de passer sum le dii terrain ou passage dont ii a en la jouissance et l'usage depuis plus de trente ans; que depuis plus de trente ans, ii a en l'usage et Ia jousssance du dit passage, et qu'iI a joui de tel droit tous lee ans, surtout durant le cours de chaque \u00e9t\u00e9 autant de fois qu'il avait occasion d'aller a la riviere Richelieu. Tel est le plai doyer du d\u00e9fendeur a peu pr\u00e9s verbatim apres le jugement sur une r\u00e9ponee en droit qui en a ecart\u00e9 une partie tel qu'originairement produit. Il n'y apparait, certainement pas bien clairement que c'est la possession du terrain que le d\u00e9fendeur pr\u00e9tend avoir eue. Il para\u00eet plut\u00f4t se baser sur la possession d'un droit de passage. Mais enfin, ii lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 libre de prouver possession du terrain m\u00eame sur sa d\u00e9n\u00e9gation de cette possession par le demandeur. C'est ce qu'il a tent\u00e9 de faire sans succ\u00e8s, cependant, dans mon opinion.\nIl me semble ressortir clairement de la preuve au dossier que tant qu'au sol, au terrain Iui-m\u00eame, c'est le demandeur qui depuis longtemps en est seul en possession animo domini, et que tout cc que le d\u00e9fendeur a poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et r\u00e9clame sur ce terrain jusqu'aux voies de fait en question, c'est un droit de passage. Or cette possession, si elle nest pas appuy\u00e9e dun titre, est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en loi avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9caire et un simple acte de tol\u00e9rance. Cross v. Judah ([10]); Bioche ([11]); Boncenne-Bourbeau ([12]); Pardessus ([13]); Merlin, Rep. Servitude ([14]); Demolombe ([15]).\nLe demandeur para\u00eet avoir permis au public de passer la pendant longtemps, et les propres t\u00e9moins du d\u00e9fendeur Dandurand et Ste. Marie, prouvent que lui d\u00e9fendeur passait la comme les autres quand il en avait besoin. E\u00fbt-il eu l'aminus domini cc ne serait pas suffisant. Il cut fallu que ses actes dc possession fussent tenement caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s que le demandeur ne put se m\u00e9prendre sur ses intentions. Bioche ([16]). S'il veut pr\u00e9tendre que ces actes de passage \u00e9taient des actes de possession du sol, alors la possession qu'il aurait prouv\u00e9 ne serait dans tous les cas qu'une possession \u00e9quivoque.\nBoncenne-Bourbeau ([17]) : La possession \u00e9quivoqee pr\u00e9senee avec celle qui s'exerce par tolerance une certaine affinit\u00e9, lorsqu'il est incertain d'apr\u00e9s le caract\u00e8re des actes s'ils sont exerc\u00e9s a titre de propriet\u00e9, de co-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et do bon voisinage, comme si, par exemple, une partie pr\u00e9tendant avoir poss\u00e9d\u00e9 a titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou do co-propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mvoquait des faits de possession qui pourraient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme l'exercice d'une servitude discontinue qui ne s'appuirait pas sur un titre Comp. Demolombe. Vol. 2 Servitude, No. 673.\nAppleton ([18]) :\nSupposons qu'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le possesseur a agi animo domini, cela suffira-t-il ? Non. Ii faudra encore que ses actes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 assez caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s pour quo le pubiic n'ait pu concevoir aucun doute sur l'existence do cot animus domini; point do possession utile silo public n'a pu savoir avec certitude quo c'\u00e9tait le droit do propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'on pr\u00e9tendait exercer, et non pas une simple servitude.\nD'ailieurs, en ne r\u00e9clamant pendant de longues ann\u00e9es qu'un droit de passage le d\u00e9fendeur n'admettaitil pas par la m\u00eame la possession du demandeur, son dominium du fonds ? Est-ce que celui qui n'exerce qu'une servitude peat en m\u00eame temps avoir l'animus domini sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u0152me? Savigny, ([19]). II a produit a l'enqu\u00eate un titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive du terrain pour qualifier sa possession. Mais ii n'a tout au plus prouv\u00e9, je l'ai dit, qu'une possession d'un droit de passage. Laurent ([20]). N'y a-t-il pas contradiction entre son titre et sa possession, entre son titre et ses pr\u00e9tentions ? R\u00e9clamet--on un droit de passage sur son propre terrain ? Il a prouv\u00e9 un titre a sa pro-pri\u00e9t\u00e9, et la possession d'une autre. Le titre supportet-il la possession ?\nSur un arr\u00eat rapport\u00e9 dans Dalloz ([21]): \" Get arsenal du droit francais ou toutes les erreurs peuvent trouver des arr\u00eats et tous les paradoxes des autorit\u00e9s.\" L'arr\u00eat cit\u00e9 donnerait a entendre que la Cour de Cassation a la d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le propri\u00e9taire dun fonds sur lequel existe un cliemin priv\u00e9 prohib\u00e9 dans la possession de ce chemin pent poursuivre au possessoire comme trouble dans un simple droit de passage. Mais, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au texte du jugement, l'on volt que la cour n'a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'une question de comp\u00e9tence.\nRe Radepont D. 29,1, 380. Lorsqu'un d\u00e9fenderr all\u00e8gue la possession d'un droit do passage, sans titre pour l'appuyer, ii doit succomber au possessoire.\nLeconte ([22]) :\nAinsi lorsque la servitude n'est pas du nombre de celles qui peuvent sacqu\u00e9rir par prescription, parc\u00e9qu'elle est non apparente, (ou discontinue, apparente ou non, n'importe,) ii n'y a point de jouissance qui puisse seule fonder l'action possessoire, au profit de celui qui all\u00e8ffue cette jouissance; son action serait non recevable : et dans tous les cas ou il serait attaqu\u00e9 par l'autre partie, comme troublant la jouissance de celle-cl, il devrait succomber au possessoire, sauf a so pourvorr au p\u00e9titoire s'il croyait avoir acquis le droit de servitude. En effet la possession annale n'aboutirait a rien, lors memo qu'elle serait avou\u00e9e, puisqu'elle ne dispenserait pas de produire un titre constitutif de la servitude Cass 23 f\u00e9vrier 1814.\nBioche.([23]):\nSi le d\u00e9fenderr pr\u00e9tend avoir eu le droit d'agir comme il l'a fait, c'est une question a examiner au p\u00e9titoire. Nous supposons que la contestation du droit invoqu\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur ne puisse r\u00e9sulter que do l'appr\u00e9ciation des pr\u00e9tentions ou allegations contraires des parties, de l'examen des titres invoqu\u00e9s; le juge de paix ne pouvant faire cette appreciation sans cumuler le possessoire et le p\u00e9titoire. Mass proviso\u00eerement la maintenue en possession du demandeur doit \u00e9tre prononc\u00e9e.\nVoir aussi Dupont dans la m\u00eame sens ([24]) :\nLe simple exercise de passage sur le fonds d'un particulier ne peut faire acqu\u00e9rir ni possession du aol ni prescription du aol. S. V. 1844, 2, 168, re Coppier. Idem, 404, re Communes de Ia P\u00e9ze.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur a amen\u00e9 un nomm\u00e9 Brun pour prouver que le demandeur aurait, en une certaine occasion, admis que lui le d\u00e9fendeur avait la un droit de passage. Mais ce t\u0152moignage est illegal et doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Art. 549-550. On ne peut prouver un droit de servitude par t\u00e9moins. Et, sur la pr\u00e9sente issue d'ailleurs, Ia possession seule est en . au c. Oirle demandeur n'a jamais admis que le delendeur f\u00fbt en possession de ce terrain on m\u00e9me en possession d'un droit de passage. Je ne vois nulle part due le demandeur ait jamais admis qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas, lui, en possession du terrain, on qu'il eu \u00e9tait en possession non animo domini.\nLe defendeur a souteun que la possession du deman dear n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 paisible et non interrompue. Le seul fait sun lequel ii appuit cette pr\u00e9tention est qu'en mai on juin 1879, moins d'un an avant l'instituiion de l'action lui m\u00eame le d\u00e9fendeur, en l'absence du deman deur qui lui avait defendu de passer sur ce terrain, y Serait entr\u00e9 pendant pen de temps, deux ou trois heures peut-etre, et y aurait fait quelques petits travaux pour faciliter le passage. be m\u00eame jour, le demandeur, de retour chez lui, d\u00e9fit ces travaux, ferma l'entr\u00e9e du oassage ayec des madriers, et renouvela au public la defense d'y passer. Le d\u00e9fendeur parut se soumettre, demanda an demandeur Ia permission d'aller chercher ses mat\u00e9riaux, et cessa de passer, laissant le demandeur en possession du terrain tel qu'il l'\u00e9tait depuis long temps litulo domini. Peut-il argumenter de ces faits que Ia possession du demandeur n'a pas Ct\u00e9 paisible et non inlerrompue ? La proposition me para\u00eet insoutenable N'a-t-il pas lui-m\u00eame alors reconnu la possession du demandeur ? Ne devait pas alors. s'il avait la possession comme ii le pretend aujourd'hui, instituer contre le demandeur une action possessoire ? e Au lieu de ce faire, il se retire, reconna\u00eet le demandeur. comme roi et ma\u00eetre, et puis, en septembre ou octobre suivaut, revient ayec force et armes encore en Pabsence du demandeur, abat les bar ri\u00e8res et clotures, et prend possession au nom du droit du plus fort. Et poursuivi par le demandeur au possessoire, ii vent invoquer la voie de fait du mois de mai, pour d\u00e9fendre celle du mois d'octobre! Bioche:\nSi j'ai d\u00e8j\u00e0 la possession annale au moment o\u00fa un autre veut rentrer en possession un, seul acte de sa part ne suffirait pas pour causer l'interruption: cet acte serait un simple trouble que je ferais r\u00e9primer par la complainte. Pour qu'une possession annale soit interrompue, il faut que I'autre dure elle-m\u00eame une ann\u00e9e ([25]).\nMais quelques reclamations isol\u00e9es et r\u00e9duitesau silence quelques voics de fait repouss\u00e9es par des voies de fait contraires sont insuffsantes pour faire perdre a Ia possession le caract\u00e9re de paisible quelle avait auparavant ([26]).\nEt si celui qui \u00e9tait en possession s'en est ressaisi ou a r\u00e9clame aussit\u00f4t qu'il a eu connaissance de l'occupation, et avant que cette occupation ait dur\u00e9 un an, ii n'y a pas eu interruption de sa possession.

The plaintiff proved an actual continuous possession extending over many years; the defendant gave no evidence of any possession other than such as consisted in the acts of disturbance of the plantiff's possession of which he complained, and the question of title asserted by the defendant not being cognizable on the record the plaintiff. was, in my opinion, clearly entitled to a judgment in his favor.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Beique, McGoun & Emard.\nSolicitors for respondent: Pagnuelo, Taillon & Lauctot.\n[1] NoTE.\u2014Il y a 5 juges nom- omis, mais il est le seul dont mes, le riom du Juge Ramsay est nous avons lee notes.\n[2] Nos 359, 360, 361.\n[3] P. 420.\n[4] Prescripiion 1 vol. p. 434,\n[5] Bioche Vo Action possessoire p. 224, n 324.\n[6] Bioche Vo.

Ins.\u2014Ins. on freight\u2014Constructive total loss\u2014Abandonment\u2014Repairs by underwriters.\nA vessel proceeding on a voyage from Arecibo to Acquim and thence to New York, encountered heavy weather, was dismasted and was towed into Guantanamo. The underwriters of the freight sent an agent to Guantanamo to look after their interests, and the master of the vessel, under advice from the owners, abandoned her to such agent, and refused to assist in repairing the damage, and complete the voyage. The agent had the vessel repaired and brought her to New York, with the cargo.\nOn an action to recover the insurance on the freight,\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court below, Strong J. dissenting, that there being a constructive total loss of the ship the action of the underwriters, in making the repairs and earning the freight, would not prevent the assured from recovering.\nAppeal from a Judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] ordering that judgment be entered for the defendants on a special case stated by the parties. The said special case was as follows:\n1st. This is an action brought to recover the sum of eight hundred dollars upon a policy of insurance issued by the defendant company to the plaintiffs, carrying on business under the name of Black Brothers and Co., upon the freight of the brigantine \"Rebecca Neily,\" of which the plaintiffs were owners, upon a voyage at and from Arecibo to Acquim and thence to New York. The plaintiffs alone were interested in said freight.\n2nd. Whilst prosecuting said voyage with her cargo on board, she encountered heavy weather, was dismasted, and towed into Guantanamo on or about the middle of November, A.D. 1881. The defendant, company had also a policy on the hull of said vessel to the extent of two thousand five hundred dollars, dated the 10th day of May, A.D. 1881, which is the subject of the first count of the declaration herein.\n3rd. It would have cost at least the amount of freight, payable under the charter-party hereinafter referred to from Acquim to New York, to send the cargo on from the said port of Guantanamo to New York by another ship.\nJ. F. Whitney & Co., commission merchants in New York, disbursed the said vessel and collected her freight, which was placed by them to credit of the \"Rebecca Neily\" and owners for account of disbursements paid by them, and after so crediting the sum received there was a balance left unpaid on disbursement account which was placed by them to the debit of said \"Rebecca Neily\" and owners. The said disbursement account was rendered by said J. F. Whitney & Co. to the defendant company by the authority of the latter, and the defendant company paid to said J. F. Whitney & Co. the said balance due to them. The said J. F. Whitney & Co. also had other money transactions with the defendant company relative to said vessel after she was towed into Guantanamo and before her arrival at New York from Guantanamo aforesaid; and the said J. F. Whitney & Co. had made payments for said vessel by the authority of the defendant company, and the latter subsequently re-imbursed said J. F. Whitney & Co. for all the moneys which they had advanced or paid for said defendants.\n4th. The printed case in an action brought by the plaintiffs above named against the Honorable Alfred G. Jones, and which is hereinafter more particularly referred to, together with the pleadings in this action, the policy of insurance granted by defendants upon said freight, the charter-party entered into on behalf of the plaintiffs for the carriage of the cargo on board said \"Rebecca Neily\" at the time of her loss shall form part of this case. The court shall consider the evidence in the said printed case herewith, and as to all questions of fact not admitted in this case the court shall be at liberty, and power is hereby given to them, to find all questions of fact and to draw all inferences of fact that a jury might.\n5th. It is admitted that preliminary proofs were given in due form more than sixty days before this action was commenced.\n6th. The said action brought by the said plaintiffs against said Honorable Alfred Gr. Jones, as will be seen on reference to the said printed case, was an action against said Jones as an underwriter upon a policy on the hull of the said \"Rebecca Neily\" to recover for a total loss of said vessel. On the trial of plaintiffs' said action against said Jones, the following verdict or finding was rendered by Mr. Justice Thompson, who tried the said cause:\u2014\n\"I give the verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount \"claimed, and interest. While recognizing the importance \"of the questions involved in this suit, I do \"not here state at large the views which I entertain \"on these questions, because I conceive it will be only \"useful for me to state the points on which my conclusions rested. I thought the abandonment justifiable, \"and the constructive total loss theory sustainable. \"1st. By the vessel's condition and situation at \"the time of the abandonment, irrespective of \"subsequent events, confirmatory of this view \"2nd. By the evidence of value after repaired. \"3rd. By the actual cost of the repairs\n\"Having arrived at this conclusion, it seemed to me \"that the plaintiffs were entitled to the verdict, notwithstanding \"the repairs effected by the underwriters, \"and the endeavours of the underwriters to restore \"the vessel to the plaintiffs.\"\n7th. The defendants, upon said verdict of Mr. Justice Thompson being sustained by the court in banco upon appeal thereto, paid into court in this action, on or about the 31st day of July, A. D. 1884, under the count upon the said policy on hull, the amount due thereon as for a total loss of said vessel, with interest to the date of such payment.\n8th. It is admitted that the foregoing findings of Mr. Justice Thompson were correct, and it is agreed that they shall form part of the case, and shall have the same effect herein as if found in this cause upon sufficient evidence in that behalf.\n9th. The question for the consideration of the Court is whether or not the plaintiffs can, under the circumstances, recover the insurance on said freight.\nJudgment to be entered for the successful party with the costs upon and incident to the claim upon the freight policy.\nThe following facts also were presented by the printed case in appeal.\nSUPPLEMENTARY PARAGRAPH.\nThe defendants sent an agent, one Lewis Anderson, from Halifax to Guantanamo to look after their interests.\nHe left Halifax 7th December, 1881, and arrived at Guantanamo the 22nd of December, 1881. In respect to this matter certain correspondence took place between the parties thereto in reference to Anderson's mission, the owners claiming that they had abandoned the ship and had no further interest in her.\nThe plaintiffs had in the meantime sent the following telegrams to J. F. Whitney & Co., which were communicated by letter to Whittier.\nDecember, 1881.\nTo J. F. Whitney & Co., New York.\nWrite Whittier Saturday's mail. Abandoned to underwriters seventeenth of November. Pay crew to that date. Underwriters sending Anderson. On arrival give up charge to him. If Anderson wants your services or crew must employ you himself. Keep charge chronometer, have estimates in writing, make no drafts. Let Anderson pay all disbursements.\nBlack Bros. & Co.\nHalifax, December 9th, 1881.\nTo J. F. Whitney & Co, New York.\nAdd to Whitter's letter, if Anderson proposes to outfit vessel from material of \"valines\" raise no objection and be careful to express no opinion as to its quality or suitableness. Be careful in every way not to commit owners to anything Anderson does.\nBlack Bros. & Co.\nWhittier refused to repair, although requested so to do by Anderson, and informed Anderson he was going to give up charge to him. He and the crew left the vessel, and thenceforth ceased to have any connection with her.\nAnderson put a man in charge of the vessel. Materials for repairs were ordered from New York by defendants, and Anderson commenced repairing the ship, and paid off salvage claims and other expenses on the ship. He placed Captain Stevens and another crew on board at Guantanamo, and they took part in repairing. When the vessel was temporarily repaired, the cargo, consisting of 270 tons of logwood, was again taken on board The vessel in charge of Stevens and his crew left there 11th March, 1882, and arrived in New York the 2nd of April, 1882. Stevens went to J. F. Whitney & Co., and gave them the ship's papers to do the ship's business. Stevens and crew were paid by defendants. The vessel was repaired further in New York and tendered back, but after action brought.\nOn the argument of the special case the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, McDonald C. J. dissenting, directed that judgment be entered for the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed from this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nGraham Q. C. for the appellants.\nThe freight was not earned before this action was brought. Providence Washington Ins. Co. v. Corbett[2].\nShepherd v. Henderson[3] shows the distinction between actions before freight earned and actions after.\nThe fact of the underwriters having earned the freight will not prevent us from recovering. The very definition of insurance on freight is against such a contention, for we could not earn the freight ourselves so as to bring it within the cases in the House of Lords. Scottish American Ins Co. v. Turner[4], and Stewart v. Greenock Marine Ins. Co[5].\nSee also Sea Ins. Co. v. Hadden[6].\nHenry Q. C. for the respondents.\nThe rights of the underwriter cannot be defeated by the bringing of the action before the proper time. The underwriters undertook to repair, and if the vessel was worth repairing there was no constructive total loss.\nThere is no distinction between this case and the Scottish American Ins. Co. v. Turner[7], See Simpson v. Thomson[8].\nThe following cases also were cited: Keith v. Burrows[9]; Miller v. Woodfall[10].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014If the abandonment was justifiable and accepted, and there was therefore a constructive total loss of the vessel, was there not therefore at that moment a loss of freight to the owners for which they would then and there have had a right of action against the underwriters on freight? If so, how could that right be affected by anything the underwriters on the ship may do with the vessel after she became their property? The moment the total loss of the ship took place was there not necessarily, then and there, a loss of the freight, and does it make any difference as regards the insurance on freight, whether that total loss was actual or constructive? The ship was, in both cases, lost to the owners, and in both cases the freight was equally lost to the owners. To make a good constructive total loss the position of the ship must be such that a prudent owner would not repair; if then he did not repair the voyage would be lost and the freight not earned, and in establishing this state of matters the underwriters on the freight would, I presume, unquestionably be liable for the loss of the freight and this by reason of the ship being incapacitated from earning freight by the perils insured against. Does it not follow, so far as the owner is concerned, that the moment he was justified in abandoning the ship by reason of the perils of the seas, that moment he was entitled to recover for all loss which those perils occasioned, whether of vessel or freight; in other words, was not the freight, against the loss of which the insurers undertook to indemnify the insured, a loss to him by the perils insured against, and therefore should they not make their indemnification good? Before any freight had been earned, as in Benson v. Chapman[11] there was a damage so serious as to justify the owner in treating it as a total loss and abandoning the ship to the underwriters. By this total loss he lost his ship by the perils insured against, and by the same loss he lost his freight by reason of the same perils. The insurers of the ship indemnified him against the one, and I cannot understand why the insurers of the freight should not indemnify him against the other. The total loss of the ship carried with it the total loss of the freight. The damage, as between the insured and underwriters, amounted to a total loss and the freight was never earned by the ship. The moment this total loss took place the insured was prevented by the perils mentioned in the policy from performing the voyage insured, and when it was so prevented that the underwriter bound himself to indemnify the insured.\nI think Benson v. Chapman[12]; Stewart v. Greenock Marine Ins. Co[13]; Scottish Marine v. Turner[14] and Rankin v. Potter[15] conclusive of this case.\nIn Stewart v. The Greenock Marine Insurance Company[16] The Lord Chancellor says:\u2014\nIn Benson v. Chapman (1), the ship, soon after leaving the port of loading, sustained damage sufficient to entitle the owner to recover as for a total loss, but the captain had repairs done at an expense beyond what a prudent owner would have incurred, and he brought the cargo home, and the freight was earned, but the court held that the total loss of the ship carried with it the total loss of the freight. Chief Justice Tindal says:\u2014\"The assured has sustained a total loss of his freight, if he abandons the ship to the underwriters on ship, and is justified in so doing, for after such abandonment he has no longer the means of earning the freight, or the possibility of ever receiving it if earned, such freight going to the underwriters on ship.\" The damage amounting, as between the assured and the underwriters, to a total loss, the abandonment did not alter the relative rights of the parties, and the principle of that decision was that the plaintiff, the owner, was entitled to recover against the underwriters on freight as for a total loss of the freight, because the total loss of the ship carried with it the total loss of the freight, and though the freight was afterwards earned it did not belong to the owners, but to the underwriters on ship.\nIn The Scottish Marine Insurance Company of Glasgow v. Turner[17], we find the following:\nThe Lord Chancellor:\nIt was to this state of circumstances that Chief Justice Tindal referred in Chapman v. Benson[18], where he said:\u2014\"The assured has sustained a total loss of the freight if he abandons the ship to the underwriters on ship, and is justified in so doing, for after such abandonment he has no longer the means of earning the freight or the possibility of ever receiving it, if earned, such freight going to the underwriters on ship.\" But there the very learned Chief Justice had in contemplation what was then treated as a total loss and abandonment before the freight was earned.\nLord Truro[19]:\nTo determine whether there has been a loss of freight within the meaning of the policy on freight, we must consider what are the obligations which the underwriter takes upon himself by that policy. My noble and learned friend has, I think, stated them most correctly. I conceive that the underwriter on freight binds himself to indemnify the insured when prevented from performing the voyage insured by any of the perils mentioned in the policy.\nThe decision of the Court of Common Pleas in Benson v. Chapman proceeded upon the distinct ground that the voyage had been lost\u2014that is to say, that the ship had been reduced to such a state of damage by the perils insured against that she could not be put into a condition to perform the voyage without an outlay such as no uninsured prudent owner would incur; for the owner, in order to save the underwriters, would not be bound to do that, greatly to his injury, which he would not do if uninsured.\nThat judgment was indeed reversed in the Exchequer Chamber, and the reversal of the Exchequer Chamber was sustained by this House; but nobody uttered a word tending to impugn the correctness of the law which had been laid down in the Court of Common Pleas. The judgment was reversed because the Court of Error could not draw that conclusion of fact upon the special verdict which the Court of Common Pleas had drawn upon the special case; the law being perfectly unimpugned both in the Exchequer Chamber and in this House.\nI think, therefore, that in this case there was a total loss of freight in consequence of damage by sea perils being so great that the shipowner was not bound to repair the ship and that there was an actual total loss of the freight by the constructive total loss of the ship. Therefore I think the appeal in this case should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Dissented.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I agree with the Chief Justice that the appeal should be allowed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I think the plaintiff is entitled to recover. There was a total loss of freight within the meaning of the contract. The vessel was lost by the perils insured against and was placed in the situation that it would require more money to repair her than she was worth.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellants: Meagher, Drysdale & Newcombe.\nSolicitors for Respondents: Henry, Ritchie & Weston.\n[1] 6 Russ. & Geld. 323.\n[2] 9 Can.

The plaintiff Bell was assignee in insolvency of the firm of McDougal & Bro., who, prior to their insolvency, had assigned a quantity of timber to the defendant Fraser in trust to sell the same and, after paying all expenses, and retaining the amount of a claim he had against the insolvent, to pay over the proceeds to them. This timber, with other timber of Fraser\u2019s, was placed in the hands of one Knight, a broker, for sale, and it was sold and part of the proceeds paid over. Knight became insolvent and Bell brought an action for the balance due on the sale of the timber, claiming that Fraser was a trustee and was liable to account for money received by his agent.\nThe defendant, by his statement of defence, had pleaded, inter alia, that the plaintiff had discharged him from liability for the claim sued upon, and also this plea:\u2014\n\u201cIn case this honorable Court shall be of opinion that the defendant is still liable for the payment of the balance of the money mentioned in the next preceding paragraph, the defendant now brings into court ready to be given to the plaintiff the sum of $4,300, and states that the same is sufficient to pay in full all claims of the plaintiff in respect of the balance of the moneys received, &c.\u201d\nThe plaintiff took the money out of court and the case went to trial on the issues raised by the pleadings.\nAt the hearing the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed, but the learned judge refused to make an order for repayment to the defendant of the money taken out of court. The defendant appealed from this decision and the plaintiff appealed from the judgment dismissing his action. Both appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeals and both parties appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the appellant. The rule relating to payment into court in equity cases is very different from the same rule at common law. This case is analogous to a suit in equity where the fund is placed in court in medio to abide the event of the suit, See Lafone v. Smith[2]; Jones v. Macki[3].\nGormully for the respondent. This is an action under the Judicature Act and the facts of its being in the Chancery Division does not make it a suit in equity. As a matter of fact, it is an action for breach of agreement and sounds in damages.\nAs to the plaintiff\u2019s right to retain this money the authorities are very clear. See Berdan v. Greenwood[4]; Goutard v. Carr[5]; Hawkesley v. Bradshaw[6]; and Wheeler v. The United Telephone Co.[7]\nMcCarthy Q.C. in reply contended that none of the cases decided that a plea of payment into court could not be conditional.\nGormully for the appellant in the cross-appeal cited Speight v. Gaunt[8]; Massey v. Banner[9]; Wren v. Kirton[10]; Lewin on Trusts[11].\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the respondent referred to Re Brier[12]; Warner v Jacob[13].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014An examination of the pleadings shows that the plaintiff by his statement of claim sets forth five distinct clauses or causes of action, the second of which is the only one necessary, in the view I take of the case, to be considered.\nThat claim is in respect of the proceeds of a quantity of timber mentioned in one of the clauses of the agreement on which the first alleged claim is founded, which timber had been placed by the defendant in the hands of one Knight for sale. By the statement of defence different answers are pleaded to all the claims. As to the second, it is alleged that the defendant gave the plaintiff an order which he accepted upon Knight for the money due by him, that he received part of it from Knight, and agreed to look to him alone for the whole of it, and discharged the defendant from all liability for it.\nThe statement of defence as to this claim is as follows:\u2014\nIn case this honorable court should be of opinion that the defendant is still liable for the payment of the balance of the money mentioned in the next preceding paragraph, the defendant now brings into court ready to be given to the plaintiff the sum of $4,300, and states that the same is sufficient to pay in full all claims of the plaintiff in respect of the balance of the moneys received by the said A.F.A. Knight, mentioned in the seventh paragraph of this statement of defence, and of all interest thereon, and of all damages for non-payment thereof, or for omission to credit the same on the defendant\u2019s claim, pursuant to the deed set out in the seventh paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim.\nUnder this statement of defence the $4,300 was paid into court. The amount appears to have been made up by calculating the interest up to the time of payment into court. The plaintiff took it out after joining issue generally on the statement of defence. The action was taken down for trial, and the defendant having succeeded in disproving his liability as to all the causes of action, now asks that the money thus paid into court and paid over to the plaintiff may be ordered to be repaid to him.\nIt is not necessary, in my opinion, to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s bill should have been dismissed or not, as I think the plaintiff had a right to take the amount paid in out of court, which, on the argument, appeared to be really the only question in controversy. The authorities, viz: Berdan v. Greenwood[14], Goutard v. Carr[15], in which Berdan v. Greenwood was followed and approved; Hawkesley v. Bradshaw[16], in which Lord Bramwell took the same view of the law, and Wheeler v. The United Telephone Co.[17], which were relied on by the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Osler in the court below, are too clear and too much in point to be got over.\nI cannot think this money was paid in without any object to be attained and by which operation defendant would gain no advantage if defendants present contention is to be upheld (under the rules as they were then). As Mr. Justice Osler says:\u2014\nDifferent forms of expression are to be found in the cases such as \u201cwithout admitting any liability,\u201d Wheeler v. the United Telephone Company17. \u201cLest contrary to what the defendant believes and contends,\u201d Berdan v. Greenwood[18], Coghlan v. Morris[19], \u201cif by reason of any wrongful act the plaintiff has sustained damage,\u201d Goutard v. Carr15; but the prevailing fact is that money is paid into court under the pleading, and that the defendant is thereby enabled to avail himself of it as a defence in the action.\nI am, as he was, unable to see any substantial distinction between the expression here used, \u201cIn case the court should be of opinion that the defendant is still liable,\u201d and those found in the pleadings in the cases cited.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the money paid into court in this case is not to be considered as having been paid in under order 26. The action is one for an account and to such an action order 26 does not apply. Nicholls v. Evens[20].\nThe fund in court was, I consider, paid in, as accord- ing to the old chancery practice money was constantly paid in, by a trustee as the balance of a trust fund in his hands to be held in medio until the right to it was formally disposed of by the judgment. This practice has never been abolished, but is still in force. Here the defendant recognised the plaintiff\u2019s right to the fund, not absolutely but conditionally on the court determining that he had not been discharged from all liability in respect of moneys received by Knight by the effect of an order on Knight given to the respondent by the appellant, but in the event of this point being determined against the defendant, it appears to me very clear that the answer recognizes the plaintiff\u2019s title to the money in question The 7th, 8th and 9th paragraphs of the statement of defence, upon a fair and reasonable construction, appear to me to be conclusive against the appellant\u2019s contention. By paragraphs 7 and 8 the appellant raises the defence that he was discharged from all liability by reason of the order given by him in favor of the respondent on Knight. It is clear, however, upon the evidence that that order had not the effect of discharging the appellant from any liability he was under as trustee for the respondent in respect to the timber in question, or in respect of the proceeds derived from its sale. Such an exoneration of the appellant was expressly and carefully guarded against by the respondent\u2019s solicitor in taking the order; Mr. Gormully\u2019s letter of the 29th of November, addressed to the appellant, most distinctly stipulates that no waiver of liability such as that which the appellant pleads in the 7th paragraph of his statement of defence shall be implied from the acceptance of this order. Whether there was such a liability apart from any discharge appears to me a question which does not arise, inasmuch as upon a fair construction of paragraphs 8 and 9 there is an implied admission of liability for the money in Knights hands in the contingency of the order being held not to operate as a discharge. The word \u201cdischarge\u201d there used implies a pre-existing liability, as does also the expression \u201cstill liable.\u201d The manifest object of the pleader was, by paying this money into court, to induce the respondent to accept it in satisfaction and so avoid an account which might result in a much larger measure of liability than that which the appellant thus conceded. The evidence, however, shows conclusively that the appellant might, with due diligence, have obtained payment of this money from Knight, and I am not prepared to admit that Speight v. Gaunt has anything to do with this case. It recognizes a general rule as to the duties of trustees, but the application of that rule to the facts of the present case in no way relieves the appellant from his responsibility for the money which came into Knight\u2019s hands.\nTaken in conjunction with the circumstances actually existing, which, as I have said, show that the appellant was liable for money received by Knight, I read the 9th paragraph as an admission of this liability, and a submission that the money in court should be paid to the respondent in the event of the order on Knight not being held to be a discharge.\nI am of opinion that the judgments of the courts below should be varied in conformity with the foregoing opinion, by declaring the respondent entitled to the money paid into court, and by ordering the appellant to pay all the costs below as well those of the action in the Chancery Division as of the appeal and cross appeal.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeals should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I concur in the decision arrived at. I think the party here paid the money into court under a rule whereby plaintiff was entitled to take it out and keep it as a result of the proceedings in court. Under the old system of paying money into court a party could not deny liability, but here the party pays money in and, at the same time, denies his liability to pay it. So if the plaintiff has taken the money out of court I think that he has not done so wrongfully.\nI think, under all the circumstances, the respondent is entitled to the costs of all the courts because he could not say that he accepted this money in full satisfaction. He could not do so where a party pays in money and at the same time contests his right to pay it.\nI concur in the decision as to the main point of the case arrived at by the learned Chief Justice, and think the whole costs of the appeal should be allowed to the respondent.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The difficulty existing in this case appears to me to have arisen from sufficient attention not having been paid to the matters put in issue between the parties by their pleadings on the record. The plaintiff is assignee in insolvency of a firm of lumber merchants named J.L. McDougal & Bro, who became insolvent on or about the 18th day of October, 1877.\nThe plaintiff, as assignee of the said insolvents and by virtue of the proceedings in their insolvency, became the owner of an undivided half of certain timber berths or limits, subject to a certain charge thereon in favor of the defendant, and the defendant at the date of the said insolvency and thenceforward until the sale thereof continued to be absolute owner of the other undivided half of the said limits. In the month of March, 1882, the plaintiff, as such assignee, instituted this action against the defendant.\nIn his statement of claim he alleges several distinct causes of action, the first of which is stated in the 7th and 8th paragraphs which are in substance as follows:\n7th Paragraph. On the 29th July, 1881, the plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement in writing signed by them whereby, among other things, they agreed as follows:\u2014\n1. That the said limits should be offered for sale by public auction on or before the 1st day of November, 1881, in such parcels as the plaintiffs should deem best for the realization of the highest price, subject, however, to the proviso that if the said limits should be offered for sale in more parcels than one each parcel should be sold subject to a condition making void the sale of such parcels, unless the price realized by the sale of the whole of the said limits should reach in the aggregate the amount of one hundred thousand dollars.\nThat the defendant should receive the purchase money upon the trusts following, that is to say:\na. To pay himself one half of the total price received for the limits.\nb. Out of the other half to deduct the sum of $58,003. 08\/100 dollars, being the amounts of the claim properly provable by him against the estate of the said insolvents, after subtracting therefrom the amount received from the sale of the raft of timber mentioned in his claims filed against said estate with interest thereon from the 20th day of September, 1881.\nc. To pay the balance to the plaintiff as assignee of the said estate, and it was thereby further agreed that the account of the sales of the timber by A.F.A. Knight & Co. should be verified at the expense of the estate if required. That the balance of the timber in the hands of A.F.A. Knight & Co, belonging to the estate, as shown in the said account sales, is 48,030 feet 84-12 inches, and that on this the defendant had a lien for his claim aforesaid, and if this should be sold before the sale of the limits it was agreed that the amount realised therefrom should be deducted from the amount of the defendant\u2019s claim as aforesaid Mr. Knight\u2019s and other proper charges to be first deducted. That if the limits should not be sold at the sale thereof the creditors should have the option, to be exercised within twenty-one days thereafter, of paying the defendant the amount of his said claim, and should thereupon be entitled to a transfer of one undivided half of the said limits on payment of the usual transfer fees, and in default thereof that the defendant should be entitled to the security held by him as the amount of his claim. The above to be a complete settlement between the said defendant and the said estate, and the said defendant to have no further claim against the said estate or the said undivided half of said limits or timber belonging to said estate. 8th Paragraph alleges that\nThe said limits were sold in the manner provided by the said agreement and the defendant received the purchase money arising from such sale, but that although all conditions had been performed and fulfilled and all things had happened and all times elapsed necessary to entitle the plaintiff to be paid the balance due to him under the said agreement, yet that the defendant did not pay the whole of the said balance to the plaintiff, but paid only a part thereof contrary to the said agreement.\nThe above contained the first item or cause of action set out in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, and the amount, if any, which the plaintiff should recover in respect thereof would be the difference between the amount of the balance remaining of one half of the amount realised from the sale of the limits, after deducting therefrom the amount of the defendant\u2019s claim remaining unpaid, and the amount, which, as the statement of claim admits, had been paid by the defendant to the plaintiff arising from the sale of the limits.\nThe second item of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is stated in the 9th paragraph of his statement of claim, as follows:\u2014\n9th paragraph\u2014The plaintiff also says that although the balance of the timber mentioned in the additional clauses of the said agreement was sold before the sale of the said limits, the defendant did not deduct the amount realized thereupon from the amount of the defendant\u2019s claim against the said insolvent estate, as provided in the said agreement, but deducted the whole amount of his claim namely, the sum of $58,003.08 mentioned in the said agreement, from the proceeds of the sale of the said limits, and did not account to, or credit the plaintiff for, the proceeds of the said timber.\nThe amount claimed by the plaintiff under this second item of his claim is the amount realized from the sale of the 48,030 feet of timber mentioned in the agreement as the balance remaining unsold when the said agreement was entered into.\nThe third item of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is set out in the tenth paragraph of his statement of claim, in which\n10th paragraph the plaintiff sets out in full an indenture under seal, bearing date the 29th day of May, 1887, between the firm of J.L. McDougal & Brother of the first part and the defendant of the second part whereby the said firm did transfer to the defendant a quantity of timber upon trust to sell the same and out of the proceeds to pay: 1st. All costs, charges, expenses and customary dues; 2nd. All men\u2019s wages and expenses at the port of Quebec; 3. To pay certain drafts and bills of exchange accepted by the defendant for the accommodation of the said firm, and every renewal thereof; 4th. To retain and pay to himself, the defendant, divers other sums therein mentioned, 2\u00bd cents per cubic foot of the timber, commission, &c., &c.; 5th. To pay the balance, if any, to the said firm. And the plaintiff alleged that although the timber mentioned in the said agreement had been sold by the defendant, and that all conditions had been fulfilled, and that all things had happened and all times had elapsed to entitle the plaintiff to an account of the proceeds of the said timber, and to be paid the balance due to him on such account, yet, that the defendant has not accounted for nor paid to the plaintiff the proceeds of the said timber, and the defendant has improperly charged the plaintiff with large sums for expenses and has improperly made large deductions from the quantity of timber admitted to have been received by him for alleged loss in culling and waste in shipping and otherwise, and upon taking the accounts of the sales of the said timber between the plaintiff and the defendant the plaintiff is entitled to credit for divers large sums of money which he has not received and which have not been paid to him by the defendant.\nThe fourth item of the plaintiff\u2019s claim is stated as follows in the 11th paragraph of his statement of claim:\u2014\n11th paragraph The plaintiff as assignee of the said insolvent estate, and under and by and with the advice and consent of the creditors of the said insolvents, made an agreement with the defendant in the month of November, 1877, by which it was agreed that for and in consideration of certain commission then agreed to be paid and allowed to the defendant the defendant should take the timber then made and the timber and supplies then being on the limits of the insolvents, and should make all necessary advances and employ and pay workmen to make timber on the said limits for the remainder of the said season and for the benefit of and on account of the said estate and should raft and take the said timber to market, and should out of the proceeds of the sale of the said timber repay himself his said advances and commission agreed upon and should pay the balance to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff says that the defendant did make and take out the timber under the said agreement and has received the proceeds thereof, but although all conditions have been fulfilled and things happened and all times elapsed to entitle the plaintiff to be paid the balance due to him on account of the said raft, the defendant has not paid or accounted to him for the proceeds of the said raft.\nThe fifth and last item of the plaintiffs claim is set out as follows in the\n12th paragraph\u2014The defendant, in or about the month of November, 1877, took possession, and has ever since been in possession of a farm upon the limits of the said insolvents and has received and taken hay, oats and other produce of the said farm, and has sold the same and received large sums of money therefor for which he has not accounted to the plaintiff and which the plaintiff claims to be paid, and the plaintiff claimed: 1. Payment of the amount which should be found due by the defendant; 2. That all proper directions might be given and accounts taken and 3. Such further and other relief as the nature of the case might require.\nFrom the above statement of claim it is apparent that the first of the above causes of action is for a simple money demand for a balance claimed to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff upon the agreement of the former and in respect of moneys which had been received by the former to the use of the latter.\nThe defendant\u2019s statement of defence to this cause of action alleges that the whole balance of the moneys arising from the sale of the timber limits, after deducting the amount of defendant\u2019s claim by way of lien thereon, was $42,233.73 and that the defendant paid to the plaintiff $42,000.00 of that sum and retained the balance of $233.73 to pay a counter claim which he asserted that he had against the plaintiff for the conversion by the plaintiff, as assignee of the insolvent estate, to the use of that estate of certain property of the defendant, and he claimed by way of counter claim the right to retain the said sum in payment and satisfaction of the property so converted. To this defence the plaintiff simply joined issue and the matter there- by put in contestation was the truth of the matter alleged by way of defence. As to the sum of $12,238.73 being the balance in which alone the plaintiff was interested, that was admitted to be correct as was also the statement that the defendant had paid $42,000.00 thereof, so that the issue was in fact limited to the correctness of the defendant\u2019s counter claim which the learned judge who tried the case found for the defendant. Upon this issue, therefore, it is clear that the plaintiff\u2019s action should not have been dismissed, but that a verdict should have been found and judgment given for the defendant in terms affirming the establishment of his defence and his counter claim, for the defence admitted the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action to the amount of $233.73 unless he should establish his counter claim, and displaced the cause of action so admitted only by establishing his counter claim. He was, therefore, clearly entitled to judgment on that issue.\nNow, the second of the above causes of action which is set out in the 9th paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim is also a simple money demand for a balance claimed to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff upon the agreement of the former and in respect of monies alleged to have been received by the former to the use of the latter.\nThe defendant\u2019s statement of defence to this cause of action, in short substance, alleges that $8,470.02 was the amount of the proceeds of the sale of the 48,030 feet of timber in the agreement, set out in plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, stated to be the balance remaining in A.F.A. Knight\u2019s hands for sale, and that upon demand made by the plaintiff on the defendant for that sum the defendant gave the plaintiff an order upon the said Knight for that sum, and that the plaintiff accepted the order and applied to Knight for the same and received from him $4,500.00 on account of such sum of $8,470.02 and the plaintiff thereby agreed to look to said Knight for the payment of the balance of the said sum of $8,470.02 and discharged the defendant from the payment of the same but\nIn case this honorable court should be of opinion that the defendant is still liable for the payment of the said balance the defendant now brings into court, ready to be given to the plaintiff, the sum of $4,300 and states that the same is sufficient to pay in full all claims of the plaintiff in respect of the balance of the monies received by the said A.F.A. Knight and all interest thereon and of all damages for non-payment thereof or for omission to credit the same on the defendant\u2019s claim pursuant to the deed set out in the 7th paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim.\nThe only replication which the plaintiff makes to this statement of defence is joinder in issue.\nNow, it is to be observed that the defendant does not set up any defence of the nature that he never had been liable to the plaintiff, but that Knight alone was, in respect of the proceeds of the sale of the 48,030 feet of timber; on the contrary, the defendant admits his original liability and his omission, as alleged in plain tiff\u2019s statement of claim, to credit the amount on the defendant\u2019s claim pursuant to the deed in the statement of claim mentioned, and he professes to avoid this original liability and such his omission to credit the amount by alleging that the plaintiff had taken the draft on Knight for $8,470.02 and had taken part from him, and had agreed to look to him for the balance, and had discharged the defendant therefrom; but in case the defendant should fail to establish this discharge and the court should hold that the defendant\u2019s original liability still remains then he pays the $4,300.00 into court as sufficient to satisfy him for the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the timber, for all damages occasioned by defendant\u2019s omission to credit the same on his claim as he had agreed to do by the deed set out in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. Upon this defence I am of opinion that the plaintiff was, upon the authority of Goutard v. Carr[21] and of Wheeler v. United Telephone Co.[22], entitled to withdraw, as he did, the amount so paid into court, but whether he was or not, was in truth unimportant in the present case, for upon the issue raised by the plaintiff\u2019s joinder in issue to the defendant\u2019s defence to the cause of action all that was in issue was, in substance, whether or not the plaintiff had discharged the defendant, as alleged, from the original liability which, by his statement of defence, he admitted, and if not whether the amount paid into court was or not sufficient to pay everything demanded by the plaintiff in respect of the matters to satisfy which it had been paid in; and as the defendant had to abandon as incapable of proof his defence as to his having been discharged by the plaintiff as asserted in his statement of defence, he, by the express terms of that statement, admitted the plaintiff\u2019s absolute right to the $4,300.00 so paid into court. But as the plaintiff offered no evidence in support of the issue that the amount so paid into court was insufficient to pay for all damages and demands in respect of which it was paid in, the defendant was entitled to a verdict and judgment in his favor upon this part of this issue joined in respect of the cause of action to which this defence is pleaded.\nIn answer to the third cause of action, which is set out in the10th paragraph of plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, the defendant, in short substance, pleads by way of defence that the instrument sued upon in the 1st and 2nd causes of action, above set out, was executed to secure all claims and demands of every nature and kind whatsoever arising in respect of the deed in the 10th paragraph of plaintiff\u2019s statement which upon a full and complete account between the plaintiff and defendant were stated and settled and secured by the deed of the 29th July, 1881, set out in the 7th paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. To this statement of defence the plaintiff having simply joined issue the sole question was as to its truth, and the learned judge having found in favor of the defendant, upon this issue also defendant was entitled to judgment being entered in his favor thereon.\nIn answer to the 4th cause of action which is set out in the 11th paragraph of the plaintiffs statement of claim, the defendant\u2019 pleads by way of defence an account stated and settled between the plaintiff and defendant in respect of this cause of action, at which statement of account the defendant was found indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $1,912.00 which sum the defendant paid to the plaintiff and the plaintiff accepted in full satisfaction of all claims and demands whatsoever in respect of this part of his claim and as set out in the 11th paragraph of his statement of claim. On joinder in issue to this defence the defendant appears to have been entitled to judgment also in his favor. To the 5th and last cause of action as set out in the 12th paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, the defendant pleads that all the matters comprised in this cause of action were taken into consideration and included in the account stated and settled between plaintiff and defendant prior to the execution of the deed of the 29th July, 1881, and that the amount by that deed secured to be paid to the plaintiff was the balance found due to him upon the stating and settling of such account. Upon issue joined by the plaintiff to this plea also the learned judge has found the issue in favor of the defendant so that the defendant was entitled to judgment upon this issue also and upon the whole record, while the plaintiff was entitled to retain the money paid into court the defendant was entitled to judgment upon all of the above issues. The defen- dant, however, does not appeal against the judgment of the court below which, instead of giving judgment for the defendant on the above issues, has dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action; on the contrary he rests his appeal which is against so much of the judgment as refuses to order repayment to him of the money paid into court by him, upon the judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action. On the other hand, the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal seems to have been taken for the sole purpose of insisting upon his right to have recovered upon the issue joined on the second of the above causes of action in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim mentioned the sum which was paid into court, if it had not been paid in, and taken out by the plaintiff, but if he should succeed in resisting the defendant\u2019s appeal in respect of his claim to have the money so taken out of court repaid to him, the plaintiff admits that he can establish no further claim against the defendant. Substantial justice will therefore be obtained by dismissing both appeals with costs and leaving the judgment to remain as pronounced in the court below although it is not in the precise form which, upon the issues joined, that judgment should have assumed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Pinhey, Christie & Christie.\nSolicitors for respondent: Gormully & Sinclair.\n[1] 12 Ont App. R. 1.\n[2] 4 H. & N. 158.\n[3] L.R. 3 Ex. 1.\n[4] 3 Ex.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynee JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nPatents\u2014 Validity of prior patent\u2014Infringement\u2014Damages\u2014 what proper measures.\nIn 1877 L., a candle manufacturer, obtained a patent for new and useful improvements in candle making apparatus. In 1879 C., who was also engaged in the same trade, obtained a patent for a machine to make candles. L. claimed that C\u2019s patent was a fraudulent imitation of his patent and prayed that C. be condemned to pay him $13,200 as being the amount of profits alleged to have been realized by C. in making and selling candles with his patented machine, and also $10,000 exemplary damages.\nC. contended his patent was valid as a combination patent of old elements; that there could be no action for infringement of L's. patent until C's. patent was repealed by scire facias; and also that L's. patent was not a new invention. The Superior Court, on the evidence found that C's. patent was a fraudulent imitation of L's. patent, and granted an injunction and condemned . C. to pay L. $600 damages for the profits he had made on selling candles made by the patented machine. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side). At the trial there was evidence that there were other machines known and in use for making candles, but there was no evidence as to the cost of making candles with such machines, or what would have been a fair royalty to pay L. for the use of his patent. And it was proved also that L's. trade had been increasing. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada it was\u2014\nHeld, (affirming the judgment of the courts below), Henry J. dissenting, that C's. machine was a mere colorable imitation of L's., based upon the same principles, composed of the same elements and producing no results materially different; therefore L's. patent had been infringed, and there was no necessity in order to recover damages for infringement that C's. patent should first be set aside by stive facias.\nAlso (reversing the judgment of the court below) that in this case the profits made by the defendants were not a proper measure of damages; that the evidence furnished no means of accurately measuring the damages, but substantial justice would be done by awarding $100.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, for Lower Canada (appeal side) confirming the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the respondent.\nThe respondent (plaintiff below) obtained a patent for a machine which he styled \" Machine a fabriquer les cierges de Jean Baptiste Lasnier.\" The said patent was said, by the specification, to consist:\n10. ''In the combination of a basin or tub C, in which the wax is placed, suspended by its curved edge D, resting on the edge of the outside basin, so as to leave a space E, which being filled with water, melts the wax by steam and boiling water, said wax by such process preserves its fine color and is prevented from burning;\"\n20. I In the combination of a dipping plunger or frame H, with its bars or cross-pieces II, and the hooks JJ to which the wicks D are attached, and the strap or chain P, so as to dip the wicks K in the wax and withdraw them. Also, the combination of the weight A and the teeth B to counterbalance the weight, as well as the regulating pin d;\"\nThat after obtaining such patent the plaintiff put it in operation and manufactured candles with it which he sold.\nThe plaintiffs patent was obtained in 1877 and in 1879 the defendants also obtained a patent for new and useful improvements in candle manufacturing apparatus under the name of \" Collette & Ulric's Candle Apparatus.\" This patent was said to consist : 1st, in a candle making apparatus the combination of a boiler A, and pipes D and K, with tank C, melting vat E and frame L; 2nd in a candle manufacturing apparatus the combination of the dipping plunger Q having slides R, with the candle holder S, having dovetailed or \u221a shaped strips b, and hooks C with the frame L having slide rods 00 and cross beam P, with pulley A 3rd in the combination with a candle making apparatus having the dipping plunger Q. fitted with candle holder S of the rope or chain T, pullev A,and winch d.\"\nThe plaintiff alleged this last to be an infringement of the patent, and brought an action for damages and for an injunction. They claimed as damages the profit made by defendants in the manufacture and sale of the candles made by the last-mentioned patent process. The Superior Court allowed both the injunction and the damages, the latter on the basis claimed by the plaintiff, and the Court of Appeal confirmed the judgment.\nLacoste Q.C. for appellants :\nUntil appellant's patent has been set aside by scire facias the respondent cannot sue for an infringement of his patent. See 32 Vic oh. 26 sec. 46; art. 1085 C. P. C. (Foran's edition).\n[The Chief Justice\u2014under sec. 23 of the Patent Act if the respondent has a valid patent, he has a right against all the world.]\nOn the merits the counsel contended, first, that the Lasnier patent was a mere combination of old elements with no new results, and therefore he could not com plain of an infringement; citing Nougier Brev\u00eatsd 'lnvention ([1]): Crompton v. Belknap Mills ([2]); Curtis Law of Patents ([3]); and secondly, admitting that the Lasnier patent is valid, the measure of damages should be according to the difference in cost between the best known machine in use which could be got for manufacturing the tapers, and the cost of the new patented machine with a fair remuneration for the improvement.\nGeoffrion Q.C. for respondent contended, that as the appellants had not contested the validity of the respondent's patent the only question for the court to decide, was whether there had been an infringement. Commenting on the evidence he contended that the manufacture of tapers by appellant was an infringement of the Lasnier patent, and relied on the following authorities :\u2014\nBump on Patents ([4]); Higgin's Digest of patent cases citing Hill v. Thompson ([5]); Morgan v. Seaward ([6]) Heath v. Unwin ([7]); Russell v. Ledsam ([8]); Bateman v. Gray ([9]). Goodeve's patent cases citing Clark v. Adie ([10]). The same doctrine prevails in the United States. Curtis's Law of Patents ([11]).\nAs to amount of damages the learned counsel argued that respondent was entitled to all the profits he could have realized, or such an amount as might have been charged for a royalty equivalent to a reasonable profit on every pound manufactured by him.\nSir W. J. Ritchie CJ.\u2014I think the defendant has infringed plaintiff's patent; that the defendant's machine is substantially the same as plaintiff's; the alterations he has made are, in my opinion, only in reference to the construction of the machine. not a new machine or new combination. FOURNIER J. concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an action for an alleged infringement of a patent obtained by the respondent Lasnier, brought by him against the appellants.\nThe declaration recites the patent and charges the appellants with a breach of it. They pleaded thereto a number of pleas: one denying the infringement and others raising other issues, to which, in the view I take of the case, it is not necessary to refer; but there are two which raise issues important to be considered.\nBy the law which determines rights under patents of invention, the specification is deemed a part of the \"patent and the two instruments are to be construed together as one, and if it appears by the patent or specification that anything is claimed by the patentee as a part of his invention which is not new the grant of the privilege will be wholly void. This doctrine is so fully established that I consider it quite unnecessary to cite authorities for the proposition. The consideration given for a patent is a warranty that all is new which the applicant seeks to protect; otherwise a party by getting a patent would obtain protection at the public expense for an alleged invention which already was in public use. The consideration is entire and covers everything in the patent and specification, and if it fails as to one or more parts 01 the alleged invention, it fails for all, and the patent is therefore void. It is not voidable merely but ab initio void. If void, no action can be maintained for any infringement of it, even if the part of the invention to which the alleged infringement refers was new. My reason for stating this proposition will be apparent hereafter.\nBefore, however, referring to the issues which are affected by the terms of the proposition just stated, I think it proper to refer to one of the defences set up by the appellants, that is to say, that whereas they obtained, subsequently to the respondent's, a patent by which they were lawfully authorized to manufacture the same article as mentioned in the patent of the respondent, although by the same means as it describes, the subsequent patent authorized such to be done, so long as the same remained unrepeated. I cannot give effect to that contention. When the patent was issued to the respondent, he, if it were good in law, got by the operation of the statute the exclusive right and a second patent for the same object would be wholly unauthorized and contrary to the terms of the statute, and therefore void. It would be void also because the invention sought to be protected by the second patent could not be deemed new. The respondent sets out the subsequent patent of the appellants, in his declaration, and having done so his counsel raised the objection that I have just dealt with.\nWe have, therefore, to decide solely as to the patent of the respondent, and the question of the alleged in fringement. In the specification of the respondent he describes his invention, and after setting out and describing the mode of manufacture and the means of using the patented machine, he concludes in these words :\u2014\nJe ne r\u00e9clame pas comme invention le fourneau, ni les bassins, ef levier, courroi, ni los poulies ni les poteaux, non plus los poteaux a mortoise, ni le poids de contre balance ni les coulisses, etc., etc., car jc sais qu'ils no sont pas nouveaux, mais je r\u00e9clame comme invention: \u2014\n10. La combinaison du bassin ou cuve int\u00e9rieur C. dans laquelle est plac\u00e9e la cire, pendue parson bord recourb\u00e9 D. reposant sur le bord du bassin ext\u00e9rieur B. do manr\u00e9re a laisser un espace E. qui rempli d'eau, fait fondre ma cire par la vapeur et chaleur do l'eau en \u0152bullition, qui par ce moyen conserve ma cire dans sa belle couleur, ct l'emp\u00eache do br\u00fbler tel quo d\u00e9crits, et pour les fins indiqu\u00e9es.\n20.

An important issue is, therefore, raised, and if the defence is proved and the patent . nevertheless sustained what would the result be ? Clearly that the public could not use a combination which was public property, because the patent interposed to prevent the continued use of such public right. Such a conclusion could not however be reached. No person by obtaining a patent can interfere with public rights previously acquired. What was in the public domain could not be called new and was therefore unpatentable As I before stated the consideration for the patent in this case was entire and indivisible\u2014 founded on the warranty that everything claimed as new was really so and as there was but one consideration for the whole, a failure in part makes the whole patent void. The issue is squarely raised and must be decided according to the facts in evidence on the trial. Looking at the evidence as to that issue, it appears all one way and that is to sustain the defence. The evidence is sufficient to establish the position that every part of the machine with its several combinations was well known and used before the date of the patent, except the application of the lever to the pullies for raising and lowering the plunger. The combination of a furnace with the two boilers as before mentioned had been well known and used, but the respondent in his specification claims it as new. He admits that the basins were not new, but claims their combination. He claims the combination of the lever with the chains or bands by which the plunger is raised and lowered to be added to and form part of the whole combination with the boilers, furnace, and other parts mentioned. His claim however is not confined to the mere combination of the lever with the other part of the combined machine but if it had been so confined and the question properly raised by the defence as to its validity, it might be at least very doubtful if the mere addition of such a piece of well known and used mechanical agency would entitle the applicant for a patent to obtain protection for it. Levers have been universally known and used for all sorts of purposes and all kinds of machinery for centuries and the mere addition of it to other parts of the combined machine in question is such that it would be obvious as a mechanical means to an end to any person knowing the operation of the other parts of the machine and the use of the lever that there would be in regard to it little that could be properly termed invention. It would be, in my opinion, but the application of a well known and used mechanical power to a combined ma chine, the right to use which by the public could not be questioned. That issue is, however, not raised as the appellants have admitted the validity of the patent to that extent. Although making that admission they have pleaded a defence otherwise and have shown by evidence that is not only not contradicted but sustained, that, for the reasons I have before given, the patent is void. If so no action can be maintained for any infringement of it, The appellants are, therefore, in my opinion, entitled to have their appeal allowed and a judgment in their favor decreed with costs\nTaschereau J.\u2014 Lasnier, the respondent, in 1877 obtained a patent for new and useful improvements in candle making apparatus. In 1879 the appellants obtained a patent for the same object\u2014new and useful improvements in candle making apparatus.\nThe respondent now sues the appellants to annul their patent, and for damages resulting from the infringement by them of his own patent. He alleges by his declaration: 1. That he manufactured tapers with his machine after having obtained his patent and that he sold those tapers. 2. That, after having taken cognizance of his patent of invention, the appellants constructed their machine, which is an infringement of his patent. 3. That on the 20th February, 1879, the appellants obtained a patent. 4. That since the month of August, 1878, the appellants have manufactured by means of their machine, 600 lbs. of tapers a day, and that they have sold them. 5. That the appellants have realized with the aid of the machine, by economy in manufacturing and superiority of the article manufactured, a saving of five cents per pound, representing so much profit. 6. That the profit so realized by the appellants by means of their machine, amounts to $13,200 which the respondent has a right to claim as having been realized by the infringement of his own patent. 7. That the respondent, moreover, has a right to exemplary damages to the amount of $10,000.\nConclusions \u2011That the appellants be declared to have copied the Lasnier machine. That the appellants' patent be declared null as having been obtained in violation of the rights of the respondent. That the appellants be forbidden to make use of the Lasnier machine, and that they be condemned jointly and severally to pay respondent $23,000 for damages.\nThe appellants admitted the legality of the respondent's patent, but denied that they had infringed it in any way, or that their own patent was a copy or imitation of it, but that, on the contrary, their patent is a good and valid one. Such, is the issue between the parties. We have therefore, not to inquire into the validity of the respondent's patent. The only question submitted is as to the legality of the one issued to the appellants.\nThe two courts below have found against the appellants, and declared that their patent was a copy and a fraudulent imitation of the one owned by the respondent, prohibiting the appellants from further making use of their machine.\nThese judgments, in my opinion, are unassailable, and the appeal should, except as to the damages, of which I shall speak just now, be dismissed. I will not enter into a detailed comparison of the two machines. This would be hardly intelligible without the model, which we had before us at the. argument. The judgment appealed from finds that the appellants' machine is substantially the same as the respondent's, and entirety based on the same principles, and that the few changes or improvements it may contain are entirely unimportant and constitute mere mechanical equivalents, used for the same purpose and producing the same result. In this finding of fact I entirely concur. It being so, in fact, the appellants' case has no standing in law. That is so clear that authority is hardly required for it. They are collected in Bump's Law of Patents Nos. 197 202 205 and 207. In France the principle is the same.\nNow, as to the question of damages. It is settled law that though a Court of Appeal will not, as a general rule, entertain an appeal from an order of the court below assessing damages, yet, it will do so when it is shown that the court below has acted on a wrong principle in assessing the quantum of damages. Ball v. Ray ([12]); Bank of Upper Canada v. Bradshaw ([13]).\nIt is under this rule that the appellants here ask us to reverse that part of the judgment of the Court below condemning them to pay $600 damages for having infringed the respondent's patent, They allege that these damages were assessed upon a wrong principle. In my opinion, it is so, and the appeal as to these damagres should be allowed. By the declaration itself the respondent alleges no actual loss, or that he suffered any damage, but simply alleges that the appellants, by using the respondent's patent or their fraudulent imitation of it have realized a profit of $13,200 over and above the profits they would have or that might have been realized in making? candles without resorting to this machine, and he claims that he is entitled to this as the amount of damages that he has suffered; there is even no allegation that had the appellants not used this machine he would have made all the candles they made. And he could not have contended this because it is in evidence that there are various other modes of making candles and that if the appellants had not in the past made, and cannot in the future make candles with their machine there was and there is nothing to prevent them from so doing by the other various modes in existence, or even with the respondent's own machine, for he could not refuse to sell them one Now all the respondent claims, is the profits that the appellants made. And the judgment of the court below grants them nothing else. After enunciating that the respondent is entitled only to the damages he actually sustained, the court evidently taking it for granted that the damages he sustained consist in the profits made by the appellants, says :\u2014\nConsider ant que le demandeur a prouv\u00e9 quo par suite do la con trefacon ill\u00e9gale de son invention, les d\u00e9fendeurs ont du r\u00e9aliser dans la fabrication des cierges par eux vendus pendant la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coulee, du mois de September, 1878. au mois do November, 1879, une \u00e9conomie leur assurant un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de 5 centins par chaque livre do ci\u00e9rges, en outre des profits ordinaries, et qu'il est prouv\u00e9 que pendant cette p\u00e9riode de 14 mois, les d\u00e9fendeuss ont fabriqu\u00e9 et vendu au moins 12000 livers de cierges dominant un profit net de six cents piastres r\u00e9alise au money de l'invention du demandeur, et que celuici est en droit de r\u00e9clamer. \u00e2 titre de damages par lui \u00e9prouv\u00e9s, a raison des faits susdits, &c.\nNow, these same profits, as I have remarked, the appellants would have made if they had bought and worked one of the respondent's machines. It is in evidence that the appellants were engaged, long before the respondent obtained his patent, in the candle making business, and he made 5,000 or 6,000 pounds a year, It is also in evidence that the respondents business ever since the appellants made use of their machine, increased and keeps increasing. Miller who estimates respondent's damages at $25,000, and Esinhart who estimates them at $15000 base their estimation on the supposition that the respondent should be, with his patent, the only one to make candles in the country; they say so unequivocally. Arr\u00eat de Bourges, 28 Dec. 1869 in Dalloz ([14]).\nThere is no evidence in the record of the cost or value of the respondent's machine, or of what would be a fair royalty on it, so that it is impossible to assess the damages; my brother judges are disposed to grant $100 damages, I would not have given so much, but will agree, however, to this amount.\nAppeal dismissed with costs as to the infringement. Appeal allowed as to amount of damages with costs against appellants.\nGWYNEE J.\u2014Assuming the respondent's patent to be a good one, as upon the record it is admitted to be the machine for which the appellants have procured a patent also is a mere colorable imitation of the respondent's machine based upon precisely the same principles, composed of the same elements, and differing from it only in the arrangement of those elements and producing no results materially different, the judgment, therefore, of the court below should be maintained, except as to the amount of damages, which should be reduced as the evidence fails to furnish to us any means of accurately measuring the plaintiff's damages. How he himself contemplated making his profit does not appear. It is only when, from the peculiar circumstances of the case no other rule can be found that the defendants' profits become the criterion of the plaintiff's loss, and we have no evidence before us to enable us to determine what rule should govern in the present case. Whether the profit should consist in the value of a license to make and sell the patented improvement; or if it showed what is a fair estimate of the value of such license, the plaintiff has not, so far as appears in evidence, set any value himself on such a license. Moreover the estimate of the defendants' profits if that had been shown to be the proper rule applicable to the case, does not appear to have been made by a comparison of the profit obtainable by use of the plaintiff's improved machine in making tapers, with the latest precedent and best known mode of making them, but by a comparison between the use of the plaintiff's improvement and of a very old mode of making tapers, which had, as is said, been improved upon by other modes before the plaintiff obtained a patent for his improvement. I think that substantial justice will be done by reducing the damages to $100.00 and maintaining in other respects the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.

MacDonald (1886) 14 SCR 1\nDate: 1886-06-08\nCASES DETERMINED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA ON APPEAL FROM THE COURTS OF THE PROVINCES AND FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nThe Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the city of Saint John (Defendants)\nAppellants\nAnd\nRoderic MacDonald (Plaintiff)\nRespondent\n1886: May 4, 5; 1886: June 8.\nPresent\u2014Sir W. J. Ritchie C. J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry and Gwynne JJ.\nAPPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nNegligence\u2014Management of ferry\u2014Manner of mooring\u2014Contract to carry\u2014Ferry under control of corporation\u2014Liability of corporation for injury to passenger\u2014Contributory negligence.\nThe ticket issued to M a traveller by rail from Boston, Mass., to St. John, N. B., entitled him to cross the St. John harbour by ferry, and a coupon attached to the ticket was accepted in payment of his fare. The ferry was under the control and management of the corporation of St. John.\nHeld, that an action would lie against the corporation for injuries to M. caused by the negligence of the officers of the boat during the passage.\nThe approaches of the ferry to the wharf were guarded by a chain extending from side to side of the boat at a distance of about 1 1\/2 feet from the end. On approaching the wharf the man whose duty it was to moor the boat unloosed the chain at one side, and when near enough jumped on the floats to bring the mooring chain aboard. A number of the passengers rushed towards the floats, and M., seeing the chain down and thinking it safe to land, followed them and fell through a space between the boat and the wharf and was injured. When this happened the boat was not moored.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the corporation of the City were liable to M. for the injuries sustained by the negligent manner of mooring the boat, and that he was not guilty of such contributory negligence as would avoid that liability.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff or to order a new trial;\nThe plaintiff MacDonald purchased a ticket in Boston, Mass., for Cape Breton, intending to go by the St. John & Maine Ry. to St. John, N. B., and thence by the Intercolonial. On arriving at St. John he went on board the ferry to cross the harbour, his fare being paid by a coupon attached to his railway ticket. This ferry is the property of the city, and is managed by an officer of the corporation. The boats are open at both ends, and there is a protection for teams and passengers by means of a guard chain at each end, extending from side to side, at a distance of about a foot and a halt back. The trip by which the plaintiff passed was what is called the \"train trip,\" when the passengers from the United States cross over on the arrival of the train.\nOn approaching the opposite side one of the deck hands of the boat took down the guard chain and when near enough leaped from the boat to the floats in order to get the mooring chain and bring it on the boat. When the chain was taken down a number of the passengers rushed forward and jumped on the floats, and MacDonald, seeing no chain nor anything to intimate that it was not safe to land, followed them and fell down between the boat and the floats and was severely hurt. The boat had not then been moored.\nIn an action brought by MacDonald against the City it was contended that if any action would lie it would only be against the company in Boston who sold the ticket; or, if the defendants were liable, that the plaintiff had not exercised proper care and was himself guilty of such negligence that he could not recover. The declaration and the material portions of the evidence will be found in the report of the court below[2].\nCertain questions and answers were submitted to the jury, among which were the following:\u2014\n2. Q. Was it necessary to let down the guard chain in order to get hold of the mooring chain and to fasten the boat?\nA. It was not necessary.\n3. Q. Was the guard let down for the purpose of getting hold of the mooring chain, or was it left down as an invitation to the passengers that they might safely land?\nA. The guard chain appears to have been let down for the purpose of getting hold of the mooring chain but it is the opinion of the jury that it might be reasonably taken by the passengers to be an invitation that they might safely land.\n4. Q. Is the end of the floats so constructed as to receive the end of the boat without leaving a space between them dangerous to passengers to and fro?\nA. It is not.\nQ. Was the taking down the guard chain an intimation to passengers that they might land?\nA. It was. The plaintiff obtained a verdict for $3000, which was sustained by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on motion by the defendants for a new trial. The City then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBarker Q.C. for the appellants cited Alton v. Midland Railway Co[3].\nSkinner Q.C. for the respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think this action was clearly sustainable against the defendants. Mr. Justice Fraser in his exhaustive judgment makes this abundantly clear. The question of contributory negligence, it is admitted, was properly left to the jury, and was, in my opinion, most properly found against the defendants.\nThe sole question then to be determined is: Was there evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants to go to the jury? I think there was abundant evidence as Mr. Justice Fraser most conclusively demonstrates.\nThe matter, then, being one unquestionably within the province of the jury it is not possible to say that the jury, viewing the whole evidence reasonably, could not properly have found this verdict, nor can this verdict, in my opinion, be said to be unsatisfactory, still less unreasonable and unjust, and therefore I think the court below was quite right in not disturbing it, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs in this court and in the court below.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion, and was at the close of the argument, that the judgment of the court below was entirely right for the reasons assigned therein.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of dismissing the appeal. I think this case very like the case of G. T. R. Co. v. Boulanger[4] decided a short time ago from the Bench. HENRY J.\u2014I concur. I have no doubt that the evidence fully sustains the verdict in this case, and that negligence was sufficiently proved to enable the plaintiff to recover.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The declaration in this case is abundantly sufficient to sustain the present action whether it be regarded as framed in tort for injuries caused to the plaintiff by the negligence of the defendants in breach of a duty arising out of their having a grant of the exclusive right of ferriage and carriage by water of cattle, goods and passengers from one part of the City of St. John, across the river and harbor of St. John, to other parts thereof, or in tort for breach of duty arising out of a contract to carry the plaintiff for hire and reward. The evidence that the plaintiff was only admitted as a passenger upon the defendants' ferry boat upon his producing a through ticket for passage by rail and ferry from Boston to St. John, for which the plaintiff had paid at Boston, and from which the defendants' servants detached a coupon, justified the inference that the defendants had been paid or secured in payment of plaintiff's fare and that they accepted the coupon from the plaintiff in payment of his fare. But the declaration alleges that the plaintiff was lawfully on board the ferry boat as a passenger and that it was the duty of the defendants, as grantees of the ferry and carriers by water of cattle, goods and passengers across the ferry, so to manage their ferry boats, and to fasten them to the landing stage in such a manner, that it would not be dangerous for passengers to pass from the ferry boats to the landing stage, and that it was by breach of this duty that the plaintiff suffered the injury of which he complained, so that the declaration would be good without the allegation of the plaintiff being a passenger, \"for certain hire and \"reward paid to the defendant,\" and these words might be expunged from the declaration and the plaintiffs cause of action be sufficiently stated[5].\nThen as to the merits the learned counsel for the defendants admitted that the case was presented to the jury with a charge both upon the question whether the defendants were guilty of any negligence and whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, to which no objection was or could have been taken, and that the jury found for the plaintiff. But the contention is that besides submitting the case to the jury with such a charge the learned judge who tried the case submitted certain questions to the jury and that some of their answers are inconsistent with their verdict and others are against the evidence. As to the former\u2014to a question:\nWhether there was any unnecessary delay or negligence on the part of the boat hands in running the boat to the landing stage and so securing the boat to the landing stage as to allow passengers safely to pass from the boat to the landing stage?\nthe jury answer that:\n\u2014there appears to be no unnecessary negligence or delay on the part of the boat hands as far as the construction and appliances of the boat and landing stage would allow.\nWhat the jury meant by this answer appears, from the other answers, to have been that in the construction of and in the absence of proper appliances to fasten the boat safely there was negligence. They found that the guard chain was let down before the boat was fastened to the landing stage, and that although it was so let down for the purpose of getting hold of the mooring chain it was not necessary to be let down for that purpose and that the letting it down might reasonably have been taken by the passengers as an invitation for them to land and that it was an intimation to them that they might land safely\u2014They found also that the landing floats were so constructed that the end of the ferry boat on which the plaintiff was did not fit close in to the landing stage and that a space was left between them which was dangerous to passengers\u2014They found also that the gang plank which was put down before the boat was fastened was an intimation that the boat was secured.\nNow all these findings were expressly upon the points of negligence charged in the declaration, which in substance were that the defendants did not run the ferry boat, on the occasion under consideration, close up to the landing stage, and did not so secure and fasten the said ferry boat and keep the same so secured and fastened to the said landing stage, as not to be dangerous for the plaintiff to step from the boat on the landing stage, and that the landing stage and the end of the ferry boat were so negligently constructed that they would not closely and properly fit the one with the other. And by reason of a space having been left between the boat and landing stage, the plaintiff while carefully going on to the landing stage fell between it and the boat and was very seriously injured. It is impossible, in my opinion, to say that the jury's findings are not supported by the evidence, or that they are at all inconsistent with their verdict for the plaintiff.\nThe appeal, therefore, must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: I.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSale of land\u2014Building lots\u2014Plan showing lanes\u2014Alteration of plan\u2014Closing of lane.\nThe city of Toronto offered land for sale, according to a plan showing one block consisting of five lots each, about 200 feet in length running from east to west bounded north and south by a lane of the same length, and east by a lane running along the whole depth of the block and connecting the other two lanes. South of this block was a similar block of smaller lots, ten in number, running north and south 120 feet each. The lane at the east of the first block was a continuation, after crossing the long lane between the blocks, of lot No. 10 in the second block. The advertisement of sale stated that \u201clanes run in rear of the several lots.\u201d\nM. became the purchaser of the first block and C. of lot 10 in the second. Before registry of the plan M. applied to the City Council to have the lane at the east of his block closed up and included in his lease which was granted. C. then objected to taking a lease of his lot with the lane closed, but afterwards accepted a lease which described the land as leased according to plan 380 (the plan exhibited at the sale) and plan 352 (which showed the lane closed), and he brought an action against the city and M. to have the lane re-opened.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below that C., having accepted a lease after the lane was closed, in which reference was made to said plan 352, was bound by its terms and had no claim to a right of way over land thereby shown to be included in the lease to M. Held also, per Gwynne J., that under the contract evidenced by the advertisement and public sale C. acquired no right to the use of the lane afterwards closed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Ferguson J.[2] in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of this case are fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and McCarthy Q.C. for the appellant.\nIf a man offers to sell property with certain advantages specified he cannot, after the sale, take away those advantages. So here plaintiff bought according to description on plans which showed lane open, and vendors could not after the purchase close them.\nIn the cases referred to in the Court of Appeal the plans were simply exhibited in the auction room. Here the land was bought in pursuance of the plans and they are referred to in the agreement.\nThere can be no doubt that we would be entitled to specific performance of our agreement by having the lots with the lanes described in the plan.\nThen, we submit that the city of Toronto could do nothing to derogate from the rights of the plaintiff.\nThe mere registry of the plan did not in any way affect the position of the city. The plan showing the lanes open was made on account of our objection to the other.\nMacDonell had knowledge of all that was done and was trying to get an advantage outside of his contract.\nAs to construction of lease see Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims pp. 498-501. A deed, lease, or agreement, to which is annexed a plan of this kind gives an absolute right to the lane and the grantor cannot do anything to derogate from his own grant. The authority for this is conclusive on two grounds, one the actual authority of the contract between the parties, and the other that for a period of 25 years the courts have held that if you sell by a plan annexed to an agreement, you are just as much bound by the plan as by anything else in the agreement. Peacock v. Penson[3]; Rossin v. Walker[4]; Cheney v. Cameron[5]; O\u2019Brien v. Trenton[6]; Adams v. Loughman[7]; Re Morton and St. Thomas[8]; Grasett v. Carter[9]; Wallis v. Smith[10].\nThe cases upon which the Court of Appeal rested their judgment are:\u2014\nFeoffees of Heriots Hospital v. Gibson[11], which decides that the mere exhibition of a plan at time of sale does not amount to a warranty.\nNurse v. Ld. Seymour [12] where the circumstances were very different from this case. The M.R. says in that case \u201cyou cannot have specific performance of an agreement with a variation.\u201d\nRandall v. Hall[13] which was similar to the last.\nAnd Squire v. Campbell[14] where the plan was in no way referred to in the lease, and the decision was that a contract could not be inferred from the mere exhibition of a plan.\nThe intention of the parties must be gathered from the instrument coupled with the circumstances surrounding it at the time. Skull v. Glenister[15]\nThen if the plan becomes part of the contract we must treat the whole question as a matter of contract. North British Ry. Co. v. Tod [16].\nThe following authorities also were cited: Espley v. Wilkes [17]; Roberts v. Karr [18]; Carr v. L. & N.W. Ry. Co.[19]; Maddison v. Alderson[20].\nRobinson Q.C. and Moss Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe case resolves itself into two questions:\u2014\nFirst. What were the rights of the parties at the time the deed was made? and\nSecondly. What was the effect, upon those rights, of whatever may have taken place before that?\nThere is a preliminary matter as to the admissibility of evidence. A petition was put in, and we objected to its being admitted without the documents attached, which were referred to in the petition. His Lordship was entirely wrong in admitting it.\nThe appellant is entitled to a lane with his lot, but only to a lane abutting upon it not to that in the rear.\nFor distinction between streets and lanes see Rowe v. Sinclair[21]. See also Vestry St. Mary v. Barrett[22]; and Hesketh v. Atherton Local Board[23]; Re Morton and St. Thomas[24]; North British Ry. Co v. Tod[25]; Randall v. Hall [26].\nThere is no pretence that we made any representation; therefore there is no force in the argument that if there was no contract there was a representation. Nurse v. Ld. Seymour[27]; Feoffees Heriots Hospital v. Gibson[28]; Squire v. Campbell[29]; Leggott v. Barrett[30].\nMcCarthy Q.C. in reply cites Wigle v. Setterington[31]; Adams v. Loughman[32]; Fewster v. Turner[33]; Palmer v. Johnson[34].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This action is not for a specific performance of the plaintiff\u2019s contract with the city of Toronto. He claims:\u20141. That the defendants should be ordered to open up and maintain a lane in the rear of the lots fronting on Huron street, as shown in the plan by which said lots were sold, and as shown in the new plan registered as 380. 2. That the defendants may pay the plaintiff the law costs incurred by him, and also the rental and taxes upon the said lot which he had to pay to the said corporation; and 3. That the defendants may also pay the plaintiff the costs of this suit.\nI find it very difficult to say that under the contract of sale the plaintiff did not acquire a right to, or interest in, the lane shown by the plan in the rear of lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, in view of its immediate contiguity to lot 10 on which it practically abutted or bounded, and in connection therewith is what, to my mind, is the self-evident fact that such a lane would be a most material advantage to lot 10 and one which could not but be patent to all parties bidding at such sale. If I had to determine this question I should desire to give it further consideration before deciding it against the plaintiff. But inasmuch as the plaintiff has not chosen to rely on his executory contract, but has accepted in fulfilment thereof a lease from the corporation after it had leased lots 11 to 15 inclusive to MacDonell, including the land on which is the lane claimed, and the corporation having no right to dedicate any portion of the lots so leased to MacDonell in derogation of his title, and the plaintiff having taken the lease from the corporation with full knowledge of such lease to Macdonell and with express reference to the registered plan No. 352, which shows that lots 11 to 15 were leased to MacDonell including the space plaintiff now claims to have opened as a lane, I cannot see that he is in a position, assuming that under the terms of the sale the exhibition of the plan would give him a right, as against the corporation, to have had a lane as indicated on plan 380 opened, or to give him a claim for compensation in lieu thereof, or to give him any claim against MacDonell or the corporation to have the lane now opened, inasmuch as, in my opinion, plaintiff took the lease from the corporation in fulfilment of his contract for what it was worth, subject to MacDonell\u2019s right, which, by taking the lease as he did, he, in my opinion, clearly recognized.\nIf the plaintiff should be advised that he has any claim enforceable against the corporation as distinct from the defendant MacDonell, I should be disposed to reserve his right to proceed to make good such claim in a suit properly framed for that purpose. In the meantime I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs to the defendant MacDonell.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice and with his last observation. I think the act of the corporation was most unjust and would have sustained Carey\u2019s contention had he not taken a lease of the city property.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nHENRY J.\u2014I am of the same opinion. I would be very glad if I could have arrived at a different conclusion. The plan shows that the lot was bounded by a lane at one end, and that another lane would be opened right in front of the land purchased by the plaintiff. In the advertisement of the sale the land was bounded by a lane. I think the parties who sold were bound by the plan, and should make good any damage sustained by not opening the lane. But the purchaser knew that a plan had been filed showing the lane not open. He must have known that the title was out of the corporation and vested in MacDonell. The corporation could not convey to him. If he had not taken that other deed he could have enforced his claim against the city.\nI think, however, that under the circumstances the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of the opinion that the appellant is bound by the terms of his lease and that he is not entitled to any rights not conferred on him by the same.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The corporation of the city of Toronto being owners in fee of certain land, situate on St. George street, Bloor street, Spadina avenue, the south side of Cecil street, the east and west sides of Huron street and the north side of Baldwin street in the said city, caused the same to be subdivided into building lots for the purpose of offering them to competition for lease at public auction. The lots on the north side of Baldwin street were delineated on a plan as ten in number, numbering from 1 to 10, lot No. 1 being shewn to be 25 feet 6 inches in width, fronting on Baldwin street and extending in a northerly direction along the east side of Huron street 120 feet to a lane of 20 feet in width extending from Huron street to the easterly limit of the block, at the northeasterly angle of the said lot No. 10, which said lot No. 10, as also all the lots numbered from 1 to 10, were shewn to be 21 feet in width fronting on Baldwin street, by 120 feet in depth measuring northerly parallel with Huron street to the lane 20 feet in width laid out along the rear of all of the said lots fronting on Baldwin street. The lots on the south side of Cecil street were designated by the Nos. 16 to 25, lot No. 16 being situate on the eastern extremity of the block, and lots 16 to 24 both inclusive being shewn to be each 21 feet in width and lot 25, on the corner of Huron and Cecil street, 25 feet 6 inches in width fronting on Cecil street by 120 feet in depth measuring in a southerly direction parallel with Huron street to a lane 20 feet in width in rear of the said tier of lots numbering from 16 to 25 inclusive, so laid out as fronting on Cecil street, such lane extending from Huron street to the eastern extremity of the block and the space between the lanes so laid down as in rear of the said lots, fronting on Baldwin and Cecil streets respectively was laid out as five lots numbering from 11 to 15, the former being 21 feet 8 inches and the others 21 feet 9 inches each fronting on Huron street, by 194 feet 6 inches in depth on lines drawn in an easterly direction at right angles with Huron street to a lane, also 20 feet in width in rear of the said lots numbering from 11 to 15 inclusive. The object of laying out these lanes in rear of these several lots was to provide access, in the event of the lots being leased separately to different persons from the rear of each lot to the street upon which the lots respectively fronted, for the convenience of the persons becoming lessees of such respective lots. The corporation caused an advertisement of the contemplated auction sale to be published in the public papers and in posters distributed through the city, as follows:\u2014\nCity property for sale or lease by auction at noon on Wednesday, the 18tb day of May, 1881, at the auction rooms of F.W.

Further terms and particulars made known at time of sale. For further particulars apply at the City Hall where plans and diagrams of the several properties can be seen.\nJOHN IRWIN,\nChairman Committee on Property.\nCity Hall, April 20, 1881.\nIn the conditions of sale it was provided that all bids should be at a frontage rate per foot per annum upon the lots offered, as the same appear upon the plan or survey produced, each lot being subject to a reserved bid.\nAt the sale the defendant MacDonell was the highest bidder for, and as such became the purchaser of, the leasehold interest offered for sale in the lots 11 to 15 on the east side of Huron street; other persons became purchasers of all the other lots fronting upon Baldwin and Cecil streets respectively and numbering from 1 to 10 on Baldwin street and from 16 to 25 on Cecil street. The plaintiff being the highest bidder for lot No. 10, fronting on Baldwin street, signed his contract for that lot at the foot of the conditions of sale in the terms following:\nTORONTO, May 18th, 1881.\nI hereby agree to lease the property described in the plan hereto annexed and marked A as lot No. 10, on the north side of Baldwin street subject to the foregoing conditions of sale for the sum of one 30\/100 dollars per foot frontage per annum on Baldwin street.\nP.F. CAREY. The defendant MacDonell having become the purchaser of the lots 11 to 15 inclusive and having no occasion for a lane in rear of those lots, but considering that the keeping it open as a lane would be a nuisance to him and to the corporation, made application to the city authorities, before any plan of the several lots was registered, to have the space designed for a lane in rear of these lots thrown into the respective lots and to have a lease given to him of the lots as including within their area the lane in rear which had been designed for the purposes of affording access to those respective lots in the rear. This application appearing to be reasonable was concurred in and a plan was prepared under the direction of the city authorities showing no lane in rear of the lots numbering 11 to 15 on Huron street but shewing lanes 20 feet in width widening at their eastern extremity to twenty-five feet in rear of the lots fronting on Cecil and Baldwin streets, which plan, duly certified under the corporate seal and signed by the Mayor and City Treasurer as representing correctly the lots and lanes, they caused to be registered in the registry office of the city of Toronto on the 9th day of June, 1881, under the provisions of the revised statutes of Ontario in that behalf as plan No. 352. On the fourteenth of the same month of June the corporation duly executed, under their corporate seal and signed by the Mayor and Treasurer of the city, an indenture of lease whereby, in consideration of the rents, covenants and agreements therein reserved and contained, they demised and leased unto the defendant MacDonell, his executors, administrators and assigns, the said lots 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, according to the registered plan No. 352 habendum for the term of twenty-one years, to be computed from the first day of July, 1881. The purchasers at the auction held on the 18th of May of all the other lots fronting on Cecil street and Baldwin street, except the purchaser of lot No. 10 on Baldwin street, accepted leases for like terms of twenty-one years of the lots bid for by them respectively, in each of which leases their several lots were described as being according to the plan No. 352. The plaintiff does not appear to have applied for a lease of his lot No. 10 fronting on Baldwin street until early in the year 1882, and when he did he refused to take his lease according to said plan 352, insisting that by the terms of his contract of the 18th May, 1881, he had an interest in the lane as originally designed in rear of lots 11 to 15 on Huron street of which, as he contended, he could not be deprived, and that the corporation had no right to register the plan No. 852 not shewing such lane but shewing the said lots 11 to 15 leased to Mr. MacDonell to extend across the space as originally designed for a lane in rear of those lots.\nThe plaintiff having brought the matter under the consideration of a committee of the city council called the property committee, the defendant MacDonell presented a petition in the shape of a letter addressed to the Mayor and Aldermen of the city in council assembled remonstrating against any attempt to prejudice his rights. In this, his petition, he referred to three certificates of the authorities which he transmitted with, and made part of, his petition in support of his contention. One of these certificates was that of the city commissioner, another of the city treasurer, the third of the surveyors who had been employed by the city to subdivide the block of land into the building lots offered at auction in May, 1881, and who had certified the plan No. 352 as correct in accordance with the provisions of the registry act chapter one hundred and eleven of the revised statutes of Ontario, section 82, sub-section 2. These certificates were by the learned judge of first instance detached from the defendants petition, which was received in evidence without the accompanying certificates, but as the certificates were so referred to in the petition as to be made part thereof they should not, I think, have been separated from it but should have been received quantum valeant. That of the city commissioner is as follows:\u2014\nCITY COMMISSIONERS OFFICE,\nTORONTO, 21st February, 1882.\nI, Emerson Coatsworth, of the city of Toronto, City Commissioner, do hereby certify that I have examined the plan of sub-division of the block of land owned by the city lying on the east side of Huron street between Baldwin and Cecil streets, and state that I find the allowance for lanes in rear of the lots fronting on Baldwin and Cecil streets respectively, ample and sufficient for all purposes relating to the said lots, and I further state that the permission to the lessee of the lots on Huron street referred to to enclose the lane in rear thereof is undoubtedly in the interests of the city, as thereby preventing the facility for nuisances being deposited clandestinely and saving extra labor to this department in keeping same clean, and there being but one lessee of all the lots for which said lane is laid out it cannot prejudice any other person whomsoever to have it closed.\nE. COATSWORTH,\nComr. Works and Health.\nThe certificate of the City Treasurer who had also signed the plan, No. 352, for registration on behalf of the corporation is as follows:\u2014\nOFFICE OF THE CITY TREASURER,\nTORONTO, 23rd February, 1882.\nI, Samuel Bickerton Harman, of the city of Toronto, City Treasurer, certify that the plan for the sub division of the blocks of land belonging to the city lying east of Huron street between Baldwin and Cecil streets was prepared under my supervision for the purpose of laying off same into building lots with lanes in rear of the lots fronting on said streets respectively, such lanes being intended to be appurttenant respectively to the tier of lots lying between them and the streets on which such lots fronted. The lanes in rear of the tier of lots fronting on Baldwin and Cecil streets were made of sufficient width to serve every practicable purpose of lanes for those lots respectively, without regard to the lane between them in rear of the lots fronting on Huron street, which was intended for the latter named lots only. I fail to see how any one has any right or interest to interfere in a matter which seems to me to affect only the purchaser of the lots on Huron street.\nSAML, B. HARMAN,\nCity Treasurer. The certificate of the surveyors who laid out the lots for the corporation, is as follows:\u2014\nWe, Unwin & Sankey, formerly Wadsworth & Unwin, of the city of Toronto, Land Surveyors, hereby certify that the plan of sub-division of the block of land owned by the city of Toronto lying on the. east side of Huron street between Baldwin and Cecil streets prepared by us, shows the allowance for lanes in rear of the lots fronting on said streets respectively the lanes in rear of the lots on Baldwin and Cecil streets being wide and amply sufficient for all purposes relating to said lots. We further state that the lane originally proposed to extend along the rear of the lots fronting on Huron street was designed for the benefit of the lessees of those lots solely; and the lessees of lots fronting on Baldwin and Cecil streets could not be entitled to any right thereto practically j and the closing up the said lane can only be a matter of business between the city and the lessee of the lots on Huron street.\nUNWIN & SANKEY,\nProvincial Land Surveyors.\nToronto, 21st February, 1882.\nWhile these certificates cannot be looked to as affording any evidence in this action in favor of the defendants of the truth of the matters therein alleged they may, I think, as representations made to the corporation by their officers of the intention of those officers in doing on behalf of the corporation the acts therein referred to, be looked at as a matter before the corporation, and as part of the res gesta in respect of which the subsequent action of the corporation in relation to the subject matter was taken, and to throw some light upon such action if it should prove to be of doubtful construction; and the action taken, we find, to have been that they caused to be prepared for registration a new plan not corresponding with the one in existence at the time of the auction, but on which the space comprising the rear twenty feet of the lots 11 to 15 as leased to MacDonell, together with the angle cut off from lots 11 and 15, as shown on plan 352, is shown to be cut off with the words \u201clane to be opened\u201d thereon, and this plan is registered in the registry office of the city of Toronto with a certificate thereon under the corporation seal, and signed by the same mayor of the city as had signed plan 352 and by the same city treasurer, and the firm of surveyors who had prepared and signed that plan for registration, and had signed the above certificate laid before the council.\nWe certify that this plan represents correctly the manner in which we have dedicated and set apart the rear 20 feet of lots 11 to 15 inclusive for the purposes of a public lane.\nIt is to be observed that the lane here spoken of as \u201cto be opened\u201d is, in this certificate, spoken of as being at present part of lots 11 to 15. Upon this plan being registered the plaintiff on the same day that it was registered, namely, the 19th day of May, 1882, accepted a lease from the corporation executed under the corporate seal demising to him for 21 years \u201clot No. 10, on the north side of Baldwin street according to registered plans Nos. 352 and 380,\u201d and he has filed his statement of claim wherein after alleging the auction sale of May, 1881, and that at such sale, relying upon the plan and conditions of sale then produced he bid for and became the purchaser of lot No. 10 on the north side of Baldwin street.\nThat on the 19th day of May, 1882, the defendants, the said corporation, executed a lease to the plaintiff of the said lot number ten in which lease the said lot is described as being according to a plan of said property registered in the registry office of the city of Toronto numbered 380.\nThat the said plan numbered 380 is identical with the plan produced at the day of sale and according to which the plaintiff purchased the said lot.\nThat on the 14th day of June, 1881, the defendants, the said corporation, executed a lease to the defendant, Alexander MacDonell, and granted him lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.\nThat the said lots are described in the deed to the said Alexander MacDonell as extending over the said lane already described as being shewn on the map or plan between the said lots 11,12,13,14 and 15 and the property of the Hon. George Brown, and no mention is made in the said lease of the reservation of the said lane or of any right of way by virtue of the said lane, but the said lots were sold as designated on the said plan and the said Alexander MacDonell had notice of the said plan and of the contract of the defendants, the said corporation, to lease the said lot, number ten to the plaintiff according to the said plan. That the said Alexander MacDonell has caused the said lane lying in rear of the said lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 to be closed up. And the plaintiff alleges that he has done so with the approval and authority of the defendants, the said corporation.\nThat the plaintiff has applied both to the defendants and to the said Alexander Macdonell to have the said lane re-opened and the obstruction removed therefrom, in order that he, with the other lessees, might have the full, free and unrestricted use of the said lane, to which he and they are entitled by virtue of the said lease to enjoy.\nAnd the plaintiff claims that by virtue of the said conveyance to him he is entitled, as owner of the said lot, to have a right of way over the said lane lying in rear of the said lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, and to have the said lane kept open and unobstructed, in order that he might not be prevented or interrupted in the free use of the same. And the plaintiff prays that the defendants should be ordered to open up and maintain a lane in rear of the said lots fronting on Huron street, as shown on the plan by which the said lots were sold and as shown on the new plan registered as plan 380.\nThe plaintiffs claim is not for specific performance of his contract of the 18th May, 1881, and in virtue of that contract to be declared to be entitled to a perpetual right of way over the rear 20 feet of the land leased to MacDonell in June, 1881, as lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, on the east side of Huron street as and for a lane to be maintained in rear of what he insists to be the true lots of those numbers. It is only as not forming a part of lots 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 on the east side of Huron street, and as being in point of fact in rear of the true lots of those numbers, that the plaintiff could have asserted any claim whatever, if he ever had any to a right of way over the land in question. The plaintiffs claim, however, as asserted in his statement of claim is\u2014that having entered into a contract with the corporation to take a lease of a piece of property designated, on a plan exhibited to him at the time of the contract being entered into, as lot No. 10 on the north side of Baldwin street, and such contract having been specifically performed, as he alleges, by a lease dated the 19th May, 1882, executed to him by the corporation wherein, as he also alleges, the said property is described as said lot number ten according to a registered plan 380, which plan, as he further alleges, is identical with the plan produced when he entered into the contract, he is entitled to have a portion of lots 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 on the east side of Huron street, which were leased by the corporation to the defendant MacDonell in June, 1881, opened as a lane so as give to the plaintiff full, free, and unrestricted use thereof as a lane, to which he claims to be entitled in virtue of the lease executed to him on the 19th May, 1882.\nAt the trial the defendants called the three witnesses who gave the certificates above set forth to prove the matters of fact therein alleged to be in point of fact true, but an objection having been taken to such evidence the learned judge, by whom the case was tried, rejected it as inadmissable and he made a decree in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with the prayer of his statement of claim; thereby virtually holding that whatever may have been the intention of the corporation of the city of Toronto in laying out lanes in rear of the several lots as stated in the advertisement of the particulars of the several lots, the leasehold interest in which were intended to be offered for sale at auction, the plaintiff was entitled in virtue of his lease of the 19th May, 1882, as set out in his statement of claim to a right of way over the rear twenty feet of the lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 on the east side of Huron street leased to the defendant MacDonell in June, 1831. This judgment having been reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from the judgment of that court the plaintiff now appeals.\nAfter the execution by the corporation of their lease to MacDonell of June, 1881, in which the lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, are described as they are shown on registered plan 352, which shows them to extend to the utmost limit of the land owned by the corporation there, that is to say, to the distance of 214 feet 6 inches easterly from the eastern limit of Huron street, it was not competent for the corporation by any act of theirs to detract from their lease or to appropriate any part of the land so leased, so long as the interest granted by such lease should continue, to the purposes of a public or of a private lane. They could not by registering a plan declaring such intention, and exhibiting thereon a lane as \u201cto be opened\u201d and laid out on any part of the land so leased, defeat, or in any manner prejudice, their lease to MacDonell. The corporation must be taken to have known that they could not do so, but that they had no intention of presuming to attempt to do so appears, I think, as well from the plan 380 itself as from the lease to the plaintiff, which he accepted in fulfilment of his contract of May, 1881. Whatever may have been the idea of the parties who procured the registration of plan 380, that plan upon its face shows that all that was intended was a dedication in the future, and that although the time when the lane should be opened in pursuance of such dedication is not stated, it could not be during the continuance of the term created by the lease to MacDonell. That the plan was not intended to have been, if it could be, in prejudice of that lease or in derogation from the plan 352, which was the plan registered according to law upon which the boundaries of the lots leased to MacDonell were shown, appears from the certificate on the plan 380, whereby it is certified by the corporation authorities, that \u201cthis plan represents correctly the manner in which we have dedicated and set apart the rear twenty feet of lots 11 to 15 inclusive for the \u201cpurpose of a public lane.\u201d The land so said to be dedicated as a \u201clane to be opened\u201d is stated at the time of the registration of the plan 380, to be the rear 20 feet of lots 11 to 15,\u201d thereby affirming the plan 352 which showed it to be so. And yet it is only by establishing the land dedicated for the purposes of a lane never to have been part of lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 that the plaintiff could claim, or pretend to have, any right of way whatever in or over the same.\nThen the lease executed to the plaintiff on the 19th of May, 1882, and which he has accepted in fulfilment of his contract of May, 1881, and in virtue of which lease alone the plaintiff now rests his claim to the right of way, instead of describing the property leased, as alleged in the plaintiffs statement of claim, as being lot No. 10, on the north side of Baldwin street, according to registered plan No. 380, describes it as being lot No. 10, on the north side of Baldwin street according to registered plans numbers 352 and 380. Moreover the plan 380 instead of being, as alleged in plaintiffs statement of claim, indentical with the plan exhibited to the plaintiff at the time of his entering into the contract of May, 1881, adopts plainly the deviation from that plan in the width of the lane in rear of lot No. 10 on the north side of Baldwin street and in the rear of lot No. 16 on the south side of Cecil street, as the same is represented on the plan 352. So that it plainly appears that all the plans 352 and 380, taken together, shew, is that the piece of land which upon plan 380 has inscribed \u201clane to be opened,\u201d is part of lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, as shewn on plan 352, and which (as is part of the matter stated in the statement of claim,)was leased to MacDonell in June, 1881, and which could not be opened by the corporation so long as the term for which those lots were granted to MacDonell should continue; and it is in this state of facts that the plaintiff on the 19th May, 1882, accepted as in fulfilment of his contract of May, 1881, a lease for 21 years of lot No. 10 on the north side of Baldwin street, which lease, upon the basis on which the plaintiff rests his right to the way which he claims, must be held to be subject to the rights of the defendant Macdonell in the land leased to him as forming part of lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, and which these plans 352 and 380 conjointly and each separately represent to be parts of those lots. The plans represent them to be so, the lease refers to and recognizes the plans, and the plaintiff cannot, in virtue of the lease upon which he bases his claim, insist that the land over which he claims the right of way is not part of these lots, but on the contrary is in fact a piece of land in rear of and outside of those lots. The whole gist of the plaintiff\u2019s contention is, that in virtue of his contract of May, 1881, to lease the lot described on a plan said to be annexed to the contract as lot No. 10 on the north side of Baldwin street, he thereby contracted for and became entitled to a right of way over a piece of land shown on the same plan as a lane in rear of lots on the east side of Huron street; if that contention be well founded, a fortiori when he accepted a lease under said plan in fulfilment of his contract, he can only claim whatever that lease and the plans therein referred to give him, and as the lot No. 10 on the north side of Baldwin street is therein described as being the lot of that number and street, \u201caccording to registered plans 352 and 380\u201d his rights must be taken to be governed by plan 352 as well as by plan 380, or wholly by 352 if the corporation could not by registering plan 380 detract from their lease of lands particularly designated on the plan 352 as lots 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 on the east side of Huron street. The plaintiff can, therefore, have no right of way whatever in virtue of his lease of May, 1882, over land shown upon plan 852, (as indeed it also is by plan 380,) to be part of the above lots on the east side of Huron street leased to MacDonell in June, 1881; his claim, therefore, as asserted in his statement of his claim under that lease cannot be sustained. But I am of opinion that the plaintiffs contention as founded on his contract of May, 1881, assuming it to be yet unexecuted, is not well founded. That contract did not in terms give or profess to give to the plaintiff a right of way over the piece of ground in rear of the lots on Huron street, nor did it deprive the corporation of the right to throw that piece of ground into the lots on Huron street. All that the plaintiff contracted for was a lease of the piece of ground shown on the plan exhibited at the auction as lot No.10 on the north side of Baldwin street. That is to say, a lot as described in the advertisement of the particulars of the auction sale as being situate on the north side of Huron street, and east of Huron street and numbered ten having a frontage of 21 feet on Baldwin street and a depth of 120 feet to a lane, 20 feet in width extending along the rear of the several lots numbered from 10 to 1 inclusive on the north side Baldwin street to Huron street. The plan as referred to in the contract is not imported into it further than to show the boundaries of lot No. 10, and the access afforded to its rear from Huron street by the lane of twenty feet in width, which the particulars of sale stated to be in rear of the several lots to be offered at the auction. The plaintiffs contract gives him no interest whatever in the pieces of land originally designed to be lanes in rear of the lots 11 to 15 on Huron street, or in rear of lots 16 to 25, on Cecil street, nor any right to prevent the corporation from altering the dimensions of those lots by throwing the pieces designed as lanes in rear of them into lots; the language of Lord Cottenham in Squire v. Campbell,[35] and of Lords Cottenham and Campbell in the North British Railway Co. v. Tod[36] also reported in 10 Jur. 975, and of Sir J.L. Knightbruce in Randall v. Hall[37], and the other authorities referred to by Chief Justice Hagarty are conclusive on this point. As the present case, however is, not for specific performance of an unexecuted contract, but as the claim asserted by the plaintiff is based wholly on the terms of the lease which he has accepted as in fulfilment of his contract, it is sufficient to say that his lease confers upon him no such rights as he claims, and he has no right to interfere with the lease executed to the defendant MacDonell in June, 1881.\nThis appeal therefore must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Cameron, Caswell & St. John.\nSolicitors for respondent MacDonell: Moss, Falconbridge & Barwick.\nSolicitor for respondents, City of Toronto: W.G.

C. (P. Q.)\nThe Corporation of the County of Ottawa under the authority of a by law undertook to deliver to the Montreal, Ottawa and Western Railway Company for stock subscribed by them 2,000 debentures of the corporation of $100 each, payable twenty-five years from date and bearing six per cent. interest, and subsequently, without any valid cause or reason, refused and neglected to issue said debentures. In an action brought by the company against the corporation solely for damages for their neglect and refusal to issue said debentures,\u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the corporation, apart from its liability for the amount of the debentures and interest thereon, was liable under arts. 1065, 1073, 1840 and 1841, C. C. for damages for breach of the covenant. (Ritchie C.J. and Gwynne J. dissenting.)\nAPPEAL from the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side)[1], affirming the judgment of the the Superior Court[2].\nThe respondents were formerly styled the Montreal Northern Colonization Railway Co., and while so styled the corporation of the County of Ottawa passed a bylaw entitled, \"by-law to authorize the corporation of the County of Ottawa, in the Province of Quebec, to take stock in the capital stock of the Montreal Northern Colonization Co. to the extent of $200,000, and to pay the same in bonds or debentures, and to impose a yearly rate to pay interest and provide for a sinking fund.\"\nThis by-law was submitted, to the electors of the county and approved; and it was subsequently incorporated in the statute 36 Vic. ch. 49 of the Province of Quebec.\nThe Pr\u00e9fet du Conseil of the county duly subscribed for 20,000 shares in the stock of the said company of the par value of ten dollars per share, on certain conditions referred to at length in the judgments hereinafter given.\nThe Company commenced work on their road in the fall of 1873 and in March, 1875, had expended $300,000. They then demanded the debentures from the County of Ottawa, which the latter refused to deliver. The Company claimed that there was due from the appellants, at the time of the said demand, $112,096.70. This action was then brought, the respondent alleging that by the refusal of the Corporation to deliver the debentures according to agreement they had lost credit and were obliged to abandon work on their road. They claimed $500,000 damages. The defendants demurred to the declaration alleging as grounds of demurrer that the only legal claim that could be made was one for the issue of the debentures or their value in money and no claim for damage for injury to credit of Company could be sustained.\nThat plaintiff could only claim a specific sum and interest thereon, which they do not claim.\nThat if this action could be maintained defendants would still be liable for the amount of their obligation with interest thereon.\nThe defendants also pleaded a number of pleas, the principal being:\nThat the debentures were only to be issued on condition of the road being completed before December, 1875; and that plaintiff had declared that they could not do so, and defendants alleged that is was impossible for them to do so.\nThat plaintiffs were utterly insolvent and unable to meet their liabilities.\nThat they had not paid for the land over which their road was being built and had no title to the same.\nAnd several pleas alleging fraud on the part of the company in issuing bogus stock and colluding with contractors.\nThey also pleaded that they never consented to the substitution of the name of the present company and that their subscription was therefore void.\nThe Attorney General for Quebec intervened, claiming that the railway and the rights of the company had been transferred to the Government of Quebec by a conveyance executed November 2nd, 1875.\nThe intervention was contested and finally discontinued, but the appellants contend that the company have parted with all their interest in the contract to the government.\nThe demurrer was over ruled by the court of first instance, and the judgment of that court was sustained by the Court of Appeal\u2014Dorion and Cross JJ. dissenting.\nThe principal question to be decided was, whether any damages, except interest, can be recovered. The appellants relied on art. 1077 of the Civil Code, which reads as follows:\u2014\nThe damages resulting from delay in the payment of money, to which the debtor is liable, consist only of interest at the rate legally agreed upon by the parties, or, in the absence of such agreement, at the rate fixed by law.\nThe respondents contended that they were entitled to other damages than those resulting from the mere delay, which fall under the general rule, allowing the court to assess damages according to the loss really sustained.\nLaflamme Q.C. for appellants.\nDeBellefeuille for respondents.\nThe authorities and cases cited are referred to in the judgments hereinafter given and in the reports of the case in the courts below.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I have been unable to bring my mind to the conclusion at which my brothers have arrived. I think it right to express, but with great hesitancy, the doubts I entertain. If this case had been brought for the delivery of the debentures, the correct measure of damages in the case, it appears to me, would be to recover the debentures, or the amount of the debentures and interest. But, as I understand the judgment, this is not the nature of the action, no such claim being put forward. On the contrary, the claim is to recover damages, apart from the amount of the debentures and interest, for which, it is stated, an action has been brought and is pending.\nI am unable to discover anything in this case other than simple delay in not paying in the manner agreed on, for which the only claim I can conceive the plaintiffs would have against the defendants would be for the delivery of the debentures, or their value in money, and interest. This delay, the plaintiffs allege, caused the damage complained of, but such damages I think the article of the Civil Code of Lower Canada 1077 clearly declares shall consist only of interest. The agreement to take stock and pay for it by debentures, was no more than an agreement to take stock securing the payment of the money therefor by debentures, and therefore an obligation to pay money, which, in the words of the respondents factum, \"the corporation purely and simply refuse to pay,\" and to which, it seems to me, article 1077 applies. That article reads thus:\u2014\nThe damages resulting from delay in the payment of money to which the debtor is liable, consists only of interest, at the rate legally agreed upon by the parties, or, in the absence of such agreement, at the rate fixed by law. These damages are due without the creditor being obliged to prove any loss. They are due from the day of the default only, except in the cases where, by law, they are due from the nature of the obligation. This article does not affect the special rules applicable to bills of exchange and contracts of suretyship.\nThere does not appear to have been any interest due on the subscription of appellants, or on the debentures had they been issued at the time the action was instituted, in which, how ever, neither debentures nor interest were claimed. My mind inclines strongly with that of the learned Chief Justice of the court below, that the plaintiffs' action should be dismissed on the twofold ground, that the declaration discloses no right of action, and that the respondents have not proved that they had suffered any loss or damage for which the appellants could be held liable. Therefore I am inclined to think this appeal should be allowed, and the judgments of the courts below should be reversed.\nFOURNIER, J.\u2014L'action de l'Intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame de l'Appelante des dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution d'un contrat par lequel cette derni\u00e8re, d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 cet effet par un r\u00e8glement sp\u00e9cial, confirm\u00e9 par les \u00e9lecteurs du comt\u00e9 d'Ottawa, avait souscrit 20000, parts dans le capital de la compagnie de l'Intim\u00e9e. La souscription contenait les r\u00e9serves suivantes, entre autres:\nSubject however to such conditions as are appended to their signatures and not otherwise, and also subject to such allotment of the shares hereinafter subscribed for by them, as shall be made by the Board of Directors of the said Company.\nDate. Name. Residence. Occupation.\nDecember, 4th 1872 (Signed) Alexander Bourgeau, Aylmer, Gentleman. number of shares Total\ntwenty thousand; (20,000) $200,000\nWarden of the County of Ottawa and acting for the Corporation of the County of Ottawa, under and in virtue of the authority of the By-law No. 2, (two) authorizing the said Corporation to take stock in the Montreal Northern Colonization Railway Company, to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), passed the said By-law by the Municipal Council of the said County of Ottawa on the twelfth day of June one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two and approved of by a majority of the votes polled and registered in the manner provided by law, subject the said subscription to all the stipulations contained in the said By-law, a copy of which is annexed to this signature for the purpose of defining the nature and extent of the said stipulations.\n(A true extract from the subscription book).\nMontreal, 19th June 1875.\nCette souscription fut ensuite r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement accept\u00e9e par le bureau des directeurs de la compagnie avec les conditions et stipulations contenues dans le r\u00e8glement qui l'autorisait.\nD'apr\u00e8s ce r\u00e8glement l'Appelante devait remettre en acquit des 20,000 actions souscrites des bons ou d\u00e9bentures du comt\u00e9 au montant de $200,000 remboursables dans 25 ans. Cent cinquante mille piastres devaient \u00eatre \u00e9mis \u00e0 mesure que l'ouvrage avancerait, mais sans d\u00e9passer cependant la moiti\u00e9 du co\u00fbt des ouvrages faits dans le comt\u00e9 d'Ottawa, et la balance de ces d\u00e9bentures devait \u00eatre livr\u00e9e lorsque les travaux seraient termin\u00e9s.\nL'Intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tendant avoir ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 les conditions de la souscription et du r\u00e8glement, r\u00e9clama, le 19 janvier 1877, la somme de $112,096, de d\u00e9bentures pour moiti\u00e9 des ouvrages qu'elle avait faite dans le comt\u00e9 d'Ottawa. Le 19 juin suivant, l'Intim\u00e9e apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9alablement mis l'Appelante en demeure de lui livrer les d\u00e9bentures tel que convenu, porta sa pr\u00e9sente action pour dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, lui r\u00e9sultant du refus de l'Appelante de livrer les dites d\u00e9bentures. Ce refus, ainsi que l'all\u00e8gue l'Intim\u00e9e, l'aurait mis dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de compl\u00e9ter le chemin de fer, et expos\u00e9 par l\u00e0 \u00e0 la perte des $80,000 de d\u00e9bentures payables \u00e0 la terminaison des ouvrages du chemin de fer, et lui aurait aussi fait perdre les subsides consid\u00e9rables qu'elle avait droit d'avoir de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et du gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Elle all\u00e8gue aussi qu'elle avait droit \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis le 19 janvier 1875 sur le montant pour lequel les debentures auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9mises. Mais la conclusion qui demande $500,000 de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, caus\u00e9s par le refus en question, omet de demander l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur les d\u00e9bentures depuis le 19 janvier, bien que l'action contienne une all\u00e9gation \u00e0 cet effet.\nPar sa d\u00e9fense en droit \u00e0 cette action l'Appelante a plaid\u00e9 que l'Intim\u00e9e n'avait pas droit \u00e0 des dommages pour la perte de son cr\u00e9dit et le tort caus\u00e9 par la non-livraison des d\u00e9bentures; que le seul droit qu'il y avait \u00e9tait de demander l'\u00e9mission des d\u00e9bentures ou leur valeur en argent,\u2014que l'obligation de l'Appelante \u00e9tant pour une somme d'argent, la r\u00e9clamation de l'Intim\u00e9e devait se borner aux int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme, mais qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas demand\u00e9s par l'action, enfin que si l'Intim\u00e9e avait droit \u00e0 sa pr\u00e9sente action, l'Appelante n'en demeurerait pas moins oblig\u00e9e au paiement des d\u00e9bentures et de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Cette d\u00e9fense \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d'une exception au sujet de laquelle il ne s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve maintenant aucune question. La d\u00e9fense en droit fut renvoy\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et l'Appelante condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 $100, de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 en appel.\nLa question soulev\u00e9e sur cette contestation est de savoir si l'Intim\u00e9e ayant ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 les conditions auxquelles elle avait accept\u00e9 l'Appelante comme actionnaire, cette derni\u00e8re n'est point passible des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats autres que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gal en cons\u00e9quence de son refus de livrer an temps convenu les d\u00e9bentures promises. L'obligation contract\u00e9e par l'Appelante n'est pas l'obligation ordinaire de l'actionnaire qui a souscrit des parts conform\u00e9ment au statut organisant une compagnie de chemins de fer, et aux lois concernant les chemins de fer. L'\u00e9tendue et les cons\u00e9quences d'une telle obligation sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es d'une mani\u00e8re sp\u00e9ciale par ces lois qui devraient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l'Appelante, si elle n'\u00e9tait qu'un souscripteur ordinaire. Dans ce cas, il n'est pas douteux que l'obligation de l'Appelante serait limit\u00e9e au paiement d'une somme d'argent, par versements, tel qu'exig\u00e9 par la compagnie, et que le d\u00e9faut de paiement \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque fix\u00e9e entra\u00eenerait l'obligation de payer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat et emporterait m\u00eame la peine de confiscation, si le paiement n'\u00e9tait pas fait dans les deux mois apr\u00e8s que l'actionnaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en d\u00e9faut\u2014ces dispositions des lois de chemins de fer n'ont pas d'application au cas actuel. L'Appelante, par suite du contrat sp\u00e9cial qu'elle a fait n'aurait pu \u00eatre poursuivie pour le paiement de ses parts; aucune confiscation n'aurait pu \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e contre elle\u2014parce que, par leurs conventions les parties avaient d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 ces dispositions de la loi pour \u00e9tablir un autre moyen d'acquitter les parts souscrites. Le mode convenu consistait dans la livraison \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9e, par l'Appelante, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque fix\u00e9e, des bons ou d\u00e9bentures de cette derni\u00e8re pour la somme de \u00a7200,000, montant des parts souscrites. L'Appelante ne s'obligeait par l\u00e0 qu'\u00e0 livrer ses bons payables dans vingt-cinq ans et non pas \u00e0 payer de l'argent dans le pr\u00e9sent. Son obligation ne consistait qu'\u00e0 remettre et livrer ses d\u00e9bentur\u00e9s tel que convenu. C'est donc l'obligation de faire une certaine chose\u2014la livraison en question que la compagnie avait le droit d'exiger de l'Appelante et non le paiement d'une somme d'argent qui n'\u00e9tait exigible que dans vingt-cinq ans.\nL'intention \u00e9vidente des deux parties en adoptant ce mode d'acquitter les parts, \u00e9tait, sans doute, de mettre de suite la compagnie en \u00e9tat, par la r\u00e9alisation des d\u00e9bentures, d'ex\u00e9cuter ses travaux. Le refus de les livrer, privait la compagnie du moyen convenu pour se procurer des capitaux n\u00e9cessaires et compromettait in\u00e9vitablement le succ\u00e8s de l'entreprise commune. Dans ce cas, la compagnie avait une action pour contraindre l'Appelante \u00e0 faire la livraison des d\u00e9bentures, mais elle n'en avait pas pour exiger le paiement d'une somme d'argent avant l'expiration des 25 ans. Quelle doit \u00eatre la cons\u00e9quence de l'inex\u00e9cution d'une telle obligation? La r\u00e9ponse d\u00e9pend du caract\u00e8re que l'on attribue \u00e0 cette obligation; si c'est simplement une obligation de payer une certaine somme d'argent, nul doute que l'on doit alors faire application de l'article 1077, C. C., et que dans ce cas, les dommages ne peuvent pas d\u00e9passer l'int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gal. Mais si l'on consid\u00e8re que le v\u00e9ritable caract\u00e8re de l'obligation contract\u00e9e consistait uniquement \u00e0 faire, au temps convenu, la tradition des d\u00e9bentures promises, n'est-ce pas alors une de ces obligations dont l'inex\u00e9cution soumet la partie qui l'a contract\u00e9e aux cons\u00e9quences des articles 1065 et 1073 C. C.? Il me semble qu'il est clair que ce sont l\u00e0 les articles du Code Civil qui devraient, plut\u00f4t que l'art. 1077, \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s au cas actuel.\nBien que les opinions aient \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es dans la cour du Banc de la Reine, que la majorit\u00e9 de la cour ait adopt\u00e9 le principe que l'art. 1077 ne s'appliquait qu'aux int\u00e9r\u00eats moratoires et qu'il pouvait y avoir d'autres dommages pour le d\u00e9faut de paiement d'une somme d'argent, tandis que cette doctrine a \u00e9t\u00e9 combattue par la minorit\u00e9, tous les honorables juges ont cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que c'est le Code civil, et non les lois de chemins de fer qui doivent d\u00e9terminer les cons\u00e9quences de l'obligation en question. Sans entrer dans le m\u00e9rite des savantes dissertations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites de part et d'autres, je crois que du moment qu'il est admis que l'on doit chercher la solution dans le Code civil, la question, cesse de faire difficult\u00e9, car le Code contient des exceptions \u00e0 l'article 1077 qui sont d'une \u00e9vidente application \u00e0 cette cause.\nQuelle est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la position de l'Appelante vis-\u00e0-vis de l'Intim\u00e9e,\u2014n'est-ce pas celle d'un associ\u00e9, plut\u00f4t que d'un actionnaire ordinaire?\u2014Au lieu de prendre cette derni\u00e8re position qui ne l'aurait soumise qu'aux cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par les Statuts, elle a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de faire un contrat sp\u00e9cial qui n'est nullement affect\u00e9 par le Statut et qui doit n\u00e9cessairement tomber sous l'effet du Code civil. Par ce contrat elle s'est assur\u00e9e d'un mode plus avantageux pour elle que celui fix\u00e9 par le Statut, pour faire le paiement de sa mise dans le fonds social. Les v\u00e9ritables relations qui existent entre les parties \u00e9tant celles d'associ\u00e9s,\u2014c'est alors dans les articles du Code civil, concernant les obligations des associ\u00e9s entre eux que l'on doit chercher la solution de la question qui nous occupe. Si, comme je le crois,\u2014ils doivent s'appliquer \u00e0 la position particuli\u00e8re que se sont faite les parties en cette cause, il n'est plus douteux que l'Intim\u00e9e a droit en cons\u00e9quence du refus de livrer les debentures \u00e0 des dommages en outre de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, ainsi que le disent les articles 1840 et 1841. L'associ\u00e9 qui manque de verser dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 une somme qu'il a promis d'y apporter devient d\u00e9biteur des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur cette somme \u00e0 compter du jour qu'elle devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e.\nIl est \u00e9galement d\u00e9biteur des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur toutes les sommes prises dans la caisse de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour son profit particulier, \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 il les en a tir\u00e9es.\nART. 1841.\u2014\"Les dispositions contenues dans les deux articles qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent sont sans pr\u00e9judice au recours des autres associ\u00e9s pour dommages contre l'associ\u00e9 en d\u00e9faut, et pour obtenir la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant les r\u00e8gles \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au titre Des Obligations et dans l'article 1896.\" L'article 1846 du Code Napol\u00e9on correspondant aux articles 1840 et 1841 de notre Code contient les m\u00eames dispositions, et tous les commentateurs qui ont \u00e9crit sur cet article se sont accord\u00e9s sur son \u00e9vidente signification. Je me bornerai \u00e0 n'en citer que quelques-uns:\nLaurent[3].\nL'article 1846, (C. C. P. Q., articles 1840, 1841) contient une seconde d\u00e9rogation au droit commun. D'apr\u00e8s l'article 1153, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant du retard dans l'ex\u00e9cution d'une obligation ayant pour objet une somme d'argent ne consistent jamais que dans la condamnation aux int\u00e9r\u00eats fix\u00e9s par la loi. L'article 1846, apr\u00e8s avoir dit que l'associ\u00e9 doit les int\u00e9r\u00eats de plein droit, ajoute: \"Le tout sans pr\u00e9judice a de plus amples dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, s'il y a lieu.\" Cette exception r\u00e9sulte aussi de la nature du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9.

This is not an action brought to recover money; it is brought on the failure on the part of the defendants to perform a contract they had entered into. That contract was, that in consideration of certain work to be done on the road, they would give the company debentures to the extent of $200,000, as assistance to build the railway, and the county to take stock in the company to that extent, said debentures to be delivered in the proportions in which such work proceeded. Up to a certain time the work had proceeded, and, by the terms of the agreement, the company became entitled to receive a certain portion of these bonds. They were not furnished, and the matter remained over, nothing being done. This action was brought for the damage sustained in consequence of non-delivery of said bonds at the time and in the manner pointed out by the agreement. There was a failure then to comply with the terms of the agreement and the failure is admitted. But it is alleged that this company cannot recover damages in any case. If they were entitled to anything, it could only be in the shape of interest, and they are not entitled to interest because the bonds or debentures had never been delivered. That being the case, this cannot be an action for interest, and it is not an action, in my view, for the bonds themselves, or for the value of the bonds, but it is an action founded solely on the failure of the parties to deliver the bonds at the particular time in which they agreed to deliver them.\nThe question first arises: Can the parties succeed, under the code in force in the Province of Quebec, in an action for damages in a case of this kind? In the next place: What are the damages, and have they shown any in this action?\nUnder the articles referred to by my brother Fournier, viz., 1065, 1073, the obligations referred to there are the common obligations between men. But under the provisions of another chapter, title 11, under the head of partnership, we find there is a different provision, and one which does not apply to common business between one man and another.\nThe provision is in art. 1840 as to the liability for interest due by a partner who fails to pay a sum which he has agreed to pay the partnership. But there is another one following it, art. 1841, and it enacts that the provisions contained in the last two proceeding articles are without prejudice to the rights of partners to damages.\nIn the first place, I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that this is an action at all for the non-payment of money. It is an action for the non-delivery of bonds, and these bonds, when delivered, were to be placed on the market for what they were worth.\nBut the company say \"in consequence of your failure, other parties who intended to take stock have failed to do so, you having refused to carry out your agreement.\" The plaintiffs contend that they undertook the work and entered into engagements on the condition that these bonds were to be given, and that they have therefore sustained damages, and substantial damages, independent of the money altogether. I think there might, under the Quebec code, be a good cause of action independent of the question of time or of interest, and although they were not entitled to the amount of the bonds, I can see my way clear to say that they were entitled to damages.\nThere is another point, that when a party has suffered wrong, and is unable to prove the damages sustained by that wrong (as is the case here) the court should not dismiss his action, but give him reasonable damages. Here the plaintiffs did not prove the exact amount of their damages, yet as the defendants caused the loss which plaintiffs had incurred, it appears to me, that in a case of this kind the court, as a court and jury, are entitled to say that although plaintiff has not proved the amount, we will award him, under the circumstances, $100. Now as to the position taken by my brother Fournier, it is clearly laid down by Laurent[9], commenting on art. 1846, when dealing with the question of partnership, that besides interest the parties have the right to recover substantial damages, and he says that the article in the code referring to mere interest, has no effect whatever upon the defendants.\nI think, therefore, referring to the Civil Code of Quebec, and the code from which it is taken, and the decision of the court below, and the opinion of Laurent, that the respondents are entitled to have their judgment sustained.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is not an action for damages resulting from delay in the payment of money. The obligation of this municipality did not consist in the payment of money. It had not to pay any money on the capital till twenty-five years after the issue of the debentures. And the railway company had not the right to ask any cash payment on their shares All that it could ask were the debentures. But these debentures, the municipality did not hand over, as they were obliged to do under their covenant, though they were regularly put en demeure. Are they not responsible for the non-execution of their obligation? Arts. 1065-1073 C. C. To say that here the municipality's obligation was nothing but an obligation to pay money, and that consequently the only damages for non-execution of that obligation is the interest, would be, it seems to me, to concede that for 25 years they might refuse to issue these debentures, and that, during all that time, all that the railway company would have the right to claim would be the interest. Can it be so? Surely not.\nThis railway company were not capitalists who desired to invest $200,000 at 6 per cent. for 25 years. Not at all. They were a company who wanted $200,000 to build a railway, not in twenty-five years, but then and there, and as this municipality was not able to pay its $200,000 of shares in cash, it was agreed that it should give its debentures, or promissory notes as it Were, for the amount, said notes payable in 25 years. So that by negotiating these notes or these debentures either at par, at a discount, or at a premium, the railway compay might procure the funds required for the construction of the road.\nUpon the faith of that agreement, the railway company proceeded to build the railway, and when they demand the issue of the debentures according to the agreement, the municipality says: never mind we will pay you the interest during 25 years, and you must be satisfied. Is that the contract? Are the company to build the railway with the interest?\nThe appellants' contentions are untenable.\nThe interest specified was for the delay given to the municipality in the payment of the money. The damages asked are for the delay in the issue of the debentures, and do not fall under art. 1077 of the code.\nTo extend this article in the sense that the appellants ask the court to do so would lead to grave consequences.\nSuppose a man engaged in mercantile pursuits, having a note for $10,000 due to-morrow at the bank in Montreal, goes to the telegraph office in Ottawa, pays them $10,000, with commission, charges, &c., for the consideration of which the telegraph company covenant to pay his note by telegraph, through their Montreal office. Through the negligence or embezzlement of their officers, the note is not paid, it is protested, this man's financial standing is gone, the bank immediately calls upon him or his firm in Montreal for an assignment. He suffers heavy damages, it is clear. But, say the appellants, the telegraph company are not responsible for these damages, beyond the interest of the money, and if the day after to-morrow they pay his note or refund him his $10,000, all the damages they will have to pay him will be one day's interest, and with that he must rest satisfied.\nSo if a man, for instance, going to New York to make purchases, goes to the Express Company's offices here, and hands them over $10,000 to be transmitted to him at New York. This man arrives in New York but the Express Company fails or delays to pay him the money. He suffers damages, but, say the appellants, the company was responsible only for the amount of the interest of the money. If that were so it must be conceded that they might keep the money for years, and all they would have to pay would be the interest. Can that be so? Was it an investment that this man intended to make in the Express Company? So, in the present case, was it an investment of $200,000 payable in twenty-five years that this railway company intended to make? It could not be contended that in these two instances these companies would not be liable in damages. Yet their obligations were to pay money, nothing else. The present case is still clearer. Here, as I have said, no money was due, no money could be asked, there was consequently no delay in the payment of money, and the damages are not claimed for any such delay. The payment of the shares is to be in debentures. Art. 1139-1148 C. C. The municipality's obligation was to make, sign and deliver them to the company.\nAs to the point taken at the bar, on the part of the appellants, that the railway company's action does not lie because they have transferred all their rights to the Quebec government, it has not even been noticed in the judgments of the two courts below, though also raised there, and for very good reasons.\n1st. There is no issue on that point raised in the pleas to the action;\n2nd. It is exciper du droit d'autrui (jus tertii);\n3rd. The damages claimed were never assigned;\n4th. Had they been assigned, the assignee could have sued in the name of the assignor;\n5th. The Attorney General who had intervened in the case as assignee under the assignment referred to has withdraw his intervention;\n6th. This assignment took place since the institution of the present action.\nAs to there being another action pending, no proof, no plea, that there is an action pending for the debentures. Then, the demand for the debentures and the demand for damages could not have been joined in one action.\nAs to the amount of the damages, it is self-evident that they must have been very large, and they are proved to have been so. Only a small and nominal sum was given; owing, I presume, to the fact that the company has virtually ceased to exist, The amount was evidently not pressed, a verdict sufficient to carry costs only being required.\nThat the amount is too small does not lie in the defendants' mouth. There was sufficient evidence to justify the verdict. In the case of non-execution of a contract, says the Court of Appeal of Rouen, reversing the judgment of the original court, in Re Marie v. Grenet[10], if it is evident that the plaintiff must have suffered some damages, the court will not dismiss his claim altogether on the ground that it is difficult to precisely determine the extent of the loss he has suffered, or that he has not established any substantial basis upon which an amount may be arrived at, but, in such a case, the court will establish the amount according to the rules of equity. The court of first instance had dismissed the claim for damages on the ground that the plaintiff had not proved a clear pecuniary loss. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The appellants in pursuance of the terms of a by-law of the corporation of the County of Ottawa became subscribers for 200,000 shares of ten dollars each amounting to $200,000 of the capital stock of the Montreal, Ottawa and Western Railway upon and subject to the following conditions, namely: that the said subscription should be payable in debentures of the corporation of the county of the sum of one hundred dollars each payable in 25 years from date bearing interest at six per cent. per annum payable half yearly on the first days of January and July of every year, at the office of the Merchants Bank, Ottawa, such debentures to be accepted at par in payment of such subscription.\n2. That out of such subscription a sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars should be paid in monthly instalments as the work should progress so as, however, not to pay more than one half of the value of the work done within the limits of the county of Ottawa, or $3,000 per mile on the certificate of the engineer of the company which might be verified by an engineer selected by the corporation.\n3. That the said railway should be completed and put in operation on or before the first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five.\n4. That the bridges should be constructed with stone piers and that the rails, if of iron, should be of the weight of sixty pounds per yard and, if of steel, of forty-eight pounds per yard and that the road and its appurtenances should be built of materials equal in quality to those of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Railway.\nThe plaintiffs allege in their declaration that on the 19th January, 1875, they had fulfilled all conditions precedent necessary to be fulfilled to entitle them to receive from the defendants their debentures for the principal sum of $112,096.70 bearing interest from that date at six per centum, payable on the first days of July and January in each year in pursuance of the terms of their subscription agreement and the bylaw in that behalf and that upon that day the plaintiffs duly demanded of the defendants the delivery of the said debentures which they refused to give and so that upon the said 19th day of January, 1875, the defendants were put in default for non delivery of the debentures.\nNow, assuming all conditions to have been fulfilled, to have entitled the plaintiffs to receive the above amount of debentures from the defendants, the plaintiffs under article 1065 of the Civil Code had two remedies. They might have instituted a suit to enforce specific performance of the defendants obligation, by delivery of the debentures, or they might have instituted an action once for all to recover all damages consequential upon the breach of their obligation in not delivering them, but in such an action they must, as it appears to me, allege and prove all the damages which they are entitled to recover. They cannot split the one cause of action up into several actions, in one of which claiming damages for one loss alleged to have been sustained; in another, or others for other and different losses alleged to have been sustained, or profits of which they had been deprived; and in another claiming nominal damages only, shewing a breach of the obligation, but not alleging and proving any loss or deprivation of gain necessarily and directly consequential thereon.\nUnder the provisions of articles 1073-4 and 5 of the Civil Code, the damages recoverable for the non-execution of an obligation are the amount of such loss or deprivation of gain as, being the foreseen, necessary, immediate and direct consequences of the non-execution of the obligation of the defendants, the plaintiffs had sustained. That loss or deprivation of profit, in a case like the present, appears to me to be readily ascertainable, for the debentures which the plaintiffs should have received, upon the assumption of their having become entitled to receive them, being negotiable instruments for the payment of money at a future time and transferable by delivery had a money value, of a varying character, it is true, according as the credit of the corporation was good or bad, and as the demand for such securities in the market was great or small, but still they had an ascertainable money value, which money value constituted, in my opinion, the precise measure of the damages which the plaintiffs had sustained, and which they were entitled to recover for the non-delivery to them of the debentures in question assuming them to have been entitled to demand and receive them. The plaintiffs, however, instead of instituting an action in which they claimed such damages instituted an action, in which, after averring their right to receive the debentures, and the default of the defendants, they alleged that they had sustained the damages following, namely, the putting in peril the sum of $50,000 part of the $200,000 subscription, the debentures for which were issuable only on condition of the road being completed on the 1st day of December, 1875; the injury to the credit of the plaintiffs and the depriving them of considerable sums that the respondents would have had the right to receive, and would have got and received as well from the City of Montreal under and in virtue of by-law No. 59, Schedule A, of the Act 36 Vic. ch. 49, as from the government of Quebec from and out of the subsidy voted to the plaintiffs by and in virtue of the act of Quebec 37 Vic. ch. 2, and that besides these damages the plaintiffs had the right to claim from the appellants interest on the amount of the debentures due to the company upon and from the date of the protest and notification of the 19th January, 1875, which said damages and interest so composed amount, as the plaintiffs allege, to the sum of $500,000, wherefore the plaintiffs concludes by praying that the defendants be condemned to pay the plaintiff the said sum of $500,000 so made up with interest, expenses, &c.; the whole under the express reservation of the plaintiffs' right to demand and recover all damages to accrue subsequently to the date of the present action, namely, the 19th of June, 1875.\nNow, as to the putting in peril the sum of fifty thousand dollars, or as to the alleged loss of credit of the plaintiffs, or as to the alleged deprivation caused to them, by the non-delivery of the defendants debentures, of considerable sums accruing to them from the city of Montreal under the by-law of that corporation and from the Government of the Province of Quebec under the act of the Legislature of that Province, it is very clear, I think, that none of these apprehended or alleged losses can be recovered in this action as having any natural or necessary connection with, or as being directly or at all attributable to, the non-delivery by the defendants of their debentures. Such alleged losses cannot be held to be either the foreseen, or necessary, or natural, or immediate, or direct consequences of the non-delivery by the defendants of their debentures. None of these alleged losses, if at all suffered, can be said to have been suffered in respect of the particular thing which was the subject of the defendants obligation which was to deliver their debentures when earned, and no damages can be recovered in this action except such as necessarily and directly arise in respect of the particular thing which was the subject of the defendants' obligation and as are necessarily and directly consequential upon the non-performance of that obligation.\nThen as to the interest which is claimed on the amount of the debentures, which, as is alleged, should have been delivered to the plaintiffs on the 19th day of January, 1875, from that day until the commencement of this action on the 19th June, 1875, this interest accrues and becomes payable only under the terms of the defendants' subscription contract and the by-law in that behalf and can only be claimed in right of such contract, which contract is that the interest shall be payable half yearly on the first days of July and January, and as this action was commenced on the 19th day of June, 1875, before the day appointed for the accruing due of any of such interest, no interest in respect of that sum can be recovered in this action The learned judge of the Superior Court before whom this action was tried has awarded the plaintiffs one hundred dollars damages, but this amount, which is neither substantial nor nominal, is plainly not given in full satisfaction of all damage incident upon the non-execution of the defendant's obligation in respect of the particular breach of that obligation which is complained of; and no part of the amount so awarded can be attributed to or allowed upon any of the items of damage especially enumerated in the declaration, none of these items being necessarily and directly consequential upon the breach complained of. The one hundred dollars have been, in fact, arbitrarily awarded without reference to any allegation made or proof offered of any actionable loss or deprivation of profit sustained, and the plaintiffs' right of action, in respect of what they are entitled to recover, if they are entitled to recover anything, is left open and undisposed of by this action, and is, as was said in the argument before us, now the subject of another action. There has been no precedent cited, nor do I think there can be any, establishing a right in the plaintiffs to recover the $100 awarded to them in this action which can be recovered only as damages awarded in the absence of any actionable loss alleged and proved: and also the right to recover in another action substantial damages which, if entitled to recover anything, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in respect of the one breach of the same obligation. As judgment for the plaintiffs in the present action cannot be treated as a complete adjudication in respect of the breach of obligation which is the cause of action stated in the declaration; and as the substantial damages which are recoverable, if the plaintiffs are entitled to recover anything, are not sought to be recovered in the present action but are made the subject of another action; and as the losses which are specifically enumerated in respect of which indemnity is sought by this action are not actionable, or directly consequential upon the breach of obligation stated; the judgment of the Superior Court cannot, in my opinion, be sustained; this appeal therefore should be allowed with costs and the action in the court below dismissed with costs. With the greatest deference to my learned brother Fournier I am unable to concur in regarding the county of Ottawa; by reason of their being shareholders in the railway company, as partners with the company who can therefore sue the county for damages within article 1840 C. C. Nor if they can be so regarded does that, as it appears to me, get over the difficulty that the damages specially sought to be recovered are not recoverable, being altogether too remote, and, in fact, not consequential on the non-execution of the obligation declared upon nor, as it appears to me, is there any loss alleged and proved to support a judgment for the $100 given and what it has been given for it is impossible to say.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Laflamme, Laflamme & Richard.\nSolicitors for respondents: DeBellefeuille Bonin.\n[1] M.

J. and Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNavigation\u2014Interference with\u2014Public navigable waters\u2014Water lots\u2014Crown grants\u2014Easement\u2014Trespass.\nW. was the lessee, under lease from the City of Toronto, of certain water lots held by the said City under patent from the crown, granted in 1840, the lease to W. being given by authority of the said patent, and of certain public statutes respecting the construction of the Esplanade which formed the boundary of said water lots.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that such lease gave to W. a right to build as he chose upon the said lots, subject to any regulations which the City had power to impose, and in doing so to interfere with the right of the public to navigate the water.\nHeld also, that the said waters being navigable parts of the Bay of Toronto, no private easement by prescription could be acquired therein while they remained open for navigation.\nAppeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Queen's Bench Division[2] in favor of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are fully set out in the report in the Queen's Bench Division.\nThe action was for trespass by the defendants on a water lot of the plaintiffs in Toronto Harbor, the defence being that the defendants had acquired an easement by user, and that plaintiffs had no grant of the lot.\nThe jury gave a verdict with damages for the plaintiffs, and such verdict was sustained by the Queen's Bench Division, and by the Court of Appeal. From the judgment of the latter court the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nArnoldi for the appellants.\nWe claim a right to the use of the water lot of the respondents in connection with vessels lying at the wharf on two grounds:\u2014\nFirst that we have acquired such right by an uninterrupted enjoyment of it for over twenty years.\nAnd secondly, that these are public navigable waters over which we in Canada, with the rest of the public, have a right of navigation.\nAs to the first ground, the evidence is clear. It is impossible to regard the acts of Taylor as evincing anything except an intention to use the property under a claim of right.\nIt is claimed that interruption put an end to the possession. As to that see Ladyman v. Grave[3]; Flight v. Thomas[4]; Gale on Easements[5].\nThese cases show that interruption must be by act of a party who had a right to claim the land.\nAs to the second ground of our claim, it is contended that the respondents had a grant of the lot from the crown, and it is private and not public property.\nIt is submitted that the conveyance granting water and land thereunder, is no more than a grant of so much land covered with water. Coke upon Littleton[6]. So that the estate in the water would only be in accordance with the estate in the lands.\nStat. 23 Vic. ch. 22, sec. 35, only validates the Order in Council, and not the patent. Wilberforce on Statutory Law[7]. Interpretation act provides that no patent right shall be interfered with. Atty. Gen. v. Perry[8].\nThe crown can give no rights to a party which would interfere with the public navigation of the harbor, and the grant was made subject to the public easements. Wharves could not be built to the water side as the sea is too heavy, and that no doubt was contemplated in making the grant. Orr Ewing v. Colquhoun[9]. I submit too, that there should be a new trial on the ground of improper rejection of evidence and excessive damages.\nRobinson Q.C. and Galt for respondents.\nAccording to the contention of the appellants, we must practically abandon the use of our property.\nThe two arguments on the other side do not agree. If these are public navigable waters, anybody could go upon and over them, and they cannot claim any special right in regard to them. But under the prescription acts it must be property over which the party claiming title by user had no right to go.\nThen are they public navigable waters? See Hood v. Toronto Commrs.[10]; Dyce v. Lady James Hay[11]\u2014referred to in Gale on easements; Sowerby v. Coleman[12]; Att. Gen. v. Chambers[13]. To make an easement there must be a dominant and servient tenement which is not the case here. Shuttleworth v. Le Fleming[14].\nIf there is any doubt about the grant to us, it is set at rest by 23 Vic. ch. 32 sec. 35. See Dixson v. Snetsinger[15].\nThe use of our property was interfered with for nearly a year, so that the damages are by no means excessive.\nThe following additional authorities were referred to:\u2014Bright v. Walker[16]; Livett v. Wilson[17]; Mitchell v. Parks[18].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In this case the judge directed the jury that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover because of the statute under which the Government has the power to make grants of water lots, and there is a patent from the crown granting the lots to the City of Toronto, and the City of Toronto granted the lots in controversy to Mr. Munson, and Mr. Munson leased it to the plaintiffs, and also because the defendants were guilty of a positive illegal act when they fastened their two boats to the side of their wharf, it having been admitted by Mr. Hamilton that they to a certain extent encroached on plaintiffs' lot. The learned judge then said:\u2014\nIf the plaintiffs owned the lots, which I believe they did, the defendants were guilty of a positive trespass, because the use made by those two boats was neither for the purpose of trade nor navigation, but for the purpose of preventing the plaintiffs using their own property. Do not trouble yourself about the law, because my opinion is that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. I shall ask you three questions.\nQ. Did the defendants and those under whom they claimed exercise the approach over the plaintiffs' land under a claim of right? A. No.\nQ. Did the defendants encroach on plaintiffs' property when the two vessels were fastened to the defendants' wharf? A. Yes. Q. Was the proposed erection made by the plaintiffs in a reasonable and proper use of their property? A. Yes.\nThe jury negatived the suppose easement claimed by the defendants. The Divisional Court sustained such finding, and the Court of Appeal found it impossible to say that the jury had erred. No good reason has been assigned in this court to justify our interference, for without the establishment of such an easement, and an interference therewith, it is clear defendants cannot succeed.\nThe combined effect of the crown grant and the subsequent legislation clearly gives a right to interfere with the navigation by building on or filling up the lots so granted. Until built on or filled up the public no doubt had the right to use the open waters for purposes of trade and navigation, and therefore it cannot be that such a user by any one individual would give him a prescriptive right against the owners, because it would not be a wrongful act against the owners.\nIn this case the lying of the vessels by defendants at their wharf was avowedly for the purpose of preventing plaintiffs using their property, defendants having built on their own property, and having as Chief Justice Wilson expresses it:\u2014\nTurned their own lot to its full advantage, they claim now they cannot get the benefit of it, unless they are allowed to use part of plaintiffs' lot, which claim the plaintiffs resist.\nHe adds:\u2014\nThe verdict should strictly have been against the defendants in any event, according to the evidence, because they were making claim to the waters of the plaintiffs for the purpose of trade and commerce; but it was not for the purpose of trade and commerce that the defendants anchored the vessels \"Annie Craig\" and \"Lillian\" in the plaintiffs water. The general question of right was no doubt the principal question; but it was a little strange for the defendant to declaim against the plaintiffs for using their own waters not for the purpose of trade and commerce, in driving the piles for the support of the boat house they proposed to build upon them, while the defendants were blockading the plaintiffs in their own waters.\nThe verdict should be against the defendants upon all the issues, and against them upon their counter claim as well. It is a claim of a very unreasonable kind which is made by the defendants. It is that they are entitled to use all their own waters and erections as they please, and that they are at liberty to use all the plaintiffs' land and water too, without interference or question by the plaintiffs' because they find it convenient for the purposes of their wharf, elevator and warehouse, although they thereby render the plaintiffs' property practically useless to them, or greatly reduce it in value, and that the plaintiffs must suffer that loss for the aggrandizement of the defendants, who never paid a farthing for the benefits and advantages which they claim.\nAnd as Burton J. says:\u2014\nBut assuming the right now claimed to have been established, upon the clearest evidence and upon a charge which was perfectly unexceptionable, I fail to see any evidence that the acts which are now complained of were done in the exercise of that right. The vessels were not crossing the plaintiffs lot in the exercise of the right claimed, but were deliberately moored and fastened to the wharves, and were encumbering the plaintiffs' lot. They were not there for the purpose of trade and commerce, but the defendants were taking the law into their own hands and adopted this rather high handed and arbitrary mode of doing so. This is the view taken of it by the jury, and they have, I think, not unreasonably, marked their sense of such a mode of proceeding by giving substantial damages.\nI can see no reasonable ground for our interfering as an Appellate Court, with the decision of the court below, and am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI see still less reason why this court should do it.\nFOURNIER, HENRY and TASCHEREAU JJ.\u2014Concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The position taken by 'the defendants by way of defence to this action is utterly untenable. The defendants, the Loan Company, are owners in fee and the other defendants are in possession under them, of a piece of land covered with water, known as the east half of a certain water lot called water lot No. 17, situate on the south side of the Esplanade in the City of Toronto, by title derived from one Greorge Munro deceased, and the plaintiffs are tenants of the west half of the same water lot under J. M. Warin who is the devisee thereof in fee under the will of the said Greorge Munro; the southerly limit of this water lot, that is its limit on the water side, is a line drawn across the Bay of Toronto from a point near the site of the French Fort west of Toronto Grarrison to Groderhams mills, as described in letters patent under the great seal of the late Province of Upper Canada, granted in the year 1840, which letters patent and the title to the lands covered with water thereby granted, including this water lot No. 17, were confirmed by two acts of parliament of the late Province of Canada, namely, 16 Vic. ch 289 and 23 Vic. ch. 2 sec. 35.\nNow, to an action of trespass brought by the plaintiffs against the defendants for forcibly and wrongfully entering upon the plaintiffs' half of the said water lot, and breaking down certain fences of the plaintiffs thereon, and with vessels trespassing on the same, and forcibly preventing the plaintiffs from filling up the said water lot and enjoying the same, the defendants plead that at the time of the alleged trespasses complained of the defendants Hamilton were in possession of the said east half of the said water lot No. 17, under a contract for the purchase of the same made with the defendants, the company, who were the owners thereof in fee simple, and that the occupiers of the said east half of the said water lot for 20 years before this suit enjoyed as of right, without interruption, for the more convenient use, occupation and enjoyment of the said land of the defendants, a way for, in, and with, ships, vessels, schooners, tugs, and boats, from a public highway on the waters of the bay in front of the City of Toronto over the said land in the statement of claim claimed by the plaintiffs to the said water lot of the defendants, and from the said last mentioned water lot over the said land so claimed by the plaintiffs to the said public highway at all times of the year, together with the right to anchor all such ships, vessels, schooners, tugs and boats, and allow them to remain upon the lands so claimed by the plaintiffs during the time navigation is closed in each year, and also at other times for shelter or repairs or other cause of detention, as well as for the purpose of loading and unloading at all times of the year; and the plaintiffs on the occasion of the trespasses alleged in their statement of claim, and at other times, drove piles in the land claimed by the plaintiffs, and in that way and by other means and devices interfered with and obstructed the defendants in the use and enjoyment of the said way and the said rights, and the plaintiffs threaten, and intend to, and they will unless restrained from so doing, continue to interfere with and obstruct the defendants in the use and enjoyment of the said way and rights. What, in effect, the defendants assert by this plea is, that as appurtenant to the east half of this water lot No. 17, and the erections thereon, the defendants have acquired by prescription a perpetual easement and right of way from the waters of the bay in front of the City of Toronto, lying outside of the line known as the windmill line, across those waters of the bay, inside of that line, which cover the west half of the said water lot No. 17 to a wharf erected in the waters of the same bay situate on the east half of the same water lot, and have so made the west half of the said water lot No. 17 and the waters of the bay which cover it servient to the east half of the same water lot, but if the waters covering the west half of the said water lot be, as they in evidence appear to be, situate in the navigable portion of the Bay of Toronto, they are, although inside the windmill line, so long as the water lot remains unreclaimed or unimproved, equally open to all members of the public navigating the same, and no private easement therein can be acquired by any particular person by reason of his being the owner of an improved unreclaimed water lot or otherwise. To meet this view the defendants, by way of alternative defence, have pleaded that the lands claimed by the plaintiffs, that is to say the west half of the said water lot No. 17, are, and were at the time of the trespasses alleged in the statement of claim, covered by the waters of Lake Ontario or of the harbor of the City of Toronto, which is an inlet of said Lake Ontario, which were then, and had always theretofore been, and now are, public navigable waters flowing and being over and upon the said lands, and such waters were not at any time, and are not now, the property of the plaintiffs, and the defendants at the time of the alleged trespass, and before and since were entitled equally with the plaintiffs in exercise of the right as part of the public of Canada to the full and uninterrupted use and enjoyment of the said public waters flowing and being over and upon the lands claimed by the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs wrongfully on the occasion of the alleged trespasses in the statement of claim mentioned, and at other times by the means stated in the statement of claim, and by driving piles in the lands claimed by the plaintiffs, so that the same stood up through the said public waters, and by other means and devices, interfered with and obstructed the navigation of the said waters, and the defendants in the enjoyment of the same, and if the defendants did any of the acts complained of, which they deny, they did so for the purpose of abating a public nuisance existing in the said waters and obstructing the navigation thereof, and which acts of the plaintiffs were also a nuisance and injury to the defendants, and hindered them from the free enjoyment and use of the said public right of navigation. Neither of these contradictory defences is at all tenable; not the first, because the waters covering the water lots as long as they remain unreclaimed being navigable waters of the Bay of Toronto no private easement can be acquired in such waters which are equally open to all Her Majestys subjects to navigate upon; and not the second, because, although until reclaimed or enclosed the waters covering the water lots as granted are open to the public to navigate upon, still the right to reclaim them and to appropriate them to their own private purposes and uses by the grantees in the terms of the grants, which was the right which the plaintiffs were exercising and with which the defendants interfered, belongs to the grantees of the respective water lots and their heirs and assigns. The effect of the letters patent granting the water lots, as confirmed by the acts of Parliament, is to pass to the grantees, their heirs and assigns in fee simple, the land covered with water together with the right of reclaiming the water lots by filling them up wholly and making dry land of them up to the windmill line, or by erecting wharves, warehouses or other structures thereon at their will and pleasure within the terms and provisions of the letters patent and the confirming acts of Parliament. In view of the high handed and vexatious way in which the defendants interfered with the plaintiffs in the exercise of their undoubted rights, the damages awarded by the jury, although large, cannot be said to be excessive. The appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellant: Howland, Arnoldi & Ryerson.\nSolicitors for Respondents: Beatty, Chadwick Blackstock & Galt.\n[1] 12 Ont.

J. Ritchie C. J. and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nWill\u2014Devisee under\u2014Mortgage by testator\u2014Foreclosure of\u2014Suit to sell real estate for payment of debts\u2014Decree under\u2014Conveyance by purchaser at sale under decree\u2014Assignment of mort gage\u2014Statute confirming title.\nA. M. died in 1838 and by his will left certain real estate to his wife, M. M., for her life, and after her death to their children. At the time of his death there were two small mortgages on the said real estate to one H. P. T. which were subsequently foreclosed, but no sale was made under the decree in such foreclosure suit. In 1841 the mortgages and the interest of the mortgagee in the foreclosure suit were assigned to one J. B. U. who, in 1849, assigned and released the same to M. M.\nIn 1841 M. M., the administrator with the will annexed of the said A. M., fyled a bill in Chancery under the Imperial Statute 5 Geo. 2 ch. 7, for the purpose of having this real estate sold to pay the debts of the estate, she having previously applied to the Governor in Council, under a statute of the Province, for leave to sell the same, which was refused. A decree was made in this suit and the lands sold, the said M. M. becoming the purchaser. She afterwards conveyed said lands to the Commissioners of the Lunatic Asylum, and the title therein passed, by various acts of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, to the present defendants.\nM. K., devisee under the will of A. M., brought an action of ejectment for the recovery of the said lands, and in the course of the trial contended that the sale under the decree in the. Chancery suit was void, inasmuch as the only way in which land of a deceased person can be sold in Nova Scotia is by petition to the Governor in Council. The validity of the mortgages and of the proceedings in the foreclosure sale were also attacked. The action was tried before a judge without a jury and a verdict was found for the defendants, which verdict the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia refused to disturb. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada: \u2014\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that even if the sale under the decree in the Chancery suit was invalid, the title to the land would be outstanding in the mortgagee or those claiming under her, the assignment of the mortgages being merely a release of the debts and not passing the real estate, and the plaintiff, therefore, could not recover in an action of ejectment.\nSemble, that such sale was not invalid but passed a good title, the Statute 5 Geo. 2 ch. 7 being in force in the province. Henry J. dubitante.\nHeld, also, that the statute cap. 36 sec. 47 R. S. 4th series (N. S.) vested the said land in the defendants if they had not a title to the same before. Henry J. dubitante.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] sustaining a verdict in favor of the defendants.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the above head-note.\nT. J. Wallace for the appellants.\nMcLennan Q.C. and Graham Q.C. for the respondents. Sir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I can see no difficulty in this case. It is clear that there was a decree made by the Court of Chancery foreclosing the mortgage, and that the court decreed a sale of this property; it is clear that the sale was made professing to be a sale under the decree passed for the purpose of settling the estate and making this land available for payment of the mortgage. The sale was made and the property duly conveyed by the master's deed. After the property was so conveyed, that closed the transaction as to the devisor and those claiming under him.\nThe transfer to Mrs. McMinn from Uniacke was evidently for the purpose of preventing this mortgage from being, as it were, a blot upon the title.\nAfter this property was conveyed to Mrs McMinn she conveyed to the Commissioners of the Lunatic Asylum, and by various acts of the legislature it passed to the board of works and then to the Commissioners of Public Works and Mines; and, in the course of legislation which took place, the title to this land was declared, not only to be confirmed in them, but vested in them in fee simple, so that the defendants now hold by a statutory title. But assuming this was not so, as pointed out in the argument, the ground on which the court below proceeded must prevail, for if the title was not in Mary McMinn when she conveyed to the Commissioners of the Lunatic Asylum it must be in Henrietta Phoebe Tremain or those claiming under her and so the plaintiff failed to show any title to the locus in quo to enable her to recover in this action of ejectment.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014It is clear that there is no foundation for this appeal. The plaintiff makes out a prim\u00e2 facie case by proving that Andrew McMinn was, at the time of his death, in possession of this land, which is presumptive evidence of his seizin in fee, and by further proving the will of Andrew McMinn by which this property, subject to the widow's life estate, was devised to the plaintiff in fee. But this prim\u00e2 facie case is met by the defendants as follows. It is proved that the legal estate passed to the mortgagee, Miss Tremaine, and it never passed out of her unless the master's deed was operative, for the deed of the 16th October, 1841, whereby the mortgagee Miss Tremaine, transferred the mortgages to James Boyle Uniacke, did not pass any estate in the land, being, apparently, merely intended as a release or extinguishment of the mortgage debt, and therefore, if the deed executed by the master (by which he assumed to convey the land to Mary McMinn as having been sold under the decree in the administration suit) is inoperative, the legal estate is still outstanding in the real representatives of the mortgagee. If, on the other hand, the sale was valid and effectual, then it is equally clear that the legal estate is not in the plaintiff, but in the defendants under the conveyance by master Nutting to Mary McMinn dated the 31st December 1842, made pursuant to the decree in the administration suit, and her subsequent conveyance of the 20th July 1853 to the Commissioners for the Asylum. Therefore, \"quacunque via dat\u00e2,\" the legal estate is shown not to be in the plaintiff, who cannot therefore recover in ejectment; for, whatever rights she might have in a court of equity, no effect can be given to them in this action. I should add, however, that I have no doubt the sale under the decree was perfectly good; the Imperial statute 6 Geo. 2 cap. 7 authorises the sale of lands in equity for the payment of debts in all British colonies; no statute is shown to have been passed in Nova Scotia whereby the law so enacted was in any way altered: the sale having been regularly made, the master had power to convey the legal estate in the lands sold under the decree, for such power is expressly conferred upon a master in equity by the statute 3-4 W. 4 cap. 52 sec 8.\nFurther, the statute of 1874 is alone a sufficient defence to this ejectment, for it expressly vests the estate in the lands sought to be recovered in the defendants, in fee simple.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nHENRY J.\u2014The plaintiff having made a prim\u00e2 facie case the difficulties are in connection with the defence.\nThe property in question was, at the time of the death of Andrew McMinn the testator who was the husband of Mary McMinn and father of the plaintiff, encumbered by two mortgages to Miss Tremaine; she subsequently assigned them to James Boyle Uniacke and he assigned them to Mary McMinn. I am of the opinion that thereby the legal estate passed to Mary McMinn. She then, in ray opinion, took the title as a tenant for life under the will. There was, however, a decree of foreclosure made at the instance of the mortgagee, but no sale was made under it, and Mary McMinn became entitled, under the assignment from Uniacke, to the benefit of the decree, but never acted on it.\nThe property was, however, finally sold for the payment of debts under the provisions of the Imperial Statute 5 Geo. 2 cap. 7. It is contended that, inasmuch as the Legislature of Nova Scotia had passed an act which rendered it necessary to the valid sale of lands of a deceased person that an order for the same should be obtained from the Governor in Council, the Imperial statute ceased to have operation in Nova Scotia, and that an application for that purpose having been refused by the Governor in. Council the decree for the sale made by the Court of Chancery was invalid. I am rather inclined to sustain the contention, but as the rest of the court take a different view I need give no decided opinion as to it. If, however, that contention can be sustained, then I am of opinion that, apart from the purchase by Mary McMinn at the sale by the master and the conveyance by him to her, she held as a tenant for life under the will. If not, then the plaintiff cannot succeed in an action at law, but might possibly succeed in a court of equity, and obtain a declaration of that court that Mary McMinn, under the peculiar circumstances, took as a tenant for life. As the rest of the court are of opinion that the statute passed by the Legislature of Nova Scotia in 1874 vests the title of the lands in question in the defendants in fee simple, any discussion of the question would be of no practical use, but I cannot arrive at the conclusion that an act of that kind can have the effect of transferring title from one party to another, and the act should be construed as intended only to transfer the title, such as it was, from one public body to another, or rather from one body of trustees to another. The appeal, however, will be dismissed, although, in my opinion, it should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014To my mind this case is quite clear. The sale under the decree for the administration of the estate of McMinn appears to me to have been quite good. Then the statutes vest the land in the Commissioner of Works. But if there were anything defective in these proceedings, the mortgage would remain with a decree of foreclosure thereof made which is enrolled and unreversed. The contention that Mrs. McMinn took, as tenant for life, a release of the mortgage, which extinguishes the mortgage and brings in again her tenancy for life and the estate in remainder, is fallacious, for the release was made to her, not as tenant for life nor while that tenancy existed, but after it had become extinguished by the sale in the administration suit, and to her as and when tenant in fee simple in virtue of that sale.\nThe present plaintiff has clearly no legal estate whatever in the premises to recover which the suit is brought, and the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Thomas J. Wallace.\nSolicitors for respondents: Graham, Tupper, Borden & Parker.\n(NOTE)\u2014In this case application was made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for leave to appeal from the decision of this court, which leave was refused.\n[1] 6 Russ. v.

Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia quashing a return to a writ of mandamus and ordering a preremptory writ of mandamus to issue.\nThis case has been three times before the court: First on an appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia making absolute a rule nisi for a mandamus, in which the majority of this court held that the issue of the writ was in the discretion of the court below. That is reported in 9 Can. S. C. R. 509. It next came before this court on a preliminary objection that a demurrer would not lie to the return to a writ of mandamus. That case is not reported in this court but will be found in the Nova Scotia Reports[1] and Cassels's Dig.[2]. The Supreme Court of Canada overruled the preliminary objection and decided that the case must be heard on the merits.\nThere are two appeals in the present case before this court, in the one case a mandamus having issued to collect from the town of Dartmouth its proportion of the school rates of the County of Halifax for the years 1875 to 1878 inclusive, and the other to collect the rates from 1879 to 1883 inclusive. The two appeals are substantially the same, the first coming before the court on demurrer to the writ of mandamus and the other on a rule to quash the writ.\nThe facts of these appeals, and the several statutes on which the claim is set up on the one side and resisted on the other are fully set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice in the former report[3], and in the present judgments.\nHenry Q.C. and Graham Q.C. for the appellants referred to the various Nova Scotia statutes bearing on the case and cited the following cases. The Queen v. Read[4]; Rex v. Justices of Flintshire[5]; and Newton v. Young[6].\nSedgwick Q.C. and Gormully for the respondents cited the following: The Queen v. Mayor of Maidenhead[7]; The Queen v. Churchwardens of All Saints, Wigan[8]; and Worthing ton v. Hulton[9].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I may say in this case, that I have taken a great deal of pains to investigate this matter, and have come to the conclusion that the town of Dartmouth is liable to be assessed and that the city of Halifax is exempt.\nI heard nothing on the argument which has altered my mind in this respect, and I think nothing has been shown in the return to the writ of mandamus which could do so.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I concur in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I regret that I have not been able to come to the conclusion arrived at by the Chief Justice. I agree with Mr. Justice Gwynne, that the town was liable for this claim.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia quashing the appellant's return to a writ of mandamus and awarding the issue of a peremptory writ of mandamus.\nTwo questions suggest themselves for consideration:\n1st. Whether the Town of Dartmouth is or is not liable to the county assessment for the support of the schools in the County of Halifax outside of the City of Halifax; and 2nd. If so liable, will a writ of mandamus lie to enjoin the appellants to levy, collect, and pay over the same to the Treasurer of the Municipality of the County of Halifax.\nI will deal with each in its order:\u2014\nThe mandamus nisi is to enjoin the Council of the Town of Dartmouth to levy rates for the years 1874, 5, 6, 7 and 8.\nWhen Dartmouth was incorporated the schools in Nova Scotia were supported:\u2014\n1st. By a legislative grant.\n2nd. By a county rate sufficient to yield a sum equal to 80 cents a head of the inhabitants to be collected each year with the county rates; and\n3rd. A special rate to be imposed by the majority of the ratepayers in each school section.\nThe statute was passed in 1866 and specially exempts the City of Halifax from its operation as regards the imposition of county or sectional rates in regard to the schools therein, and this provision was made in the act, the act for its incorporation having been passed many years before.\nThe 2nd section of that act provides that:\u2014\nThe Clerk of the Peace in each County, except as hereinafter provided in relation to the City of Halifax, shall add to the sum annually voted for general county purposes at the General Sessions, a sum sufficient after deducting costs of collection and probable loss to yield an amount equal to thirty cents for every inhabitant of the county according to the last census preceding the issue of the county rate-roll, and the sum so added shall form and be a portion of the County Rates. One half of the sum thus raised shall be paid semiannually by the County Treasurer upon the order of the Board of School Commissioners for the county. One half the amount provided to be raised annually as aforesaid, shall at the close of each half-year be apportioned to the Trustees of Schools conducted in accordance with this act, and the Act hereby amended, to be applied to the payment of teachers salaries. And each school shall be entitled to participate therein according to the average number of pupils in attendance and the length of time in operation but shall receive no allowance for being in session more than the prescribed number of days in any one half-year.\nBy the 19th section the City of Halifax is made one school section and under Commissioners and the city was required to provide all monies required for its schools in addition to the annual grant provided by the legislature.\nThe Town of Dartmouth was incorporated in 1873, and the provision for the support of its schools appears to me substantially the same as previously made for the City of Halifax.\nBy the 27th section of the act of incorporation it is provided that the Council of the Town shall have jurisdiction over the support and regulation of the public schools, the appointment of teachers and the regulating and collection of assessments.\nBy section 28 the council is to vote, assess, collect, receive, appropriate, and pay all monies required, amongst other things, for its schools; and to have all the powers relating thereto previously vested in the sessions, grand jury school meeting and town meeting. By the 36th section the town was made a separate school section and was to have for its schools the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits. The 37th section connected with the town for school purposes two adjoining school districts, and it was provided that the proportion of the legislative grant to which they would be entitled should be paid to the town, and the town should have the right to impose and levy the county school assessments and all school taxes on such districts, and collect the same in the same manner as if such districts formed part of the town.\nBy the 41st section the council was declared to have the regulating and ordering of all monies to be paid out of funds in the hands of its treasurer.\nHere then is provided the whole system for the support and management of the schools of the town. It is clear that in the provision for schools no part of the funds is stated to be derived from any participation of the county school funds raised by the rate of 30 cents a head. The provision as to the latter requires the county treasurer to pay semi-annually one half of the funds raised by the assessment of thirty cents, upon the order of the school commissioners, to be applied and appropriated by them. By the act of incorporation the town ceased to be within the jurisdiction of any board of school commissioners; and the council of the town, although exercising the same functions as school commissioners, are not known as or termed such; and besides, after payment on the order of the school commissioners by the county treasurer, the same section provides that at the close of each half year the moneys were to be apportioned by the school commissioners to the trustees of schools conducted in accordance with that act, and the act by it amended, to be applied to the payment of teachers' salaries. Now, by the act of incorporation a different system for schools in the town is provided, and the schools there cannot be said to be conducted according to the school act as applicable to counties and therefore are not within the category referred to as entitled to participate. As a matter of fact the town did not so participate. It has otherwise paid for and sustained its schools, and this, to my mind, was the intention of the legislature when enacting the incorporation of the town. The town has supported its own schools without asking for any participation in the county assessment, and it is now sought to make it contribute to the support of schools outside. If it assessed, collected and paid to the county treasurer the assessment of thirty cents a head justice would require that its proper proportion should be paid back in aid of its schools. According to the provisions I have quoted from the school act the town could not participate for, amongst others, the reason that its schools are provided to be sustained in a manner not in accordance with that act, and that consideration is evidence that no such rate was intended to be levied on the inhabitants of the town.\nFurther the 28th section before referred to provides that the council should vote, assess, collect, receive, appropriate and pay all monies required for its schools. The only outside aid provided was its share of the legislative grant. Beyond its share of such grant it was required, as in the case of the City of Halifax, to support its own schools, and by the 36th section it was made a separate school section and to have for its schools the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits; and the 47th section gave the regulating and ordering of all monies to be paid by its Treasurer to the council of the town. If the council was to vote, assess, collect and appropriate all monies required for its school it could not participate in the funds raised by any county assessment, and the act having made it, not a school district but a separate school section to support its own schools, and as such, to have the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits, why should the matter of the assessment of thirty cents be at all applicable to the town? The provisions of the incorporation act in regard to schools are essentially different from those in the general school act. And the former substantially repeals the provisions of the latter as to the town.\nHad the town been incorporated when the general school act was framed and passed I have not the slightest doubt but in the section providing for the county assessment Dartmouth would have been excepted as well as Halifax. It is true that the fourth series of the revised statutes was in force during the years for which it is claimed that the town was liable; and it might have been exempted like the City of Halifax; but if under the original school act the town was liable but under the terms of its incorporation act it would not be liable under the provision for county assessment, though that provision was continued in the fourth series (which may be construed as a re-enactment merely of the original act and not intended as a repeal of any of the provisions of the incorporation act) the latter act being a local act would not be assumed to be affected by a revision of the general and public statutes; but if any doubt existed on that point it would be at once removed by reference to a provision in the 4th series providing for its publication, which enacted that nothing therein contained should affect local acts. I am, in consideration of the legislation on the subject in question, of the opinion that the town was and is wholly exempt from the operation of the section of the school act which provides for county assessment, and that when the legislature by the provisions of its act of incorporation imposed upon it the whole burden for the support of its schools beyond the legislative grant it was so intended. It has been contended that the words:\nAs also of all Government and school grants for such schools which grants shall be paid to the town\u2014\nfollowing as they do the provision that:\nThe town shall have the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits for the schools of the town\u2014\ncontrol and effect the operation of the provision preceding them. I am, however, at a loss to discover that they have any effect except to extend the operation of the provision so as to include the expenditure of the Government grants. It is claimed that the words \"and school grants\" are to be construed as intended to apply to the funds raised by county assessments. In my opinion it would be torturing language to do so. The difference between \"grants\" and \"rates\" or \"assessments\" is too well understood and appreciated for any one to assume that the Legislature should so misapply the word \"grants,\" and particularly in the same section which gives to the council of the town the exclusive right of expenditure \"of all \"school rates raised within its limits.\" Unless it plainly and irresistibly appeared to be so we cannot think that the Legislature would so stultify itself. Besides, it being patent from the whole of the school act that the only \"grants\" mentioned were Government grants, I am brought to the conclusion that the word \"and\" between the words \"Government\" and \"school grants\" was unintentionally inserted and that the provision should be read \"as also of all Government school grants.\" If, however, it be read even as including the county assessment of 30 cents, the previous provision is not thereby limited but on the contrary extended. The whole provision was made to confer upon the council the right of expenditure, and if the rate be raised, either as a county assessment or otherwise, within the limits of the town, the council had its expenditure and it was not therefore to go into the general school fund of the county to be applied under the provisions of the act. Reading the act of incorporation with the school act it is not difficult to reach the conclusion that it was fully the intention of the Legislature to apply to Dartmouth the same system for the support of its schools as was then in force with respect to the City of Halifax, and it appears to me difficult to resist that conclusion. I am therefore of opinion that Dartmouth is in no way liable to the municipality of the County of Halifax, and that our judgment should be accordingly.\nIn case, however, I should be wrong in my conclusion in that respect it is desirable to discuss the other point in the case\u2014that in case Dartmouth should be liable as contended for should a peremptory mandamus be adjudged.\nIt is a high prerogative writ and one of the first principles in regard to it is that it is only allowed when the complaining party has no other remedy, nor is it allowed where issues are necessary to be tried to ascertain the sum really due, if any. If Dartmouth is liable to the county assessment it will not be contended that it is not, as a result, entitled to a distributive share of the funds so raised. By no evidence is it shown, nor is it I presume now capable of being shown, what in each of the years in question that share would have amounted to. The schools in the county have been sustained, as also those in the town, independently of the funds now claimed from Dartmouth. What then is the destination of the money if assessed upon and collected in Dartmouth and paid over to the county treasurer? It cannot be appropriated under the school act, for the object no longer exists and the time for doing so has elapsed. The county school commissioners could not now appropriate it under the terms of the school act. Its legal disposition was required to be made semi-annually for the payment of the teachers employed and serving each year and that could not now be done for their services have been paid for already. Under such, and other circumstances not necessary to be stated, why should a peremptory mandamus be allowed to enforce the assessment for and collection of monies for purposes and objects no longer necessary? Had the municipality of the county been shown to have advanced and paid out under the provisions of the school act the monies now sought to be recovered the case would stand on a different footing, but it is quite clear that such was not done. Dartmouth received nothing during those years from the county fund and it is not shown that the municipality of the county was called upon to pay or did pay one penny more on account of the default of Dartmouth to contribute its share of the funds to be raised by county assessments. Why then should Dartmouth pay the county anything?\nThere are, therefore, many nice legal and equitable questions to be adjudicated upon and decided, and if the liability of Dartmouth to the county was established the former would be liable only for the difference between the amount of its liability and the amount it would be entitled to as its distributive share of the funds. Such an adjustment could only be fairly made after a thorough investigation requiring much evidence, documentary and otherwise, and until such was made it would, under the circumstances, be unjust and oppressive to oblige Dartmouth to pay by assessment the whole amount and to trust to future proceedings to obtain its distributive share from the county. Courts never allow a peremptory mandamus to be issued where the interests of the parties are not provided for, and for the reasons given and many others that might be stated I think we would perpetrate a gross wrong to Dartmouth, under the circumstances, if we allowed the writ in this case. I am therefore of opinion that on all points our judgment should be to refuse it.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question in this case arises upon a demurrer to a return to a mandamus nisi addressed to the municipality of the Town of Dartmouth commanding them, unless they should shew good cause to the contrary, to assess and levy upon and from their ratepayers and to pay over to the treasurer of the municipality of the County of Halifax the sum of $15,976.00, being the aggregate of several sums said to have been apportioned upon the inhabitants of the town by the clerk of the peace of the County of Halifax in the years 1874, 5, 6, 7 and 1878 respectively, calculated at the rate of thirty cents for every inhabitant of the town, and for which several sums, as is said, the ratepayers of the Town of Dartmouth were in those several years respectively liable according to law to have been assessed to assist in the support of common schools in the County of Halifax, and which several sums so annually apportioned it was the duty, as is said, of the municipality of the town to have assessed upon, and levied from, the ratepayers of the town in each of those years and to have paid over to the treasurer of the County of Halifax when collected, but that they neglected so to do. The points to be determined are two, namely:\u2014\n1st. Whether the ratepayers of the municipality of the Town of Dartmouth were, or their property was, liable to contribute to the support of the common schools of the County of Halifax outside of the Town of Dartmouth, during the above years, the 30 cents per head of the inhabitants which is mentioned in the 52nd section of chap. 32 of the 4th series of the revised Statutes of Nova Scotia as is claimed, and\n2nd. Apart from the question whether such ratepayers were or not liable to have been rated and assessed in each of the above years for the above purpose, as claimed, whether in view of the matters pleaded in the return to the mandamus nisi, or of any of those matters, a peremptory mandamus should be now granted commanding the municipality to assess their present ratepayers and to levy from them the above sum of $15,976.00 dollars and to pay the same to the treasurer of the County of Halifax.\nOn the 30th day of April, 1873, when the act incorporating the Town of Dartmouth was passed the provision made for the support of common schools in the Province of Nova Scotia consisted of three funds:\u2014\n1st. A Provincial or Government grant.\n2nd. A rate or assessment called the county school rate or assessment which consisted of a rate calculated on the basis of 30 cents for every inhabitant of the respective counties and collected together with the ordinary general county rates, except in the City of Halifax which was a distinct municipality in itself for which special provision was made, and\n3rd. A special rate which the majority of the ratepayers in each school section present at a regularly called school meeting were authorised to impose upon the ratepayers of their section. This rate in default of payment was also collected together with the general county rates and the assessment was returned to the general sessions of the county in which the school section in which the special rate was imposed was situate. The statute then in existence in relation to the Provincial or Government grant was 28 Vic. ch. 29, entituled \"an Act for the better encouragement of education\" and passed on the 2nd of May, 1866, by which act the sum of $6807.00 per annum was granted to the District of the City of Halifax, $3929.00 to the District of Halifax West, $1263.00 to the District of Halifax Shore and $1279.00 to the Rural District of Halifax.\nThe statute then in existence in relation to the county school rate was 29 Vic. ch. 30, entituled \"An \"Act to amend the Act for the better encouragement \"of education,\" and passed on the 7th day of May, 1866. By the 2nd section of that act it was enacted as follows:\u2014\n2nd. The Clerk of the Peace in each county, except as hereinafter provided in relation to the City of Halifax, shall add to the sum annually voted for general county purposes at the general sessions, a sum sufficient, after deducting costs of collection and probable loss, to yield an amount equal to thirty cents for every inhabitant of the county, according to the last census preceding the issue of the county rate roll; and the sum so added shall form and be a portion of the county rates, and one-half of the sum thus raised shall be paid semi-annually by the County Treasurer upon the order of the Board or Boards of School Commissioners for the county.\nOne half of the amount provided to be raised annually as aforesaid shall, at the close of each half year, be apportioned to the trustees of schools conducted in accordance with this act and the act hereby amended to be applied to the payment of teachers' salaries; and each school shall be entitled to participate therein according to the average number of pupils in attendance and the length of time in operation but shall receive no allowance for being in session more than the prescribed number of days in any one half year.\nThe provision in relation to the special school section rate was contained in the third section of this act but it is unnecessary to set out at large the provisions of this section.\nThe provision in respect of the City of Halifax was contained in the 19th section and, in short substance, was that the city was as one school section placed under the jurisdiction of a board of commisioners appointed by the Governor in Council, composed of twelve persons, two being residents of each ward in the city; and upon the council of the city was imposed the burden of providing all monies necessary for the support of the schools in addition to the amount provided by the provincial grant. Now, on the 30th of April, 1873, the act 36 Vic. ch. 17 was passed, by which a portion of the County of Halifax was incorporated as the Municipality of the Town of Dartmouth, and the question now is, whether the provisions of that act do not, in equally clear language as is used in the above act 29 Vic., ch. 30 in relation to the City of Halifax, exempt the ratepayers of the Town of Dartmouth from all liability to contribute to the support of common schools in the County of Halifax outside of the town. The first section of the above act of incorporation defines the limits of the town.\nBy the 27th section it is enacted that the council of the town, consisting of a warden and six councillors as provided in a previous section, shall have jurisdiction over all the property of the town and over the support and regulation of the public schools and the appointment of teachers, and also over the support of the poor, and regulating and collecting the assessments, and making all contracts relative to matters under their control.\nBy the 28th section it was enacted that they should vote, assess, collect, receive, appropriate and pay whatever monies should be required for county assessments, poor, school and other rates and assessments, and should have within the town all the powers relating thereto vested in the sessions, grand jury, school meeting and town meeting, and should have and exercise within the town all the powers and authority which within the district previous to the passing of the act were exercised by the sessions, grand jury or town or school meeting or trustees of schools and public property.\nBy the 36th section it was enacted that the town should constitute a separate school section and that it should have for the schools of the town the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits.\nBy the 37th section it was enacted that for all school purposes the district lying between the northern boundary of the town and the lands of the British Government, and the district lying between the southern boundary of the town and Herbert's brook, should form part of the Town of Dartmouth, and that the town should be entitled to receive and be paid the proportion of the Government school grants payable in respect of such districts, and to impose and levy the county school assessments and all school taxes on such districts and collect the same in the same manner as if such districts formed part of such town. By the 41st section it was enacted that the council should have the regulating and ordering of all monies to be paid out of funds in the hands of the treasurer of the town, and by the 35th section that the school house and all property real and personal which, at the time of the passing of the act, should be public property or should have been held in trust for the Town of Dartmouth should, on the passing of the act, vest in and become the property of the town.\nNow the language of this act, as it appears to me, in the plainest possible terms detaches the Town of Dartmouth wholly from the County of Halifax for school purposes and from the control of the boards of school commissioners for the county, and exempts the ratepayers of the town from all liability to contribute the thirty cents for every inhabitant of the town, constituting the county school rate, or any part thereof to the treasurer of the county. The school property situate in the town is transferred to, and made part of, the property of the town, over which absolute jurisdiction and control is given to the town council. To the town council is also given absolute jurisdiction over the support and regulation of the public schools and the appointment of teachers and the assessment and collection and expenditure for the schools of the town of all school rates raised within its limits, comprehending therefore the expenditure of the thirty cents for every inhabitant of the town, if that be a rate which after the passing of the act of incorporation of the town remained imposed upon the ratepayers; all these rates so collected, in the absence of any express provision to the contrary, must naturally be payable into the hands of the treasurer of the town, out of whose hands no monies can be paid without the authority of the town council, who, having absolute jurisdiction over the support and regulation of public schools and the appointment of teachers are also invested with all the authority, powers and duties which, in relation to that portion of the County of Halifax which is constituted the town of Dartmouth, were, previously to the passing of the act incorporating the town, vested in the boards of school commissioners for the county and the trustees of the public schools of the county. For all school purposes the districts mentioned in the act which abut on the northern and southern limits of the town as defined in the act are made part of the town corporation, which is declared to be entitled to receive and be paid the proportion of the Government school grants payable in respect of such districts and to impose and levy the county school assessments and all school taxes on such districts in the same manner as if such districts formed part of such town. Can any language be plainer than this? It is not that the town hall receive and be paid the proportion of the Government school grants and of the county school assessments payable in respect of such districts, but with the same sentence in which it is said that the town council shall receive and be paid the proportion of the government school grants payable in respect of such districts is coupled the provision that they shall also receive the county school assessment, that is to say, they shall receive the thirty cents for every inhabitant of the districts.\nNow, that the Government school grants are received by the town for the support of the schools of the town there can be no doubt; upon what principle then can this other fund, which by the same sentence the town council are authorized to receive, be received by them for a different purpose without express language clearly defining such different purpose? But instead of such language the section says that the town is entitled to impose and levy this county school assessment (consisting of thirty cents per head for every inhabitant of the districts) and all school taxes in such districts, in the same manner as if the districts were for all purposes, as for school purposes they are, by the act made to form part of the town; that is to say, as it appears to me, that they shall impose and collect these taxes for the support of the schools of the town, and in their character of a board of school commissioners for, and trustees of the common schools of the town, having absolute jurisdiction over the support and management of those schools, and that they shall collect them by the hands of their own collectors, and receive them into the hands of their own treasurer, and be accountable to no one in respect of them but their own constituency, as a separate municipality.\nNow, against the above apparently plain construction of express provisions in the statute it is argued that under the 28th section of the act the town of Dartmouth had as clear a right of exemption from liability to the county rate for general purposes, as to which they had not claimed exemption, as of exemption from liability for the county school rate of 30 cents per head, as to which they do claim exemption; and so it was argued that they were liable for both. But the answer to this argument is very simple, namely, that the two rates are very different and are treated as being so in the act, and that the exemption from liability to pay over the school rate to the county treasurer is not claimed solely in virtue of the provisions of section 28 of the act, but in virtue also of the provisions of sections 36 and 37 which give to the Town Council, in the exercise of their absolute jurisdiction over the support and regulation of the public schools of the town vested in them by the 27th section, the expenditure for the schools of the town of all school rates raised within the limits of the town. But while the act thus gives to the town council absolute jurisdiction and control over all school rates raised within the town, it provides equally clearly (by sections 28 and 42) that the town shall contribute to the sum required for county rates for general purposes, the expenditure of which is not given to the town but is left with the county authorities just as it was before the incorporation of the town; and for this reason the contribution of the town to the sum required for general purposes of the county, when levied, becomes payable to the county treasurer; although, inasmuch as the powers of the general sessions as affecting county assessments are vested in the town council, the latter very probably have the right of defining what the town's share or contribution to the county rate for general purposes shall be; but with this we are not concerned. For the present purposes it is sufficient to say that it is quite a fallacy to hold that of two funds, one of which, when collected, is appropriated to purposes of the county as distinct from the town, and the other to the purposes of the town as distinct from the county, because the former is properly payable into the county treasury therefore the latter must be also.\nMoreover, it is to be observed that the act 29 Vic. ch. 30, which imposed the rate of 30 cents for every inhabitant of the county, provides that the rate shall be paid when collected into the hands of the county treasurer and that one half of the sum thus raised shall be paid by him semi-annually upon the order of the board or boards of school commissioners for the county, and that the one half shall semi-annually be apportioned to the trustees of schools conducted in accordance with the act, to be applied to the payment of teachers' salaries. But as the town council have absolute jurisdiction over the support and management of the common schools of the town and the appointment of teachers, whose salaries therefore they must agree upon and provide, and as they are thus put in the place of a board of school commissioners and trustees of the schools of the town, they could not claim to be nor be recognized as being a board of school commissioners for the county so as to entitle them to demand and receive from the county treasurer, for the schools of the town, any part of the county school rate come to his hands for the support of the common schools of the county, nor can the schools of the town which are conducted by authority of the act of incorporation of the town under the exclusive regulation of the town council as the board of school commissioners for, and as trustees of, the schools of the town, be said to be schools conducted in accordance with the act which regulates the management of the common schools of the county so as to warrant the payment of any portion of the rate received by the county treasurer for support of the schools of the county to the teachers of the common schools of the town who, being appointed by the town council with whom they contract for their services, must look alone to the town council who appoint them for their pay. But it is contended, and this is the chief argument upon which the right of the municipalty of the County of Halifax to the peremptory mandamus asked for is rested, that all these express provisions for the support and regulation of the schools of the town under the control, conduct and management of the town council, as board of school commissioners and trustees of the common schools of the town, and notably the provision that the town council shall have, for the schools of the town, the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits, are over ruled by a sentence in the 36th section of the act, the consideration of which I have purposely postponed until now for the purpose of first drawing attention to those clauses of the act which, as is contended, are over ruled by the language of the sentence relied upon, and of thus pointing out with greater force what appears to me to be the fallacy of the argument, which is, that a liability by implication is created, which subjects the town council of Dartmouth to the burthen of collecting within the limits of the town the thirty cents for every inhabitant of the town for the purpose of paying over the rate when collected to the county treasurer to be distributed under the provisions of the general act among the schools of the county, and that the only interest which the town council of the town of Dartmouth have in that rate is to receive for the schools of the town a proportion of the whole amount constituted of the thirty cents for every inhabitant of the county, including the inhabitants of the town of Dartmouth, such proportion being calculated, as in the case of the schools of the county outside of the town, upon the average attendance of the pupils at the schools. The sentence relied upon comes immediately after that part of section 36, which says that:\u2014\nThe town shall have the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits, for the schools of the town, as follows: as also of all Government and school grants for such schools, which grants shall be paid to the town.\nNow, apart from the improbability of the Legislature imposing on the town and its ratepayers such a burthen as is contended for by the municipality of the County of Halifax, not in express terms but as arising by implication merely, it is to be observed that (coupled as the sentence is with the previous part by the words \"as also of\") what is intended to be given by the latter part of the clause is the expenditure for the schools of the town of something additional to what by the previous part is given for the same purpose. I have already shown that what is given by the previous part is the expenditure for the schools of the town of all school rates raised within the limits of the town; the ratepayers of the town can, therefore, be no longer liable to have levied upon them a rate raised within the limits of the town, not for the schools of the town, but as a contribution to the county school rate, to be received by the county treasurer for the support of the common schools of the county, and to be distributed by the board of school commissioners for the county and the trustees of the common schools of the county. The words \"school grants,\" therefore, in the 35th section, can by no possibility be construed as meaning that proportion of the county school rate calculated according to the average attendance of pupils and which would have come to the schools of that portion of the county set apart for the town if the town had never been incorporated; and it is wholly upon the assumption that this is what the words \"school grants\" as used in the section do mean that the liability by implication which is contended for is rested. The inference and conclusion which in fact do follow from what is expressly said in the section is directly the reverse of what is contended for, namely, that as the town council are beyond all doubt given the control and expenditure of all school rates of every description raised within the limits of the town, they cannot claim (as in point of fact they do not claim and never have claimed) any right to receive for the support of the schools of the town any part of the county school rate coming into the hands of the treasurer of the county, nor can the town or its ratepayers be made liable to contribute to that fund, and this is the construction which, as I think I have shewn, is consistently supported by the other provisions of the act which withdraw the town schools from all supervision and control of the board of school commissioners for the county and places them wholly under the town council as the board of school commissioners for the town. It is impossible, therefore, to give to the words \"school grants\" as used in the 36 th section the meaning contended for. Moreover the term \"grant\" is a very inappropriate term to apply to a portion of a rate levied upon several ratepayers for the purpose of distribution in varying proportions among the several contributors. Nowhere is the term so applied. The appropriate designation \"school rates\" is given in the 36th section to cover the whole of that portion of \"school rates\" which is raised within the limits of the town. In the 37th section what the town is given in respect of the outlying districts which are made part of the town for school purposes is\u2014the proportion of the Government school grants payable in respect of such districts and the county school assessment. Here also the appropriate designation is given\u2014nowhere is that rate or a part of it spoken of as a \"grant\" to the parties upon whom the rate is levied. It is asked however: What then can have been intended by the use of the words \"school grants\" in the 36th section of the act? To answer that question accurately I am not concerned; it is sufficient if it be, as I think it is, plain beyond all question that they could not have been used to mean a portion of the county school rate in the hands of the county school treasurer as is contended for, for no part of any school rate raised within the limits of the town can be applied as a contribution to that fund, the town itself having the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits I do not think that we are bound to find a precisely accurate and grammatical construction for every minute word used in an act of Parliament. It is sufficient if we can arrive at a proper construction of the act from its general provisions and from what is therein expressed with sufficient certainty. But to my mind the use of the words in the section can receive an explanation in perfect consistency with the construction I have given to the act, by regarding the words as intended to be used, as I must say I have little doubt is the fact, in precisely the same sense as it is clear they are used in the 37th section\u2014the only difference being the inversion of the order in which the \"Government school grants\" and \"the county school rate or assessment\" are spoken of in these sections, and the inadvertent misuse and insertion of the very minute word \"and\" where it ought not to be. Thus the 36th section will read that the town shall have the expenditure of all school rates raised within its limits, for the schools of of the town, and also of all Government school grants for such schools\u2014and the 37th that the town shall be entitled to receive and be paid the proportion of \"the Government school grants\" and to impose and levy on all the districts named the county school assessments, and collect the same in the same manner as if such districts formed part of -such town. In this manner, the words \"school grants\" being in both cases coupled with the word \"Government\" receive their appropriate designation, namely, \"Government school grants.\" Another argument has been used founded on the fact that the provision which exempts the city of Halifax from contribution to] this county school rate is found in ch. 32 of the 4th series of the Consolidated statutes, and the question is asked: If it had been intended that the Town of Dartmouth and its ratepayers should be in like manner exempt why does not a provision to that effect appear in this same 32nd chapter? The answer is, however, very plain and is: Because the 4th series is but a consolidation of the public general statutes, and as to this particular act the provisions which appear in the 32nd ch. of the 4th series are taken verbatim from 29 Vic. ch. 30, the statute in force on the subject when the act by which Dartmouth was incorporated was passed. The City of Halifax was incorporated as a separate municipality in 1864 before the passing of the Public General Statute 29 Vic. ch. 30, which authorized the levying of the rate of 30 cents for every inhabitant of the county which is the county school rate. The Public General Statute 28 Vic. ch. 29, passed in 1865, first made the city a separate school section and gave to it for the support of the city schools a large sum by way of Government grant and conferred upon the city council the power, and imposed upon them the burthen, of levying by assessment on the ratepayers of the city all further monies necessary for the support of city schools. When, then, the county school rate of 30 cents per head was first constituted by the Public General Statute 29 Vic. ch. 30, which was a statute in amendment of 28 Vic. ch. 29, it was natural that the provisions in this latter act as to the city of Halifax supporting its own schools should be continued and if required amended in 29 Vic. ch. 30, and this was what was done, and when the 4th series of the Public General Statutes came to be published as a consolidation of those statutes the provisions as to the city of Halifax retained their original place in the Public General Statutes so consolidated. But the portion of the county of Halifax which in 1873 was incorporated as the Town of Dartmouth having been ever since 1866 subject to the county school assessment under the provisions of 29 Vic. ch. 30 as part of the county it was natural that, in the act incorporating the town as a separate municipality and as a separate school section, should be inserted provisions imposing on the town corporation the like burthen of supporting their own schools and exempting the ratepayers of the town from further contribution to the support of the schools of the county outside of the limits of the town, in like manner as appears in the public statutes in relation to the city of Halifax. The act incorporating the town of Dartmouth being a local act its provisions could not appear in chapter 32 of the 4th series of the consolidated Statutes, those statutes being only the Public General Statutes, but in an act passed on the same day as the act incorporating the town was passed, and which is the act which provides for the publication of the 4th series of the Consolidated Statutes and prescribes the time and manner at and in which that series should come into operation, it is enacted that nothing therein contained should affect local or private acts, so that, as I stated at the outset, the only question is, whether the provisions of the act incorporating the Town as a separate municipality and school section are or not as effectual for exempting the ratepayers of the town in all time thereafter from liability to contribution to the county school rate coming to the hands of the county treasurer for the support of the schools of the county, that is to say schools outside the limits of the town, as the provisions of the Public Statutes relating to the City of Halifax and which exempt the ratepayers of that city from a like burthen. And in my opinion, for the reasons above given, the provisions of the act incorporating the town are abundantly sufficient to exempt and do exempt the ratepayers of the town from all liability to contribute to the support of any schools outside the limits of the town, and they are not therefore liable to be rated for the sum now demanded or any part thereof.\nNow, as to the 2nd question: The town council, in their return to the mandamus nisi, besides insisting upon their absolute exemption from liability to contribute to the county school rate for the support of the schools of the county, raise two objections to the issuing of the peremptory mandamus: 1st. They rely upon an act of the Legislature passed in 1877, whereby it was enacted that in no year should a sum in excess of $15,000 for all ordinary and extraordinary expenses be levied upon the ratepayers of the town; and 2nd. They say that the rate payers of the town are now quite different persons from those who were ratepayers of the years 1874, 5, 6, 7 and 8, upon whom the burden, if any, was imposed of providing a fund to pay for the education of the children of the ratepayers of those years, and they insist upon the injustice of calling upon the present ratepayers for what the ratepayers of the above years should alone have paid.\nIn consideration of these points insuperable objections to our granting this exceptional process present themselves; for assuming the liability of the ratepayers of the town in the above years, and the rate when collected to have been payable to the county school fund in the hands of the county treasurer, under the provisions of ch. 32 of the 4th series of the revised statutes, it was leviable and payable for a special purpose occurring only in those years respectively, namely, the support of common schools and the payment of teachers' salaries in those years, in which special purpose, according to the contention of the applicants for the mandamus, the schools of the town were equally interested with those of the county. But all those schools have been supported and all their teachers paid in those years; in the town, at the sole expense of the town, without any assistance whatever from the county, and in the county at the sole expense of the county. The purpose then for which the levy on the ratepayers of the town, if authorized, was authorized, was satisfied in each year without any contribution by the town to the county school fund. The levy, therefore, if now made, assuming it to have been leviable by authority of the county upon the rate payers of the town, cannot be required for the purpose of being applied to the purpose for which it was originally established and the town would have been entitled to receive a share of the whole fund in proportion to the attendance of pupils at their schools; so that in no event could the county receive the whole amount demanded. But as the monies, if levied now, could not be applied to the purpose to which, if leviable in the above years respectively, they were applicable, for what purpose can they be now recovered? To no purpose, as it appears to me, could they when levied be now applied unless it be to reimburse the county for such amount, if any, as they may have been compelled to pay, in each of the above years, in support of their own schools in excess of what would have fallen upon them if the town had contributed the amounts now claimed to have been the proportions which in each of the above years they should have contributed to the common fund. But as the town schools, according to the contention of the county, would have been entitled to share in the fund in proportion to the attendance of pupils at their schools; a proportion which has never been ascertained and probably cannot now be, and if ascertainable, the fund cannot now be applied to the purpose for which it was established; the amount if any there be which the county could claim by way of re-imbursement never has been, and probably cannot now be, ascertained. Certain however it is that they are not entitled as they claim to be, to demand and recover now the whole of the rate which they say the town should have contributed in each year to the fund, deducting nothing for the amount the town schools would have been entitled to receive from the fund in each year. Moreover there is nothing to show that the county incurred and paid any greater sum in the support of their schools, or that those schools received in the above years, from general county funds, a greater sum, or that they were entitled to receive in proportion to the attendance of pupils at their schools any greater sum, than the county school fund, as actually received by the county treasurer in those years, was sufficient to pay. We have no means now of knowing what amount of the common fund if the town had contributed to it in those years would have been applicable to distribution among the county schools and for their support and how much for distribution among the town schools if distributed under ch. 32 of the 4th series, and the town having received nothing in those years from the fund, we are furnished with no information, and we cannot tell whether the amount received by the county schools in those years from the fund actually received by the county treasurer as the common school fund of those years was greater or less, and if less how much less, than would have been the share of those schools respectively if the contribution of the town had been added to the fund and the share which the town schools would have been entitled to receive in proportion to the average attendance of pupils had been drawn from it also. What sum, therefore, if any there be, which the county should now receive by way of reimbursement is unknown and can only be ascertained in an action properly framed and adequate to establish the amount to be due, if anything be due, as a debt from the town to the county. It is, however, clear that the amount, if any, which the county could establish a right to recover would not be the amount of the whole of the town's proportion of contribution to the fund in each year assuming the town to have been liable to contribute at all to it. If the county can establish a claim against the town, as for a debt, by way of reimbursement or otherwise, it is by action and not by mandamus that they should proceed. If entitled to recover in such an action the town may be able by the issue of debentures or otherwise to pay the debt without violating the provisions of the act of 1877. This court, in my opinion, has no jurisdiction to compel, by the prerogative writ of mandamus, the levying of an amount in one year in excess of what the law permits to be levied in one year; nor in a case within its jurisdiction should it by such a summary and exceptional process order this large sum now claimed to be levied on the present ratepayers, which sum is not required for the purpose of being, and which in the nature of things cannot be, applied to the purposes for which in each of the above years the rate was authorized to be levied, and which can only be wanted and recovered for the purpose of re-imbursing the county for some advance made by it to supply the place of the monies not contributed by the town in the respective years named to the county school rate, the amount of which advance, if any was ever in fact made, being unknown. In such a case it would, in my opinion, be the duty of the court to abstain from enforcing a doubtful demand by this exceptional prerogative process and it should leave the county to establish their right to recover by an action brought for the purpose of determining their right and ascertaining the amount if right there be.\nThe court must be satisfied that there is a legal duty imposed upon the defendants to comply with all that is commanded by the writ. * * * It is quite settled that if any part of what is commanded by a peremptory mandamus goes beyond the legal obligation the whole must be set aside.\nThis is the language of Lord Campbell C.J. in Regina v. Caledonian Railway[10].\nBailey J. in Rex v. Lincolns Inn[11] says\nThe right to the thing demanded and an obligation to do it must concur.\nAs to the point of levying upon the present ratepayers what should have been levied if at all upon the several ratepayers of the years 1874\u20135\u20136\u20137\u2013and\u20138. Lord Abinger says in Woods v. Reid[12] The general inconvenience of retrospective rates has been long known and recognized in the courts of law on the ground that succeeding inhabitants cannot legitimately be made to pay for services of which their predecessors had the full benefit.\nI can conceive no case to which this language is more applicable than to an attempt to levy on the ratepayers of 1886 sums of money which were only required in 1874, 5, 6, 7, and 8 to support the schools where the children of the ratepayers of those years were educated and which sums were wanted for no other purpose. If any persons suffered by the educational power of the schools having been impaired in those years it must have been the ratepayers of those years; and if the school fund of those years, without any contribution from the ratepapers of the town, was sufficient to maintain the schools for the school going population of the county in those years no damage would seem to have been suffered by anyone to warrant the levying now, retrospectively, of rates on the ratepayers of the town[13]. And in The County of Frontenac v. The City of Kingston[14], where the county sued the city in debt for monies which it was alleged the city should have levied on their ratepayers in previous years as their contribution to the jury fund, Wilson J. at pp. 595\u20136 says:\u2014\nIf this were a motion for a mandamus on the city to levy a rate to satisfy the claims now sued for, the argument that the claims were of that nature and standing that they could not be lawfully levied from the present ratepayers would be a conclusive answer,\n* * * * * *\nfor the debt claimed would not be the debt of those who are now the ratepayers any more than the baker's or butcher's bill against the former occupant of a house is the debt of the present occupant.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the defendants here are entitled to judgment upon both grounds urged, namely, that the court has no jurisdiction to order a rate to be levied which it would not be lawful to levy as being in excess of what is permitted to be levied in any one year by the statute of 1877 and also because of the retrospective character of the rate sought to be levied and the impossibility of applying it to the purposes for which if levied in the years 1874\u20135\u20136\u20137--and\u20138, it would have been applied in those years, namely, the support of the schools of those years. As, however, the question of the liability of the ratepayers of the town in these years to contribute at all to the county school fund has been raised, and as it is important to all the parties interested that this point should be finally determined as a guide for the action of the town in future years, and as it is competent for us to decide it upon the present proceedings, I think we ought to do so; and being of opinion for the reasons already given that the ratepayers of the town were not in the above years, and are not, liable to contribute to the common school fund for the support of the schools of the county and that therefore the county has no right to recover the amount demanded or any part thereof by action or otherwise I think we ought to rest our judgment upon this ground and allow the appeal and order judgment to be entered for the defendants on the demurrer. The judgment in the other case will be the same in substance but in form it will be to allow the appeal and to order the rule nisi for quashing the mandamus to be made absolute.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellants: B.

Ontario\nBank v. Wilcox[1] distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] affirming a judgment of the Divisional Court[3] in favor of the respondent.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the judgments of the court.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Dougall Q.C. for the appellants. The question of change of possession is one of fact which has been found in our favor on the trial, and this court should be governed by that finding. The act requires an actual and continued change of possession. Here the seller remains in possession and puts the buyer in possession also. There was no actual change of possession; if there was, there was no continued change of possession The statute is not satisfied by the seller giving up possession for a short time and then resuming it again.\nLingard v. Messiter[4] shows what the law, as between creditors and purchasers, was prior to any statute defining it. If a person sells goods and still remains in possession, the presumption in law is, that he is still the owner. Doyle v. Lasher[5].\nThe following authorities were relied on: Carscallen v. Moodie[6]; McLeod v. Hamilton[7]; Ontario Bank v. Wilcox[8]; Ex parte Hooman. In re Vining[9]; Ancona v. Rogers[10]; Whiting v. Hovey[11]; Ex parte Lewis. In re Henderson[12]; Ex parte Jay. In re Blenkhorn[13]; Edwards v. Edwards[14]; Carter v. Grasset[15].\nW. Cassels Q.C. and Holman for the respondent. All the judges in the court below have found that the sale was bon\u00e2 fide and valid, and this court is asked, after three courts have pronounced on the question of fact, to grope through the evidence to find a fraud on the part of Morton.\nThe argument for the appellants, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson, virtually is that where a purchaser employs the seller as his clerk the sale may be set aside. But that is creating a statute.\nThe following cases were cited: Vicarino v. Hoiingsworth[16]; Hater. Kennedy[17]; Smith v. Wall[18]; Heward v. Mitchell[19].\nMcCarthy Q.C, in reply, cited: Snarr v. Smith[20]; Burnham v. Waddell[21].\nSir W.J. Ritchie C.J.\u2014This is an interpleader proceeding. The judgment creditor claims to have a right to the goods, because, though there was a transfer of the goods he alleges there was no continued change of possession and no registration. The learned judge who tried the case found, and the Court of Appeal entertained the same opinion, that this was a fair and bon\u00e2 fide transaction.\nThen it is said that there was no change of possession after the transfer. The purchaser went into possession and employed the clerk of the seller who locked the store in the middle of the day for which the new owner dismissed him. He then, not having a person competent to take charge of the business, employed the seller to act as his clerk for a certain time, which he did. The respondent went on purchasing goods, added to his stock and the change of business was advertised in the local papers, and it was known to everybody in the neighborhood that the purchaser was in the store as proprietor and that the goods had been transferred by the seller who ceased to have any interest in them. \u201cBut\u201d says the appellant, \u201cthat may be very true but you had no right to employ this man, even admitting the bon\u00e2 fides of the transaction.\u201d Why such an employment per se should be treated as fraud I cannot see; in connection with other circumstances it might be evidence of want of bon\u00e2 fides in the transaction but I think all the circumstances very clearly show that the transaction was a bon\u00e2 fide one and that there was a perfect and continuous change in the possession.\nGibbons v. Hickson[22], which I was not aware of at the time of the argument, appears to me to be this case exactly.\nIn that case Huddlestone B. says:\nIn this case the rule must be discharged.\nIt is clear that the goods in question were sold bon\u00e2 fide by Harrison to Gibbons, and the transaction was carried out by a deed of assignment, which provided that Harrison should remain as manager of the shop\u2014that is, as a servant of the defendant. Now, this being a transfer of personal chattels comes within the definition of a \u201cbill of sale\u201d contained in the Bills of Sale Act, 1878, s. 4, and, therefore ought prim\u00e2 facie to have been registered under section 8 of the same Act. But it is contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the goods in question were not in the \u201capparent possession\u201d of Harrison at the time of the execution, and consequently, the deed of assignment is exempted from the operation of the statute. Let us examine the facts. The plaintiff took possession of everything in the shop, going round with an inventory to check the articles in stock; he took this deed of assignment from Harrison, whom he retained in the shop, but only as his paid servant. He changed the name over the shop from Harrison to Harrison & Co; he sent circulars to all Harrison\u2019s customers, and others besides, telling them that the business had changed hands. Not content with this, he advertised the fact three times in the newspapers, and finally wrote a letter to the defendants themselves on the subject, which they answered. I think that, with these facts before him, the county court judge was justified in directing the jury that there was evidence of a general knowledge of the change of ownership of the goods. As to the case of Pichard v. Marriage, there notice of the change of ownership was not given to the public as here. In Gough v. Everard, which was a case under the old Bills of Sale Act (the interpretation clause of which, 17 & 18 Vic, ch. 36, sec. 7, is in identical terms with that of the act now in force, as far as regards the meaning of the phrase \u201capparent possession,\u201d Bramwell B. says I construe this clause to mean that the goods shall be deemed to be in the \u201capparent possession\u201d of the vendor as long as they are \u2018on premises occupied by him, if nothing more has been done than \u201cthe mere formal taking possession; but that where, as in the present case, far more than mere formal possession has been taken, the clause does not apply.\u201d\nIn this case, also, I am of opinion that \u201cfar more than mere formal possession has been taken,\u201d and that, therefore, the county court judge was right, and this appeal must be dismissed.\nThe present case seems to me a much stronger case of actual continuous and notorious change of possession than that of Gibbons v. Hickson. I think the appeal in this case should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J\u2014Possession is a question of fact, not of law. Certain legal results, such as acquisition of title under the statute of limitations, and the right to defend possession and re\u2011acquire it after loss or forcible taking away, are legal consequences of possession; but, in itself, it is a pure question of fact, consisting as it does of the power of physical disposition of the thing which is the subject of it coupled with the intention to possess as owner. These considerations are material here as showing that the question we have to determine in the present case is entirely one of evidence, and consequently that decided cases can have little or no bearing upon the decision of this appeal. Facts which, in other cases, have been held to warrant certain inferences, may, in the present case, lead to no such conclusion. The voluminous evidence before us, taken in conjunction with the finding of the learned judge who presided at the trial, and who saw and heard the witnesses give their testimony, that the sale was bon\u00e2 fide, can, in my opinion, only lead to the conclusion that the respondent was actually put in possession of these goods as the owner, and retained such possession continuously up to the date of the seizure. From the date of the sale the respondent, exclusive of all other persons, had full control and dominion over the goods, and they were subject to his disposition, and such as were sold were actually disposed of by him. There was, therefore, that actual and continued change from the prior possession of the assignor which the statute requires.\nAgain, the publicity and notoriety of this sale the bon\u00e2 fides of which, in view of the facts established and found by the learned judge at the trial, cannot be questioned, is almost conclusive to show that there was an actual change of possession, since, if the sale itself was bona fide and was really and honestly intended to effect a transfer of the property, there could be no object in making a merely fictitious or colorable change in the possession; and I am of opinion that this is in no way contradicted by any presumption arising from the employment of the former owner as a clerk, under the circumstances detailed in the evidence. The goods were not in the possession of the clerk in this case, any more than goods exposed for sale in a shop can in any sense, be said to be in the possession of a clerk or servant of the proprietor employed to sell them, and it calls for no demonstration to show that in such a case the relation of the clerk or salesman to the goods which he is employed to sell is not that of possession.\nIf the words of the act had been stronger than they are, and had required, not merely an actual, but an open and notorious change of possession, the proof would have been quite sufficient to have established it.\nAlthough decided cases are not controlling authorities on a mere question of fact like the present, yet it is satisfactory to find, that under circumstances precisely similar to those before us in this case it has been held in England that the apparent possession was not to be considered as remaining in the assignor, but as having passed to the assignee. This appears from the case of Gibbons v. Hickson[23] to which I have been referred by the Chief Justice who has cited it in his judgment.\nThe evil which the statute of Ontario was intended to remedy was that which arose in the case of a transfer of property of goods in which a mere formal possession was delivered but which were allowed to remain in the house or building, or upon the premises, in the occupation of the assignor, and so in his apparent possession, which is not the case here, inasmuch as the possession of the store in which the goods were was contemporaneous with the sale acquired by the respondent.\nThis appeal is, in my opinion, entirely without foundation, and should be dismissed with costs.\nFournier J. concurred.\nHenry J.\u2014One William Morton, who had a general store of merchandise at Campbellford, Ontario, in 1881, on the 25th of August in that year sold out his stock in trade for a valuable consideration to the respondent, delivered the goods to him and gave him two keys of the shop, one of which the respondent gave to Mr. Kay, a former clerk of Morton\u2019s, retaining the other himself. Mr. Ray opened the shop the next morning, but locked it up in the afternoon, whereupon a dispute arose, and the respondent discharged him, paying him $5.00 for his services. The respondent thereupon requested and obtained the services of Morton and agreed to pay him $1.50 a day as wages and a sum sufficient to pay his wife\u2019s board. The local paper of the village of the first of September, contained a notice of the change of the business and its transfer to the respondent, and it was generally known in the village on the 26th August. On the 15th September the respondent procured further aid in the shop, and Morton was frequently absent attending to business of his own. He, however, ceased to act for the respondent about the first week in October, when one Ingersoll was retained by the respondent in his place.\nThe learned judge of first instance found that the sale was bon\u00e2 fide and his finding on that point has been sustained by the courts before whom the case has been considered, and there is, in my opinion, no reason to doubt its correctness. The same learned judge, however, also found that there was no such actual and continued change of the possession of the goods as required by the statute, and gave judgment for the appellants. He seems to have arrived at that conclusion from decisions which he cited and remarked upon. I have carefully looked at those cases, and find they are not at all applicable to the facts of this case, and that, if the transaction, as we must hold it, was in good faith, the decision in the cases referred to does not affect the question under consideration.\nIf the evidence given by the witnesses for the respondent is to be relied on, and it is not only uncontradicted but of such a character as to entitle it to credence, I am at a loss to find that the possession of the goods by the respondent was not actual and continued. He was given the actual possession and the keys of the store. He, and he alone, by himself and those in his service, had the continued control of the shop and the sales made in it after the delivery of the goods and the keys to him. How, then, can it be said that anyone else participated as owner or claiming any right to the goods in that possession? The evidence establishes the fact that Morton did not participate in that possession except as the paid employee of the respondent and only to the extent necessary to perform the services to the respondent that he was hired for. His acting in the shop as salesman where there is a question of bon\u00e2 fides as to the sale might be an element in the evidence to establish a fraudulent sale; but where the sale is admitted to have been bon\u00e2 fide, the mere fact of his acting as the clerk or assistant of the respondent cannot in the slightest degree affect the question of possession.\nI do not consider it necessary to say more than that I fully concur in the views of the majority of the learned judges of the Divisional Court, of Chief Justice Cameron and the learned judges of the Appeal Court who concurred with him, and think the appeal herein should be dismissed with costs,\nGwynne J.\u2014These are interpleader issues in which the above respondent was plaintiff and the appellants were defendants. The learned judge before whom the issues were tried found as matters of fact that the goods which consisted of the stock in trade in a general store in the village of Campbellford belonging to one William Morton were, on the 25th day of August, 1881, bon\u00e2 fide sold for valuable consideration paid therefor to the plaintiff into whose actual possession the goods were then delivered by Morton; that the plaintiff having received from Morton the keys of the store, on that 25th of August in the evening delivered one set of the keys to one Mckay who had been Morton\u2019s clerk and between whom and the plaintiff a partnership was contemplated directing him to open the store in the morning and took the other set away himself which he took home with him; no one slept in the building where the store was; that on the following day McKay opened the store in the morning but that in the afternoon a quarrel occurred between him and the plaintiff and the latter dismissed him paying him $5.00; that not being able at the moment to procure another clerk the plaintiff proposed to Morton to remain in the store and to take charge of it for the plaintiff in selling the goods, keeping the books &c., until the plaintiff could get a clerk; that Morton being about to enter into some other employment at first expressed himself unwilling to do as the plaintiff requested but finally yielded to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitation and agreed to remain at $1.50 per day and a sum sufficient for his wife\u2019s board to be paid by the plaintiff; that the change was advertised in the papers on the 1st September and became generally known in the village after it occurred; that on the 15th of September the plaintiff hired a lad to assist him; that from the time that Morton was hired by the plaintiff he was occasionally absent on his own business but continued in the plaintiff\u2019s service until the 1st of October when the plaintiff hired one Ingersoll as a salesman and Morton oocasionally attended for a day or two afterwards explaining the business to Ingersoll and assisting in sales; that the plaintiff himself was in the store a good part of the time, and to this it may be added that a large mass of evidence showed that he appeared to be the owner and was so understood to be by persons frequenting the store and the inhabitants of the village generally; that the sales were regularly entered in a new set of books which the plaintiff on purchasing the stock had opened. The goods were taken under executions on the 5th October.\nUpon this state of facts the learned judge, while he found as matter of fact that the sale to the plaintiff was made in good faith on the part of both parties and for valuable consideration and that the plaintiff was not aware that any of the securities transferred in payment of the price was defective in character or deficient in value, and while he also held that upon the sale there had been an actual immediate transfer of the goods by the vendor into the possession of the plaintiff, he nevertheless held that he was comvelled to the conclusion that upon the facts as found by him, and above stated, there was no such actual and continued change of possession as the statute requires and for this reason, and this reason only, he rendered his verdict for the defendants. What the learned judge plainly conveys by saying in his judgment: \u201clam compelled to the conclusion,\u201d &c., &c., &c., is that this conclusion, namely, that no such actual and continued change of possession had followed the actual delivery of the goods to the plaintiff, as the statute requires, was forced upon him by the judicial decisions in the cases which he had just enumerated and reviewed.\nNow, when the motion to set aside this verdict and to enter judgment for the plaintiff upon the facts appearing in evidence and the finding of the learned iudge as to the bon\u00e2 fides of the transaction and the actual delivery of the goods to the plaintiff, was made in the court above what was, or were, the question or questions, raised before the Divisional Court in which the motion was made?\nPlainly, as it appears to me, the following and only those:\u2014\n1st. Did the learned judge form a correct conception of the decided cases, when he held that they compelled him to arrive at the conclusion that, as matter of fact, the actual delivery of the goods which he found to have been made to the plaintiff upon a bon\u00e2 fide sale for valuable consideration was not followed by such an actual and continued change of possession as was contemplated by the statute?\nAnd if the court should be of opinion that the decided cases did not necessitate such a conclusion then the duty was cast upon the court of determining as matter of fact\n2nd. Whether, assuming the transaction to have been a bon\u00e2 fide sale and an immediate delivery made thereon, as found by the learned judge, the evidence did or not show that such delivery was followed by an actual and continued change of possession, as required by the statute? and\n3rd. Was the finding of the learned judge as to the bon\u00e2 fides of the transaction so clearly erroneous as to require the Divisional Court to set aside the learned judge\u2019s finding upon that point and to render a verdict and judgment for the defendant upon that ground?\nAs to the first of the above questions I entirely concur with the judgment of the majority of the Divisional Court that the decided cases did not necessitate the conclusion the learned judge arrived at and upon this point I should not say anything in addition to the observations made by Chief Justice Cameron and the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, who have concurred with him, if language of my own in the case of the Ontario Bank v. Wilcox[24] was not given an interpretation very different from what I intended the language to bear and from what I think it does bear and which was relied upon in support of the contention in this case, namely, that a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser of goods for valuable consideration paid can in no case be protected in his purchase if he employs the vendor as his clerk after the sale and delivery of the goods. In that case the mortgagor of chattels which consisted of a quantity of lumber in his own yard, remained in actual possession, dealing with the lumber as owner just as he had been before the mortgage was executed. Upon an assignment of the mortgage having been made to the Ontario Bank it was agreed between the mortgagor and the bank that the former should continue in possession precisely as before and should continue selling the lumber, but that he should render weekly accounts to the bank of all sales. The bank, finding that the promised weekly returns of sales were not regularly made, put one Wharton into the lumber yard, in charge for the bank, under and subject to special instructions not to interfere with the mortgagor selling the lumber, nor to exercise control in any way further than to see that the mortgagor should make due returns to the bank of his sales; and to enable Wharton to conform to these instructions, the mortgagor pointed out to him what lumber in his yard was that which was covered by the chattel mortgage and over which his control was limited. The mortgagor had never been divested of his possession of the lumber, which remained always in his possession as it had originally been, unaffected in any way save as his sales were made subject to the control of Wharton, under the above special instructions given to him. It is to this state of facts that the language which is relied upon relates, and by it I meant to convey, as I thought at the time and still think that the language simply does convey, that the possession or control, such as it was, that Wharton had, never having excluded the original possession of the mortgagor, the right of his creditors had not been excluded. This case I cannot think open to the construction put upon it by the learned counsel for the defendants.\nNow, the decided cases not necessitating the conclusion which, upon their assumed authority, the learned judge arrived at, the question of fact as to the actual and continued change of possession remained undecided and open for the Divisional Court to decide; and they being of opinion that the finding of the learned judge who tried the issues as to the bon\u00e2 fides of the transaction could not successfully be questioned, came to the conclusion that the evidence did, to their satisfaction, establish that the delivery of the goods to the plaintiff upon the sale had been followed by such an actual and continued change of possession as excluded the claim of the creditors of the vendor; and they, therefore, rendered a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs, which, in my opinion, should be sustained. Whatever force there is in the objection taken by the defendants, and so strongly urged on their behalf, namely, that the delivery of the goods had not been followed by an actual and continued change of possession, seems to me to point to and to affect rather the question of the bon\u00e2 fides of the transaction than the question of whose was the possession after the sale and after the delivery, continuously, until the seizure. The finding of a person who had been the open and notorious owner of chattels, still selling the goods, but calling himself the clerk of a person claiming to be the purchaser of the goods from him, may be a badge of fraud requiring explanation; but if a satisfactory explanation be given and the sale is shown to have taken place in good faith and that the vendor was actually and in good faith hired and employed by the purchaser as his clerk or salesman, the possession which such a person in such case has is not the original possession which he had as owner, but is a wholly new possession which is that of his employer the purchaser; and when, as here, the change in the character in which the original owner is found dealing with the goods and the fact of the sale are found to have been notorious, to hold that the bon\u00e2 fide delivery of the goods had not been followed by such an actual and continued possession as the statute requires would be, as it seems to me, to make the statute operate to commit rather than to redress a fraud.

J. Ritchie, C. J., and Strong, Fournier, Henry, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nPetition of Right Act, 1876, sec. 7\u2014Statute of Limitations\u201432 Henry 8 ch. 9\u2014Rideau Canal Act, 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1\u20146 Wm. 4 ch. 16\u20147 Vic. ch. 11 sec. 29\u20149 Vic. ch. 42\u2014Deed\u2014Construction of\u2014Estoppel.\nUnder the provisions of 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1, generally known as the Rideau Canal Act, Lt.-Colonel By, who was employed to superintend the work of making said canal, set out and ascertained 110 acres or thereabouts, part of 600 acres or thereabouts theretofore granted to one Grace McQueen, as necessary for making and completing said canal, but only some 20 acres were actually used for canal purposes. Grace McQueen died intestate, leaving Alexander McQueen, her husband, and William McQueen, her eldest son and heir-at-law, her surviving. After her death, on the 31st January, 1832, Alexander McQueen released to William McQueen all his interest in the said lands, and by deed of Feb. 6th, 1832 the said William McQueen conveyed the whole of the lands originally granted to Grace McQueen to said Lt.-Colonel By in fee for \u00a31,200.\nBy 6 William 4 ch. 16, persons who acquired title to lands used for the purpose of the canal after the commencement of the works, but who had purchased before such commencement, were enabled to claim compensation.\nBy the Ordnance Vesting Act, 7 Vic. ch. 11, the Rideau Canal, and the lands and works belonging thereto, were vested in the principal officers of H. M. Ordnance in Great Britain, and by sec. 29 it was enacted: \"Provided always, and be it enacted, that all lands taken from private owners at Bytown under the authority of the Rideau Canal Act for the use of the canal, which have not been used for that pupose, be restored to the party or parties from whom the same were taken.\"\nBy 9 Vic. ch. 42, Canada, it was recited that the foregoing proviso had given rise to doubts as to its true construction, and it was enacted that the proviso should be construed to apply to all the land at Bytown set out and ascertained and taken from Nicholas Sparks, under 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1, except certain portions actually used for the canal, and provision was made for payment of compensation to Sparks for the land retained for canal purposes, and for revesting in him and his grantees the portions of lands taken but not required for such purposes.\nBy the 19-20 Vic. ch. 45, the Ordnance properties became vested in Her Majesty for the uses of the late Province of Canada, and by the British North America Act they became vested in Her Majesty for the use of the Dominion of Canada.\nThe appellant, the heir-at-law of William McQueen, by her petition of right sought to recover from the crown 90 acres of the land originally taken by Colonel By, but not used for the purposes of the canal, or such portion thereof as still remained in the hands of the crown, and an indemnity for the value of such portions of these 90 acres as had been sold by the crown.\nHeld per Gwynne J. (in the Exchequer)\u2014Under the statute 8 Geo. IV the original owner and his heirs did not become divested of their estate in the land until after the expiration of the period given by the act for the officer in charge to enter into a voluntary agreement with such owner, unless in virtue of an agreement with such owner. Nor was there any conversion of realty into personalty effected by the act until after the expiration of said period. By the deed made by William McQueen of the 6th February. 1832, all his estate in the 110 acres, as well as in the residue of the 600 acres, passed and became extinguished, such deed operating as a contract or agreement made with Col. By as agent of His Majesty within the provisions of the act and so vesting the 110 acres absolutely in His then Majesty, his heirs and successors.\n2. Such deed was not avoided by the statute 32 Hy. VIII ch. 9, Col. By being in actual possession as the servant and on behalf of His Majesty and taking the deed from William McQueen while out of possession, the statute having been passed to make void all deeds executed to the prejudice of persons in possession by persons out of possession to persons out of possession, under the circumstances stated in the act.\n3. There was no reversion or revesting of any portion of the land taken by reason of its ceasing to be used for canal purposes. When land required for a particular purpose is ascertained and determined by the means provided by the Legislature for that purpose, and the estate of the former owner in the land has been by like authority divested out of him and vested in the crown, or in some persons or body authorized by the legislature to hold the expropriated land for the public purpose, if the estate of which the former owner is so divested be the fee simple, there is no reversion nor anything in the nature of a reversionary right left in him in virtue of which he can at any subsequent time claim upon any principle of the common law to have any portion of the land of which he was so divested to be revested in him by reason of its ceasing to be used for the purpose for which it was expropriated.\n4. Assuming that Grace McQueen had by operation of the act become divested of her estate in the land in her lifetime and that her right had become converted into one merely of a right to compensation which upon her death passed as personalty, the non-payment of any demand which her personal representative might have had could not be made the basis or support of a demand at the suit of the heir-at-law of William McQueen to have revested in him any portion of the lands described in the deed of the 6th February, 1832, after the execution of that deed by him, whether effectual or not for passing the estate which it professed to pass.\n5. The proviso in the 29th section of 7 Vic. chap. 11, as explained by 9 Vic. ch. 42, was limited in its application to the lands which were originally the property of Nicholas Sparks and not conveyed or surrendered by voluntary grant executed by him and for which no compensation or consideration had been given to him.\n6. Her Majesty could not be placed in the position of trustee of the lands in question unless by the express provisions of an act of Parliament to which she would be an assenting party.\nIn the Supreme Court held:\u2014\n1. Per Ritchie C.J. By the deed of the 6th February, 1832, the title to the lands passed out of William McQueen, but assuming it did not, he was estopped by his own act and could not have disputed the validity and general effect of his own deed, nor can the suppliant who claims under him.\n2. Per Ritchie C.J. and Strong and Gwynne JJ. The suppliant is debarred from recovering by the Statute of Limitations, which the crown has a right to set up in defence under the 7th section of the Petition of Right Act of 1876.\n3. Per Strong J. Independently of this section, the crown, having acquired the lands from persons in favor of whom the statute had begun to run before the possession was transferred to the crown that body incorporated under the title of \"The Principal Officers of Ordnance\" would be entitled to the benefit of the statute.\n4. Per Strong J. The act 9 Vic., ch. 42 had not the effect of restricting the operation of the revesting clause of 7 Vic. ch. 11 to the lands of Nicholas Sparks, and was passed to clear up doubts as to the case of Nicholas Sparks and not to deprive other parties originally coming within sec. 29 of 7 Vic. ch. 11 of the benefit of that enactment.\n5. Per Strong J. A petition of right is an appropriate remedy for the assertion by the suppliant of any title to relief under sec. 29. Where it is within the power of a party having a claim against the crown of such a nature as the present to resort to a petition of right a mandamus will not lie, and a mandamus will never under any circumstances be granted where direct relief is sought against the crown.\n6. Per Strong J. By the express terms of the 3rd section of 8 Geo. IV ch. 1, the title to lands taken for the purposes of the canal vested absolutely in the crown so soon as the same were, pursuant to the act, set out and ascertained as necessary for the purposes of the canal; and all that Grace McQueen could have been entitled to at her death was the compensation provided by the act to be ascertained in the manner therein prescribed, and this right to receive and recover the money at which this compensation should be assessed vested, on her death, in her personal representative as forming part of her personal estate. Therefore as regards the 110 acres nothing passed by the deed of 6th February, 1832. And up to the passing of 7 Vic. ch. 11, no compensation had ever been paid by the crown, nor any decision as to compensation binding on the representative of Grace McQueen.\n7. Per Strong J. The proviso in sec. 29 of 7 Vic. ch. 11 applied to the 90 acres not used for the purposes of the canal, and had the effect of revesting the original estate in William McQueen as the heir-at-law of his mother, subject to the effect upon his title of the deed of 6th February, 1832. But if it had the effect of revesting the land in the personal representative, the suppliant is not such personal representative and would therefore fail.\n8. Per Strong J. This deed did not work any legal estoppel in favor of Col. By which would be fed by the statute vesting the legal estate in William McQueen, the covenants for title by themselves not creating any estoppel. But if a vendor, having no title to an estate, undertakes to sell and convey it for valuable consideration his deed, though having no present operation either at law or in equity, will bind any interest which the vendor may afterwards acquire even by purchase for value in the same property, and in respect of such after acquired interest he will be considered by a court of equity to be a trustee for the original purchaser, and he, or his heir-at-law, will be compelled to convey to such purchaser accordingly. In other words, the interest so subsequently acquired will be considered as \"feeding\" the claim of the purchaser arising under the original contract of sale, and the vendor will not be entitled to retain it for his own use. Therefore, if the suppliant were granted the relief asked, the land and money recovered by her would in equity belong to the heirs of Col. By.\nAlthough nothing passed under the deed of the 6th February, 1832, yet the suppliant could not withhold from the heirs or representative of Col. By anything she might recover from the crown under the 29th section of 7 Vic. ch. 11, but the heirs or representatives of Col. By would in turn become constructive trustees for the crown of what they might so recover by force of the rule of equity forbidding purchases by fiduciary agents for their own benefit.\n9. Per Strong J. The deed of the 6th February, 1832, being in equity constructively a contract by William McQueen to sell and convey any interest in the land which he or his heirs might afterwards acquire, there is nothing in the statute 32 Henry 8 ch. 9, or in the rules of the common law avoiding contracts savoring of maintenance, conflicting with this use of the deed.\n10. Per Fournier and Henry JJ. The mere setting out and ascertaining of the lands was not sufficient to vest the property in His Majesty, and Grace McQueen having died without having made any contract with Col. By the property went to William McQueen her heir-at-law.\n1. Per Fournier, Henry and Taschereau JJ. The deed of the 6th February, 1832, made before the passing of 7 Vic. ch. 11 sec. 29, and five years after the crown had been in possession of the property in question, conveyed no interest in such property either to Col. By personally or as trustee for the crown, and the title therefore remained in the heirs of Grace McQueen.\n2. The proviso in sec. 29 of 7 Vic. ch. 11 was not limited by 9 Vic. ch. 42 to the lands of Nicholas Sparks and the appellant is entitled to invoke the benefit of it.\n3. The 90 acres now used for the purposes of the Canal did not by 19. Vic. c. 54 become vested in Her Majesty, nor were they transferred by the B. N. A. Act to the exclusive control of the Dominion Parliament. The words \"adjuncts of the canal\" in the first schedule of the B. N. A. Act could only apply to those things necessarily required and used for the working of the canal.\n4. The crown was not entitled to set up the Statute of Limitations as a defence by virtue of sec. 7 of the Petition of Right Act, 1876, that section not having any retroactive effect.\n5. Per Fournier, Henry and Tashereau JJ. There could be no estoppel as against William McQueen by virtue of the deed of the 6th February, 1832, in the face of the proviso in 7 Vic. ch. 11.\nThe court being equally divided the appeal was dismissed without costs.\nAppeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne in the Exchequer Court in favor of the crown.\nThe suppliant by her petition of right alleged:\u2014\nParagraph 1. That by letters patent dated the 20th May, 1801, under the great seal of the province of Upper Canada, lots lettered E and D, in concession C, in the township of Nepean, containing 400 acres, were granted unto one Grace McQueen in fee simple.\nParagraph 2. That by letters patent, dated the 10th day of June, 1801, under the great seal of the said province, lots D and E in broken concession D on the river Rideau in the said township of Nepean were granted unto the said Grace McQueen in fee simple.\nParagraph 3. That the said Grace McQueen entered into possession of the lands so granted to her and, save as hereinafter appears, continued in possession of the said lands down to and at the time of her death.\nParagraph 4. That by an act of the Provincial Parliament of the said province of Upper Canada, viz.: 8 Geo. 4, ch. 1, passed on the 17th of February, 1827, commonly referred to as the Rideau Canal Act, it was enacted (as in this paragraph alleged, but which it is not necessary to set out at large).\nParagraphs 5, 6 and 7. That by the said act it was further enacted, as in these paragraphs alleged, but which it is unnecessary to set out here.\nParagraph 8. That Lieut.-Col. John By, of the Royal Engineers, was the officer employed by His Majesty to superintend the work of making the said Rideau Canal, and he set out and ascertained certain parts of the said parcels or tracts of land comprised in the said two several hereinbefore stated letters patent and deeds of grant respectively, as aforesaid, amounting altogether to 110 acres or thereabouts, as necessary for making and completing the said canal, and other purposes and conveniences mentioned in the before stated act, and said 110 acres were forthwith taken possession of by His said Majesty, his heirs and successors; and the land which he so] set out and ascertained, as aforesaid, was described on a certain plan signed by him and lodged by him in the office of the Surveyor-G-eneral of the said late province of UpperCanada, and now fyled in the office of Her Majesty's Crown Land Department for the province of Ontario.\nParagraph 9. Some time after the passing of the said act the said Grace McQueen died intestate, being at the time of her death possessed of the said parcels or tracts of land comprised in the said two several deeds of grant, or of so much thereof as had not been set out and ascertained for the purposes of the said canal, as before mentioned; and she left Alexander McQueen, her husband, and William McQueen, her eldest son and heir-at-law, her surviving. And on the 31st day of January, 1832, the said Alexander McQueen, by a deed poll of that date, under his hand and seal, released unto the said William McQueen all his right and interest to and in the said parcels of land, to hold the same unto the sole and proper use of the said William McQueen, his heirs and assigns forever.\nParagraph 10. The Rideau Canal was completed and opened for traffic throughout its length some time in the month of May, 1832.\nParagraph 11. That by an act passed the 9th day of December, 1843 (7 Vic. c. 11) the lands and other property therein mentioned, including the Rideau Canal and the lands and woods belonging thereto, were vested in the principal Officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance in Great Britain, and their successors in the principal said office, subject to the provisions of the said act.\nParagraph 12. That on or about the 20th day of October, 1845, the said William McQueen died intestate, leaving the suppliant his only legal issue and his sole heir-at-law,\u2014him surviving.\nParagraph 13. No payment, indemnity or compensation was ever made to the said Grace McQueen, nor to the suppliant, nor to any person entitled to receive the same, in respect of the said part of the said 110 acres so set out as necessary for the canal purposes, but not used for the purposes of the said canal.\nParagraph 14. That the real property adjoining the said lots granted to the said Grace McQueen formerly belonged to one Nicholas Sparks. A portion of this was set out and ascertained as necessary for the purpose of the said canal, and was accordingly taken from the said Nicholas Sparks under the authority of the said Rideau Canal Act. And after the passing of the said Act, 7 Vic. c. 11, the said Nicholas Sparks applied for a restoration of part of the land so taken from him, and thereupon was passed an act of the Provincial Parliament of Canada (9th Vic., c. 42), A.D. 1846, intituled:\u2014'An Act to explain certain provisions of the Ordnance Vesting Act, 7 Vic. c. 11, and to remove certain difficulties which have occurred in carrying the said provisions into effect.'\nParagraphs 15 and 16 set out what is alleged to be the most material part of 9 Vic. c. 42.\nParagraph 17 sets up the suppliant's contention as to what the effect of 7 Vic. c. 11, as explained by 9 Vic. c. 42, was.\nParagraph 18. That in pursuance of the last mentioned act a considerable portion of the land taken from the said Nicholas Sparks for the said Rideau Canal has since been restored to him; but that no part of the land of the said Grace McQueen so set out and taken as aforesaid for canal purposes, held by Her Majesty but not used for canal purposes, to wit: 90 acres or thereabouts of the said 110 acres, has ever been restored to the said Grace McQueen, nor to the said late William McQueen, nor to suppliant.\nParagraphs 19, 20, 21 and 22. That by an act of the Provincial Parliament of Canada, viz., 19 Vic. c. 45, it was among other things enacted as in these paragraphs is alleged.\nParagraph 23. That several years after the death of the late William McQueen, to wit: in 1869-70, suppliant caused to be presented to the Governor General of Canada in Council a memorial urging the facts and circumstances aforestated, and praying for the restoration of the said 90 acres of land, but that no part of the said land has been restored to her.\nParagraphs 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 contain an extended legal argument in support of the suppliant's claim to have the said 90 acres restored to her.\nParagraph 29. The suppliant insists that the said 90 acres not so used for the purpose of the said canal, and which passed to or became vested in Her Majesty therefore have, by lapse, passed to and are now vested in the suppliant, as if the said canal had never been made and the said acts had never been passed; yet Her Majesty's Government in Canada have all along, since the construction of the said canal, taken and held possession of the said 90 acres, and still hold possession thereof, and have taken the rents and profits thereof, and have sold parts thereof,\u2014and made conveyances thereof to purchasers and given possession to such purchasers, and have received the purchase money thereof; and the suppliant submits that Her Majesty should deliver possession to the suppliant of the said land remaining unsold, and should pay to the suppliant the rents and profits of the lands unsold: and, as to the portions of the said lands so sold, should pay the present value thereof, and that the suppliant should have a re-conveyance of all such lands as have not been sold.\nParagraph 30. That by the British North America Act, 1867, the said lands and tenements were transferred to the Dominion of Canada. Paragraph 31. That, in any case, Her Majesty was and is a trustee for the suppliant of all of the said lands that were not actually used for the purposes of the said canal, and it should be so declared. And the prayer of the petition is that all such parts of the said two parcels or tracts of land comprised in the said two several deeds of grant, dated respectively the 20th day of May and the 10th day of June, 1801, as were supposed to be taken to the use of the said Rideau Canal, but not used for that purpose, may be restored to and be re-vested in the suppliant, according to her right and interest to and in the same; and that an account of the rents and profits thereof may be taken, and, together with the costs of this petition, be paid to the suppliant; and as to such portions thereof as have been sold, that the values thereof may be paid to the suppliant, and also the rents and profits thereof prior to the selling thereof by Her Majesty, and that for the purposes aforesaid all necessary orders and decrees may be made and accounts taken.\nTo this petition Her Majesty's Attorney General for the Dominion of Canada has filed an answer, wherein:\u2014\nParagraph 1\u2014He admits that letters patent issued, bearing date respectively the 20th day of May, 1801, and the 10th of June, 1801, as mentioned in the first and second paragraphs of the said petition, whereby certain lands were granted to Grace McQueen in the said petition mentioned.\nParagraph 2 admits the passing of the Act of Parliament of the late province of Upper Canada (being the Act 8 Geo. 4. c. 1), referred to in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh paragraphs of the said petition, to which, however, for greater certainty he refers.\nParagraph 3 admits that Colonel By, in the 8th paragraph of the said petition named, was the officer employed by His late Majesty to superintend the work of making the said canal, and that he set out and ascertained certain parts of the said parcels of land comprised in the said letters patent, comprising altogether 110 acres or thereabouts, as necessary for making and completing said canal, and other purposes and conveniences mentioned in the said act, and that the land which he so set out and ascertained as aforesaid is described in a plan lodged by Colonel By in the office of the Surveyor-General of the late province of Upper Canada, and signed by him.\nParagraph 4 admits that the said Grace McQueen died intestate some time before the 31st day of January, 1832, and after the passing of the said act, but denies that she died seized or possessed of the whole of the said parcels of land; and charges that the parts thereof set out and ascertained by Colonel By, as required for the uses and purposes of the said canal, were at the time of her death vested in His Majesty, and His Majesty was then in possession thereof for the purposes of the said canal.\nParagraph 5 admits that the said Grace McQueen left her husband, Alexander McQueen, her surviving, and also William McQueen, her eldest son and heir-at-law, and admits the execution of the deed dated 31st day of January, 1832, from Alexander McQueen to William McQueen, but denies that any estate or interest in the said lands set out and ascertained by Colonel By, as aforesaid, descended to the said William McQueen or passed to him under said deed.\nParagraph 6 charges that the said Colonel By was, at the time of the execution of the indenture dated 6th February, 1832, hereinafter referred to, an officer in the service of His Majesty the late King William IV, and had in charge for His Majesty the said canal and the works connected therewith, and the lands set apart and taken therefor, including the lands in question in this matter; that by an indenture dated 6th day of February, 1832, made at Bytown, in the late province of Upper Canada, between the said William McQueen and Colonel By, the said William McQueen, for the consideration therein mentioned, granted, conveyed and confirmed unto the said Colonel By, his heirs and assigns forever, all the lands and premises which are the subject matter of the suppliant's petition, together with appurtenances and all the estate, right, title, interest, claim, property and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, of the said William McQueen, of or to or out of the same, and every part thereof; and submits that upon the death of the said William McQueen, after having conveyed to the said Colonel By the said lands and premises, and all his interest therein, no right or interest therein passed to the suppliant, as stated in the twelfth paragraph of her petition, and that she has no title to the said lands and premises and cannot now assert any claim in respect thereof.\nParagraph 7 submits that any interest in the said lands and premises acquired by the said Colonel By, under the said indenture of 6th February, 1832, having been acquired by him under the circumstances above referred to, passed in equity to His Majesty, His successors and assigns, and that Her Majesty the Queen is now entitled thereto.\nParagraph 8 submits that the said conveyance by William McQueen to Colonel By was operative under the provisions of the second section of the said act 8 George IV., c. 1, and passed to the said Colonel By, on behalf of His Majesty, the fee simple and legal estate in the lands so set apart by him for the purposes of the said canal.\nParagraph 9. The ninth section of the said act 8 George IV, ch. 1, provided that in estimating the claim of any individual to compensation for property taken or for damage done under the authority of the act, the arbitrators or jury in assessing such damages should take into their consideration the benefit likely to accrue to such individual from the construction of the said canals, by enhancing the value of his property or producing other advantages.\nParagraph 10. That some time after obtaining the conveyance of the 6th day of February, 1832, Colonel By took proceedings under the said act 8 George IV, ch. 1, to obtain, by arbitration, compensation or damages from His Majesty in respect of the lands comprised in the said conveyance of the 6th day of February, 1832, and that therein he claimed compensation or damages for the lands now in question.\nParagraph 11 charges that an award was duly made in writing in the course of the said arbitration proceedings, whereby it was awarded and determined that by reason of the enhancement of the value of the other land which at the time of her death belonged to the said Grace McQueen, and of other benefits and advantages which accrued to her, and those claiming under her, from the construction of the canal, as provided in the 9th section of the said act, His Majesty was not liable to make compensation for the lands in question in this matter taken under the said act.\nParagraph 12 charges that afterwards Colonel By, being dissatisfied with the said award, duly caused a jury to be summoned under the provisions of the said act, to assess the said damages and compensation claimed by him, and that the jury duly delivered their verdict to the same effect as the said award.\nParagraph 13 submits that by reason of the enhancement of the value of other lands of the said Grace McQueen, and of the other benefits and advantages which accrued to her and those representing her, the crown never became liable to make compensation for the lands in question in this matter.\nParagraph 14 charges that the said William McQueen, as heir-at-law of the said Grace McQueen, inherited the said other lands which had been so enhanced in the value, and by the said deed of 6th February, 1832, sold and conveyed the same to the said Colonel By, and received from him such enhanced value, by reason whereof the said William McQueen received the value of the lands in question in this matter.\nParagraph 15 admits the 7 Vic. ch. 2, and also the 9 Vic. ch. 42, but as to the effect thereof craves leave to refer to said acts.\nParagraph 16 submits that upon the true construction of the said acts the benefit of the said proviso was and is confined to Nicholas Sparks, therein mentioned, and that the same did not extend to the lands in question.\nParagraph 17 submits that the claim against the crown for compensation or damages by reason of the taking of the lands in question in this matter was personal estate of the said Grace McQueen, and passed at her death to her personal representative, and not to her heir-at-law; and by an act (2 Vic. ch. 19) it was expressly enacted that from and after the 1st day of April, 1841, all and every the provision of the said act, 8th year of King George the Fourth, ch. 1, should in respect of claims brought forward after that period, cease and determine.\nParagraph 18. And it was further by the last-mentioned act enacted that claims made before the said 1st day of April, but not duly prosecuted as required by the said act, should thenceforward be barred, as if they had never been made. Paragraph 19. And it was further by the last-mentioned act enacted that it might be lawful for the Lieutenant-Governor to issue a proclamation requiring all persons to prosecute their claims within the time so limited, or that such claims should thereafter be barred.\nParagraph 20 avers that on the 9th day of September, in the last-mentioned year, such proclamation was duly made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Her Majesty's name, and the same was published in the official gazette and claims, on behalf of Her Majesty, the benefit of the said act and proclamation, and submits that thereby all claims of every kind against Her Majesty, in respect of the said lands, by the said Grace McQueen or her representatives, or any person claiming through or under them or either of them, including the suppliant, became and were and are for ever barred on and after the 1st day of April, A.D. 1841.\nParagraph 21 admits that in pursuance of the acts of 1844 and 1846 some part of the lands taken from Nicholas Sparks for the said canal was restored to him, and that no part of the land in question was ever restored to the suppliant, or to those through whom she claims, and charges, that no land taken for the canal from any other person was restored to the owners under the said proviso and acts, other than to the said Sparks.\nParagraph 22 admits the passing of the act of the 19th of June, 1856, (19 and 20 Vic. c. 45), and by virtue thereof the lands in question became vested in Her Majesty for the uses of the late Province of Canada, and craves leave to refer to its provisions.\nParagraph 23 admits that by the British North America Act the same lands, or so much thereof as had not previously been sold or disposed of, became vested in Her Majesty for the use of the Dominion of Canada.\nParagraph 24 denies that Her Majesty is a trustee for the suppliant of the said lands, or any part thereof.\nParagraph 25 charges that from the original setting apart and taking of the said lands, until the year 1843, the said lands were vested in Her Majesty, in right of Her Imperial Crown, during all which time the suppliant, or those through whom she claims, might have proceeded against Her Majesty by petition of right or otherwise in Her Majesty's courts in England, but they never did so.\nParagraph 26 charges that from the year 1843 to the year 1856 the lands in question were vested in the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance, and the said principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance were also during all the times last mentioned in possession thereof, and the suppliant or those under whom she claims might, during all the last mentioned time, have sued and impleaded the said principal officers in the courts of the late province of Canada for the recovery or restoration of the said lands, but they neglected so to do.\nParagraph 27 charges that the suppliant and those under whom she claims have been guilty of such laches and delay in respect of the said claims as precludes the suppliant in equity from now prosecuting the same.\nParagraph 28 claims, under the provisions of the Petition of Right Act, the statutes of limitations.\nParagraph 29 admits the presentation of the memorial mentioned in the 23rd paragraph of the suppliant's petition and that after mature deliberation and consideration the Privy Council refused to entertain it, of which due notice was given to the suppliant.\nParagraph 30 submits on behalf of Her Majesty that the petition shows no grounds for relief against Her Majesty in respect of any of the matters contained therein.\nParagraph 31 submits that under no circumstances is Her Majesty, as representing the Dominion of Canada, answerable or responsible to the suppliant for or in respect of any of the said lands heretofore sold or disposed of, or in respect of the rents and profits of any of the said lands and that the suppliant is not entitled to any such account as prayed for in the said petition.\nUpon this petition and the answer thereto a special case has been agreed upon, which is also divided into paragraphs wherein it is admitted as follows:\u2014\nParagraph 1, admits that by letters patent of the respective dates mentioned in the petition, the lots of land therein mentioned, containing 600 acres, were granted in fee simple to Grace McQueen.\nParagraph 2. That on the 17th February, 1827, the act 8 Geo. IV, ch. 1, (commonly called the Rideau Canal Act), was passed.\nParagraph 3. That on the 18th day of September, A. D. 1827, Grace McQueen died intestate, leaving, her surviving Alexander McQueen, her husband, William McQueen her eldest son and heir-at-law.\nParagraph 4. That as set forth in the 8th paragraph of this petition, prior to the death of Grace McQueen, Colonel By, the officer in charge of the Rideau Canal and works, acting under the provisions of the said Rideau Canal Act, for His then Majesty, for the uses and purposes of the said canal, had, from the parcels of land patented as aforesaid, ascertained, set out and taken possession of one hundred and ten acres thereof which he thought necessary and proper for the purposes of the said canal; and that the officers of Her Majesty, for Her Majesty or the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance, or the purchasers from Her Majesty hereinafter mentioned, as the case may be, have had possession of the same from thence hitherto.\nParagraph 5. That as set forth in the 9th paragraph of the said petition, the said Alexander McQueen, by deed dated 81st January, 1832, released all his right, title and interest in all the said lands to the said William McQueen and his heirs, and that the said Alexander McQueen died in or about the year 1851.\nParagraph 6. That by an indenture dated the 6th February, 1832, a copy of the memorial of which is put in as evidence of its contents, the said Wm. McQueen, for the consideration therein mentioned, purported to grant, convey and confirm all the said lands patented as aforesaid unto the said Col. By, his heirs and assigns.\nParagraph 7. That at the time of the execution of the said indenture the said Col. By was the officer in the service of His Majesty the late King William the Fourth, who had in charge for His Majesty the said canal and the works connected therewith and all the lands set apart and taken therefor.\nParagraph 8. That the Rideau canal was completed and opened for traffic some time in the month of May, 1832.\nParagraph 9. That on the 20th day of April, 1836, the act of the late Province of Upper Canada, 6 Wm. IV. ch. 16, was passed.\nParagraph 10. That on the 11th of May, 1839, the act 2 Vic. c. 19, was passed, and on the 9th of September of that year a proclamation was issued and published as set forth in the 20th paragraph of the answer filed to the suppliant's petition.\nParagraph 11. That on the 9th day of December, 1843, the act 7 Vic. c. 11, was passed. Paragraph 12. That on the 20th day of October, 1845, the said Wm. McQueen died intestate, leaving him surviving the suppliant, Lucy McQueen, who for the purposes of this case is to be treated as his only child, heiress-at-law and next of kin.\nParagraph 13. That A.D. 1846, the act of the Legislature of the late Province of Canada 9 Vic. c. 42, was passed.\nParagraph 14. That in the year 1856 the act 19 and 20 Vic. c. 45, was passed.\nParagraph 15.

That on 12th day of April, 1867, an act was passed by the Parliament of Canada, called the 'Petition of Right Act.'\nParagraph 18. That of the 110 acres of the lands and premises so set out and ascertained and taken possession of as aforesaid, only about 20 acres thereof have been actually used for canal purposes.\nParagraph 19, sets out a provision of the 9th sec. of 8 Geo. IV. c. 1.\nParagraph 20. That after obtaining the conveyance of the 6th February, 1832, Colonel By took proceedings, under 8 Geo. IV c. 1, to obtain by arbitration compensation from His Majesty in respect of the lands now in question.\nParagraph 21. That an award was made in the matter of the said arbitration, whereby it was awarded and determined that by reason of the enhancement of the residue of the lands, whereof the said Grace McQueen at the time of her death was seized, from the construction of the canal, His Majesty, under the provisions of the 9th sec. of the act, was not liable to make any compensation for the lands in question in this matter.\nParagraph 22 That upon the action of the said Col. By this award was afterwards affirmed by a jury empanelled under the act.\nParagraph 23. That the documents relating to the said arbitration and assessment proceedings, in the three preceding paragraphs mentioned, are to be treated as part of the special case.\nParagraph 24. That the said McQueen, as heir-at-law of the said Grace McQueen, inherited the said other lands which are stated in the said arbitration proceedings to have been enhanced in value, and which are included in the said deed of the 5th February, 1832.\nParagraph 25.

That in pursuance of the acts 7 Vic. ch. 11, and 9 Vic. ch. 42, some part of the lands taken from Nicholas Sparks for the said canal was restored to him, but that no part of the land in question was ever restored to the suppliant, or to those through whom she claims.\nParagraph 27. That on the 18th day of February, A.D. 1869, the Under Secretary of State for Canada, being duly authorized in that behalf to represent Her Majesty, advertised for sale by auction a portion of the said lands and premises for building lots, and on the 16th March, 1869, portions of the said lands were sold for the benefit of Her Majesty in pursuance of the said advertisement and that such sale took place, notwithstanding a formal protest of the suppliant in writing and set out at large in this paragraph was served upon the officer in charge of the Ordnance Lands Department and on the several purchasers at the sale.\nParagraph 28. That in the same year, 1869, the suppliant caused to be presented to the Privy Council of Canada a memorial to the effect set out in the 23rd paragraph of her petition, and that the Privy Council after mature consideration and deliberation upon the matters alleged in the said memorial, and on certain reports made to the Council by the Department of Justice, to which department the said memorial had been referred, to report thereon, resolved by an order duly made and notified to the suppliant that the claim preferred by her could not be entertained, and that reference may be made to the documents, referred to in this paragraph for evidence of their contents.\nParagraph 29 is a verbatim admission of the matters of fact alleged in the 25th and 26th paragraphs of the answer of the Attorney-General of Canada to the suppliant's petition.\nThe questions submitted for the opinion of the court on the facts, documents and statutes referred to in the foregoing case are as follows:\u2014\n\"1st. Did William McQueen take the lands in question, or any part thereof, as heir-at-law of Grace McQueen; and, if so, what part?\n\"2nd. Had Grace McQueen, at the time of her death, as to the portion of the said lands taken and used as aforesaid, any right to compensation or damages in respect thereof; and, if so, in respect of what portion did such right pass to her heir or to her personal representative?\n\"3rd. Were the deeds dated 31st January, 1832, or 6th February, 1832, or either of them, void at common law or under the statute 32 H. 8, ch. 9, or otherwise?\n\"4th. If the said lands, or any part thereof descended, is Lucy McQueen entitled to recover the same or any part thereof, or is she barred or precluded from so doing by the statutes of limitations, or laches, or otherwise?\n\"5th. If the said right to compensation or damages passed to the heir-at-law of Grace McQueen, in whom would it be now vested? Assuming it still to exist, is it barred by the statute of limitations, or by laches, or by the said arbitration proceedings, or otherwise? And would the fact that there never has been any person representative of Grace McQueen preserve the right as against the statute of limitations?\n\"6th. Is the statute of limitations any defence when pleaded by Her Majesty in this petition of right under the fact herein stated?\n\"7th. If at the time of his death William McQueen was residing out of Canada, and the suppliant was then a minor, residing out of Ontario, and if the suppliant has continued to reside out of Ontario ever since, would that prevent the statute of limitations from running in favor of Her Majesty, assuming that Her Majesty can set it up as a defence to the petition?\n\"8th. Is the suppliant entitled to recover by petition of right the said lands, or any part thereof, under the facts and circumstances herein stated?\n\"9th. Is the suppliant entitled to recover by petition of right compensation or damages for the taking of the said lands or any part thereof under the facts and circumstances herein stated?\n\"10th. Is the suppliant entitled to recover by petition of right the purchase money of the parts of the said lands sold by the crown, and, if so, is she entitled to interest thereon?\n\"11th. Is the suppliant entitled to recover by petition of right mesne rents and profits and, if so, from what date?\nMr. Gormully appeared on behalf of the suppliant and Mr. Lash Q.C. for the crown. GWYNNE J.\u2014(After reading the above statement of the case delivered the following judgment in the Exchequer Court:\u2014)\n\"In the year 1876 a similar petition of right was filed in this court by the heirs of the late Colonel By, claiming relief in their favor, similar to that which the suppliant, Lucy McQueen, now claims by her petition, and upon the answer of the Attorney-General having been filed to the petition, a special case was stated, wherein some questions were submitted to the court similar to some of those which are now submitted.\n\"The late Chief Justice of this court, Sir Wm. B. Richards, delivered his judgment in that case dismissing the petition.\n\"Upon the argument before me of the present case it was urged by Mr. Lash, upon behalf of the crown, that any of the questions decided by Sir W. B. Richards in that case, similar to those submitted now, should be deemed concluded by his decision; and upon the other side I was requested by Mr. Gormully to express my own views in the case, independently of the judgment of the late Chief Justice in the former case.\n\"In view of the apparent magnitude of the claim asserted by the suppliant, and inasmuch as upon as thorough a consideration of the case as I am able to give it, I have arrived at the conclusion that there is no ground whatever upon which the claim of the suppliant to any portion of the relief prayed by her can be supported, and as in some minor particulars my mode of arriving at this conclusion may appear to be somewhat different from that by which the late learned Chief Justice arrived at the like result as to the claim of the heirs of Colonel By, I have thought it right that I should state fully the mode of reasoning which has satisfied my mind that the claim of the suppliant cannot be rested upon any foundation of either a legal or equitable character.\n\"The act 8 Geo. 4, ch. 1 in its preamble recites that:\nWhereas His Majesty has been most graciously pleased to direct measures to be immediately taken under the superintendence of the Military Department for constructing a canal uniting the waters of Lake Ontario with the River Ottawa, and affording a convenient navigation for the transport of naval and military stores, and whereas such canal when completed will tend most essentially to the security of this Province by facilitating measures for its defence and will also greatly promote its agricultural and commercial interests, and it is therefore expedient to provide by law any necessary facility towards the prosecution of so desirable a work.\nAnd it was therefore enacted that the officer employed by His Majesty to superintend the said work should have full power and authority to explore the country lying between Lake Ontario or the waters leading therefrom and the River Ottawa, and to enter into and upon the lands or grounds of or belonging to any person, and to survey and take levels of the same, or any part thereof, and set out and ascertain such part thereof as he shall think necessary and proper for making the said canal, locks, aqueducts, tunnels and all such other improvements, matters and conveniences as he shall think proper and necessary for making, effecting, preserving, improving, completing and using the said navigation, and also to make, build, erect and set up in and upon the said canal, or upon the lands adjoining or near the same, such and as many bridges, tunnels, aqueducts, sluices, locks, weirs, pens for water tanks, reservoirs, drains, wharves, quays, landing places and other works, as the officer aforesaid should think requisite and convenient for the purposes of the said navigation and also from time to time to alter the route of the said canal, and to amend, repair, widen and enlarge the same, or any other of the conveniences above mentioned; and also to construct, make and do all other matters and things which he shall think necessary and convenient for making, effecting, preserving, improving, completing and using the said canal, in pursuance of and within the true meaning of this act, doing as little damage as may be in the execution of the several powers to him thereby granted.\nBy the 2nd section it was enacted that after any lands or grounds should be set out and ascertained to be necessary for making and completing the said canal, and other purposes and conveniences thereinbefore mentioned, the officer aforesaid was thereby empowered to contract, compound, compromise and agree with all persons, &c., &c., who should occupy, be possessed of, or interested in, any lands or grounds which should be set out or ascertained as aforesaid, for the absolute surrender to His Majesty, His heirs and successors, of so much of the said land as should be required, or for the damages which he, she or they should reasonably claim in consequence of the said intended canal locks and other constructions and erections being cut and constructed in and upon his, her or their respective lands, and that all such contracts, agreements and surrenders should be valid and effectual in law, to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\nBy section 3 it was enacted that such parts and portions of land or lands covered with water as might be so ascertained and set out by the officer employed by His Majesty as necessary to be occupied for the purposes of the said canal, and also such parts as might, upon any alteration or deviation from the line originally out laid for the said canal, be ascertained and set out as necessary for the purposes thereof, should forever thereafter be vested in His Majesty, his heirs and successors.\nBy the 4th section it was enacted that if, before the completion of the canal through the lands of any person, no voluntary agreement should be made as to the amount of compensation to be paid for damages according to the act, the officer superintending the said work should at any time after the completion of such portion of the canal, upon the notice or request in writing of the proprietor of such lands, or his agent legally authorized, appoint an arbitrator, &c., and provision was made for the determination, by arbitrators, one so appointed, another by the claimant and a third by the two so appointed, of the amount to be paid to such claimant.\nSections 5, 6, 7, 8 provided for submission of the question of the amount to be paid to such claimant to a jury, in case the officer superintending the work or the party claiming should decline to abide by the award of the arbitrators, and\nBy the 9th section it was enacted that in estimating the claim of any individual to compensation for property taken or for damage done under the authority of the act, the arbitrators or jury assessing such damages should take into their consideration the benefit likely to accrue to such individual from the construction of the said canal by enhancing the value of his property: Provided also that it should not be competent for any arbitrators or jury to direct any individual claiming, as aforesaid, to pay a sum in consideration of such advantages over and above the amount at which the damages of such individual should be estimated.\nNow the first question that arises under this act, as it appears to me, is: At what instant of time did Grace McQueen become, if she ever did in her lifetime become, divested of her estate in the 110 acres, part of the lands granted to her in fee? Unless she became divested of the fee simple estate granted to her, so that such estate in the 110 acres became, under the provisions of the statute, absolutely vested in His late Majesty King George the Fourth, His heirs and successors, the estate granted to her by the letters patent in the whole of the lands therein mentioned, including the 110 acres, must have devolved upon her heir-at-law William McQueen eo instanti of her dying intestate, subject, however, to the interest of her husband as tenant by the courtesy; but whichever be the correct view to take makes no difference in the result.\nThat Grace McQueen did not become divested of her estate immediately upon the lands deemed to be necessary by the officer in charge of the construction of the contemplated canal having been first ascertained on survey and staked out upon the ground, (which are acts that might have been done without the owner of the land having any knowledge whatever of them) appears to me to be clear from the provisions of the 2nd and 4th section of the act; for by the former the power given to the officer to contract with the owners for the amount to be paid for the lands, and for their surrender to His Majesty, is stated to be given as a power coming into operation only after the lands shall have been set out and ascertained to be necessary, &c., &c., and the section provides that all contracts, agreements and surrenders made under this power shall be valid and effectual to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\nNow, for what purpose could they be valid and effectual, unless it be for the purpose of vesting the fee of the lands required in His Majesty, and how could they operate for that purpose if, eo instanti of the lands having been set out and ascertained, and therefore before the officer became empowered by the act to contract with the owner, the fee simple estate of such owner had become divested out of him and vested absolutely in His Majesty by the terms of the act? Then, again, by the 4th section the period during which the officer in charge is empowered to enter into contracts with the owner of land taken, while such owners are deprived of all powers of having the amount of compensation to be paid to them determined by compulsory process, is made to extend over the whole period that the works shall be in progress of construction through the lands of the respective owners. The right of the owner to have the amount of his compensation determined by arbitration does not accrue to him until after the completion of the canal through his lands. The section says:\nIf before the completion of the canal through the lands of any person no voluntary agreement shall have been made as to the amount of compensation to be paid for damages according to this Act, the officer superintendent of the work shall at any time after completion of such portion of the canal, upon notice or request in writing of the proprietors of such lands, appoint an arbitrator, &c. &c.\nThis section seems to me to regard the former owner as still proprietor of the land taken during the whole period that the work through his land is in progress, and at least until the time stated, when in default of a voluntary agreement having been entered into the proprietor of the land may enforce an arbitration to determine the amount to be paid to him for compensation. Then, again, the provision in the 9th section, that in estimating the claim of any person to compensation for property taken the arbitrator or jury assessing such damage shall take into consideration the benefit likely to accrue from the construction of the canal by enhancing the value of his property (namely the portion not taken), seems to exclude the possibility of any person being entitled to compensation for lands taken, other than the person entitled to the estate in the land; for, if before a voluntary agreement should be entered into, and before the amount of compensation to be paid to an owner in fee for land taken from him should be determined by an award or by the verdict of a jury, and eo instanti of the required land being set out and ascertained by a survey, the owner should have become divested of his estate and the lands so set out should have been absolutely vested in His Majesty, and the title of the former owner in fee turned into a claim merely for compensation which upon his death, intestate, would devolve upon his personal representative, and if such personal representative could claim the compensation, the provisions of the 9th section could not be carried into effect; for such person, if entitled to recover, could by no possibility have his right affected by the benefit which the construction of the canal would attach to the remaining lands not taken which would belong to the heir-at-law of the intestate deceased. Moreover, the 4th section which alone provides for the ascertainment by compulsory process of the amount to be paid for land taken, names the proprietor of the land as the only person who can bring into action the compulsory process, and he is the only person with whom the provision of the 9th section would be given any effect. It is, moreover, contrary to the spirit of legislation to deprive any person of his estate in lands by expropriation for the public use, unless upon voluntary agreement, or until compensation shall be secured, by some process of law provided for the purpose, such as are the provisions contained in the various Acts of the late Province of Canada, affecting the Board of Works, whereby it was provided that until payment and tender into court of some amount as and for compensation and submission to arbitration, in the absence of a voluntary agreement to determine the amount which should be paid, the owner of the lands required for the public use does not become divested of his estate. For these considerations, I think the proper construction to be put upon the act, notwithstanding the words of the 3rd section, is that the original owner, at the time of the lands being first set out and ascertained by survey on the ground, and his heirs, do not become divested of their estate in the land, at least until after the expiration of the period given by the act for the officer in charge to enter into a voluntary agreement with such owner, unless it be in virtue of an agreement being entered into with such owner.\nThe provisions of the act, 6 Wm. 4 c. 16, seem to me to confirm this view, for that act contemplates, and makes provision for the case of parties acquiring title to lands taken after the commencement of the works, for in a proviso to the 3rd section of that act it is enacted that in all cases of a sale of property made after the commencement of the works, compensation shall be made, either to the former owner or to the assignee, as it may appear just to the arbitrators under the facts proved to them.\nNow the statute 8 Geo. 4 c. 1, was passed on the 17th February, 1827, and Grace McQueen died intestate, as is stated in the special case, upon the 11th of September, 1827, after Colonel By had set out and ascertained, but how is not stated, the 110 acres parcel of the 600 acres of which she was seized in fee. The special case does not allege that when she died the canal had been constructed through her lands. In view of the period which had elapsed since the passing of the act we might safely conclude that it had not, but the special case does not even allege that any part of the works had been commenced when she died. In the view, however, which I take it would make little difference if they had been because, for the reasons which I have already explained, I am of opinion that when she died intestate, without any contract having been entered into with her by Colonel By, her heir-at-law, Wm. McQueen, to whom his father only tenant by the courtesy, had released all his right, was the only person with whom a contract could have been entered into by Col. By under the provisions of the act, and it was competent for him to enter into a contract in respect of the 110 acres so taken. In this result, although arrived at in a different way, I entirely concur with the judgment of Sir. W. B. Richards in the case instituted in this court by the heirs of Colonel By against the Crown[1]. The cases of Richards v. The Attorney General of Jamaica[2], and Frewen v. Frewen[3] do not appear to me to have any bearing upon this case, for the question which arose in those cases was who was entitled to the compensation, into a claim for which what had been real estate was by certain acts of Parliament clearly converted, whereas here there is no question as to the person entitled to receive compensation for the land taken; but the question is, whether the heir-at-law of a former owner is entitled to have vested in him land taken from his ancestors upon the ground of its ceasing to be used for the purpose for which it was taken. Moreover, for the reasons I have given, I am of opinion that no conversion of realty into personalty was effected by 8 Geo. IV, c. 1, at least not during the period therein mentioned within which voluntary agreements might' be entered into, nor until the arrival of the time when, by the act, the right was vested in the proprietors of lands taken of proceeding to obtain compensation for the lands taken by compulsory process, in case a voluntary contract should not be entered into before the arrival of that time. Neither have the cases as to the right to money agreed to be paid for the purchase of lands not yet conveyed when the vendor dies, passing to his personal representative, any bearing upon this case, because then the amount of the purchase money has been ascertained by the contract of the parties enforceable in equity, and they proceed upon the principle that equity regards as done, what has been validly agreed to be done. And, moreover, there is no question here as to any right to compensation, or as to who was the party entitled thereto. William McQueen, then, being competent to contract in respect of the 110 acres, appears to have entered into a contract with Col. By for the sale of all his estate and interest therein for the consideration of two hundred and twenty pounds provincial currency paid to him, for this I take to be the conclusion to be arrived at upon the true interpretation of the transaction expressed by the indenture of the 6th February, 1832.\nFrom the memorial of that indenture which has been produced and has been agreed to be taken as evidence of the contents of the indenture itself, it appears that thereby William McQueen, described as heir-at-law of Grace McQueen, in consideration of twelve hundred pounds of lawful money of the Province of Upper Canada, to him paid, the receipt whereof is thereby acknowledged, did give, grant, bargain, sell, assign, release, transfer, convey and confirm with covenants of seizin, right to transfer, freedom from incumbrances, quiet enjoyment and general warranty unto the said John By, habendum, to him and his heirs forever, the 600 acres granted to Grace McQueen by the precise description covering the whole 100 acres, as contained in letters patent of the 20th of May and the 10th of June, 1801.\nNow, whether the money so paid to William McQueen was or was not the money of His then Majesty is a matter with which neither William McQueen nor any person claiming under him can have anything to do. Whether it was in whole or in part Col. By's money, or money belonging to the crown over which he had control, was a matter in which Col. By and the crown were the sole parties concerned and if Col. By chose to apply his own money in satisfying William McQueen to the full value of the lands taken from him for the purpose of the canal, all claims of William McQueen or of any person claiming under him to have any compensation for the lands so taken would be satisfied and discharged equally as if the money applied in paying him had been the monies of His Majesty or public monies under the control of Col. By. Whether Col. By in such a case could or could not procure reimbursement from the crown for monies so advanced by him out of his own pocket would be a matter wholly between himself and the crown, and after the payments so made to William McQueen the latter could not ever after, nor could his heirs-at-law, be heard to assert, under any circumstances whatever, a right to have any part of the land so paid for re-conveyed to him or them founded upon the assertion that the land had not been paid for.\nWhether an estate did or did not pass by the deed executed by William McQueen would be a matter of no importance, for the deed still stands as a conclusive acknowledgement that it was as and for the purchase money for the whole 600 acres that the \u00a31,200 was paid, and if no estate in the 110 acres passed, still the fact remains that William McQueen got paid the full value of these 110 acres upon the faith that, upon the execution of the deed, whatever estate, right, title or interest he had therein was divested out of him and his heirs for ever, and in fact and in law all title and interest of him and his heirs therein became thereby forever extinguished; but as it appears to me, the estate o William McQueen in the hundred and ten acres equally as in the residue of the 600 acres did at law pass by the deed, notwithstanding at least anything contained in the statute of 32 Henry 8 ch. 9, which, in my opinion, has no bearing upon the case. That act was passed to make void all deeds executed to the prejudice of persons in possession by persons out of possession to persons out of possession, under the circumstances stated in the act.\nIf A, by the command of and as the agent and servant of B, disseised C, and some years afterwards A, being still in possession as the agent and servant of and upon behalf of B took a conveyance identical in terms with that of the deed of the 6th February, 1832, from the heir-at-law of C, or from C himself, without any reentry having been made by him, such a conveyance was never supposed to be within the act. The transaction would not be within the mischief pointed at by the act, and so would not be within the operation of it; the conveyance would at law operate as a release and the legal estate of the heir of B or of C, as the case might be, could undoubtedly in law become released to and vested in A whatever right in equity B might be able to enforce against him. Now that is the case here: Col. By as the agent of His Majesty, who could never be himself in actual possession, entered upon and took actual possession of the 110 acres in the lifetime of Grace McQueen; while in such actual possession as the servant of and in behalf of His Majesty, he takes the conveyance from William McQueen heir-at-law of Grace while he is out of possession. Such a conveyance is a good conveyance at law by way of release unaffected by the statute of Henry the eighth equally as the conveyance to A by the heir-at-law of C in the case above put; and His Majesty would have equal equity to enforce his rights against his agent and servant Col. By as, in the case put, B would have against A. The person out of possession executing such a deed to the person in actual possession could not, nor could his heir-at-law, ever after be heard to base a claim to any part of the land comprised in the conveyance founded on the contention that the conveyance was void within the statute of Henry the eighth.\nThe deed then of the 6th February, 1832, not having been avoided in law as to the hundred and ten acres in question by reason of anything contained in the statute of Henry the eighth, the effect of that deed as to those 110 acres was, in my opinion, to make it operate as a contract or agreement made with Col. By as agent of His Majesty within the provisions of 2nd section of 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1, and so by force of that statute to vest those 110 acres absolutely in His then Majesty, His heirs and successors, free and absolutely released and forever discharged from all claims whatsoever of the said William McQueen and his heirs, whose title thereto became utterly extinguished, leaving Col. By, if the monies paid by him to William McQueen in respect of the hundred and ten acres were his own, to claim indemnity therefor as best he could from the crown. Had he presented his claim in the shape of a purchase made by him on behalf of His Majesty, at the rate of two pounds per acre, possibly his claim might have been recognized; but he does not appear to have done so, but on the contrary, as in paragraph 20 of the special case is stated, he, some time after the execution of the conveyance of the sixth day of February, 1832, took proceedings under the act 8 Geo 4 ch. 1, to obtain by arbitration compensation or damages from His Majesty in respect of the lands comprised in the said indenture of the 6th February, 1832, and therein he claimed compensation for the lands now in question, and thereupon, as in paragraph 21 of the special case is stated, an award was made in writing in the cause of the said arbitration proceeding, whereby it was awarded and determined that by reason of the enhancement of the value of the other land, which at the time of her death belonged to the said Grace McQueen, and of the benefits and the advantages that accrued to her and those claiming under her from the construction of the canal, as provided in the ninth section of the said act, His Majesty was not liable to make any compensation for the lands in question in the matter taken under the act, and as is stated in paragraph 22 of the special case. Afterwards Colonel By, being dissatisfied with the said award, duly caused a jury to be summoned under the provisions of the said act to assess the said damages and compensation claimed by him, and the jury delivered their verdict to the same effect as the said award.\nBy paragraph 23 of the special case it is agreed that the documents relating to the said arbitration and assessment proceedings in the three preceding paragraphs mentioned are to be treated as part of the special case.\nI have repeatedly tried to get these arbitration papers which are so made part of the special case and have deferred giving judgment in the case for a long time in the hope of getting them, but either for the reason that they have been mislaid and cannot be found, or for some other reason, they have not been furnished to me. I was particularly anxious to see them, as I think that if produced they would probably remove what I cannot but think is an error in the admission in the special case, where it is said that it was Col. By himself who took the proceedings in arbitration.\nHe could not have done so while he was the officer in charge of the canal representing the crown and in re Holmes[4] cited in the argument it appears that the arbitration took place in 1840 in consequence of a claim for compensation having been made by the trustees of the will of Col. By, who, as also appears in that case, died upon the 1st February, 1830.\nWhen it is said in the special case that the arbitration took place at the instance of Col. By as claimant we must assume it to have taken place after he ceased to be the officer in charge of the canal upon behalf of the reigning Sovereign and when some other person as officer in charge represented the Sovereign.\nNow Col. By having purchased the lands described in the conveyance of the 6th February, 1832, and having procured those lands to be, by that indenture, conveyed to himself, could not, it may be admitted, as against the crown, have asserted an interest in the 110 acres set apart for the use of the canal, although the effect of persons in a position of trust purchasing in their own name lands required for the purposes of their trust was not at that early period very well understood in Upper Canada; however, it was the crown alone who could object and it was competent for the Sovereign to waive his strict rights and as an act of grace to recognise Col. By as the proprietor of the land in question and so recognising him to enter into an arbitration with him as with any other proprietor of land taken for the purposes of the canal under the provisions of the act 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1. It was only in the character of proprietor of the land that Col. By could have claimed to have an arbitration under the act, and the special case admits that the arbitrators appointed and the jury summoned to assess the amount of compensation if any to be paid to Col. By for the hundred and ten acres, were so appointed and summoned respectively under the provisions of the act, and that they adjudged and determined that under the provisions of the act he was not entitled to the payment of any sum of money by way of compensation, for that the enhanced value attached by the construction of the canal to the residue of the land, not taken, was sufficient and complete compensation for the value of the land taken.\nWe have seen that if any pecuniary payment by way of compensation had been awarded it was competent for the arbitrators and jury to say whether it was, under the particular circumstances of the case, to be paid to the claimant Col. By as assignee of the former owner, or to the former owner; and as Col. By paid William McQueen at the rate of two pounds per acre for the land taken for the canal, there can be no doubt, in justice, if any sum had been awarded it would have been made payable to Col. By and not to William McQueen or any person representing him. The arbitrators and jury having adjudged and determined that no sum was payable under the provisions of the act for the reasons above given, Col. By, who had paid William McQueen two pounds per acre for the land, was compelled to be content with the benefit received by him in the enhanced value attached by the work to the residue of the land which he bought from William McQueen.\nUnder the circumstances I am unable to see upon what principle of law or equity any claim in favor of the heir-at-law of William McQueen can be asserted as founded upon the allegation that \"no pecuniary compensation was paid by the crown to Grace McQueen or to William McQueen, or to any person claiming under them,\" as admitted in the special case and asserted in the petition of right filed in this case. It would be difficult to reconcile with any principle of law or equity the recognition of such a claim founded upon the fact that the crown ex grati\u00e2 abstained from insisting, as against Col. By, upon rights which it might have insisted upon and granted him an arbitration under the act, treating him as being, as the indenture executed by William McQueen represented him to be, the proprietor, as purchaser for full value from William McQueen, of all the land in question.\nBut it is said that the law does not permit more land to be taken from any person by process of expropriation for a public purpose than is necessary for the purpose, and that if more be taken than is necessary for the purpose for which it is taken the part not used reverts upon the non-user or cesser of use at common law to the former owner, although at the time of expropriation the full fee simple value of the land taken may have been paid to the former owner from whom it was taken.\nUpon this assertion of right is founded the claim made in this case, that 90 acres of the 110 taken not being used, as is said, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of the canal have reverted to the heir-at-law of Grace McQueen, although it appears in the case Col. By paid to him the full value of the whole 110 acres, under the belief that the legal estate therein, as well as in the residue of the lands granted to Grace McQueen by the letters patent of the 20th of May and the 10th of June, 1801, had passed to Col. By in virtue of the indenture of the 6th February, 1832, executed by William McQueen. That the land of a private person cannot legally be expropriated for a public purpose to any greater extent than is necessary for the purpose for which it is expropriated may be admitted, but it is plain that the right to restrain expropriation beyond what is necessary for the purpose of the expropriation must be exercised at the time of the expropriation.\nThere must be some mode of determining then what is necessary; and with respect to the expropriation for the purposes of this canal, the mode of determining what was necessary is in express terms provided by the act 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1; but when the land required for the particular purpose is ascertained and determined by the means provided by the Legislature for that purpose, and the estate of the former owner in the land has been by like authority divested out of him and vested in the crown, or in some persons or body authorized by the legislature to hold the expropriated land for the public purpose, if the estate of which the former owner is so divested be the fee simple, there is no reversion nor anything in the nature of a reversionary right left in him in virtue of which he can at any subsequent time claim upon any principle of the common law to have any portion of the land of which he was so divested to be revested in him, by reason of its ceasing to be used for the purpose for which it was expropriated. With respect to the particular act in question here, the late learned Chief Justice Sir John Robinson in the Court of Queen's Bench for Upper Canada, in Doe. Mallock v. H. M. Ordnance[5] thus expresses himself:\nThe Legislature passed in 1827, the act 8 Geo. 4, ch. 1, for granting certain facilities to the government for the construction of the Rideau Canal. They recite in it that \"the work would tend most essentially to the security of the province by facilitating measures for its defence as well as promote greatly its agricultural and commercial interests\" and when this double public advantage is considered we cannot doubt that the Legislature intended that the discretionary powers which they were about conferring upon the military officers to be intrusted by His Majesty with the superintendence and charge of the canal should be such as would enable them to carry out the design on what they might-consider an efficient and proper scale with reference to the protection and security of the work in war as well as in peace. I have so held on several occasions when it was made a question before me at nisi prius whether the lands which the military engineers had taken were in fact necessary. Although there might possibly be such an evident abuse of the powers given by the statute as would make it right to hold that what was pretended to be done under its provisions was not in fact done with a view to execute its powers but only under colour and pretence of its authority, yet it has always appeared to me that wherever there could be said to be any room for question as to the necessity, it ought to be assumed that the public officers had used their discretion fairly and in good faith, in which case the question of the land being necessary or not necessary must be governed by their judgment and not by the judgment of any court or the opinion of any other person public or private, and this appears to me to be not only legal but highly reasonable when we consider the great public interests involved on the one hand, and on the other the care taken to secure to every individual whose property may be taken possession of a just compensation for its value.\nA passage from Mills on Eminent Domain (2 Ed.) was cited on the argument in support of the claim which is asserted as a common law right upon the part of the suppliant as heir-at-law of William McQueen, but that passage refers to a case where the estate or interest expropriated is an use or easement: when the fee simple is the estate expropriated that author expounds clearly what is the language also of the common law.\nAt section 50 he says:\u2014.\nIt is the exclusive privilege of the Legislature to determine the degree and quality of interest which may be taken from an individual as well as the necessity of taking it. An easement or usufruct may be taken or the entire property may be taken so as to be vested absolutely, without reversion to the original owner in case of a change in the use. In such case the owner is paid the entire value of the land and should have no reversion. When only an easement is taken it is presumed that the full value is not given and that the owner receives a lesser amount when there is reserved to him the chance of reversion on a discontinuance of the public user. * * * When the full value has been paid the land with all the materials thereon belongs to the public, there is no right of easement remaining in the owner and the lands so taken may be sold for other purposes. Land taken originally for an almshouse or hospital may, after years of increase in the population of a city, become unsuitable for such purposes and may be sold by the public. Otherwise the owner having received the full value of his land might either compel the public to continue a public institution in an unsuitable place or receive in addition to the value of his land the erections made on it.* * * When the state takes land for its own purposes it is presumed to take the fee.\nNow if the arbitration which took place with Col. By in respect of the land in question, instead of having been had with him, as the special case states, had taken place with William McQueen, and the arbitrators and jury had adjudged and determined, as they did upon the arbitration with Col. By, that the enhancement in value put upon the adjoining lands of William McQueen not taken (by the construction of the canal) gave to him full value for the land taken, such an award having been authorised by the act, when the fee in the lands taken became as it did by force and operation of the statute vested in the crown to the same extent as if a money value had been paid by the crown directly to William McQueen, the fact that any part of the lands taken under the act ceased to be used for the purposes of the canal, could not have the effect of revesting in William McQueen or his heirs the land taken, and which had ceased to be used for the purposes for which it was taken. Nothing short of another act of parliament could divest the crown of the fee which was vested in it by the act 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1, or authorize the appropriation of the lands so vested in the crown to any other purpose than stated in the act. A case of Mulliner v. Midland Ry. Co.[6] was relied upon by the learned counsel for the suppliant, but that was a decision rendered upon 127th sec. of the Imperial Statute 8 and 9 Vic., ch. 18, usually called the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, a section which directs a much more natural and equitable appropriation of land not required for the purpose for which it was acquired than to give it back to the original owner who was already paid for it and who might no longer have any interest in any adjoining land, which is the unnatural and inequitable: appropriation which in such a case is by the learned counsel for the suppliant attributed to the common law. That section enacts as follows:\u2014\nAnd with respect to lands acquired by the promoters of the undertaking under the provisions of this or the special act or any act incorporated therewith, but which shall not be required for the purposes thereof be it enacted as follows: Within the prescribed period, or if no period be prescribed, within ten years after the expiration of the time limited by the special act for the completion of the works, the promoters of the undertaking shall absolutely sell and dispose of all such superflous lands and apply the purchase money arising from such sales to the purposes of the special act, and in default thereof all such superfluous lands remaining unsold at the expiration of such period shall thereupon vest in and become the property of the owners of the land adjoining thereto in proportion to the extent of their lands respectively adjoining the same.\nThen the 128 sec. enacted that before the promoters of the undertaking should dispose of any such superfluous lands they should, unless such lands be situate within a town, or be lands built upon or used for building purposes, first offer to sell the same to the person then entitled to the lands, if any, from which the same were originally taken, or if such person refuse to purchase the same or cannot after diligent enquiry be found, then that the like offer should be made to the person or to the several persons whose lands should immediately adjoin the lands so proposed to be sold.\nI have hitherto treated the case as if Grace McQueen had died seized in fee of the land in question, and that, having died intestate, as is admitted in the case, the lands descended to William McQueen who, by force of the contract made with him by Col. By, received full value for the lands taken, and that his estate therein by force of such contract, for giving effect to which the deed of the 6th February, 1832, was executed, and by force of the statute operating upon the contract made with Col. By, the crown's agent in the matter, for the sale of the land to him, became vested in His then Majesty, his heirs and successors forever, under the provisions of the statute in that behalf. But assuming Grace McQueen to have become during her lifetime divested of her estate in the lands, and that therefore upon her death intestate those lands did not descend to her heir-at-law William McQueen, (it is unnecessary to notice the interest of her husband as tenant by the curtesy), still the claim which is asserted upon the petition of right on behalf of the suppliant would not be a whit advanced.\nIf Grace McQueen was not seized of the land in question at the time of her death it must have been solely because the statute 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1 had already operated in her lifetime to divest her of her estate and to vest the lands in fee in his then Majesty, his heirs and successors forever, for the purposes of the act. I have already referred to the difficulty which, as it appears to me, such a construction of the act would create as to the awarding compensation if none had been agreed upon between Grace McQueen and Col. By in her lifetime and I do not propose to refer to it again, but shall assume, as has been argued in the suppliant's interest, that she had by the operation of the act become divested of her estate in the land in her lifetime and that her rights had become converted into one merely of a right to compensation which upon her death passed as personalty.\nAssuming it to have so passed, it would have been a right enforceable at the suit or demand of a personal representative. Although beneficially it would have belonged to the next of kin, if when her heir-at-law William McQueen in this character of assumed owner of the land in question received, as he did receive from Col. By, the price agreed upon between them as the full value of the land taken, he at least could have no pretence of claim in his character of next of kin to any further compensation; but assuming for the sake of the argument that there were other persons who as next of kin of Grace McQueen would have had an interest in regarding her claim as a mere personal demand and who would not have been prejudiced in the assertion of their demand by reason of William McQueen having wrongfully received, if it was wrongful in him to receive, the full value of the land taken, such a claim could only have been asserted, if at all, under the act.\nAnd whether it could have been enforced under the act or not, either before or after the time limited in that behalf by the statute 2nd Vic. ch. 19, matters not, for it is obvious that a claim which a personal representative of Grace McQueen could have asserted in the interest of her next of kin and which never was asserted, could never be made the foundation of a claim at the suit of an heir-at-law of William McQueen, who either rightfully or wrongfully received payment of the full value of the land taken and covenanted to warrant and defend his vendee in the enjoyment of the estate, which in consideration of such payment he purported to convey, to have re-vested in such heir-at-law the fee simple estate in the lands purported to be sold by his ancestor, upon the ground of the land sold ceasing to be used for the purpose for which it was acquired. The non-payment of any demand, if any, which a personal representative of Grace McQueen might have had could never be made the basis or support of a demand at the suit of the heir-at-law of William McQueen to have revested in him any portion of the lands described in the indenture of the 6th February, 1832, after the execution of that indenture by William McQueen, whether that indenture was effectual or not for passing the estate which it professed to pass. If, then, the suppliant is not, upon principles of the common law, entitled as heir-at-law of William McQueen to the relief claimed in her petition of right filed in this case, and for the reasons already given I am of opinion that she is not, she cannot have acquired any title to such relief unless it be by force of some act of the legislature.\nIt is, however, contended that the proviso set out in the suppliant's petition of right as being contained in the 29th section of the act of the Parliament of Canada, 7 Vic. ch. 11, has the effect of conferring upon the suppliant the right asserted by her in her petition of right.\nThat act recited among other things that divers lands and real property being within the province of Canada had been at various times set apart from the crown reserves or from the clergy reserves, and had been placed under the charge and control of the officers of Her Majesty's Ordinance or of the Commander of the Forces for purposes connected with the defence of the province and the service of the said department, and that divers other lands and real property had been at divers times purchased for like purposes, and conveyed or surrendered to, or in trust for Her Majesty or Her royal predecessors, or had been taken for like purposes under the authority of some act or acts of the legislature of the late province of Lower Canada or of the late province of Upper Canada, and are by the provisions of such acts vested in Her Majesty, and the price or compensation of and for the same hath been paid out of the funds provided for that purpose by the parliament of the United Kingdom, and that it might be expedient that such parts of the said lands as might not be wanted for the service of the said department or for the military defence of the province should, from time to time, be sold or disposed of. And it was therefore enacted that all lands covered with water, canals, &c., within the province of Canada, and at the time of the passing of the act vested in Her Majesty or in any person or persons, officer or officers, in trust for Her Majesty and set apart and occupied for purposes connected with the military defence of the province, or placed under the charge and control of the officers of the said Ordinance Department or of the commander of Her Majesty forces, or other military officer or officers, whether the same have become vested in Her Majesty or her royal predecessors for such purpose by the cession of this province, or have been by her or them set apart or transferred from the lands of the crown or from the clergy reserves, or have been purchased for such purpose by any person or officer and paid for out of the funds provided for that purpose by the parliament of the United Kingdom, and surrendered or conveyed to Her Majesty or her royal predecessors, or to some person in trust for her or them, or have been set apart or transferred, or have been taken for any such purpose under the authority of any act, or law in force in this province or in any part thereof by whatsoever mode of conveyance the same shall have been purchased or taken, and whether in fee or absolute property, or for any life or lives or, term or terms of years, or for any lesser interest or a titre de cens, and more especially the lands and other real property mentioned and described in the schedule annexed to the act, shall be and the same are hereby vested in the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordinance in Great Britain, and their successors in the said office according to their respective nature and quality, and the several estates and interests therein subject to the provisions of this act, and in trust for Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, for the service of the said department, or for such other services as Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, or the said principal officers, shall from time to time direct.\nIn the schedule above refered to, is particularly, described the Rideau Canal and the lands purchased taken or set out and ascertained as necessary for the purposes of the said canal, and marked and described as necessary for such purpose on a certain plan lodged by the late Lieut.-Col. By, of the Royal Engineers, the officer then employed in superintending the construction of the said canal, in the office of the Surveyor General of the late province (of Upper Canada), and signed by the said Lieut.-Col. By, and now filed in the office of Her Majesty's Surveyor-General for this province, and all the works belonging to the said canal or lying or being on the said lands.\nThen the 12th section of the act authorized the principal officers to sell or exchange or to let and demise the lands so vested in them, and the 13th section enacted that the monies to arise from such sales, demises, &c., should be applied to such purposes as Her Majesty, heirs or successors, should direct.\nThe act also authorized the principal officers in their discretion to acquire other lands, &c., for the service of the department or for the defence of the province, and made provision for the mode of acquiring such lands.\nThe act also contained clauses having peculiar relation to lands acquired in that part of the province formerly constituting Lower Canada and placed under the control of the principal officers. The 9th section in which the proviso relied upon by the suppliant is found in one of those sections\u2014it enacts\u2014that it:\nShall be lawful for the said principal officers to grant any censitaire holding lands or other real property, within the censive of any seigniory vested in them under the provisions of this act, a commutation from all seigniorial rights, burthens and charges on such lands or real property on the same terms and conditions on which such commutations might be granted by Her Majesty without this act, but the lands or real property, with regard to which such commutation shall be granted, shall hereafter be held in franc aleu roturier, as shall also any lands or real property which, being within the boundaries of any seigniory vested in the said principal officers under provisions of this act, shall be granted or conveyed by them to be holden otherwise than censive, provided always that nothing herein contained shall prevent the said principal officers from granting any lands or real property within any such seigniory to be held en censive, if they and the grantee shall so agree\u2014provided always and be it enacted that all lands taken from private owners at Bytown under the authority of the Rideau Canal Act for the uses of the canal which have not been used for that purpose be restored to the party or parties from, whom the same were taken.\nHow this proviso, the operation of which, if given effect to, would be so wholly at variance with the objects for which, as appears by the preamble and the first enacting clause the act was passed, came to be inserted in this section, which relates to a subject having no connection whatever with the subject to which the proviso relates, seems very singular. It presents to my mind, if such a thing were possible, the appearance of having been thus introduced by some person interested upon behalf of some private person, and that the proviso and its effect must have altogether escaped notice when the bill was passing through the legislature and until after the royal assent had been given to it. No motive for the insertion of such, a clause is suggested in the act or can well be conceived. It seems to be impossible to conceive that the legislature could have contemplated that lands taken under the Rideau Canal Act for a work which the military authorities considered to be necessary for the defence of the province, and which lands had been purchased and paid for by His then Majesty with funds provided for the purpose by the Imperial Government, should be restored to the parties from whom they had so purchased, without any consideration whatever being given therefor by the persons to whom they should be so restored, and that the sole reason for such restoration should be that they had not been used for canal purposes, although for military purposes of defence they might perhaps be very necessary; but necessary or not necessary for military purposes, what motive could induce the Imperial authorities, whose assent to such a proviso would be necessary, to consent that any lands which had been purchased and paid for out of funds supplied by the Imperial Government, which had been at the sole cost of constructing the canal, should be restored, without any consideration whatever, to the persons who had received full value therefor, is neither suggested nor is to my mind at all conceivable.\nIf indeed there had been a case of lands having been taken, for which the private owner from whom they had been taken had neglected to take measures to enforce payment of compensation by arbitration under the act within the time limited by 2nd Vic. ch. 19, and that any of such lands were not required for the purposes of the canal, a motive of justice might be suggested for provision being made for restoration of such land to the owner from whom it had been so taken without any consideration given therefor or arbitration had, but the proviso as introduced into the act is not framed so as to be limited to such a case; and yet, as appears by the subsequent act passed for the express purpose of explaining what was meant by the proviso, that seems to have been the only reason which could be suggested as explanatory of its object.\nThe act 9 Vic. ch. 4, which was passed for the express purpose of explaining this proviso so inserted in the 29th sec. of 7 Vic. ch. 11, recites the proviso and that doubts had arisen as to the true intent and meaning of the same, and as to the land to which it was intended to apply, and that proceedings at law and in equity which had arisen out of such doubts had been commenced and were still pending and that during the last session of the Legislature a bill had been passed by the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of the province for the purpose of explaining and amending the said act, as far as regards the effect of the said proviso and of setting such doubts at rest, but that the bill having been reserved for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure thereon had not received the Royal Assent, and that the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordinance, as well as the private parties interested, were desirous that the doubts aforesaid should be removed, and that all matters in difference between them should be fairly and amicably settled, and it was therefore enacted, that the proviso should be construed to apply to all the land at Bytown set out and ascertained and taken from Nicholas Sparks, Esquire, under the provisions of the act 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1, except so much thereof as is actually occupied as the site of the Rideau Canal, as originally excavated at the Sappers' Bridge, and of the basin and by-ward as they stood at the passing of the Ordnance Vesting Act, and excepting also a track of 200 feet in breadth to on each side of the said canal, the portion of the said land so excepted having been freely granted by the said Nicholas Spark to the late Col By of the Royal Engineers for the purposes of the canal, and excepting also a tract of 60 feet round the said basin and By-wash (wherever the present ordnance boundary stones stand beyond that distance from the said basin and by-wash, but where they stand within that distance then they shall bound the tract so excepted), which is freely granted by the said Nicholas Sparks to the said principal officers for the purposes of the said canal, provided there be no buildings thereon, and that notwithstanding anything in the act last cited (8 Geo. 4 ch. 1) or in the act passed in the second year of Her Majesty's reign intituled: An act to limit the period for owners of land making claims for damages already occasioned by the construction of the Rideau canal, and for other purposes therein mentioned or any judgment, decree, verdict or decision of or in any court of law or equity, all the lands to which the said proviso is applicable as aforesaid shall, if retained by the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordinance under the provisions of this act, be paid for by them in the manner provided by this act and any parts thereof which shall not be so retained and paid for shall be and the same are hereby declared to be absolutely re-vested in the said Nicholas Sparks, or the other parties, respectively, to whom the same may have been conveyed by him before the 10th day of May, 1846, to his and their own proper use forever; and such conveyances shall not then be invalidated by any want of possession in the said Nicholas Sparks, or adverse possession by the said principal officers at the time they were respectively made.\nThe 2nd sec. of the act enacts that the principal officer should, within one month after the passing of the act, obtain a certificate from the officers commanding Her Majesty's forces in the province, setting forth what parts of the lands to which the proviso is applicable it is necessary to retain for the service of the ordnance department for military purposes, and that such parts should be retained by and should remain vested in the said principal officers in trust for Her Majesty, and that the remainder, if any, should be immediately thereafter absolutely vested in the said Nicholas Sparks, or the party or parties claiming under him to his and their own proper use forever, any law to the contrary notwithstanding. The fourth section makes provisions for the purpose of ascertaining the sum to be paid for the parts of the said land so retained as aforesaid by three arbitrators, namely, one James Sutton Elliott, or in case of his death, inability to act or absence from the Province for more than one month, such other persons as the said principal officers shall appoint, and Stewart Derbyshire, or in case of his death, inability to act or absence from the province for more than one month, such other person as the said Nicholas Sparks, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns should appoint, and John Alexander McDonald, Esq., or in case of his death or refusal or inability to act, such other as the other two arbitrators should agree upon.\nThen by the seventh section it was among other things enacted that the sum awarded should be respectively paid to the parties entitled to the same within three months after making the award, and that if any sum awarded should not be so paid within three months, as aforesaid, then that the land for which the same should have been awarded should be forthwith, after the expiration of the said period, restored to the said Nicholas Sparks, or the parties claiming under him as aforesaid, and should be, and was thereby, vested in him or them by the mere fact of such non payment within said period, and further, that if the said principal officers should fail to obtain the certificate of the officers commanding His Majesty's forces in this province, within the time limited in the act for that purpose, or should negligently fail to comply with any of the other requirements of the act, or if through non-attendance or other wilful neglect of the said James Sutton Elliot, or other persons appointed in his stead by the said principal officers, the other arbitrators should be prevented from proceeding, and such wilful default or neglect should continue for three months, then at the expiration of the said period the land to which the said proviso is hereby made applicable should be absolutely re-vested in the said Nicholas Sparks or those claiming under him as aforesaid by the mere fact of the expiration of such period.\nNow, from this act, the object of passing which, was to explain the true intent and meaning of the above proviso so singularly inserted in the 29th section of 7 Vic. c. 11. and to remove difficulties attending giving effect to that proviso, it is apparent that its intent was not to divest the principal officers of so much of the land vested in them by the first enacting clause of 7 Vic. c. 11, as had not been used for the purposes of the canal as the proviso literally imported. On the contrary the intent was to leave still vested in them under 8 Geo. 4 c. 1 and 7 Vic. c. 11, all the lands to which the proviso was applicable, or so much thereof as the commanding officer of Her Majesty's forces in the province should certify to be necessary to be retained not merely for the use of the canal, but for the service of the ordnance department for military or canal purposes, subject however to the condition that the lands so retained, (notwithstanding anything in 2 Vic. ch. 19) should be paid for at their value, to be ascertained by arbitration had between the principal officers of the one part and Nicholas Sparks of the other part in the manner provided in the act, and that payment of such value, when so ascertained, should be paid to Nicholas Sparks, or the persons claiming under him, and that the residue of the land, not so certified to be necessary and therefore not so arbitrated upon, should be and was thereby re-vested in Nicholas Sparks, or those claiming under him.\nIn addition to the reasons given in the judgment rendered by the late Chief Justice Sir W. B. Richards in the case above alluded to for holding that the proviso must be construed as being limited in its application to the lands of Nicholas Sparks, it appears to me that the plain object of the act and of the proviso whose intent is explained by the act 9 Vic. c. 42, was to prevent the principal officers taking advantage of 2nd Vic. ch. 19, for the purpose of retaining without payment of compensation certain lands which had been set apart and taken under 8 Geo. 4 c. 1 and which had not been conveyed by voluntary grant or surrender to Her Majesty, Her Royal predecessors or to Col. By for the purpose of the canal or to any one in trust for His late Majesty or arbitrated upon under the provisions of 8 Geo. 4 c. 1, and as all the land to which the statutes declare the proviso is applicable, if retained by the officer commanding Her Majesty's forces, was to be paid for at a value to be ascertained upon an arbitration with Nicholas Sparks, and to Nicholas Sparks or those claiming under him, and the balance not so paid for was declared to be restored to and vested absolutely in Nicholas Sparks, and those claiming under him, it appears to me to be plain that all the lands to which the proviso applied were lands which were originally the property of Nicholas Sparks, and not conveyed or surrendered by voluntary grant executed by him, and for which no consideration or compensation had been given to him. He, most possibly, was the only person who, not having been agreed with as to price by the officer in charge, had not availed himself of the compulsory process supplied by 8 Geo. 4 c. 1, within the time limited by 2 Vic. c. 19, and was therefore the only person whose lands were intended to be affected by the proviso.\nThe whole frame of the explanatory act shows that there never was entertained such an intention as that lands, for which the owners had received full value, as William McQueen had for the land in question here from Col. By, who was the officer in charge acting on behalf of and representing His Majesty, should become revested in the said William McQueen, who had already received full value therefor, or in his heirs-at-law in which character the suppliant claims the right asserted in the petition of right in this case.\nThe reason why a portion of the excepted land is said to be retained without having to be arbitrated upon to ascertain a value to be paid by the principal officers, namely, \"The portion of the said land so excepted having been freely granted by the said Nicholas Sparks to the late Col. By of the Royal Engineers for the purposes of the canal,\" shows that the proviso was only intended to apply to lands not granted and not arbitrated upon, and the reason so given so exactly corresponds with the mode adopted in taking title from William McQueen that it appears very plain I think that if there was any lands formerly belonging to William McQueen which were in the same position as the land of Nicholas Sparks as to which provision for future arbitration was made, the 110 acres mentioned in the deed of the 6th February, 1832, must have been and would have been excepted for precisely the same reason as the above excepted part of the lands of Nicholas Sparks, which were retained vested in the principal officers without any arbitration being had in respect thereof under the provisions of the act 9 Vic. c. 42.\nThen it is clear that, and indeed it is admitted that (notwithstanding anything contained in 7 Vic. c. 11.) the lands in question here were by 19 Vic. c. 54 vested in Her Majesty for the public uses of the late Province of Canada and that while still so vested they were by the B. N. A. Act placed under the exclusive control of the Dominion Parliament. So that even if there were such principle of the common law as that contended for by the suppliant (although no such principle is recognized by the common law) still it would not be applicable to the present case, for by the force and effect of acts of the legislature these lands are placed under the exclusive control of the Dominion Parliament, which therefore is the sole power capable of giving to the suppliant' any estate or interest whatever in the lands in question.\nAs to the contention that Her Majesty is a trustee of the lands in question in trust for the suppliant there is no foundation for such a contention; Her Majesty never could be placed in such a position unless by the express provisions of an act of Parliament to which she was herself an assenting party and the existence of such an act of Parliament is not suggested.\nWhen, therefore, the 8th, 10th and 11th questions submitted in the special case are answered, as for the reason above given they must be, in the negative the whole case made by the suppliant's petition of right is disposed of.\nIn the view which I have taken, although my opinion as to the points suggested in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd questions sufficiently appears in the judgment I have delivered, still the questions there put are quite immaterial if, as I am of opinion, in answer to the 8th question, the suppliant is not entitled to recover the lands in question or any part thereof under the facts and circumstances stated in the case, so neither, for the like reason, is it material to determine whether, if she ever had a right to recover any part of the lands in question, such right would or not be now barred by the statute of limitations.\nFor the like reason, and for the further reason that the 5th question puts a merely hypothetical case relating to a subject, namely a claim for compensation for the land, a matter which forms no part of the case set up or the relief prayed by the petition of right, that question is quite immaterial in this case, and I decline to express any opinion upon a purely hypothetical case and which if given would amount to no more than an obiter dictum as the point in respect of which the question is put has no bearing whatever upon the case made and the relief prayed by the suppliant.\nThe 7th question, for the like reason that it purely relates to a hypothetical case not set up in the petition of right, and having no relation to the case thereby made and the relief thereby prayed, is also quite immaterial to the decision of this case.\nThe 9th question is also immaterial as the suppliant has not in her petition of right made any claim, if she had any, for compensation for the land taken.\nIn fact, as I have already said, the whole case is answered when I answer as I do the 8th, 10th and 11th questions in the negative, and say that the suppliant is not entitled to any relief upon the claim and case asserted in her petition of right under the facts and circumstances appearing in this case.\nHer petition of right, therefore, must be dismissed with costs.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court.\nMcDougall Q.C. and Gormully appeared on behalf of the appellant and Lash Q. C. on behalf of the respondent.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I think the appeal in this case should be dismissed. Without going over all the points raised, and on which a great deal may be said, there are two very simple grounds which I think fatal to the suppliant's right to recover, and first, it appears that by memorial of a deed of bargain and sale dated the 8th of February, 1832, William McQueen (under whom the suppliant claims) heir-at-law of Grace McQueen of the one part, and Col. By of the other part in consideration of the sum of \u00a31200 sold, &c., certain tracts of land therein particularly described \"to have and to hold the said granted premises, with all the privileges and appurtenances thereof to him the said John By, his heirs and assigns, to their own use for ever, with covenants of seizin, right to transfer, freedom from incumbrances, quiet enjoyment, and general warranty; subject, however, to the reservation and conditions contained in the original grant thereof from the crown,\" which deed was registered the 6th June, 1862. Several questions have been raised as to the legal effect of this deed, whether it passed the title to Col. By, or whether John By purchased the property on his own behalf or for the crown whose servant he was at the time. But these questions appear to me wholly immaterial because, whether the deed transferred the property to John By or whether he purchased on behalf of himself or the crown, if William McQueen had a right to make this deed which, as at present advised, I think he had, and that the deed took effect from its date as a good valid transfer of his interest in the lands mentioned therein to John By, the title forever passed out of William McQueen; but assuming it did not then I am of opinion William McQueen was estopped by his own act and could not, during his lifetime, have impunged or disputed the validity and general effect of his own deed: so neither can the suppliant who claims under him, she being in like manner estopped.\nThe crown has also invoked the benefit of the statute of limitations which, in my opinion, is a clear answer to this claim, if the brown can raise such a defence, and that it can do so is not, in my opinion, open to doubt or controversy. The seventh section of 39 Vic. c. 28, declares what defences may be raised. The statute is as follows:\u2014\n7. The statement in defence or demurrer may raise, besides any legal or equitable defence in fact or in law available under this act, any legal or equitable defence which would have been available had the proceeding been a suit or action in a competent court between subject and subject, and any grounds of defence which would be sufficient on behalf of Her Majesty may be alleged on behalf of any such person as aforesaid.\nI am, therefore, of opinion that by virtue of the effect of the said deed as well as of the statute of limitations, the claimant is barred and the appeal must be dismissed.\nSTRONG, J.\u2014The lands which the appellant seeks to recover by this petition of right are part of a larger tract originally granted by the crown to Grace McQueen in 1801.\nGrace McQueen died intestate on the 18th of September, 1827, leaving William McQueen her eldest son and heir-at-law; her husband Alexander McQueen also survived her.\nBy deed poll dated the 31st of January, 1832, Alexander McQueen released all his title and interest as tenant by the curtesy to William McQueen.\nBy indenture dated the 6th of February, 1832, and made between William McQueen of the first part and John By, a Lieutenant Colonel in the Royal Engineers of the second part, William McQueen purported to convey the whole of the lands originally granted to Grace McQueen to Colonel By in fee for the valuable consideration of \u00a31,200. On the 17th February, 1827, the act 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1, commonly called the \"Rideau Canal Act,\" was passed by the legislature of the then existing Province of Upper Canada, whereby the construction by the crown of a canal connecting the waters of the River Ottawa with those of Lake Ontario was authorised, and certain powers and authorities incidental to and necessary for the performance of the undertaking were conferred upon the crown. By the first section of this act it was enacted (amongst other things) that\u2014\nThe officer employed by His Majesty to superintend the said works should have full power and authority to explore the country lying between Lake Ontario and the waters leading therefrom and the River Ottawa, and to enter into and upon the lands or grounds of, or belonging to, any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, and to survey and take levels of the same, or any part thereof, and set out and ascertain such parts thereof as he shall think necessary and proper for making the said canal locks, aqueducts, tunnels and all such other improvements, matters and conveniences as he shall consider proper and necessary for making, effecting, preserving, improving, completing and using in the said navigation.\nBy the 2nd section it is enacted:\u2014\nThat after any lands or grounds shall be set out and ascertained to be necessary for making and completing the said canal and other purposes and conveniences hereinbefore mentioned the officer aforesaid is hereby empowered to contract, compound, compromise and agree with all bodies politic, communities, corporations, aggregate or sole, guardians and all other persons or persons for themselves or as trustees not only for and on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, but also for and On behalf of those whom they represent whether infants, lunatics, idiots, femmes covert, or other person or persons who shall occupy, be possessed of or interested in any lands or grounds which shall be set out or ascertained as afore said for the absolute surrender to his Majesty, his heirs and successors, of so much of the said land as shall be required, or for the damages which he, she or they may reasonably claim in consequence of the said intended canal, locks, towing paths, railways and other constructions and erections being cut and constructed in and upon his or their respective lands, and that all such contracts, agreements and surrenders shall be valid and effectual in law, to all intents and purposes whatsoever any law statute or usage to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe 3rd section enacted:\u2014\nThat such parts and portions of land or lands covered with water as may be so ascertained and set out by the officers employed by His Majesty as necessary to be occupied for the purposes of the said canal, and also such parts and portions as may, upon any alteration or deviation from the line originally laid out for the said canal, be ascertained and set out as necessary for the purposes thereof, shall be forever thereafter vested in His Majesty, his heirs and successors.\nThe 4th section provided for a mode of fixing and assessing compensation, in the first instance by arbitrators, and secondly by a jury, in cases where no voluntary agreement as to it was arrived at before the completion of the canal; it directed that in such cases one arbitrator should be appointed by the land owner, one by the officer superintending the works, and a third by the two arbitrators so firstly appointed, and that these three arbitrators should, after hearing evidence upon oath, award the amount of compensation to be paid to the claimant. The 5th sec. provided that if either the officer superintending the work or the claimant should be dissatisfied with the award, they might decline to abide by it, and have the amount of compensation assessed by a jury, upon giving notice to that effect within ten days after the award. And the following sections prescribed the mode in which the jury should be summoned, and the procedure to be followed before it.\nSection 9, which is of especial importance here, was as follows:\u2014\nIn estimating the claim of any individual for property taken or for damage done under the authority of this act, the arbitrators or juries assessing such damages shall take into their consideration the benefit likely to accrue to such individual from the construction of the said canal by its enhancing the value of his property or producing other advantages; provided always, nevertheless, that it shall not be competent to any arbitrators or jury to direct any individual claiming as aforesaid to pay a sum in consideration of such advantages over and above the amount at which the damages of such individual shall be estimated.\nIn 1836 an amending act was passed (6 Wm. 4 ch. 16), but in my opinion it contains nothing material to the present case, being confined exclusively to cases of claims by land owners for lands damaged by reason of stone, earth, timber or other materials having been taken therefrom and to injuries caused by diversion of water-courses and the overflowing of lands, and not applying to the case of lands taken for the purposes of the canal.\nIn 1839 an act (2 Vic. ch. 19) Was passed whereby all claims not prosecuted before the 1st of April, 1841, were to be absolutely barred. In 1843 an act known as the Ordnance Vesting Act (7 Vic. ch. 11) was passed whereby the Rideau Canal and the lands and works thereto belonging were vested in the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance in Great Britain. The 29th section of this act, which forms the basis of the claim asserted by the suppliant in this petition of right, is in the following words:\u2014\nThat all lands taken from private parties at Bytown under the authority of the Rideau Canal Act, for the uses of the canal, which have not been used for that purpose be restored to the party or parties from whom the same were taken.\nIn 1846 the act 9 Vic. ch. 42 was passed whereby it was declared that the provision contained in the 29th section of the act of 1843 should be applicable to lands at Bytown taken from Nicholas Sparks. It has been suggested rather than argued, on behalf of the crown, that this latter act of 1846 had the effect of restricting the operation of the re-vesting clause of the 7 Vic. ch. 11, to the lands of Nicholas Sparks. I may say at once that this objection is wholly unsustainable; the whole scope of the latter act shows that the object of this provision was to clear up doubts as to the case of Nicholas Sparks and not to deprive other parties originally coming within the 29th section of the act of 1843 of the benefit of that enactment. This is so clear that it does not call for further discussion, and 9 Vic. ch. 42 may therefore be dismissed from further consideration.\nIn the 4th paragraph of the special case agreed on between the crown and the suppliant upon which the cause was heard in the court below, it is stated as follows:\u2014\nPrior to the death of Grace McQueen Col. By, the then officer in charge of the Rideau Canal and works, acting under the provisions of the said Rideau Canal Act for His then Majesty for the uses and purposes of the said canal, had from the parcels of lands patented as aforesaid ascertained, set out and taken possession of 110 acres there of which he thought necessary and proper for the purposes of the said canal, and the officers of Her Majesty or the purchasers from Her Majesty have held possession ever since. The 18th paragraph of the case is as follows\nOut of the 110 acres or thereabouts of the lands and premises so set out, ascertained and taken possession of as aforesaid only about 20 acres thereof have been actually used for canal purposes.\nThe case also contains the following statements and admissions of facts:\u2014\n20. Some time after obtaining the conveyance of the 6th day of February, 1832, Col. By took proceedings under the said act (8 Geo. 4 ch. 1) to obtain by arbitration compensation or damage from Her Majesty in respect to the lands comprised in the said conveyance of the 6th February, 1832, and that therein he claimed compensation or damages for the lands now in question.\n21. An award was made in writing in the cause of the said arbitration proceedings, whereby it was awarded and determined that by reason of the enhancement of the value of the other land which at the time of her death belonged to the said Grace McQueen, and of other benefits and advantages that accrued to her and those claiming under her, from construction of the canal as provided in the 9th section of the said act, His Majesty was not liable to make compensation for the lands in question in this matter taken under the said act.\n22. Afterwards Col. By, being dissatisfied with the said award, duly caused a jury to be summoned under the provisions of the said act to assess the said damages and compensation claimed by him, and the jury duly delivered their verdict to the same effect as the said award.\n23. The documents relating to the said arbitration and assessment proceedings in the three preceding paragraphs mentioned are treated as part of this special case.\nThe title of the lands in question having been, by legislation set out in the case and which need not be further referred to here, transferred from the principal officers to the crown, the greater part of the lands have been sold by the latter to purchasers for valuable consideration. William McQueen, the heir-at-law of Grace McQueen, died intestate in 1845, leaving the suppliant Lucy McQueen, his only child and heir-at-law, who now presents her petition of right seeking to recover from the crown the ninety acres of land originally taken by Col. By, but not used for the purposes of the canal, or such portion thereof as still remains in the hands of the crown, and an indemnity for the value of such portions of these ninety acres as have been sold by the crown. And the questions thus raised for decision on the facts stated and admitted in the special case and the statutory enactments already mentioned, having been decided against the suppliant upon the hearing of the cause in the Exchequer Court she now appeals to this court.\nI have no doubt that a petition of right is an appropriate remedy available to the suppliant for the assertion of any title she may have to relief under the 29th section of the act of 1843, directing lands not used for the canal to be restored to the parties from whom the same were taken. In the case of Re Holmes[7] (which was a proceeding by way of petition of right in the English Court of Chancery respecting these same lands) Vice Chancellor Sir W. P. Wood suggested that the remedy might be by mandamus, but the late case of Re Nathan[8] shows conclusively that where it is within the power of a party having a claim against the crown, of such a nature as the present, to resort to a petition of right a mandamus will not lie; and further that a mandamus will never under any circumstances be granted where direct relief is sought against the crown.\nIn order to consider what are the substantial rights of the suppliant upon the admitted facts it is necessary first to determine the construction of the provisions of the Rideau Canal Act (8 George 4 ch. 1) as to the effect of the powers to take lands therein contained, and also the exact meaning of the 29th section of the act of 1843 (7 Vic. ch. 11), the latter enactment being the foundation of the suppliant's title to relief, if any she has.\nA question has been raised in relation to the time at which lands taken for the purposes of the canal by the officer appointed to superintend its construction vested in the crown, whether the title to such land vested immediately on its being, in the words of the 2nd section of the 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1, \"set out and ascertained to be necessary for making and completing the canal,\" or whether it did not vest until the price of the land should be fixed and a surrender agreed to between the commanding officer and the land owner under the terms of the 2nd section, or if there was no such voluntary agreement until the compensation was fixed according to the fourth and following sections, which latter proceeding could, by the express words of the statute, only be taken after the completion of the canal. I am of opinion that by the express terms of the 3rd section the title to lands taken for the purposes of the canal vested absolutely in the crown so soon as the same were, pursuant to the act, set out and ascertained as necessary for the purposes of the canal.\nThe third section applies alike to land and land covered with water, and it expressly declares that lands ascertained and set out as provided for in the 1st section shall be \"forever thereafter vested in His Majesty, His heirs and successors.\" This, it is true, was not in accordance with the course generally followed in later statutes authorizing expropriation for the purpose of works of public utility, but it is to be remembered that here the expropriation was not in favor of a corporation empowered to execute the work with a view to private gain, but was in favor of the crown directly, for the purpose of a great public work designed for the purposes of military defence as well as for commercial transit and which was considered as of inestimable value to the new and sparsely inhabited country through which it was to be constructed. It was no doubt further considered that the crown being bound to indemnify owners whose lands were taken, the security they had in this liability of the crown to pay the compensation did not require the addition of a retention of the title until payment, or a lien upon the land themselves. It could hardly be supposed that the title to lands actually appropriated to the line of the canal itself was to remain in the original owner after its completion until compensation was actually paid, and until the canal was completed the amount of compensation could not, according to the specific terms of the act, be ascertained, and that for the manifest reason that in ascertaining the amount of compensation regard was to be had to the benefit which the land owner might be considered to derive from the enhancement in value of his other lands caused by the construction of the canal. It seems therefore scarcely open to argument that the lands vested in the crown immediately upon their being set out and ascertained. This is the construction which seems always to have been adopted by the Upper Canada courts, and which the Court of Queen's Bench considered correct in the case of Doe Malloch v. The Principal Officers[9]. It is sufficient, however, to say that it is a construction which the literal terms of the 3rd section makes so imperative that no other can possibly be admitted.\nSuch then being the proper construction of this 3rd section, all that Grace McQueen could have been entitled to at the time of her death was the compensation for the lands so taken provided by the act, and to be ascertained in the manner therein prescribed; and the right to receive and recover the sum of money at which this compensation should be assessed either by arbitrators or by a jury, must have vested, on the death of Grace McQueen, not in her heir-at-law William McQueen, but in her personal representative as forming part of her personal estate. If the statute had contained any provision for re-conversion, similar to that found in the English Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, which provides for the re-investment in land of money paid as compensation for the lands of a feme covert taken by railway companies, the case would have been different, for in that case the heir-at-law would have been entitled to the money, but no provision of this kind is to be found in any of the statutes relating to the Rideau Canal. The conversion was therefore absolute[10], and at the time of her death Grace McQueen was entitled to a compensation in money which vested in her personal representative and to nothing else.\nIt is therefore clear that so far as the 110 acres originally \"set out and ascertained\" for the purposes of the canal in the lifetime of Grace McQueen are concerned, nothing passed by the conveyance of February, 1832, from William McQueen to Col. By. No interest in the land, for William McQueen had acquired no title to this 110 acres, the statute having previously to Grace McQueen's death vested the fee in the crown absolutely, and no right to the compensation could have been acquired by Col. By, even if William McQueen had assumed to assign it, for William McQueen as heir-at-law had no title to that, which was personal estate and had, therefore, vested in the personal representative of Grace McQueen. The arbitration proceedings mentioned in the special case as having been had between the crown and Col. By were all void and ineffectual so far as the present suppliant is concerned, Col. By having no title to claim compensation and not being within the provisions of the statute in that respect. Therefore, up to the date of the statute 7 Vic. ch. 11 no compensation had ever been paid by the crown, nor had there ever been any decision as to compensation binding on the representative of Grace McQueen under the statute or otherwise. Then by the 29th section of this last mentioned statute passed on the 29th December, 1843, it was enacted:\u2014\nThat all lands taken from private owners at Bytown under the authority of the Rideau Canal Act for the uses of the canal, which have not been used for that purpose be restored to the party or parties from whom the same were taken.\nThe 90 acres of land which the suppliant now seeks to recover by this petition of right seem to be within all the conditions required by this section. The lands were situate at Bytown; they had been taken from a private owner under the authority of the Rideau Canal Act for the uses of the canal, and had not been used for the purposes for which they had been taken. Had Grace McQueen been then alive, and had there been no sale or attempted sale and conveyance of the lands by her, it cannot, in my opinion, be doubtful that immediately on the passing of the act these 90 acres of land would have become re-vested in her\u2014for I construe the act as by implication vesting the title in lands to be \"restored\"\u2014the latter word (certainly a most inartificial and inappropriate expression) applying, in my opinion, as well to the title as to the possession, in such a way that the land owner entitled to the benefit of it was by force of the statute itself, and without the necessity of a grant by the crown, re-instated in his former title in the lands, the possession of which the crown was bound also to restore to him. This 29th section is in other respects very generally and loosely worded, inasmuch as it leaves it open as a matter of doubt whether, under the description of \"lands taken,\" lands taken and paid for by the crown, or for which compensation under the statute had been awarded to the land owner and paid by the crown are included. I should think it plain, however, that lands acquired by voluntary purchase, as well as lands originally taken under powers conferred by the act, but for which compensation had been awarded and paid by the crown, were not within this re-vesting clause. In either of such cases the title of the crown would be referable to purchase and would not be solely dependent on the expropriation clause of the act. This consideration is, however, not pertinent to the present case for there is nothing to show that any price or compensation was ever paid or even fixed or determined either by agreement or otherwise between the crown and Grace McQueen, or her personal representative to whom, after her death, such compensation belonged. This section is further loose, ambiguous and incomplete in not making any express provision in terms for the very likely case of the death of the original owner by directing to which set of representatives, the personal or the real, the lands should be restored. I think, however, from the nature of the property, \"land,\" from the word used by the legislature, \"restored,\" implying a reinstatement in title, and from the absence of any adequate reason for preferring the personal representatives to the heir, that it was intended that the statute should have, and that it had, the effect of revesting the original estate in the heir-at-law of the owner from whom the land was taken. Therefore prim\u00e2 facie, and subject to the effect upon his title of the sale and deed of 1832, purporting to sell and convey these lands to Col. By, the statute of 1843 did vest the title in fee, in these 90 acres of land in William McQueen as the heir-at-law of his mother, or at least did give him a statutory right to call upon the crown for a conveyance and for delivery of possession; and that subject, to the same exception, upon the death of William McQueen in 1845 the same estate and right vested in the suppliant as his heir-at-law.\nWe have next to consider whether the deed of February, 1832, whereby William McQueen purported to convey the lands in question to Col. By, had any and what effect upon the title or rights acquired by the former under the statute. In considering this question it is to be borne in mind that on this record all equitable defences are open to the crown. The Petition of Rights Act of 1876 is express on this point. Now, I have already pointed out that this deed of the 6th of February, 1832, could have had no operation as a conveyance by which any estate passed at the time. The deed itself is not before us. All we have is a copy of the memorial of its registration. From this it does not appear that the deed contained any recitals, though certain covenants for title by the vendor are stated to have been comprised in it, namely, covenants of siesin, right to transfer, freedom from encumbrances, quiet enjoyment and general warranty. In the absence of recitals it is impossible that this deed, one of bargain and sale, the common assurance then in use in the country operating under the statute of uses, worked any estoppel in favour of Col. By which would be fed by the statute, (7 Vic. ch. 11 sec. 29) vesting the legal estate in William McQueen. The covenants for title, according to a recent English authority, The General Finance Co. v. Liberator Building' Society[11] do not by themselves create any estoppel, and although this is certainly contrary to a former decision of the Court of Queen's Bench of Upper Canada[12] the reasons given for the decision by Jessell, M. R. seem to be conclusive. It is, therefore, clear that there was no legal estoppel which could have effected the estate when it revested in William McQueen. It is, however, a well established principle of the law of real property that if a vendor having, no title to an estate, undertakes to sell and convey it for valuable consideration his deed, though having no present operation either at law or in equity, will bind any interest which the vendor may afterwards acquire even by purchase for value in the same property, and in respect of such after acquired interest he will be considered by a court of equity to be a trustee for the original purchaser and he or his heir-at-law will be compelled to convey to such purchaser accordingly. In other words the interest so subsequently acquired will be considered as \"feeding\" the claim of the purchaser arising under the original contract of sale, and the vendor will not be entitled to retain it for his own use. This doctrine is not to be confounded with that of estoppel at common law, nor with that relating to specific performance of the usual vendor's covenant for further assurance. It is purely equitable and applies altogether irrespective of express covenant, being founded on the right of a purchaser for valuable consideration to call upon his vendor to carry out his contract whenever he becomes in a position to do so, even though at the date of the agreement to sell he had no interest in the subject of the sale.\nInstead of entering into any lengthened discussion of the cases which might be cited in support of this principle of equity, I extract a passage from a text writer of high repute, not as by itself an authority but as conveniently stating the rule, which will be found amply supported by the decisions referred to by the learned author in support of his text. Mr. Dart in his \"Vendors and Purchasers,\" 5th edition,[13] says:\u2014\nSo also the purchaser may in equity, under the covenant for further assurance although not running with the land, require the vendor to perfect a defective title even by conveying any interest in the estate which he may have subsequently acquired for valuable consideration, and this right seems to exist independently of such a covenant, and may be enforced against the vendor's representatives and parties claiming under him for valuable consideration with notice. And the rule seems to be the same even where he has no estate in the land at the date of the conveyance. It was, however, decided in an old case that such an equity could not be enforced against the heir, but there seems to be no good ground for such a distinction, and it has been judicially disapproved of by Lord St. Leonards.\nFurther, the same conclusion may be reached by regarding the covenant of warranty, which the memorial shows the deed to have contained, though it does not appear to have contained the usual covenant for further assurance, as one susceptible of specific performance, just as the latter covenant would have been. From this it follows that if we were to give the suppliant the relief she asks by this petition of right the land and money recovered by her would, in equity, be bound by a trust for, and in short would belong to, the heirs of Col. By, and might be immediately reclaimed by them, and we should thus be, indirectly and through the intervention of a trustee giving to the same person, who in the case of Tylee v. The Queen[14] sought relief against the crown in respect of this same land just what the Exchequer Court in that case conclusively adjudged they were not entitled to recover. The judgment in this case of Tylee v. The Queen (1) is not, it is true, mentioned in the printed case or in the pleadings, but it was referred to in argument at the bar in such a way as to involve the admission that we may safely refer to the statement of it contained in the report already cited.\nThere is, however, still another consideration why, upon an application of the equitable doctrine already referred to, it would be impossible without injustice to the crown to adjudge these ninety acres of land or their value to the present suppliant. I have already said, and I only repeat it to adhere to it, that I cannot hold that Col. By intended in fact to acquire the 110 acres parcel of the 600 acres purchased by him from William McQueen for the use of the crown or otherwise than as his own private property. It is true that he acquired no estate in this portion of his purchase as the title had already vested in the crown, but whether advised as to the legal rights of the crown or not, I am satisfied that Col. By in his dealing with William McQueen was acting in his own interest and not in that of the crown. The 110 acres, were part of the tract of 600 acres included in the purchase deed; the residue beyond the 110 acres, it is not and could not be disputed Col. By acquired for his own behoof and held and dealt with as his own private property. The price for the whole six hundred acres was \u00a31,200. It is not proved or even suggested that this purchase money was paid out of the monies of the crown or otherwise than out of Col. By's own private funds, nor is it even pretended that he had public monies in his hands wherewith to make the purchase. Moreover we find Col, By, by taking the abortive arbitration proceedings before referred to to enforce the payment of compensation by the crown, most distinctly asserting his claim to be as between himself and the crown the beneficial owner of this land, and thus repudiating any intention of having acted as a trustee for the crown in the matter of the purchase. I could not come to any other conclusion on the facts admitted without assuming to draw inferences and make presumption which would be directly contrary to those which the actual circumstances warrant. Further I cannot see any principle on which we should be justified in holding, as a matter of legal presumption, that contrary to the fact the purchase of this land would, if it had been effectual, by reason of the official relationship in which Col. By stood towards the crown have enured for the benefit of the crown in such a way as to vest the legal title in the latter. I think, however, that upon another and that an equitable not a legal principle the crown would, if Col. By had made an effectual purchase of these lands now in dispute, have been entitled to say that, standing as he did in the peculiar and quasi fiduciary position as regarded the crown of the commanding officer having on behalf of the crown the whole charge, control and management of the Rideau Canal and the works connected with it any purchase which he might make of lands already set apart as required for the use of the canal must have been deemed to have been made as a trustee for the crown, and that a constructive trust would have arisen respecting any such property so acquired by Col. By, which trust a court of equity would, almost as a matter of course, enforce against him or those claiming under him as volunteers or as purchasers with notice.\nIt may, however, be said that inasmuch as according to the construction I have put upon the 3rd sec. of 8 George 4, ch. 1, the title to this land vested in the crown so soon as the 110 acres were \"set out and ascertained\" to be necessary for the use of the canal, the conveyance to Col. By was as regards the land in question wholly ineffectual and inoperative, William McQueen having had nothing to sell or convey, and that consequently any claim which the heirs of Col. By could now set up would arise from the statute of 1843, which was entirely matter ex post facto, and that therefore the doctrine of equity applicable to purchases by fiduciary agents can have no application. To this objection it must, in my opinion, be answered that as between the heiress-at-law of William McQueen, the present suppliant, and the heirs or devisees of Col. By, this land is in equity the property of the latter; the suppliant's ancestor having sold it to Col. By and having been by him paid the agreed price for it. That the very foundation of this equitable title of the representatives of Col. By is the contract of purchase and the deed of February, 1832, and that although this purchase, at the time it was entered into, had no present effect as regards an actual title to the land in question, it was just as much in contravention of the rule of equity which disables a person from purchasing property, in respect of which he has fiduciary duties to perform, as it would have been if the legal estate had passed under the conveyance. The principle on which this salutary rule of equity is founded is, as is well known, the honesty, justice and good policy of incapacitating one who has undertaken the performance of services or duties towards others requiring that trust and confidence should be reposed, from placing himself in a position in which his interest would conflict with his duty. To apply this to the present case, it was the obvious duty of Col. By, even as regards lands already set out and ascertained, and the title to which, as I hold, had therefore absolutely vested in the crown, to abstain from purchasing or trafficking for his own private gain in the claims or supposed rights of the owners of such lands, for the reasons that, there must have existed a hope or expectation that if not of right, yet from the justice, grace and favor of the crown, lands which should, after the construction of the canal was completed, prove not to be required for the work, but to be superfluous for any of its purposes, would not be retained by the crown, but would be returned to the owners from whom such lands had been compulsorily taken, or those to whom they might have assigned their claims. With a view to making profit out of purchases and dealings in the claims of land owners, it would be the direct interest of a commanding officer, who had so far forgotten his duty as to indulge in such speculations, to sacrifice the interests of the crown, by making it appear that lands really required for the canal were in fact superfluous and might be dealt with as the crown would probably be disposed to deal with such lands by returning them to the original owners or their assigns, which, as we have seen, was in fact ultimately done by the statute of 1843. The inevitable tendency of such dealings would therefore be most prejudicial to the rights and interests of the crown. That Col. By himself considered his purchase had placed him in a position antagonistic to the crown, is shown by his own conduct in claiming compensation and by the grossly irregular and abortive arbitration proceedings which he entered upon. It is clear, therefore, that although nothing passed under the deed of February, 1832, yet the suppliant could not withold from the heirs or representatives of Col. By anything she might recover from the crown under the 29th section of the act of 1843, but it is equally plain that these same heirs or representatives of Col. By would in turn become constructive trustees for the crown of what they might so recover, by force of the rule of equity forbidding purchases by fiduciary agents for their own benefit.\nThe estate sought to be recovered is therefore, to use the technical expression of conveyancers, \"at home\" in the hands of the crown and upon the plainest principles of equity and in order to avoid circuity we are required to do justice to the crown by dismissing the suppliant's petition of right.\nIn the argument before this court the learned counsel for the suppliant dwelt with much force on the point that the deed of February, 1832, was void for maintenance either at common law or under the Statute 32 Hy. 8 cap. 9 relating to the sale of pretenced titles, for the reason that William McQueen had been out of possession for more than a year when he executed it. I hold this deed to have been inoperative as a conveyance upon another ground, viz., that William McQueen had, irrespective of being out of possession, no title whatever remaining in him to sell or convey; but I give effect to the deed as being in equity constructively a contract by William McQueen to sell and convey any interest in the land which he or his heirs might afterwards acquire. There is nothing in the statute of Henry 8th or in the rules of the common law avoiding contracts savoring of maintenance conflicting with this use of the deed, according to the ordinary every day principles of equity as shown by the passage I have quoted from the work of Mr. Dart. Courts of equity constantly administer this relief and no judge or text writer has ever suggested that such an equity in any way conflicts with the law as to maintenance, and I never heard of such a point being even argued before. In requiring a vendor who had nothing vested in him when he executed the conveyance to convey an after-acquired interest the court treats the conveyance as a contract to convey such after-acquired interest, and for the reason that an expressed contract to convey an after-acquired interest would be perfectly free from the objection in question I fail to see why an implied agreement to the same effect should be open to it, more especially as this whole doctrine of maintenance has now, since the passing of the statute which permits the assignment of rights of entry, become almost entirely obsolete. I should say it was principally in a view of the case different from that which I take, viz., that which regards the Rideau Canal Act as not vesting the title to lands taken until after payment of compensation, that this objection of maintenance was argued. It was said that in that case the crown had been in possession for more than a year when the deed of 1832 was made, and that although the title was then in William McQueen it did not pass as the deed was void for maintenance. As I construe 8 Geo. 4 cap. 1, this point does not arise and I express no opinion on it. I understood, however, that the same objection of illegality for maintenance was raised to the validity of the deed in the other aspect of the case which, following the old Upper Canada decisions, I do take, viz., that lands vested as soon as they were set out and ascertained, and it is from this standpoint that I have addressed myself to the objection, and to my own satisfaction sufficiently answered it.\nReverting for a moment to the construction of the 29th section of the act of 1843, I would say that if I have missed the true construction of that section by holding that restoration of the lands was to be made to the heirs and real representatives, and not to the personal representatives of the original owner the suppliant would still fail inasmuch as she is not the personal representative of Grace McQueen, and no such person is a party to the petition.\nFurther, the statute of limitations which has been pleaded by the crown is, as it appears to me, a defence to this claim, as it was also held by Richards C.J. to be to that put forward by the devisees of Col. By in Tylee v. The Queen[15].\nThe Petition of Rights Act of 1876 contains a clause\u2014the 7th\u2014which seems to authorize this defence, even if the case of Rustomjee v. The Queen[16] is to be taken as a sufficient authority to show that such a defence would not be available to the crown under the English Petition of Right Act. This 7th section authorizes the crown to raise \"any legal or equitable defences \"which would have been available had the proceeding \"been a suit or action in a competent court between \"subject and subject.\"\nBy the 4th section of the statute of limitations, Rev. Stats. Ontario, ch. 108, no action is to be brought to recover land but within ten years after the right first accrued. As is well known the following sections of the statute prescribing the time when the right to recover shall be deemed to have accrued in the several cases provided for are not exclusive. In the somewhat unusual case of a title to land being conferred by statute as in the present case, the right to recover must be deemed to have accrued so soon as the statute conferring the title began to operate. The statute 7 Vic. ch. 11, not being limited to come into operation at a time subsequent to the date at which it received the royal assent, took effect at the latter date, viz., the 29th December, 1843, at which time, if this were an action between subject and subject, the suppliant's right would be held to have accrued. Therefore the twenty years, which formerly constituted the statutory bar, elapsed on the 30th December, 1863, when not only the remedy of the suppliant, but by the express provision of the 15th section of the act (which is identical in terms with section 34 of the English act (3-4 W. 4 ch. 27), her right and title to the lands in question also, became extinguished. I fail to see that any answer can be suggested to this defence of the statute. I have considered the case of Rustomjee v. The Queen[17], holding that the statute of limitations of James 1st was not a defence which the crown could set up to a petition of right. That case is, however, clearly distinguishable from the present in these important respects. The English Petition of Right Act, 1860, which applied in the case of Rustomjee v. The Queen (1) contains no provisions similar to the 7th section of the Canadian act just set out. Further it appears to me to be questionable whether the decision in Rustomjee v. The Queen, (1) which related to a quasi personal demand against the crown, the remedy for which, not the right itself, would be alone barred by the statute of limitations applicable to it in the case of a subject would apply at all to a claim to recover land where not merely the remedy but by the express words of the act, the \"right and title\" of the claimant, that is his right and title against all the world, became extinguished at the expiration of the statutory period. I should have thought that in such a case if the crown were in possession the right and title would become barred in its favor as well as in favor of all other persons. So far has this view prevailed, indeed, that it was even held by a great authority on such questions\u2014Lord St. Leonards\u2014that although the statute in its terms only purported to extinguish the title of the claimant out of possession that it did this so effectually, that in a case where no disabilities could be shown to exist it operated by way of positive prescription and conferred such a perfect title on the party in possession that a court of equity would treat it as marketable and force it on a purchaser[18]. I am content, however, to rest this defence of the statute of limitations on the 7th section of the Canadian Petition of Right Act, 1876, as a defence, which would have been available if this had been an action between subject and subject; and so considered to hold that the title asserted by the suppliants has long since been barred and extinguished.\nIt is no answer to this defence of the statute of limitations to say that there was no statutory provision regulating the procedure by petition of right before 1875 when the first Petition of Right Act, 38 Vic. ch. 12, was passed. It does not follow that there was no remedy against the crown either by mandamus or some other proceeding prior to the statute which only prescribed the practice to be applied in such cases and did not originate the remedy. It is said to be a constitutional obligation binding on the advisers of the crown to put in a course of judicial enquiry any reasonable claim on the part of a subject to recover his property in the hands of the crown, and this obligation existed before as well as since the statute of 1875.\nMoreover, the statute began to run in 1843 in favor of the body incorporated under the title of the \"Principal Officers of Ordnance,\" in whom the possession of the land remained until it was handed over to the crown as representing the province in 1856. That corporation was capable of suing and being sued by the express terms of the act incorporating it. Then nothing can be better established as a universal rule of English law, applying to all statutes of limitations from the statute of fines down to the statutes passed in the 3-4 W. 4, whatever may be their character, whether operating by way of extinguishment of the right or bar to the remedy, that when the statute once begins to run no disability afterwards supervening will stop the running; it continues to run, notwithstanding any subsequent disabilities even though, as Sir William Grant says in Beckford v. Wade[19], it should be one actually excluding the possibility of obtaining relief, as by the closing of the courts during war or rebellion. The authorities on this head are too numerous and conclusive to leave the least doubt on the point[20].\nIt is plain therefore that the well known rule of Roman and French law contra non valentem agere nulla currit pr\u00e6scriptio, does not in its entirety hold good in English law.\nThen to apply the above rule to the present case and to consider its effect when taken in connection with the 7th section of the Petition of Rights Act of 1876, it is manifest that if the crown, after having held the possession of the land from the date of the transfer to the province in 1856, had sold it to a subject, and the purchaser, after the lapse of the statutory period of 20 years dating from 1843, that is for a period making up 20 years when added to the time of possession by the principal officers (namely, the 13 years between 1843 to 1856) but before he had himself held it for. 20 years, had been sued by the suppliant for the recovery of the land, such a purchaser could undoubtedly have successfully pleaded the statute. And if so the crown is enabled by the 7th section of the Petition of Rights Act to do the same, since it is by the express terms of that enactment authorized to set up all defences which would have been available in the case of a subject.\nFurther, independently of the 7th section of the Petition of Rights Act it would appear clear that the crown acquiring lands from persons in favor of whom the statute of limitations had begun to run before the possession was transfered to the crown would, on the principle of the authorities before referred to, be entitled to the benefit of the statute. Granting that the statute would not begin to run whilst the lands were in the hands of the crown by reason of the claimant being disabled from maintaining an action for the recovery of the land, yet when the statute began to run whilst the land was in the possession of subjects, as were the Principal Officers of Ordnance, it would seem the subsequent disability arising from the possession vesting in the crown ought not to have any other or different effect from that caused by other supervening disabilities such as infancy or coverture.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J:\u2014Le pr\u00e9sent appel est d'un jugement rendu par la cour d'Echiquier, le 19 novembre 1883, renvoyant la p\u00e9tition de droit de l'appelante avec d\u00e9pens.\nLes faits de la cause sont longuement expos\u00e9s dans la p\u00e9tition de l'appelante et dans le cas sp\u00e9cial soumis de consentement par les deux parties.\nL'a\u00efeule de l'appelante Grace McQueen \u00e9tait incontestablement propri\u00e9taire en vertu de lettres patentes \u00e9mises sous le grand sceau, le 20 mai et le 10 juin 1801, d'une grande \u00e9tendue de terrain dont celui r\u00e9clam\u00e9 en cette cause faisait partie. Ce terrain serait plus tard pass\u00e9 en la possession de la Couronne, dans les circonstances suivantes, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'admission des parties.\n4o. Prior to the death of Grace McQueen, Colonel By, the then officer in charge of the Rideau Canal and works, acting under the provisions of the said Rideau Canal Act for His then Majesty, for the uses and purposes of the said Canal, had from the parcels of land patented as aforesaid, ascertained set out and taken possession of one hundred and ten acres thereof, which he thought necessary and proper for the purposes of said Canal, and the officers of Her Majesty or the purchasers from Her Majesty, hereinafter mentioned have held possession of the same from thence hitherto.\nLa 2e section de l'acte du canal, 8 Geo. 4, ch. 1, donnant \u00e0 l'officier en charge de la construction du canal le pouvoir d'expropriation pour les fins du canal, est con\u00e7u en ces termes[21]:\nLes sections 4, 5, 6, 7 et 8 du m\u00eame acte pourvoient au mode de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour l'\u00e9valuation des dommages.\nGrace McQueen est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e ab intestate le 11 septembre 1827, laissant comme son h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gal, Wm McQueen.\nDes 110 acres pris pour les fins du canal il n'en a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s que vingt, le surplus, 90 acres, quoique n'ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme n\u00e9cessaire pour cette fin, est cependant rest\u00e9 en la possession de la Couronne.\nParmi les moyens de d\u00e9fense invoqu\u00e9s est le suivant:\n13. I submit that by reason of the enhancement of the value of other lands of the said Grace McQueen, and of the other benefits and advantages which accrued to her and those representing her, the crown never became liable to make compensation for the lands in question in this matter.\nLa v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de cet \u00e9trange moyen de d\u00e9fense est constat\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re la plus positive dans les termes suivants de l'article 25 du special case, o\u00f9 il est dit:\n25o. No payment or compensation in money has ever been made by the crown to Grace McQueen or to William McQueen or to the suppliant or to any person claiming under them for the 20 acres actually used for canal purposes or for the residue of the hundred and ten acres set out, ascertained and taken possession of as aforesaid but not so used.\nIl n'est ni admis ni prouv\u00e9 que Grace McQueen a\u00eet jamais consenti en faveur de la Couronne un contrat ou titre quelconque pour transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re le fee simple qui lui appartenait dans le terrain en question.\nToutefois il est \u00e9vident d'apr\u00e8s les plaidoiries et les admissions de faits des parties qu'il n'en existe pas et qu'il n'y en a jamais eu. L'article 4 des admissions, constate que c'est avant la mort de Grace McQueen que le colonel By,\nHas ascertained, set out and taken possession of one hundred and ten acres.\nIl est donc certain qu'il y a eu prise de possesion sans titre \u00e0 moins que le setting out ne soit lui-m\u00eame un titre, comme on le pr\u00e9tend. D'apr\u00e8s la 2e section de 8 G. 4 ch. 1, (Canal Act) ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pr\u00e9liminaire de d\u00e9termination du terrain n\u00e9cessaire pour le canal que l'officier en charge\nis empowered to contract, compromise and agree with all persons who should occupy, be possessed of or interested in any lands or grounds which should be set out or ascertained as aforesaid, for the absolute surrender, etc.\nL'interpr\u00e9tation de cette clause a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la question de savoir \u00e0 quelle \u00e9poque Grace McQueen s'est trouv\u00e9e expropri\u00e9e et d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9e de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, si toutefois elle l'a \u00e9t\u00e9, et quand la Couronne en a \u00e9t\u00e9 investie. La simple prise de possession pour les fins du canal suffisait-elle pour cela, o\u00f9 bien ne fallait-il pas apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9termination du terrain requis a contract, compromise or agreement auxquels la m\u00eame section donne les effets l\u00e9gaux en ces termes:\nAnd all such contracts, agreements and surrenders should be valid and effectual in law, to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\nLes opinions se sont partag\u00e9es \u00e0 ce sujet. Sir William Richards, dans la cause de Tylee v. La Reine[22] o\u00f9 les repr\u00e9sentants du colonel By r\u00e9clamaient comme sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 le terrain en question en cette cause, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le seul proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de d\u00e9termination (setting out and ascertaining) avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant pour investir l\u00e9galement Sa Majest\u00e9 de cette m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Dans son jugement de la pr\u00e9sente cause, au sujet de la m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e maintenant par les repr\u00e9sentants de Grace McQueen, l'honorable juge Gwynne, apr\u00e8s une longue et savante dissertation sur cette question, en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que Grace McQueen \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e sans avoir fait aucun contrat avec le colonel By, elle a laiss\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question \u00e0 William McQueen, son h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gal. Son argumentation sur ce point me para\u00eet concluante; comme la citation en serait trop longue, je r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 son jugement dans cette cause, sur cette question.\nD'apr\u00e8s l'honorable juge, un titre de Grace McQueen ou de ses repr\u00e9sentants \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour investir Sa Majest\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question. D'apr\u00e8s l'opinion de Sir William Richards, le setting out et la prise de possession par le colonel By \u00e9taient suffisants pour donner un titre \u00e0 la Couronne. Je suis d'avis avec l'honorable juge Gwynne qu'un titre \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, mais je ne crois pas comme lui que le deed du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832 par William McQueen au colonel By, qu'il suppose avoir agi dans cette transaction comme trustee de la Couronne, soit un titre suffisant pour avoir investi la Couronne. J'en donnerai les raisons ci-apr\u00e8s. L'opinion de l'honorable juge Gwynne sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'un titre a \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9e par Sir Hugh Cairns, alors solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et plaidant comme tel pour Sa Majest\u00e9 dans la cause re Holmes,[23]o\u00f9 les m\u00eames questions, au sujet du m\u00eame terrain ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 la cour de Chancellerie, en Angleterre, en vertu d'une p\u00e9tition de droit contre Sa Majest\u00e9. Les repr\u00e9sentants du colonel By fondaient leur r\u00e9clamation sur l'acte que lui avait consenti William McQueen, le 5 f\u00e9vrier 1832; l'honorable solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\nMoreover the suppliants have shown no title, which, if in any one, is in the representative of Grace McQueen.\nLe jugement qui renvoya cette p\u00e9tition est fond\u00e9 sur le seul motif d'absence de pouvoir dans la cour de Chancellerie en Angleterre pour disposer d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re en dehors des limites de sa juridiction. Mais on trouve dans l'opinion du solliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral une r\u00e9futation compl\u00e8te des pr\u00e9tentions du colonel By. Dans une autre partie de son argumentation, apr\u00e8s l'expos\u00e9 des objections \u00e0 la juridiction de la cour, il exprime l'opinion que c'est aux h\u00e9ritiers de William McQueen qu'appartient cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9:\nIf all these difficulties [au sujet de la juridiction] were got over, the persons entitled to claim the restoration would be the representatives of William McQueen, and not those who claim under colonel By. The conveyance of 1832 passed all the interest which William McQueen had in the land, but it would not pass an interest which was only enacted by a long subsequent act of parliament in favour of \"the party or parties from whom the land was taken.\" The suppliants are not such parties.\nEn effet lorsque la vente \u00e0 By a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par William McQueen, le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832, la Couronne \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en possession depuis au-del\u00e0 de cinq ans, c'est-\u00e0-dire depuis au moins le 11 septembre 1827, date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Grace McQueen, de sorte que William McQueen n'avait pu transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 By des droits \u00e0 une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dont il n'\u00e9tait pas en possession et qui avait depuis longtemps auparavant \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9s \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re au nom de la Couronne qui en \u00e9tait alors en possession.\nDe plus, cet acte du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832, fait onze ans avant la passation de la 7 Vict., ch. 11, sec. 29 (Vesting Ordnance Act), ne pouvait transf\u00e9rer au colonel By des droits qui n'ont pu appartenir \u00e0 William McQueen que onze ans plus tard, en vertu du proviso de la section 29. Ceci devrait \u00eatre concluant si ce n'\u00e9tait \u00e0 cause du caract\u00e8re de trustee que l'honorable juge Gwynne attribue au colonel By dans cette transaction du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832.\nIl n'est pas douteux que lorsque le colonel By exer\u00e7ait ses attributions dans les limites de la loi 8 Geo. 4, ch. 1, et prenait possession de terrains n\u00e9cessaires pour les fins du canal, il devait \u00eatre regard\u00e9 comme un trustee pour Sa Majest\u00e9. Mais peut-on lui pr\u00eater cette qualit\u00e9 lorsqu'il agit dans une transaction tout \u00e0 fait en dehors des pouvoirs qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par le statut, pour l'acquisition d'un terrain qui n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour le canal\u2014\u00e0 une \u00e9poque (le 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832) o\u00f9 le canal \u00e9tait construit, puisqu'il fut ouvert au trafic deux mois apr\u00e8s\u2014et pour un terrain qu'il n'a cess\u00e9 de r\u00e9clamer comme sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 personnelle, comme le d\u00e9montrent les faits admis et prouv\u00e9s. Il a protest\u00e9 bien des fois et de la mani\u00e8re la plus formelle contre cette qualit\u00e9 de trustee de la Couronne qu'on lui a pr\u00eat\u00e9e dans la transaction du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832. Loin de l\u00e0, il a mainte fois r\u00e9clam\u00e9 en justice et autrement cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise par lui et pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice personnel, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, une compensation. Une premi\u00e8re fois il a obtenu une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 arbitres, qui ont refus\u00e9 de lui accorder des dommages \u00e0 raison de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Cette m\u00eame r\u00e9clamation a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus tard r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 un jury, qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 comme les arbitres l'avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait. Il ne s'est pas content\u00e9 de protester personnellement contre cette qualit\u00e9 de trustee, ses h\u00e9ritiers et repr\u00e9sentants ont soutenu comme lui qu'il n'avait pas cette qualit\u00e9\u2014et l'un d'eux, C. W. By, a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, en juillet 1856, par une demande adress\u00e9e au gouverneur en conseil, r\u00e9clamation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 repouss\u00e9e par la Couronne. Les trustees de la succession du colonel By ont m\u00eame r\u00e9clam\u00e9 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9, en Angleterre, par une p\u00e9tition de droit devant la cour de Chancellerie\u2014in re Holmes[24]. Cette r\u00e9clamation \u00e9tait encore une r\u00e9pudiation de la qualit\u00e9 de trustee. En dernier lieu la m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par ses h\u00e9ritiers et repr\u00e9sentants devant la cour d'Echiquier du Canada, dans la cause de Tylee v. La Reine[25], o\u00f9 des efforts consid\u00e9rables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour faire d\u00e9clarer que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenait \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers. Cette proc\u00e9dure ne reposait que sur sa pr\u00e9tention qu'il n'avait pas agi comme trustee, mais pour lui-m\u00eame. Non seulement le colonel By et ses repr\u00e9sentants ont ni\u00e9 cette qualit\u00e9 de trustee, mais la couronne elle-m\u00eame se trouve en avoir fait une r\u00e9pudiation solennelle par l'acte 7 Vic. ch. Il, section 29, en d\u00e9clarant que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s non employ\u00e9es pour l'usage du canal seraient rendues \u00e0 ceux de qui ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. C'\u00e9tait dire clairement que n'\u00e9tant pas n\u00e9cessaires pour le canal, elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises ill\u00e9galement par le colonel By, et r\u00e9pudier sa pr\u00e9tendue qualit\u00e9 de trustee. En face de cette r\u00e9pudiation de la part des deux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es peut-on se fonder sur cette pr\u00e9tendue qualit\u00e9 de trustee pour lui faire produire l'effet d'une vente valide et l\u00e9gale. Sans l'attribut de cette qualit\u00e9 au colonel By, l'honorable juge Gwynne aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9 d'admettre que la Couronne n'avait pas de titre, et la cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9vitable eut \u00e9t\u00e9 un jugement en faveur de l'appelante. Il me semble que cela suffit pour faire voir que le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 Grace McQueen, en vertu des lettres patentes du mois de mai et juin 1801, n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 ali\u00e9n\u00e9 ni en faveur du colonel By personnellement, ni par son entremise comme trustee, en faveur de la couronne. Ce titre existe encore de droit dans la personne des repr\u00e9sentants de Grace McQueen.\nInd\u00e9pendamment de ce titre l'appelante peut encore en invoquer un autre, reposant sur un texte de loi. C'est celui qui r\u00e9sulte du proviso suivant de la section 29 de la 7 Vic. ch. 11, con\u00e7u en ces termes:\nProvided always and be it enacted, that all lands taken from private owners at Bytown, under authority of the Rideau Canal Act, for the use of the Canal, which have not been used for that purpose be restored to the party or parties from whom the same were taken.\nAinsi que je crois l'avoir \u00e9tabli plus haut le titre de Grace McQueen n'ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 ali\u00e9n\u00e9, il ne reste donc \u00e0 sa repr\u00e9sentante, l'appelante, qu \u00e0 faire voir qu'elle est encore dans les conditions de pouvoir invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ce proviso. Je ne crois pas devoir m'arr\u00eater aux consid\u00e9rations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites sur l'endroit qu'occupe cette disposition dans la section 29, comme n'ayant pas de connexion avec les autres parties de cette section o\u00f9 l'on dit qu'elle se trouve isol\u00e9e et hors de place. Ce ne sont nullement des raisons pour ne pas lui donner son plein et entier effet, si elle est d'ailleurs claire et pr\u00e9cise. En outre, elle me semble l\u00e0 \u00e0 sa place, aussi bien que dans aucune autre partie de l'acte. Il s'agit, il est vrai, de la mani\u00e8re de donner des titres par les officiers de l'ordonnance, dans des seigneuries du Bas-Canada,\u2014mais comme il n'y en avait pas \u00e0 donner \u00e0 ceux dont on avait ill\u00e9galement pris les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sous pr\u00e9texte qu'elles \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la construction du canal, il n'y avait qu'en ordonner la restitution. Et il \u00e9tait d'autant plus n\u00e9cessaire de le faire que la 1\u00e8re clause de cette loi mettant an nombre des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s transf\u00e9r\u00e9es aux principaux officiers de l'ordonnance, le canal Rideau, canal and works, lands, &c., les dits officiers auraient pu croire que les terrains auxquels le proviso fait allusion leur \u00e9taient aussi transf\u00e9r\u00e9s. Dans le but d'\u00e9viter des difficult\u00e9s, il est \u00e9vident que la loi ne leur a impos\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard qu'un devoir bien simple et bien facile \u00e0 remplir, celui de remettre les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s prises mais non employ\u00e9es \u00e0 l'usage du canal, aux personnes de qui elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Il n'y avait pour cela qu'\u00e0 en abandonner la possession dont se d\u00e9mettait le Couronne sans en investir les officiers de l'ordonnance comme le fait voir la c\u00e9dule \u00e0 la fin de l'acte, transf\u00e9rant le canal et les terrains lawfully purchased and taken, &c., as necessary for the purposes of the canal Ceux qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s pour l'usage du canal n'\u00e9taient donc pas mis sous leur contr\u00f4le. Les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s par l'op\u00e9ration de la loi \u00e9taient rendues aux propri\u00e9taires. Les officiers de l'ordonnance n'avaient qu'un devoir de constatation de l'identit\u00e9 de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s a remplir pour mettre ce proviso \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution.\nQuoi qu'il en soit, ce proviso, fait pour r\u00e9parer de graves injustices commises dans la construction du canal, avait sa place dans cet acte et doit \u00eatre d'autant plus respect\u00e9 qu'il n'offre pas un doute possible sur sa port\u00e9e et sa signification.\nMaintenant \u00e0 quelles conditions sont soumises les personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es dans ce proviso? Il faut\u20141o Qu'elles \u00e9tablissent que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises sous l'autorisation du Rideau Canal Act pour l'usage du canal; 2o. Que ces m\u00eames propri\u00e9t\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9es pour les fins du canal. Voil\u00e0 les seules conditions impos\u00e9es. L'admission de faits constate que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pour les fins du canal, art. 4, p. 21 du dossier\u2014et l'art. 25 reconna\u00eet qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin. La preuve de l'appelante \u00e9tant compl\u00e8te et son droit clairement \u00e9tabli par le proviso, rien ne devrait donc plus faire obstacle \u00e0 la remise de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nMais pour \u00e9viter de donner effet \u00e0 une disposition l\u00e9gale aussi claire que celle dont il s'agit, on refuse de lui reconna\u00eetre le caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et absolu que lui donne les termes dans lesquels elle est con\u00e7ue, pour en restreindre l'application au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'un seul individu, Nicholas Sparks.\nCette pr\u00e9tention est appuy\u00e9e sur la 9e Victoria, ch. 42, dont on trouve une analyse dans le jugement de l'honorable juge Gwynne qui, comme Sir William Richards dans la cause de Tylee v. La Reine, exprime l'opinion que ce statut n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 que pour venir au secours de Nicholas Sparks.\nIl est certain que ce statut d\u00e9clare que le proviso de la 29e clause de la 7e Vict., ch. 11, shall be construed to apply to all land at Bytown set out and ascertained and taken from Nicholas Sparks en vertu de l'acte du canal Rideau, 8 Geo. 4, ch. 1,\u2014et il est pourvu \u00e0 un mode de proc\u00e9dure pour le faire rentrer en possesion. Du fait que Sparks seul est mentionn\u00e9 dans cet acte, on n'en peut conclure autre chose si ce n'est qu'il est un de ceux auxquels il \u00e9tait applicable, il n'est pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre le seul ayant le droit d'invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du la loi, il est seulement dit que le proviso sera interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme le comprenant. Nulle expression comporte l'id\u00e9e qu'il ne s'applique \u00e0 aucune autre personne et aucune expression dans l'acte n'en comporte la r\u00e9vocation. Comme ces dispositions l\u00e9gislatives ne sont pas en contradiction les unes avec les autres, elles peuvent et doivent \u00e9galement subsister, comme ind\u00e9pendantes les unes des autres. On a donn\u00e9 aussi, suivant moi, \u00e0 la 9e Vic., ch. 42, un effet restrictif que ne comporte pas la teneur de ses dispositions. Cet acte ne me para\u00eet aucunement affecter les droits de l'appelante en vertu du proviso.\nUne autre objection est que par l'acte 19 Vic. ch. 54, la Couronne a \u00e9t\u00e9 investie du terrain r\u00e9clam\u00e9. L'honorable juge Gwynne s'exprime ainsi au sujet de cette proposition:\nThen it is clear that, and indeed it is admitted that (notwithstanding anything contained in 7th Vic. c. 11,) the lands in question here were by 19 Vic. c. 54 vested in her Majesty for the public uses of the late Province of Canada, and that while still so vested they were by the B. N. A. Act placed under the exclusive control of the Dominion Parliament.\nMalgr\u00e9 tout le respect que j'ai pour l'opinion de l'honorable juge, je suis forc\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rer avec lui sur cette question. Il me semble, au contraire que cet acte, dont le but \u00e9tait de transporter \u00e0 l'un des principaux secr\u00e9taires d'Etat pour le d\u00e9partement de la guerre les terrains qui \u00e9taient en vertu de la 7e Vic. ch. 11 sous le contr\u00f4le des principaux officiers de l'ordonnance, a soigneusement \u00e9vit\u00e9 de faire aucune mention du terrain r\u00e9clam\u00e9, et que les expressions employ\u00e9es font voir qu'il est rest\u00e9 dans la position qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le proviso de la section 29.\nLes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es dans cet acte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divis\u00e9es en deux classes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la premi\u00e8re et la deuxi\u00e8me c\u00e9dules annex\u00e9es au dit acte. Celles de la premi\u00e8re c\u00e9dule consistant en constructions et travaux militaires, sont transport\u00e9es au principal Secr\u00e9taire d'Etat pour la guerre. Celles de la deuxi\u00e8me c\u00e9dule sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es retourner \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 pour l'avantage de la province. Au nombre de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s se trouve le Canal Rideau dans le paragraphe ainsi con\u00e7u:\nRideau and Ottawa Canals, City of Ottawa Barracks, Block houses and adjuncts of the Canal.\nA moins de pr\u00e9tendre que les 90 acres des terrains r\u00e9clam\u00e9s se trouvent compris dans le terme \"adjunct,\" il est \u00e9vident qu'ils en sont exclus. Le mot adjunct qui est d\u00e9fini en anglais \"something added to another but not essentially a part of it,\" ne peut s'appliquer qu'aux choses n\u00e9cessaires et actuellement employ\u00e9es \u00e0 l'exploitation du canal. Les 90 acres en question n'en ont jamais fait partie et n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'usage du canal, comme le fait est reconnu et admis, et ne peuvent \u00eatre par cons\u00e9quent consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme un \"adjunct\" du canal.\nCe statut loin d'avoir investi la Couronne de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la province en r\u00e9voquant le proviso, a au contraire r\u00e9serv\u00e9 les droits de tous ceux qui avaient des r\u00e9clamations au sujet des terrains, b\u00e2tisses ou autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es dans la section 7 pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Cette section est celle op\u00e9rant le transport des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la c\u00e9dule 2e.\nLa section 9 va encore plus loin en limitant la r\u00e9vocation de l'acte 7 Vict., ch. 11, aux seules propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es dans la 2e c\u00e9dule, elle laisse \u00e9videmment subsister le proviso de la section 29. De sorte que ce statut n'affecte en aucune mani\u00e8re le droit de l'appelante.\nIl y a le m\u00eame argument \u00e0 faire contre la pr\u00e9tention que le terrain en question a pass\u00e9 au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral par l'acte de conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. La section 108 lui transporte les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es dans la 3e c\u00e9dule, article 1er: \"Canals, with lands and water powers connected therewith.\" Cet article comprend certainement le canal Rideau, et les mots \"with lands connected therewith,\" comprennent bien certainement aussi les terrains n\u00e9cessaires et employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'usage du canal, mais ne comprennent pas les 90 acres qui sont admis n'avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'usage du canal.\nApr\u00e8s avoir attentivement examin\u00e9 les divers statuts qui concernent le sujet en question, j'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'aucun d'eux n'a eu l'effet de r\u00e9voquer le proviso de la section 29, et qu'il doit encore avoir son plein et entier effet et qu'il forme un titre l\u00e9gal en faveur de l'appelante. Pour conclure je citerai les paroles de Sir Hugh Cairns in re Holmes[26] qui, suivant moi, sont parfaitement applicables \u00e0 cette cause:\nThere has been no conveyance to vest the legal estate in the Crown or previously in the ordnance officers, and the enactment that the lands be restored is not a direction that they shall be reconveyed, nothing being necessary except the surrender of possession.\nIl est vrai que les opinions exprim\u00e9es par Sir Hugh Cairns dans cette cause, re Holmes (1), n'ont pas re\u00e7u la sanction judiciaire, parce que la cour de Chancellerie se d\u00e9clarant incomp\u00e9tente \u00e0 statuer sur les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'immeubles situ\u00e9s en dehors des limites de de sa juridiction, ne rendit en cons\u00e9quence aucune d\u00e9cision sur les autres questions d\u00e9battues.\nMais ces opinions de Sir Hugh Cairns n'en sont pas moins de la plus haute importance et ne m\u00e9ritent pas moins la plus grande consid\u00e9ration, non seulement \u00e0 cause de la science profonde de cet \u00e9minent jurisconsulte, mais aussi par le fait que dans cette cause il parlait officiellement comme Solliciteur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9, et que sa haute fonction que l'on peut assimuler \u00e0 une magistrature, l'obligeait dans ce d\u00e9bat entre Sa Majest\u00e9 d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 et des sujets de l'autre, \u00e0 dire de quel c\u00f4t\u00e9 se trouvait la loi et la justice. Il s'est formellement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 contre les pr\u00e9tentions des h\u00e9ritiers By, d\u00e9clarant que la loi avait ordonn\u00e9e de rendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question aux h\u00e9ritiers de Grace McQueen.\nCes opinions me paraissent non seulement justifier les droits de l'appelante, mais en \u00eatre en m\u00eame temps une admission solennelle devant Sa Majest\u00e9.\nLa Couronne oppose encore deux autres moyens de d\u00e9fense, le premier fond\u00e9 sur la prescription introduite par la septi\u00e8me clause de l'acte des p\u00e9titions de droit de 1876, et la deuxi\u00e8me, un estoppel, fond\u00e9 sur l'acte de vente du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832, au colonel By, par William McQueen, dont l'appelante est h\u00e9riti\u00e8re en loi et comme telle garante de l'ex\u00e9cution des dits actes.\nLa 7e section de l'acte des P\u00e9titions de droit est en ces termes:\nThe statement in defence or demurrer may raise beside any legal or equitable defences in fact or in law available under this Act, any legal or equitable defence which would have been available had the proceedings been a suit or action in a competent court between subject and subject, and any grounds of defence which would be sufficient on behalf of Her Majesty may be alleged on behalf of any such person aforesaid.\nLa Couronne par cette section se trouve avoir maintenant le droit qu'elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas avant ce statut, dans Ontario, et qu'elle ne poss\u00e8de pas encore actuellement en Angleterre, d'invoquer les statuts de Limitation. Ce droit ne lui est pas conf\u00e9r\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re directe, il est une cons\u00e9quence du privil\u00e8ge accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 de plaider tous moyens de droit ou d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 qui pourraient l'\u00eatre, comme dans une poursuite entre particuliers. Les statuts de limitation ou de prescription \u00e9tant un moyen de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la disposition des particuliers; l'effet de cette section est de permettre \u00e0 la Couronne de s'en pr\u00e9valoir.\nL'acte des p\u00e9titions de droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 pour combler une lacune consid\u00e9rable dans notre l\u00e9gislation qui ne permettait pas de mettre la Couronne en cause pour le r\u00e8glement des difficult\u00e9s r\u00e9sultant de ses nombreux contrats pour travaux publics, r\u00e9clamation de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, etc., etc. Il y avait urgence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et pour r\u00e9m\u00e9dier \u00e0 ces graves inconv\u00e9nients, il ne fallait qu'un simple acte accordant la facult\u00e9 de poursuivre la Couronne, et r\u00e9glant le mode de proc\u00e9der. Aucune l\u00e9gislation nouvelle sur le droit civil n'\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour cela. Les droits d'action sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par le droit civil de chaque province et doivent \u00eatre jug\u00e9s et d\u00e9cid\u00e9s d'apr\u00e8s ce m\u00eame droit.\nLa Couronne n'ayant pas avant cet acte le droit de plaider prescription, on a donc en lui accordant le privil\u00e8ge apport\u00e9 une modification importante au droit civil des provinces dans lesquelles ce droit n'existait pas avant d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit par cette loi. Cette modification est d'autant plus importante que Sir W. Richards dans son jugement de la cause de Tylee v. La Reine[27] a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette loi un effet r\u00e9troactif, et d\u00e9clar prescrits et \u00e9teints les droits qui ne l'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sans cela. En supposant qu'il n'y aurait eu que ce seul moyen de d\u00e9fense, Tylee aurait donc vu ses droits \u00e9teints et prescrits au moment o\u00f9 entrait en force une loi qui en lui ouvrant la port des tribunaux, lui enlevait en m\u00eame temps son droit d'action. Tylee n'est pas un cas isol\u00e9, l'appelante n'est pas non plus seule dans cette position anormale. Cette proscription, car c'en est une, et des plus injuste, fait main basse sur les droits acquis de nombreux sujets qui sachant que la Couronne ne prescrivait pas contre eux, ne se sont gu\u00e8re h\u00e2t\u00e9s de faire valoir leurs r\u00e9clamations contre elle. Il est de toute \u00e9vidence que cette loi viole des droits acquis et que son approbation sera dans bien des cas une v\u00e9ritable spoliation consomm\u00e9e au nom de la loi. Peut-on dire que la loi avait en vue un pareil r\u00e9sultat? Certainement non, car rien dans son texte n'indique une semblable intention. Les criantes injustices qu'elle causerait si elle \u00e9tait appliqu\u00e9e aux transactions pass\u00e9es sont de puissantes raisons en loi pour refuser de lui donner un effet r\u00e9troactif. Le sujet qui fait la mati\u00e8re de cette l\u00e9gislation \u00e9tait tout-\u00e0-fait nouveau, et, comme toute loi nouvelle, elle ne doit avoir d'application que pour le pass\u00e9. Cette loi pouvant causer des injustices aussi graves que celles auxquelles je viens de faire allusion, ne peut donc avoir d'effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 moins d'une disposition formelle \u00e0 cet effet qui n'existe pas. Il n'est gu\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux autorit\u00e9s sur la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 des lois. Elles sont tr\u00e8s connues et on en trouvera une longue liste dans la cause de Taylor v. La Reine,[28].\nPour arriver \u00e0 admettre la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de cette loi, Sir W. Richards s'est sans doute appuy\u00e9 sur cette consid\u00e9ration, qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, la pr\u00e9somption de non r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 des lois ne s'applique pas \u00e0 celles qui ne concernent que la proc\u00e9dure et la pratique des cours. Ceci est sans doute vrai pour ce qui concerne la proc\u00e9dure et la pratique, mais non pas lorsqu'il s'agit comme ici d'un principe du droit civil: la prescription. Mais m\u00eame en fait de proc\u00e9dure, il y a des exceptions dans les cas o\u00f9 la nouvelle proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9judicierait aux droits \u00e9tablis sous l'ancienne, ou porterait pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la bonne foi des parties[29].\nBut the new procedure would be presumably inapplicable where its application would prejudice rights established under the old or would involve a breach of faith between parties.\nLe m\u00eame auteur page 271 dit:\nThe general principle, indeed, seems to be that alterations in procedure are always retrospective, unless there be some good reason against it[30].\nPuisque d'apr\u00e8s l'autorit\u00e9 ci-dessus, il y a lieu de faire exception \u00e0 l'application de ce principe lorsqu'il y a de bonne raison, l'exception doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e dans le cas actuel, car je ne pense pas qu'il puisse s'en trouver un seul dans lesquels il y ait de meilleurs et plus justes raisons pour ne pas donner d'effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la loi. J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9 plus haut les graves injustices qui r\u00e9sulteront de la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 de cette loi. Elle d\u00e9truit certainement le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante. Et dans quelles circonstances? C'est lorsque la Couronne admet qu'elle n'a jamais pay\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante le prix de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ni \u00e0 ses auteurs, ni \u00e0 qui que ce soit pour elle, lorsqu'un texte de loi non r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, le proviso de la section 29, reconnaissait ses droits et qu'aucune prescription ne les affectait. Par cette r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 on lui enl\u00e8ve sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'attribuer contre toute justice \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en vertu d'une loi que cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 devait \u00eatre rendue \u00e0 l'appelante. Et encore on ne peut arriver \u00e0 ce d\u00e9plorable r\u00e9sultant qu'en donnant \u00e0 la disposition 7 de l'acte des P\u00e9titions de droit un effet qui d\u00e9passe la limite des pouvoirs du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Cette disposition, si elle a l'effet d'introduire une prescription qui n'existait pas, est \u00e9videmment inconstitutionnelle comme enfreignant les droits des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales\u2014tout autant qu'un statut du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque que Sa Majest\u00e9 avait eu et aurait \u00e0 l'avenir le droit d'invoquer les limitations et prescriptions.\u2014Un semblable statut e\u00fbt attir\u00e9 l'attention et n'aurait sans doute pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 parcequ'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une invasion des droits des provinces\u2014mais dans la forme adopt\u00e9e, on ne s'est pas aper\u00e7u qu'on donnait simplement \u00e0 la Couronne le droit de faire les m\u00eames d\u00e9fenses que dans les causes entre particuliers, on lui accordait un droit dont l'application pour le pass\u00e9 causerait de graves injustices. Je crois que, comme loi de proc\u00e9dure, il y a lieu de faire ici l'exception dont parle Maxwell. De plus, je consid\u00e8re cette disposition contraire aux droits des provinces, comme inconstitutionnelle. J'en conclus, pour ces deux motifs, qu'on ne peut opposer \u00e0 l'appelante la prescription fond\u00e9e sur la 7e section de l'acte des P\u00e9titions de droit, etc.\nQuant \u00e0 l'estoppel fond\u00e9 sur l'acte de vente du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832 par William McQueen au colonel By, il est clair qu'il ne peut \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante, d'abord parce qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas partie \u00e0 cet acte, et ensuite parce que cet acte pour la partie concernant les 110 acres \u00e9tait nul pour les raisons que j'ai donn\u00e9es plus haut, et enfin parceque le titre de l'appelante est \u00e9tabli par la loi, le proviso de la section 29. De plus, d'apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s suivantes, on ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir de l'estoppel contre un acte du parlement:\nEverest and Strode Law of Estoppel[31].\nIt is, perhaps, owing to the above rule, viz: that an Act of Parliament is a record to which every one is privy, that the doctrine of estoppel has been considered to have no application so as to permit parties to a contract to estop themselves in face of an Act of Partiament. However, whatever its origin, such a rule has been laid down (c) in re Stapleford Colliery Co., Barrow's case (2).\nBacon V. C. dans la cause in re Barrow, dit[32]:\nBut the doctrine of estoppel cannot be applied to an Act of Parliament Estoppel only applies to a contract inter partes, and it is not competent to parties to a contract to estop themselves or any body else in the face of an Act of Parliament.\nPour tous ces motifs j'en suis venu aux conclusions suivantes: 1o. Que les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 Grace McQueen en vertu des lettres patentes du mois de mai et juin 1801, n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement ali\u00e9n\u00e9s; 2o. Que la partie de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 prise sous pr\u00e9texte qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la construction du canal, n'ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e \u00e0 cet usage, le proviso de la section 29 de 7 Vic., ch. 11, en ordonne la restitution. 3o; Qu'aucune prescription ne peut lui \u00eatre oppos\u00e9e. 4o; Qu'il n'y a pas lieu non plus d'invoquer un estoppel fond\u00e9 sur l'acte du 6 f\u00e9vrier 1832.\nJe suis d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9.\nHENRY J.\u2014This is an action brought by petition of right and involves the title to a large and very valuable property, consisting of about ninety acres in the City of Ottawa, part of which is known as Cartier Square. It originally formed a part of patents to one Grace McQueen, dated 10th May, 1801, and 10th June, 1801, containing about 600 acres. Under a statute of Upper Canada, passed in 1827, (8 Geo. 4, ch. 1) commonly called the Rideau Canal Act, His then Majesty was invested with certain powers and authorities necessary to the making, maintaining and using the canal intended to be completed under His Majesty's direction for connecting the waters of Lake Ontario with the River Ottawa, and for other purposes therein mentioned. Lieut. Col. John By, of the Royal Engineers, was the officer employed by His Majesty to superintend the work of making the canal, and it is admitted that he some time before the passage of the act, and before the death of Grace McQueen, measured and made a plan of about 110 acres out of the lands granted or conveyed by the patents before mentioned to her, and took possession thereof for His Majesty, and it is alleged that such possession has been continued up to the time of the bringing of this suit, which was on the 1st of February, 1879. The canal was finished and opened in May, 1832. Grace McQueen died intestate on the 18th September, 1827, a few months after the passing of the act, leaving William McQueen, the father of the suppliant, her sole heir-at-law. He died intestate on the 20th October, 1845, leaving the suppliant his sole heiress at law. That in the ordinary course would have established the title to the lands in question in the suppliant. How then has she been divested of that title?\nIt is said in the first place that she was divested of the title to the 110 acres by the act of Col. By as before stated. I cannot arrive at that conclusion for the statute provides that the laying off of the land and the filing of the plan made of itself no expropriation, and provided that the engineer in question was authorized to arrange for payment for it with the owner and obtain a surrender of title to His Majesty. Such was not done in the lifetime of Grace McQueen, nor afterwards, and it does not appear that she had any knowledge of the laying out of the 110 acres or of the filing of the plan. She never was paid anything for the land so set apart and I have no hesitation in declaring that the title to it was in her at the time of her death, and that title descended to William McQueen her son and only heir. In Re Holmes,[33]; Sir Hugh Cairns, Solicitor General, on the part of the Crown, referring to the circumstances of this case, said:\nThere has been no conveyance to test the legal estate in the Crown, or previously in the ordnance officers; and the enactment that the lands be restored is not a direction that they shall be re-conveyed, nothing being necessary except the surrender of possession.\nAgain, on page 536 he says:\u2014\nIf all these difficulties were got over the persons entitled to claim restoration would be the representatives of William McQueen, and not those who claim under Col. By. The conveyance of 1832 passed all the interest which Wm. McQueen had in the land, but it could not pass an interest which was only created by a long subsequent act of Parliament in favor of \"the party or parties from whom the land was taken.\" The suppliants are not such parties.\nThe positions so taken by the learned solicitor were combatted by counsel on the other side, and did not form any part of the judgment in the case. Independently, then, of the dicta just quoted, we must consider the effect of the deed from William McQueen to By on the 6th February, 1832. At that time the canal was about finished, and it was opened for traffic in May following. The 110 acres were then in the possession of the crown, and not in possession of either McQueen or By. I am, therefore, of opinion there was no legal conveyance of the 110 acres to By. The title was after that either in the crown or in McQueen. If McQueen held the title, but even out of possession, the law denied him the power or right to transfer it; if he did not transfer it it remained in him. If he should subsequently obtain the possession either by a suit at law or otherwise he would then be in a position to make a legal transfer, and if seeking to recover the posession from a wrongful holder by a suit at law the defendant could not prevent his recovery by setting up the inoperative conveyance. We are not now trying the question as to which party to the conveyance the recovery would finally benefit. The case before us is between the party who made the inoperative conveyance, who was no doubt the titled owner, and one who claims that the title was divested before the conveyance. If that position is established the right of the claimant never existed.\nIt is admitted on all sides that but 20 out of the 110 acres were required for the canal purposes, and that no part of the remaining 90 acres was ever used or considered necessary for the use of the canal. The possession of it was, however, as I think wrongfully withheld at all events since the passage on the 9th of December, 1843, commonly called \"The Ordnance Yesting Act.\" That act vested by general terms certain public lands, &c., including the Rideau Canal, and the lands and works belonging thereto in the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance in Great Britain, and their successors in office, subject to the provisions of the said act. Now one important provision of that act in the 29th sec. is as follows:\u2014\nProvided always, and be it enacted that all lands taken from private owners at Bytown under the authority of the Rideau Canal Act for the uses of the canal which have not been used for that purpose be restored to the party or parties from whom they were taken.\nNow the 90 acres in question in this suit were taken as the proviso states but not used\u2014all lands similarly placed became subject to the enactment\u2014no matter from how many parties they had been taken. They were to be \"restored\" not reconveyed. It may be fairly argued that if the legislature or party or the parties who framed the act considered the parties wholly divested of the title to the lands in question we would have found the word re-conveyed instead of the word restored, and directions given and authority enacted for the party or parties to make the conveyances. If that is not the true construction then a most inapt word was used to provide for a conveyance. I entirely agree with Sir Hugh Cairns that no conveyance was considered necessary and that none is provided for. It is a legislative intimation to the parties in effect saying\u2014The crown has taken more of your land than was necessary for the canal, the title of what was necessary for the canal and which has been used for that purpose, with other public properties of various kinds, has been handed over to the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance, but they are not to have anything to do with the lands taken but not used for canal purposes. The enactment in the proviso not only proclaims that the principal officers of the ordnance shall have no title in or control over the now used lands, but actually conveys them to the parties from whom they were taken. The act is a general and most comprehensive one and intended to cover all the lands and property held by the crown and containing the declaration that the crown should no longer exercise any right to or have any interest in the lands referred to.\nIn 1856 an act was passed by the legislature of the late Province of Canada, intituled:\nAn act for transferring to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State the powers and estates and property therein described now vested in the principal officers of the Ordnance and for vesting other parts of the Ordnance's estate and property therein described in Her Majesty the Queen for the benefit, use and purpose of this Province,\nSection 9 of that act is as follows:\nWith respect to all lands and other real property comprised in the second schedule to this act annexed, which by this act shall be vested in Her Majesty the Queen for the benefit use and purposes of this Province in the said recited act of the seventh year of the reign of Her present Majesty, and every clause, matter and thing therein contained, shall from and immediately after the passing of this act be repealed, and the same is and are hereby repealed accordingly.\nOn reading the second schedule referred to it will be found that a great many lots of land and other property are described and included. The only reference to the Rideau Canal is in the last line of the schedule and in these words: \"Rideau and Ottawa Canals;\" and under the descriptive heading there are the words, \"City of Ottawa, Barracks, Block-houses and adjuncts of the Canals.\"\nWhat, then, is meant by the words adjuncts to the canals? Surely they cannot be intended to apply to the 90 acres which, since the opening of the canal in 1832\u201424 years before\u2014had not only never been used in connection with the canal, but which was considered by the government agents as not required for the working or maintenance of it, and which must have been within the knowledge of the legislature which passed and those who prepared the proviso in the act 7 Vic. ch. 11. The evidence furnished by the case clearly shows that for 24 years previous to 1856 the 90 acres in question formed no part of the adjuncts of the canal. If not sec. 9 above quoted not only does not repeal the proviso in question so as to affect the 90 acres, but virtually re-enacts it. It is to that extent a legislative declaration that that proviso was in force in 1856 and should have subsequent operation.\nThe transfer to Her Majesty made by sec. 6 of the act of 1856 were stated to be: All and every the lands and other real property in this province comprised in the second schedule to the act annexed, being a portion of the messauges, lands, tenements, estates and heriditaments, comprised within the provisions and meaning of the said in part recited act of the 7th year of the reign of Her present Majesty, which prior to the passing of this act were by the said recited act or otherwise vested in the said principal officers of Her Majesty's ordnance, and their successors in the said office and which have been used or occupied for the service of the ordnance department or for military defence, &c.\nNow, to include lands in that referential description it must be shown first that such lands were at the passing of the act vested in the principal officers of the ordnance department, for the statute only refers to lands previously so vested. I have already shown that the 90 acres in question were never so vested, and that the title of Grace. McQueen and her heirs remained undivested, notwithstanding the laying off of the 110 acres and the filing of the plan. The further proof necessary would be to show that the lands to be vested in Her Majesty for the use of the Province had been used or occupied either for the service of the ordnance department, which is not pretended, or for military defence, and which is also not pretended. In fact, the evidence afforded by the case shows that the 90 acres in question was not used; if used at all it was not for the service of the ordnance department or for military defence. The lands held and used for military purposes are designated in the first schedule, and if the lands in question had been so used they would have been therein included. For these reasons then, I conclude that the 90 acres in question were not included in the section in question.\nThe next section (the 7th) contains this enactment:\nProvided always, and be it further enacted, that nothing herein contained shall be taken to affect the rights of any parties claiming any of the lands, buildings, or other property referred to in the next preceding section, and in the said second schedule. If then the suppliant was entitled to claim the land in question at the passing of that act her rights are reserved to her thereby.\nThis statute is re-enacted verbatim in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada (1859) at page 292.\nIt is contended that the act 9 Vic. chap. 4, which passed at the instance of Nicholas Sparks, excluded all other persons in whose favor the proviso in the act 7th Vic. chap. 11, was enacted, but I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that it had any such legal result. If the suppliant had the legal estate in the 90 acres in question either at common law or by the operation of the statute 32 Henry VIII, the enactment contained in the proviso did not add to her title, but if she had not then I am of the opinion she got such a title as would convey to her the fee simple, and that title could only be divested by direct legislation. It was well known when that proviso was enacted that 90 out of the 110 acres had never been used for canal purposes and it being contrary to all law relative to the expropriation of private lands for public purposes that the 90 acres being such a large excess, should, in the first place, have been marked off and, a greater wrong still, retained\u2014it is but right to conclude that the 90 acres should be restored. Neither Grace McQueen nor her heirs got any payment whatever for the 110 acres, but it is argued that because an award was made at the instance of Col. By deciding that the property unexpropriated was increased in value to the extent of the 110 acres, her son was paid for them. My objection to that contention is that he was in no way a party to the reference and his interests were not affected by the award. In the next place neither of the reference papers were produced nor was the award, and it is therefore impossible to say whether the reference for the valuation was for the 110 acres or for but the twenty then being used. From the fact that it was then known that the ninety acres were not then required or used, I think the proper conclusion, in the absence of proof to the contrary, is that the arbitration only had reference to the 20 acres then being used and, further, it is not easy to believe that it would be a necessary sacrifice of more than one sixth of the whole of the 600 acres or that any arbitrators would have so awarded. It appears from the case that Nicholas Sparks had made a surrender of his title to certain parts of land to Col. By for canal purposes and thereby divested himself of all claim thereto. He parted with such parts by a surrender and it was not taken by expropriation proceedings. When therefore the act 7th Vic. chap. 11, was passed he occupied a position in respect to the lands surrendered wholly different from that of Grace McQueen's heirs. It was considered, therefore, that as respects his interests in the whole of his lands taken further legislation might be necessary. To make title in him as to the lands surrendered it was necessary not merely to restore the possession but to give him a title, either by express legislation or by a re-conveyance, to be authorized by an act. In the view of Lord Cairns, when arguing the case of re Holmes[34], before mentioned, and which I have adopted, no conveyance to the heir of Grace McQueen was necessary. The act of 1846 (the Sparks act) was considered necessary to provide for such re-conveyance, and it was done by duly reciting that doubts existed as to the construction of the proviso in the act 7 Vic. chap. 11, and it was enacted that portions of the land should be conveyed to him; but the legislature then and for the first time excepted such lands as might be desirable to retain for the service of the Ordnance Department for military purposes. The legislature, therefore, as far as the canal purposes were concerned by that act gave effect to the terms of the proviso, but as some of the land might be required for military purposes, for which purposes Sparks had made no surrender, it enacted virtually an expropriation to obtain them under the common and usual terms by valuation of and payment to be made therefor. That was substantially, as far as Sparks was concerned, a re-enactment of the terms of the proviso. The legislature then speaking by the act, said to Sparks: We will carry out the terms of the proviso and convey all the unused land to you, but some of the land may be required for military purposes. We will except such in case it may be required, and if required, will pay you for it. If then Sparks was entitled to the substantial restoration of it by the necessary legal means, why should not other parties still more favorably situated be equally so? The difficulty in Sparks' case may have been considered to have arisen from the surrender he made by which his title to parts of the land was divested, but had he occupied the position of William McQueen I am of opinion no act would have been necessary to explain the terms of proviso. There may too have been other reasons why doubts were entertained as to the proviso. Independently, then, of the legislation as to the lands of Sparks by the act of 1846, the reason for the doubts, as to the true intent and meaning of the same referred to in the act, and as to the land to which it was intended to apply, are not recited or explained. I have already referred to the doubts as to the position of Sparks, after his surrender of parts of his land for canal purposes, but there must have been doubts also as to the extent to which the proviso operated as far as he was alone concerned, for I find the act declares:\nThat the proviso should be construed to apply to all the land at Bytown set out and ascertained, and taken from Nicholas Sparks. Esq., under the provisions of the act 8 Geo. 4 ch. 1, excepting such parts as were actually occupied as a part of the canal, and some other exceptions defining what was to be retained.\nThe section in which this provision appears shows that under the circumstances it might been considered necessary in Sparks' case to define particularly the land to which the proviso was intended to apply, and therefore the reason is shown why the words referring to the same in the enactment were used. The matter was therefore one between Sparks alone and the public, and whatever way the matter was compromised or settled should not affect the rights of others. The application to the legislature was no doubt intended only to settle such doubts and difficulties as existed between those interested parties, and was never intended, I take it, to affect the rights of others. Sparks wanted a declaration as to the meaning of the proviso, and the extent to which his interests were affected as regards the quantity of his land to be restored and I conclude that the legislature meant nothing further. The act recited \"that proceedings at law and equity which had arisen out of such doubts had been commenced and were still pending.\" In 1846 suits at law and in equity were pending. In such suits, from the references to them, we must conclude Sparks alone was interested and the legislature was appealed to for aid to settle the matter in difference. This was done by the act giving Sparks a construction of the proviso, which gave him substantially the same as the proviso. That construction is in favor of the claimant's case. At all events she is unaffected by the act as the declaration in favor of Sparks does not directly or even indirectly limit the terms of the proviso to the lands of Sparks but leaves it as to others in full force. It was in my opinion but an explanatory act applicable solely to the claims of Sparks and so intended. It could only have affected the interests of others by an express and direct application to them and not by speculative inferences liable to error and the working of injustice.\nTo the petition of right in this case title to the land in question herein is pleaded to be in Her Majesty for the benefit and use of Canada. I have carefully examined and considered the provincial statutes and have shown that the land was not included in any of them having for their object the transfer of title or interest in the public lands and property from the trust held, as to them, by the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance Department, and I have shown also that it was not included in the trust previously created in those officers. I will next refer to the Imperial Confederation Act of 1867. The 108th section\u2014the only one necessary to be looked at\u2014is as follows:\u2014\nThe public works and property of each Province enumerated in the third schedule to this act shall be the property of Canada.\nThe third schedule referred to in the section just recited is headed:\nProvincial public works and property to be the property of Canada.\nThe only items of the schedule affecting the question are the 1st, 9th and 10th\u2014the 1st is:\nCanals, with lands and water powers connected therewith.\nFor thirty-five years previous to the passing of that act the 90 acres in question had not been connected with the canal, and if considered to have been so connected the connection, such as it had been, was severed by the act of 1843.\nThe 9th item is as follows:\nProperty transferred by the Imperial Government and known as Ordnance property.\nThat item certainly does not include the 90 acres in question.\nThe 10th item: Armories, drill sheds, military clothing and munitions of war, and lands set apart for general public purposes.\nThat item does not include the 90 acres in question, for it never was set apart for \"general public purposes or, indeed, for any special public purpose.\nIf the title to the 90 acres was never vested in the principal officers of Her Majesty's Ordnance or the Secretary for War it certainly never passed to Her Majesty for the benefit or use of Canada and it did not pass to Canada by the Imperial Confederation Act.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the defence set up on that ground must fail. If since the Confederation Act was passed the possession of the 90 acres has been held by some parties connected with the Dominion Government claiming under that act, it is my opinion that such holding was unauthorized.\nI have thus shown my opinion to be that the suppliant, after at all events the passing of the act of 1843, was legally entitled, at least, to the 90 acres in question. It is, however, contended that her claim was barred by the statute of limitations and I will proceed to consider that question.\nUp to the time of the passing of the act of Canada passed on the 12th of April, 1876, entitled: \"An act to make further provision for the institution of suits against the Crown by petition of right,\" the defence of the statute of limitations could not be pleaded by the sovereign.\nBy section 7 of that act: \"Any legal or equitable defences which would have been available had the proceedings been a suit or action in a competent court between subject and subject will be available to the crown.\"\nThe provision is comprehensive enough to include the defence of the statute of limitations, and we are not to inquire whether or not the legislature meant to enable the sovereign to set up that defence. Whether such a defence can be admitted under the circumstances in this case is a matter calling for consideration. To answer such an inquiry it is necessary to consider the circumstances under which the legislation in question took place and the legislature had no doubt in providing a new jurisdiction the right to prescribe how it should be exercised. Sir Peter Maxwell, in his work on \"The Interpretation of Statutes,\" at page 257, says:\u2014\nUpon the presumption that the legislature does not intend what is unjust rests the leaning against giving certain statutes a retrospective operation. Nova constitutio futuris forman imponere debet non praeteritis. They are construed as operating only on cases or facts which come into existence after the statutes were passed, unless a retrospective effect be clearly intended. It is chiefly where the enactment would prejudicially affect vested rights, or the legal character of past transactions, that the rule in question prevails. Every statute, it has been said, which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, or imposes a duty, or attaches a new disability in respect of transactions or considerations already past, must be presumed out of respect to the legislature to be intended not to have a retrospective operation.\nSee Williams v. Smith[35]; Jackson v. Woolley[36]; Re Suche & Co.[37]; Re Cochran's Estate[38]; and Young v. Hughes[39].\nAt page 273 the same author says:\u2014\nBut the new procedure would be presumebly inapplicable where its application would prejudice rights established under the old, or would involve a breach of faith between the parties.\nIn Re Ph\u00e6nix Bessemer Steel Co.,[40] Jessel M. R. as to a question whether an act had a retrospective effect says:\u2014\nThe general principle upon which alterations of the law are made is not to interfere with rights and interests that are already ascertained and determined. Nothing is more reprehensible in legislation than to deprive people of their rights without compensation. * * * If the act is to have the effect contended for (a retrospective one) the result will be to deprive these creditors of an ascertained right. I am of opinion that cannot be done without express words.\nIn re Joseph Suche Co.,[41] the same learned judge referring to his previous judgment just cited and quoted from, after saying he might decide the case on other grounds, says:\u2014\nHowever, I have since consulted other judges, and I prefer on the present occasion to rest my decision on the general ground, that the section was not intended to apply to any winding up that had been commenced before the act came into operation. I so decide because it is a general rule that when the legislature alters the rights of parties by taking away from them, or conferring upon them, any right of action, its enactments, unless in express terms they apply to pending actions, do not affect them at all. It was said that there is one exception to this rule, namely, that where the enactment merely affects procedure and does not extend to rights of action in those cases enactments have been held to apply to existing rights, and it is suggested that the alteration made by section 10 comes within this exception. I am of opinion it does not. It is not merely an alteration in procedure. It is an alteration in the right to prove for a debt.\nThe learned judge then referring to the alterations of the law by the enactment under consideration, says: \"That is not procedure.\"\nIn Wright v. Greenwood[42], which was an action to recover a medical bill, the defence was that under the provisions of sec. 32 of 21-22 Vic. ch. 90, the plaintiff not being a registered practitioner could not recover. The section provided that no person should be entitled to recover in such a case \"unless he shall prove upon the trial that he is registered under this act.\" The court, however, held that provision inapplicable to cases where the services were performed before the passing of the act. The act provided that no person could recover, but because it interfered with a vested right it could not be declared to have a restrospective operation. That is a much stronger case than that now under consideration.\nSee also Hughes & others v. Lumley & others[43] and Vansittart v Taylor[44] where the same principle was declared.\nSee again Dash v. Van Kleeck[45] wherein Chief Justice Kent in an exhaustive judgment decides a case in the same way. It is laid down in the head note:\nIt is a principle of universal jurisprudence that laws civil and criminal must be prospective and cannot have a retroactive effect.\nIn Society, &c. v. Wheeler[46] Judge Story says:\nUpon principle every statute which takes away or impairs vested rights, acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions or considerations already past must be deemed retrospective and this doctrine seems fully supported by authorities.\nIn Colder v. Bull[47] Chase, Justice, afterwards Chief Justice, delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States says\nEvery law that takes away or impairs rights vested agreeably to existing laws is retrospective and is generally unjust and may be oppressive and it is a good general rule that a law should have no retrospect.\nAgain:\nEvery law that is to have an operation before the making thereof as to commence at an antecedent time or to save time from the statute of limitations, or to excuse acts which were unlawful, and before committed and the like, is retrospective.\nThe governing authorities, as I read them, announce the law to be that where vested rights are concerned statutes shall not have reference to retrospective effect unless made expressly to have it and that such statutes are not to be considered as affecting procedure only. For the reasons stated I am of opinion the appeal should be allowed and judgment entered for the suppliant with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the suppliant's claim is not barred by the statute of limitations.\nIt appears from the facts admitted that some time prior to the 18th September, 1827, Col. By, the officer in charge of the Rideau Canal works, had set out, ascertained and taken possession of for His Majesty King Greorge IV. the 110 acres of land in question in this suit. It also appears that in February, 1832, the canal was almost completed. These 110 acres were then consequently vested in the crown. It follows, in my opinion, that the sale by William McQueen to Col. By of these 110 acres was void and of no effect. How could Col. By, holding, as he did, this land as trustee for the crown, buy it for himself? How could he get a title from McQueen, when, to his, Col. By's own knowledge, the title was in the crown? None of this land passed to Col. By, by that deed of sale. Then, subsequently by the 7 Vic. ch. 11, it was enacted that \"all lands taken from private owners at Bytown under the authority of the Rideau Canal Act, for the uses of the canal, which have not been used for that purpose, be restored to the party or parties from whom the same were taken.\" Now, it was only in 1869 that it was declared by the crown that 90 acres out of the 110 acres taken from McQueen were not wanted for the canal.\nI would hold that up to then the crown could not prescribe against 7 Vic. ch. 11, and that since then she holds these 90 acres as trustee.\nI would allow the appeal and hold that the suppliant is entitled to these 90 acres. As the judgment of the court will dismiss the appeal it is, however, useless for me to inquire what would be, in my opinion, the extent or nature of the remedy the suppliant would be entitled to had the judgment been in her favor upon the question of the statute of limitations.\nGWYNNE J. adhered to his judgment in the Exchequer Court, adding, that on the question of the statute of limitations he concurred with the Chief Justice and Strong J.\nAppeal dismissed, but without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Belcourt & MacCraken.\nSolicitors for respondent: O'Connor and Hogg.\n[1] Tylee v.
