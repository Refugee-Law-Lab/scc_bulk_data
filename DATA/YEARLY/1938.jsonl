Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92\nThe Bank Taxation Act, The Credit of Alberta Regulations Act, 1937 and The Accurate News and Information Act are ultra vires of the provincial legislature of Alberta.\nThe Alberta Social Credit Act is ultra vires of the provincial legislature. Cannon J. expressing no opinion..\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson JJ.\u2014Such legislation does not come within section 92 (13 or 16) of the B.N.A. Act; it is not within the power of that province to establish such statutory machinery with the functions for which this machinery is designed and to regulate the operation of it: such machinery, in part at least, as subject matter of legislation, comes within the field designated by \"Currency,\" (s. 91 (14) B.N.A. Act).\nPer Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson. JJ.\u2014Such machinery, as established by The Alberta Social Credit Act, in its essential components and features, comes under head no. 15, \"Banks and Banking.\"\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson JJ.\u2014Even if such legislation is not strictly within the ambit of no. 14 ,or no, 15, or partly in one or partly in the other, then this legislation is ultra vires as its subject-matter is embraced within category no. 2 of s. 91, \"Regulation of Trade and Commerce.\"\nHeld, by the Court, that the Bank Taxation Act is not an enactment in exercise of the provincial power to raise a revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation, but is legislation which, in its true character and by ascertaining its effect in the known circumstances to which it is to be applied, relates to \"Incorporation of Banks and Banking\" (s. 91 (15) B.N.A. Act).\nPer Duff C.J. and Cannon, Davis and Hudson JJ.\u2014The rate of taxation provided by that Act must be prohibitive in fact and must be known to the Alberta legislature to be prohibitive. It is not competent to the provinces of Canada, by the exercise of their powers of taxation, to force banks which are carrying on business under the authority of the Bank Act to discontinue business; and taxation by one province on a scale which, in a practical business sense, is manifestly prohibitive is not a valid exercise of provincial legislative authority under section 92. Such legislation, though in the form of a taxing statute is \"directed to\" the frustration of the system of banking established by the Bank Act, and to the controlling of banks in the conduct of their business.\nPer Crocket and Kerwin JJ.\u2014The Bank Taxation Act, instead of being a taxing enactment, is merely a part of a legislative plan to prevent the operation within the province of those banking institutions which have been called into existence and given the necessary powers to conduct their business by the only proper authority, the Parliament of Canada.\nHeld, by the Court, that The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, 1937, is legislation in relation to \"Banking\" (s,. 91 (15) B.N.A. Act); and, per Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson. JJ., it is also legislation in relation to \"The regulation of trade and commerce \" within the meaning of section 91 (2).\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis and Hudson JJ.\u2014This Act is a part of a general scheme of legislation of which The Social Credit Act is really the basis; and, that latter Act being ultra vires, ancillary and dependent legislation falls with it.\nHeld, by the Court (except Cannon J.) that The Alberta Accurate News and Information Act forms part of the general scheme of social credit legislation, the basis of which is The Alberta Social Credit Act; and since that Act is ultra vires, ancillary and dependent legislation must fall with it.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis J.\u2014Under the constitution established by the B.N.A. Act, legislative power for Canada is vested in one Parliament and that statute contemplates a parliament working under the influence of public opinion and public discussion. The Parliament of Canada possesses authority to legislate for the protection of that right; and any attempt to abrogate that right of public debate or to suppress the traditional forms of the exercise of such right (in public meeting or through the press) would be incompetent to the legislatures of the provinces. Moreover, the law by which 'the right of public discussion is protected existed at the time of the enactment of The British North America Act and the legislature of Alberta has not the capacity under section 129 of that Act to alter that law by legislation obnoxious to the principle stated.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The mandatory and prohibitory provisions of the Alberta Accurate News and Information Act interfere with the free working of the political organization of the Dominion. They have a tendency to nullify the political rights of the inhabitants of Alberta and of the citizens outside the province, as citizens of Canada, and cannot be considered as dealing with matters purely private and local in that province. The federal parliament is the sole authority to curtail, if deemed expedient and in the public interest, the freedom of the press in discussing public affairs and the equal rights in that respect of all citizens throughout the Dominion. These subjects were matters of criminal law before Confederation, have been recognized by Parliament as criminal matters and have been expressly dealt with by the criminal code. Such an Act is an attempt by the legislature to amend the Criminal Code in this respect and to deny the advantage of section 133 (a) of that Code to the newspaper publishers,\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada in the exercise of the powers conferred by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35) of the following questions as contained in the Order in Council referring these questions to the Court :\nWhereas there has been laid before His Excellency the Governor General in 'Council, a report from the Minister of Justice, dated November 2nd, 1937, representing:\n1. That it has been, and is, the avowed object of the present Government of the province of Alberta (since its advent to office in September, 1935) to inaugurate in the said province \"a new economic order\" upon the principles or plan of the theory known as Social Credit:\n2. That the said government has since the date afore-mentioned secured the enactment by the legislature of the province of Alberta of the following statutes, more or less directly related to the policy of effectuating the object hereinbefore recited, namely:\nStatutes of Alberta\n1936 (1st Sess.)\nChapter 5, entitled \" An Act Respecting Social Credit Measures,\" assented to April 3, 1936.\nChapter 6 entitled \"An Act Respecting the Refunding of the Bonded Indebtedness of the Province,\" assented to April 7, 1936.\nChapter 66 entitled \" An Act to Amend the Department of Trade and Industry Act,\" assented to April 7, 1936 (2nd Sess.)\nChapter 1 entitled \" An Act to Provide the People of Alberta with Additional Credit,\" assented to September 1, 1936.\nChapter 2 entitled \"An Act to Provide for the Reduction and Settlement of Certain Indebtedness,\" assented to September 1, 1936.

That by Order in Council, dated August 17, 1937 (P.C. 1985), passed on the recommendation and for the reasons set out in the annexed report of the Minister of Justice, it was ordered that the following Acts of the legislature of the province of Alberta, intituled respectively:\u2011\n\" An Act to Provide for the Regulation of the Credit of Alberta\";\n\" An Act to Provide for the Restriction of Civil Rights of Certain Persons \"; and\n\"An Act to Amend the Judicature Act\";\nbeing chapters one, two and five, respectively, of the statutes of the said province, 1937, assented to on the 6th day of August, 1937, and received by the Secretary of State of Canada on the 10th day of August, 1937, be disallowed; that upon the same date, the Deputy of the Governor General did certify under his sign manual and seal that the said Acts were received by him on the 10th day of August, 1937; and that by proclamation of His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the province of Alberta, dated August 27, 1937, published in the issue of the Canada Gazette of September 11, 1937 (at page 686), reciting the tenor of the said Order in Council and Certificate, the disallowance of the said Acts was duly signified.\n4. That following upon the disallowance of the Acts aforementioned, the following Bills, namely: Bill No. 1 \"An Act Respecting the Taxation of Banks\";\nBill No. 8 \"An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act\"; and\nBill No. 9 \"An Act to ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information,\"\npassed by the Legislative Assembly of the province of Alberta at the 1937 (Third Session) thereof, were by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, on the 5th October, 1937, reserved for the signification of the Governor General's pleasure; and that authentic copies of the Bills so reserved were received by the Secretary of State of Canada on the 12th October, 1937;\n6. That in a submission set forth in a letter of October 12th, 1937, to the Right Honourable the Prime Minister of Canada, the Honourable William Aberhart, Premier of the Government of the province of Alberta, stated, with reference to said Bill No. 8: \" Should there be any doubt as to the constitutional validity of the press bill, we have no objection whatever to having it referred to the courts along with the question of disallowance,\" and, after making certain observations with particular reference to said Bills Nos. 1 and 8, concluded: \" For all these reasons we contend that the question of disallowance and the press bill might well be referred to the courts for a decision.\"\nAnd whereas the Minister of Justice reports that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the legislature of the province of Alberta has legislative jurisdiction to enact the provisions of said Bills Nos. 1, 8 and 9 (authentic copies whereof are hereto annexed); and, reserving for the time being the consideration of what advice ought to be tendered to the Governor General as to the propriety of signifying, or of withholding signification of, the royal assent to the said Bills, he is of opinion that it is expedient that the question aforementioned should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination.\nNow, therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and pursuant to the provisions of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, is pleased to refer and doth hereby refer the following questions to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration: 1. Is Bill No. 1, entitled \" An Act Respecting the Taxation of Banks\" or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent intra vires of the legislature of the province of Alberta?\n2. Is Bill No. 8, entitled \"An Act to amend and Consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act\" or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent intra vires of the legislature of the province of Alberta?\n3. Is Bill No. 9, entitled \"An Act to ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information\" or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent intra vires of the legislature of the province of Alberta?\nE.

MacKay K.C. for the Alberta newspapers.\nThe judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The three Bills referred to us are part of a general scheme of legislation and in order to ascertain the object and effect of them it is proper to look at the history of the legislation passed in furtherance of the general design.\nIt is no part of our duty (it is, perhaps, needless to say) to consider the wisdom of these measures. We have only to ascertain whether or not they come within the ambit of the authority entrusted by the constitutional statutes (the British North America Act and the Alberta Act) to the legislature of Alberta and our responsibility is rigorously confined to the determination of that issue. As judges, we do not and cannot intimate any opinion upon the merits of the legislative proposals embodied in them, as to their practicability or in any other respect.\nIt will be necessary, first of all, to examine with some care the central measure, which is The Alberta Social Credit Act, and to arrive at a proper conception of its character from the constitutional point of view.\nVarious declarations throughout the enacting provisions of this statute, as well as in the preamble, leave no room for doubt as to its objects. We cite verbatim some of these declarations because we think it is important to have before us the language selected by the Legislature itself to describe the purpose of the legislation and the general nature and functions of the machinery which is to be put into operation,\nTo appreciate the significance of these declarations, however, it is necessary to advert to the constitution and nature of the three bodies set up by the statute for the administration of the Act as well as to the statutory definition of \" Alberta Credit.\"\nThere is, first, a Board which is designated simply as \" The Board\"; the first members of which are named by the statute, their successors being appointed by the Legislature. Then there is the Provincial Credit Commission which is to be appointed by the Board; and here it is convenient to mention the duties of the Commission in determining the value of \" Alberta Credit.\" \" Alberta Credit \" is defined by section 2 (a) as,\nthe unused capacity of the industries and people of the province of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services.\nBy section 5 (1) there is to be an account in the treasury of the province known as the Provincial Credit Account. The Commission is to determine, in the manner prescribed by the Act, the value for each year of the\nunused capacity of the industries and people of the province of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services;\nin other words, the value in money (section 2 (k)) of \" Alberta Credit.\" This amount is to be credited to the Provincial Credit \"Account and \" at the end of each year the amount \" in this account \" which shall not have been drawn upon in that year shall be written off.\" The decisions of the Board and of the Commission in the determination of the annual money value of this \" unused capacity \" are to be final and are to govern the Provincial Treasurer in the establishment and maintenance of the \" Provincial Credit Account.\" It is this \" Alberta Credit \" annually determined and credited to the Provincial Credit Account which constitutes, according to the plan of the statute, a fund of credit that is to be employed and put into circulation through the machinery set up by the Act in order to facilitate the exchange of goods ,and services and generally to effectuate the purposes of the Act.\nThen, there is the Alberta Credit House which is a department of the provincial administration, constituted by the Commission and a body corporate; and which is to maintain branches throughout the province.\nA reference is also necessary to Treasury Credit Certificates. These are issued by the Provincial Treasurer against the Provincial Credit Account from time to time through the Credit House system.\nAmong the declarations expounding the purpose of the statute we refer to these:\u2014\nBy the preamble it is affirmed :\nthe people of Alberta, rich in natural wealth and resources both actual and potential, are yet heavily in debt and have been unable to acquire and maintain a standard of living such as is considered by them to be both desirable and possible; and\n* * * the existing means or system of distribution and exchange of wealth is considered to be inadequate, unjust and not suited to the welfare, prosperity and happiness of the people of Alberta.\nSection 7 provides:\nIt is the intent and purpose of this Act to provide for the issue of Treasury Credit Certificates to such extent as may be requisite for the purpose of increasing the purchasing power of the consumers of Alberta as to make such purchasing power conform to the productive capacity of the people 'of the province for the production and delivery of wanted goods and services, which capacity is declared to be the measure of Alberta Credit.\nSection 31 declares:\nThe Commission shall so function and administer this Act for the purpose and to the intent that the Treasury Credit Certificate Account in all branches shall be maintained in balance at all times. It is the intent of this Act to control the volume of the means of payment for goods and services in harmony with the ability of the whole province to produce and consume them on a rising standard of living, so that excess expansion of credit and a consequent undue advance in the price level shall not occur, and that the present system of issuing credit through private initiative for profit, resulting in recurrent deflations and inflations shall cease.\nWith this section, section 33 should be read. It is in the following words :\nIn order to establish a system of circulating credit which shall at all times conform to the capacity of the industries and people of Alberta for the production of wanted goods and services; it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta to prevent the undue expansion of credit as well as to eliminate the contraction of credit in time of slackening trade. It is the true meaning and intent of this Act, whenever deemed necessary by the Commission, that the controls over supply of credit through open market operations and the discount rate shall be employed as heretofore to maintain a balanced credit structure.\nTo these should be added the following statements in the Social Credit Measures Act (1936) which has been repealed:\n* * * the existence of indigence and unemployment throughout a large portion of the population demonstrates the fact that the present monetary system is obsolete and a hindrance to the efficient production and distribution of goods; and\n* * * the electors of the province are favourable to the adoption in the province of a measure based .on what are generally known as Social Credit principles, their general objects being to bring about the equation of consumption to production, and to afford to each person a fair share in the cultural heritage of the people in the province;\nand this statement from the Credit House Act (1936) also repealed :\n2 (a) \"Alberta Credit\" means the credit provided by the Credit House for facilitating the exchange of goods and services within the province.\nSection 36 (b) should also be noticed:\n36. In addition to the specific powers 'conferred by this Act, the Commission shall be empowered,\u2014\n(b) to examine into, consider, investigate and formulate proposals 'having for their object the increase of the purchasing power of the consumer by means of social dividends, compensating discounts or by any other means and the payment to the producer of any commodity of a just price and the allowance to any dealer in a commodity of a fair commission on turnover, and for such purposes to ascertain all necessary facts relating thereto, and to report to the Board as to the feasibility of applying any such proposal or any modification thereof having regard to the economic circumstances of 'the province and of the various businesses, industries, trades and vocations of the people of the Province.\nBy section 42, the substance of which is given below, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council has full power to give effect to any report of the Commission in so far as its recommendations are not contrary to the policy of the statute, even to the extent of altering and supplementing the provisions of the statute itself. These declarations enable us to affirm with certainty (1) that the evil as the Legislature conceives it with which the statute is intended to grapple is the inability of the people of Alberta to attain to a proper standard of living by reason of the inadequate supply or the unfair distribution of purchasing power; and (2) that, broadly speaking, the enactments in the statute are designed, to employ the phraseology of the authors of the legislation, to equate purchasing power or effective demand with productive capacity; and, moreover, it is easily susceptible of demonstration by reference to the provisions of this statute in detail and to those of the cognate legislation that these measures proceed upon this fundamental postulate, viz., that the economic ills which they aim at curing arise primarily from financial causes and, particularly, from the circumstance that bank credit, which constitutes in the main, in point of volume, the circulating medium of payment and exchange in this country, is issued through private initiative for private profit. And, speaking in general terms, the statute sets up the machinery of a financial system which is to be administered by statutory authority and the predominant function of which is to provide a form of credit designated as \" Alberta Credit \" which is to be made accessible to consumers and others through the channels created by the Act, and which is to circulate as a medium of exchange and payment.\nAlberta credit (the nature of which is described as explained above) is distributed by the Provincial Treasurer by means of Treasury Credit Certificates; and it is his duty to issue through the Credit House system Treasury Credit Certificates in such amounts and at such times as may be required for the purposes of the statute. In particular, it is his duty to issue such certificates to the branches or other agencies for the purpose of providing the credits established pursuant to the requirements of section 13 for, that is to say,\n(a) a discount on prices to consumers at retail;\n(b) government services;\n(c) interest free loans;\n(d) debt payments;\n(e) export subsidies;\n(f) provincial consumers' dividends;\n(g) such other purposes as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council at the request of the Board may by order so declare. As to the purposes mentioned in section 13 (g), it should be noticed that, by section 36 (a), in addition to the other powers conferred by the Act, the Commission is empowered to transfer Treasury Credit Certificates in any manner consistent with the purpose of this Act.\nThe Commission is, moreover, specifically authorized by section 5 (3) to advance Alberta credit to persons engaged in\nagriculture or manufacturing or industry * * * and * * * to defray the costs of the building of a home or for establishing or maintaining any business, vocation, calling or for public service.\nIt is also authorized to negotiate any transfer of Alberta credit with any person, firm or corporate body \" entitled to Alberta credit.\"\nThen the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is authorized (section 10),\non the advice of the Board * * * (to) declare that all claims against the province for the payment of any money out of any appropriation of public money made by the Legislative Assembly * * * shall be satisfied by the transfer to such person of an amount of Alberta Credit.\nequivalent to the amount of such claim, with a proviso that, in the case of contractual obligations, all parties must agree.\nMunicipal corporations (by s. 12) are authorized to accept transfers of Alberta credit in satisfaction of any claim and to transfer such Alberta credit to persons who are willing to accept the same in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of their claims for the carrying out of any public work.\nTwo principal methods are provided for securing access to Alberta Credit by the population generally as individuals. One of the means adopted for this purpose is designated the \"Consumers' Dividend,\"\u2014a monthly grant of Alberta credit to everybody falling within the designation of \"persons entitled to Alberta credit,\" which includes virtually everybody who is twenty-one years of age, a British subject, resident and domiciled in Alberta, the amount of which is determined by the Commission. The payment of these dividends is provided by Treasury Certificates issued to each branch for the amount that branch has to disburse and the branch issues credit vouchers to the recipients of the dividend in payment thereof.\nThe second method is by use of the retail discount rate, which constitutes, perhaps, the cardinal feature of the statutory plan. This is a rebate by which purchasers of goods and services are subsidized through a reduction of price compensated by a corresponding credit to the retailer. It is applicable to sales of goods and services to ultimate consumers by persons qualified to \" dispense \" the discount. In order to qualify for this purpose, a retailer must enter into an agreement with the Commission, one term of which, if the Commission so requires, is that he will deal only with wholesalers and primary producers who have entered into agreements with the Commission pursuant to the provisions of the statute. The discount rate is fixed by the Commission and is determined by the ratio of the money value of the \" unused productive capacity \" of Alberta to the value of the total capacity.\nFor augmenting purchasing power, the principal agency appears to be this retail discount rate. A subsidy in this form, by way of reduction of price, it is, perhaps, assumed, will not be attended with the same risk of consequential inflation as a direct subsidy to consumers; especially as the rate, being fixed by reference to the ratio between the value of unusued capacity for production and the value of total capacity may be supposed to diminish with augmentation of production. A condition of the operation of this device is, of course, the provision of some means for compensating the seller for the reduction in price and, since the province of Alberta has no legislative control over the creation of currency or legal tender or bank credits, compensation in any of these forms would ordinarily be supplied by means of taxation, or in other words, ultimately from the pockets of people living in Alberta or owning property there. Such difficulties the statutory plan proposes to avoid by the establishment of Alberta credit as a fund of credit for employment, as we have seen, as a means of exchange and payment.\nThe statute recognizes that extra-provincial debts will in most cases have to be paid in currency and declares that they shall be so paid when desired by the \" other party\"; and certain enactments of the statute appear to be intended to make provision for this. It is recognized, in other words, that it would not be practicable for Alberta to establish a system under which legal tender is wholly dispensed with.\nAs regards intra-provincial transactions, authority is given to everybody to receive Alberta credit in payment of goods and services, but here again the Legislature has obviously recognized its lack of authority to make such acceptance compulsory by direct legislative enactment. Nevertheless, it is clear from the declarations above quoted, as well as from the statute as a whole that the substitution generally in internal commerce of Alberta credit for bank credit and legal tender as the circulating medium is of the very essence of the plan.\nThe object being to provide increased purchasing power, it is, as explained, of the essence of the scheme that this shall be brought about, not by subsidizing consumers directly, but, mainly by a rebate in prices through the application of the retail discount rate. As that necessarily involves the provision of some means for compensating the seller, and since the compensation provided is compensation out of Alberta credit, it is clear enough that this device could only be made practicable in connection with transactions where the price is paid in Alberta credit, and the discount rate will itself, of course, be paid in the same way.\nThe practicability of the scheme, the feasibility of it as a means of accomplishing the declared purpose of the legislation, postulates, therefore, a willingness on the part of sellers of goods and services, in Alberta transactions, to accept Alberta credit in payment; in other words, acceptance generally in Alberta of Alberta credit as the circulating medium.\nThe Credit House is, as already observed, the agent of the Provincial Treasurer through which Alberta credit circulates. The Credit House is to accept deposits of currency and securities, to transfer credit, to receive deposits of credit vouchers and of transfers of Alberta credit. It can convert currency and negotiable instruments on demand into Alberta credit. It is to issue credit vouchers in payment of the consumers' dividend. It is probably intended to issue discount vouchers. Alberta credit on deposit with a branch may be drawn against by a customer by means of any instrument in the form prescribed by the Commission. The forms of credit vouchers and discount vouchers and of transfers are to be settled by regulation by the Commission.\nIt is expressly provided that a transfer of credit becomes effective on delivery; that is to say, on presentment to a branch of the Credit House. In other words, it is equivalent to an order which is to be honoured on demand. Bankers' credit may be described as the \" right to draw cheques on a bank \"; and the practical exercise of this right involves either the transfer of credit to another on the books of the same bank, or on the books of another bank, or payment to the payee in legal tender at his discretion. A customer of the Credit House has no right to require payment of legal tender at his discretion, unless his ; deposit is a currency deposit, and cannot transfer such a right to another, but, save in that respect, he is, and must necessarily be, if the system is really to be operative, in relation to his account in the Credit House, in the same position as the customer of a bank.\nThe question arises: Is legislation of this type competent to a province as within the ambit of Property and Civil Rights within the Province (no. 13) or Matters merely local or private within the Province (no. 16) ; or does the subject matter of it fall within the categories of matters set apart by section 91 under the enumerated heads of that section to be exclusively regulated and controlled by the central legislative authority acting in behalf of the people of Canada as a whole?\nThe question thus stated puts a dilemma which is not strictly complete because, of course, a subject matter of legislation, though not within any of the enumerated heads of section 91, may still be outside the ambit of section 92.\nThe whole of the two sections must be considered; and, of course, in light of the judicial interpretation of them. The second of the enumerated categories of section 91 is defined by the words \" The Regulation of Trade and Commerce.\" The same section comprises a number of other categories of subjects which in great part, at least, would, if full scope were given to the words \"Regulation of Trade and Commerce\" in their ordinary sense, fall under head no. 2. Among them are Currency and Coinage (no. 14) ; Incorporation of Banks, Banking and the Issue of Paper Money (no. 15) and Legal Tender (no. 20).\nIn respect of \" any matter coming within any \" of these \" classes of subjects\" the authority of the Parliament of Canada is \" exclusive \"; and \"legislation falling strictly within any of the classes \" so enumerated \" is not within the legislative competence of the provincial legislatures under section 92\" (The Fisheries case)[1].\nIndeed, by the explicit words of the concluding paragraph of section 91, \" any matter coming within any of \" these \" classes of subjects shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local and private nature \" assigned exclusively to the provinces. It is settled by the decision of the Privy Council in A.G. for Ontario v. A.G. for Canada[2] (as interpreted in the Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[3]) that if a given subject-matter falls within any class of subjects enumerated in section 91, \"it cannot be treated as covered by any of those within section 92.\"\nThe general character of the classes of subjects enumerated in section 91, especially of those mentioned above (Trade and Commerce, Currency and Coinage, Banks and Banking, Legal Tender), is important. A comparison of the nature of these subjects with the subjects included in section 92 seems to suggest that credit (including credit in this novel form) as a medium for effecting the exchange of goods and services, and the machinery for issuing and circulating it, are among the matters assigned to the Dominion under section 91 and not among those intended to be assigned to the provinces under any of the categories of section 92.\nThe categories (of s. 91) mentioned having been committed for legislative action to Parliament, which represents the people of Canada as a whole, we find it difficult to suppose that it could have been intended, under the general headings Property and Civil Rights, Matters merely local or private, that a single province might direct its powers of legislation under section 92 to the introduction, maintenance and regulation of this novel apparatus for all commercial, industrial and trading operations.\nFor our present purpose, we are, once again, not in the least concerned with any question of the practicability of the scheme; which will necessarily depend, as we have seen, upon the general acceptance, by the people of Alberta, of Alberta credit as a medium of payment in intra-provincial transactions. In order to test the validity of the legislation we must, we think, envisage the plan in practice as the statute contemplates it.\nOur conclusion is that it is not within the power of the province to establish statutory machinery with the functions for which this machinery is designed and to regulate the operation of it. Weighty reasons could be urged for the conclusion that, as subject matter of legislation, in part at least, it comes within the field designated , by \"Currency\" (no. 14 'of section 91). We think the machinery in its essential components and features comes under head no. 15, Banks and Banking; and if the legislation is not strictly within the ambit of no. 14 or no. 15, or partly in one and partly in the other, then we are satisfied that its subject matter is embraced within category no. 2, Trade and Commerce, and that it does not come within section 92.\nFirst, as to banking. A banker has been defined as \" a dealer in credit.\" True, in ordinary speech, bank credit implies a credit which is convertible into money. But money as commonly understood is not necessarily legal tender. Any medium which by practice fulfils the function of money and which everybody will accept in payment of a debt is money in the ordinary sense of the words even although it may not be legal tender; and this statute envisages a form of credit which will ultimately, in Alberta, acquire such a degree of confidence as to be generally acceptable, in the sense that bank credit is now acceptable; and will serve as a substitute therefor.\nSections 31 and 33, which have been quoted above, are most important in this connection.\nFurthermore, sections 32, 34 and 35 (1) all contemplate the maintenance and control of credit by operations which would appear to be substantially banking operations.\nIt will be observed that full powers are vested in the Commission to give effect to the general provisions of the Act by regulation; and that, moreover, the Board is invested with authority to assist any proposal calculated to \" equate \" consumption with production; and, further-more, that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, by section 42, is authorized, for the purpose of giving effect to the intent and purpose of the statute, upon the request of the Board, to alter or supplement the provisions of the Act for the purpose of providing for matters arising out of the operation of the Act for which no provision is made, provided that such change is not contrary to the policy of the Act. The \"policy\" of the Act, \"the intent and purpose\" of the Act, are sufficiently stated in the declarations quoted above.\nSince the operation of the scheme will necessarily depend upon the general employment of Alberta credit as a means of exchange and payment, we think the argument advanced in Mr. Geoffrion's factum is a sound one, that, as regards the forms of credit vouchers and discount vouchers and transfers, and the administration of the Credit House and the transaction of business as between the Credit House and its customers, provision will presumably be made in exercise of these powers for facilitating in as high degree as possible the use of Alberta credit for all the purposes of trade and commerce within Alberta; and that the forms of dealing in credit, which by long experience have commended themselves to the banking, financial and commercial community as the most convenient, will be followed as far as practicable. It is fair to infer, we think, that this is what the statute contemplates.\nIn substance, we repeat, this system of administration, management and circulation of credit (if, and in so far as it does not fall under the denomination \" Currency \") constitutes in our view a system of \" banking \" within the intendment of section 91; and the statute in our opinion is concerned with \" banking \" in that sense.\nThere is, if the subject matter of the statute is not strictly \" currency \" or \" banking,\" or both, an alternative view of the character of it. Employing the words in their ordinary sense and detached from their context in the British North America Act, nobody would hesitate to say that The Alberta Social Credit Act is concerned with \"trade and commerce.\" It provides the machinery for a novel system of credit and contemplates the separation of intra-provincial industry, commerce and trade from the existing system of finance (in which bank credit and legal tender constitute the media of payment) ; and the conduct of industrial, commercial and trading activities by the instrumentality of this new system of credit through this statutory machinery; and this would appear to involve profound and far-reaching changes in the operations of commerce and trade. In this connection the comprehensive terms of section 36 (b) should be recalled. Any proposal reported to the Board by the Commission pursuant to that section can, under the powers of section 42, be given the force of statute by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, even though that should involve an amendment of the Act. These two sections afford striking evidence of the penetrating and far-reaching character of the activities of the Board and the Commission in relation to commerce, industry and trade which the authors of the legislation had in view.\nSuch legislation, if not legislation in respect of banking or currency, would appear to be concerned with the regulation of trade and commerce, rather than with property and civil rights or matters merely local or private in the province.\nThis brings us to the question: Is such a classification forbidden by the context, or by any restriction imposed in consequence of considerations derived from the enactments and the declarations of the B.N.A. Act as a whole?\nIn deciding this question, we must, of course, consult the pronouncements of the Courts. It has been settled in a series of decisions that the literal meaning of the words \" Regulation of Trade and Commerce \" must be restricted\nin order to afford scope for powers which have been given exclusively to the provincial legislatures (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[4].\nIt will not be necessary to review these decisions at length. The concrete questions there brought into controversy can be briefly stated. They concerned the authority of the Dominion under section 91(2) to legislate in relation to local railways and undertakings, which are specifically dealt with in section 91(29) and section 92(10) (Montreal Street Railway case)[5] ; in relation to the regulation of a particular business (Insurance Reference)[6]; in relation to a commission appointed by the Government of Canada and empowered to make orders directed to particular traders in a given town controlling them in respect of the prices of commodities offered by them for sale in such town (In re Board of Commerce Act)[7]; in relation to the public investigation of disputes between individual employers and their workers and the prohibition of strikes and lockouts pending such investigation (Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider)[8].\nThese comprise the principal relevant decisions prior to the judgment of the Privy Council in 1937 in re Natural Products Marketing Act[9] to which we are about to refer; and if attention be directed to the thing which was the actual subject of decision, rather than to what was said, it will be found that they are completely and accurately summed up in the observation of Lord Atkin in A.-G. for B.C. v. A.-G. for Canada[10] in these words:\nthe regulation of trade and commerce does not permit the regulation of individual forms of trade or commerce confined to the province.\nIn our opinion, there is no kind of analogy between the legislation under review in any of these cases and The Social Credit Act. Neither the object of that Act, as stated in the explicit declarations quoted, nor the effect of it, if it be operative, is the regulation of any particular form of business, unless it is legislation on the subject of banking. Nor does the statute attempt the regulation of particular trades or of forms of trade or commerce through a general authority committed to a single regulating body, as in the Board of Commerce case[11] and in the Reference re the Natural Products Marketing Act5. Nor is it a statute, such as the Sales of Goods Act, declaring the legal rights of parties in relation to trading or commercial transactions. It attempts, as we have said, to effect a radical reorganization of the whole system of trade and commerce within the province by the substitution of a novel system of credit for the present financial system under which the operations of trade, industry and commerce are now conducted.\nCan it be said that this view ascribes to the Regulation of Trade and Commerce a meaning and effect which unduly restricts the ambit of the powers given under section 92\u2014which fails, in the words quoted above from the judgment in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[12], to\nafford scope for powers which are given exclusively to the provincial legislatures? The conclusion, we have already indicated, that the subject matter of this legislation would appear more naturally to fall within category no. 2 of section 91 than within section 92 under either Property and Civil Rights or Matters merely local and private, is fortified by reference to the general nature of other classes of subjects assigned to the Dominion. Assuming that the subject-matter does not fall within the more specific categories mentioned (Banking and Currency), it is closely allied to such, matters. We can see, we repeat, no reason for ascribing it to nos. 13 and 16 of section 92. Where you have in the enumerated subdivisions of section 91 language which is apt for the designation of a particular matter, then you are not entitled to exclude that matter from the category so defined in the absence of some very cogent reason. The reason indicated above (the risk of unduly restricting the scope of powers intended to be vested in the provinces) which led to the exclusion from this category of the regulation of individual forms of trade and commerce, and of contracts in particular trades, and the regulation of the relations of masters and servants, have no application here; because an inspection of the structure and language of sections 91 and 92, and a comparison of the subjects of the two sections, reveals no justification for the assumption that the subject matter of this legislation belongs to any type of matters which it could have been intended to commit to the legislative jurisdiction of a single province.\nWe have discussed the principal decisions upon the scope of head no. 2 of section 91. It remains to consider some observations contained in the judgments in three, of those cases,\u2014the Montreal Street Railway case[13], the Board of Commerce case[14] and Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[15]. In the judgments in the two last-mentioned cases a view was expressed which had been adumbrated in the first of them and which can be given in a sentence from the judgment in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[16]. It is to this effect:\nIt is in their Lordships' opinion now clear that excepting so far as the power can be invoked in aid of capacity conferred independently under other words in s. 91, the power to regulate trade and commerce cannot be relied on as enabling the Dominion. Parliament to regulate civil rights in the provinces.\nIt is difficult, no doubt, to reconcile this view with the concluding paragraph of section 91 already discussed; nevertheless, in a judgment delivered in Re the Natural Products Marketing Act[17] we unanimously expressed the opinion, and our judgment proceeded in part, at least, upon the hypothesis, that we were bound by this pronouncement in the judgment in Snider's case[18] and by similar \u2014 pronouncements in the Board of Commerce case[19], as expressing the ratio decidendi of those decisions. It is clear now, however, from the reasons for judgment in A.-G. for Ontario v. A.-G. for Canada[20] that the Regulation of Trade and Commerce must be treated as having full independent status as one of the enumerated heads of section 91. The judgment states, referring to the former Trade Mark Act of 1927, that it gave.\nto the proprietor of a registered trade mark the exclusive right to use the trade mark to designate articles manufactured or sold by him. It creates, therefore, a form of property in each province and the rights that flow therefrom. * * * If challenged one obvious source of authority would appear to be the class of subjects enumerated in s. 91 (2), the Regulation of Trade and Commerce, referred to by the Chief Justice. There could hardly be a more appropriate form of the exercise of this power than the creation and regulation of a uniform law of trade marks.\nThis judgment recognizes the necessity of keeping the actual language of sections 91 and 92 constantly in view in applying the enactments of those sections. Paraphrases of the words of head no. 2 of section 91 have been found useful in particular cases for assigning to that head a function in the scheme of these sections which would not result in defeating one main purpose of the B.N.A. Act by substantially impairing the autonomy of the provinces in respect of matters of purely provincial concern. But such paraphrases were not framed in light of the possibility of such legislation as that now before us. Such legislation was not in the minds of the great judges who adopted them. And since in none of the cases was it strictly necessary to draw an abstract line fixing the limits of the category in question, these formulae ought not to be treated as substitutes for the words of section 91, when, as now, a totally new type of legislation has to be considered; in relation to which it would be extravagant to suggest that any question of impairment of such autonomy arises.\nIt remains to add that the circumstance that the statute operates only within the boundaries of the province is, in the view expressed above, immaterial.\nThis Act, in common with The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, contains a section which it will be convenient to discuss here. It is section 50 and is in these words:\nNo provision of this Act shall be so construed as to authorize the doing of any act or thing which is not within the legislative competence of the Legislative Assembly.\nSpeaking of similar provisions in Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd.[21], Lord Sumner said:\nIn their Lordships' opinion the real question is whether the Legislature has actually interfered with interprovincial or with foreign trade. The presence or absence of an express disclaimer of any such interference may greatly assist where the language of the Provincial Legislature does not in itself determine the question and define its effect. If, however, it is otherwise clear that there is such an interference, or that there is none and the language actually used sufficiently decides that question, there is no such sovereign efficacy in such a clause as s. 72 as to make its presence or absence in an enactment crucial.\nSince, in our opinion, the substantive enactments of the statute are ultra vires and the statute as a whole is void as constituting an attempt to set up and provide for the regulation of the machinery for a system of credit in the sense explained, s. 50 would appear, in the view expressed by the Judicial Committee, to be of no significance, as having nothing to operate upon.\nSection 50 is of an entirely different character from that in question in A.G. for Manitoba v. Manitoba License-holders Ass'n[22].\nWe come now to the bills submitted. The first to be considered is Bill no. 8, The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, 1937,\"\nIn view of what has already been said, this statute is ultra vires on a narrow ground. It is a licensing statute, not in the sense that it imposes taxation by way of licence, but in the sense that the licensing authority is used for the purpose of regulating the institutions to which the statute relates; that is the pith of it, and the licensing authorities are the Provincial Credit Commission and the Social Credit Board, the commission and the board constituted under The Alberta Social Credit Act; and the narrow point is this: In the view already expressed, The Alberta Social Credit Act is ultra vires. The machinery it professes to constitute cannot, therefore, come into operation. Consequently, The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act which can only take effect through that machinery must necessarily be inoperative. Furthermore, it is quite plain, not only from the preamble of The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, but also from its enacting provisions, that it is a part of the general scheme of legislation of which The Alberta Social Credit Act is really the basis; and that statute being ultra vires, ancillary and dependent legislation falls with it.\nThe broader ground upon which we think this legislation is ultra vires is this: First, it is legislation in relation to Banking. In the alternative, it is legislation in relation to the Regulaton [sic] of Trade and Commerce within the meaning of section 91 (2) of The British North America Act.\nThe statute contains no express definition of \" credit.\" Nevertheless, the language itself in which the enactments of the statute are expressed appears to afford indicia from which it is not difficult to ascertain the kind of credit the statute contemplates. First, we have the declaration that a \" credit institution \" is a person or corporation whose business or ,any part of whose business is the business of dealing in credit. The credit we are concerned with, therefore, is something which is dealt with as part of a business.\nThen, by clause (b), a business of this kind consists in transactions whereby such \" credit is created, issued, lent * * * provided * * * by means of book-keeping entries \" or \" dealt in \" by such means. Further, the credit is of such a character that these transactions occur in relation to it: \" the payment of cheques (which have been) made, drawn or paid in by customers,\" the payment of other negotiable instruments which have been similarly dealt with by customers and \" the making of advances and the granting of overdrafts.\"\nWe are concerned, for the present, with 'ascertaining the effect of clause (a) and of clause (b) minus the last member. Perhaps it is convenient at the outset to refer to the recital which is in these words:\nWhereas the extent to which property and civil rights in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the principles governing the monetization of credit and the means whereby such credit is made available to the province and to the People collectively and individually of the province.\n\"Monetization of credit\" does not seem to be a very precise expression, but it does point to the conclusion that the credit with which the statute is concerned is credit in a form in which it can be employed for the purposes of money.\nNow, the language of clause (b), excluding, of course, the last member, is perfectly sensible as applied to bank credit. A banker is a dealer in credit. Bank credit has, in ordinary usage, the meaning which is ascribed to it in the following paragraph in the chapter on the Creation of Credit in the late Mr. Walter Leaf's volume on Banking in the Home University Library, a chapter added in the last edition by Mr. Ernest Sykes, secretary to the Institute of Bankers:\nThe word credit is used in a variety of meanings between which it is not at the moment necessary to distinguish. Suffice it to say that when the creation of credit is discussed there is general agreement that by credit is meant banker's credit, that is to say, the right to draw cheques on a bank. The exercise of this right involves either the withdrawal from the bank of legal tender, in the shape of bank notes or silver and bronze coin, or the transfer of such a right to some other person in the books of the same or another bank.\nIn a well-known book, published in 1890 (Macleod, Theory of Credit, p. 368-9), it is said:\nWhen a customer pays in money into his account in the usual way of business, he sells it to the banker. * * *\nIn exchange for the money the banker makes an entry of an equal sum in credit in favour of his customer. And it is the entry to the credit of the customer which, in the technical language of modern banking is termed a deposit * * *\nSo when a banker discounts a bill for a customer he buys it exactly in the same way as he bought money from his customer. He creates a credit in his books in favour of his customer. And this credit created to purchase the bill is termed a deposit equally as the credit created to purchase the money * * * A deposit is simply a credit in the banker's books. It is the evidence of the right of action which a customer has to demand a sum of money from the banker. As soon as the banker has created a credit, or deposit, in his books in favour of a customer he has issued to him a right of action against himself.\nIt is needless to say, perhaps, that we are not in the least concerned here with controversies about the creation of credit by bankers, touching the limits of the power of bankers in this respect, and the conditions to which the power is subject. Everybody concedes that bankers do create credit in the sense of the paragraphs just quoted. Moreover, it is not in conflict with usage to speak of such credit being \" credit created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in by means of book-keeping entries.\"\nSuch language, properly understood, not incorrectly describes the practice followed in banking transactions. Speaking generally, bank credit transferable on demand and so available for commercial purposes is evidenced by book-keeping entries, and it is upon the evidence, and authority of such entries that the banker and his employees daily and hourly act in the business of the bank. Such entries are for practical purposes the record as well as the evidence of the creation, of bank credit and it is by means of them that such credit as a medium of payment and exchange is transferred, disbursed and dealt in.\nThen, the 'transactions enumerated in the second member of the clause are all defined as transactions relating to \" credit created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in by means of book-keeping entries \" in course of the business of dealing in credit. In this country, the functions of temporary lending and the provision of transferable credits as a means of payment are performed together as a matter of course.\nBut it is important to emphasize that, while the payment of customers' cheques and other negotiable instruments and the making of advances and the granting of overdrafts are enumerated in the second member of the clause, they are all transactions having relation to some \" credit created * * * or dealt in by means of book-keeping entries.\"\nThe essential feature of the business of dealing in credit, therefore, is, by this definition, the creation of credits and the dealing in credits by means of book-keeping entries and these related transactions. It should be noted also that, from the persons carrying on the business of dealing in credits so defined is excepted the Bank of Canada; and clause (b), with the last member left out of consideration, has unquestionably the effect of designating transactions which are the transactions of somebody who is carrying on business in banking. We are unable to read this language as extending to transactions which are not of that character. It was suggested that the transactions of a bill broker or a person engaged in discounting bills or making advances on the credit of bills or promissory notes would fall within it, but this leaves entirely out of account the all important limitation that the business of dealing in credit, by definition, is the business of somebody who is engaged in transactions of the kind specified but with the qualification that such transactions are effectuated by means of \"book-keeping entries.\" Such language, properly understood, finds, as we have seen, a reasonable application in designating the transactions of a banker but, so far as we are aware, it has no application to the business of a bill broker or to that of a money lender who is not a banker.\nIt should be observed that the statute applies only to credit institutions which are carrying on business when the Act comes into force, that is, when assented to.\nWe come now to the final member expressed in these words :\nbut does not include transactions which are banking within the meaning of the word \"bang\" as used in subhead 15 of section 91 of The British North America Act, 1867.\nWe repeat, clause (b) consists of a single sentence containing what professes to be a definition of \" business of dealing in credit \" as employed in the statute. The words just quoted are part of that definition. If effect is given to them, they completely destroy everything which precedes them in that definition. They reduce the definition to the single proposition that the \" business of dealing in credit \" in the Act \"does not include transactions which are banking within the meaning of the word ` banking' as used in sub\u2011head 15 of section 91 of The British, North America Act, 1867.\"\nWe have come to the conclusion that we have here one of those cases in which there is a repugnancy of such a character that the last words, if any effect is to be given them, really empty the clause of all meaning ,as a definition and the statute of its intended effect and must be disregarded. (The Case of Alton Woods[23] ; Clelland v. Ker[24], and Drury 227). If we should be wrong in this view of the construction of section 2(b), in other words, if, giving full effect to the last sentence, there is still some content left in the phrase \" business of dealing in credit \" then the subject-matter of the statute would appear to be within the category Regulation of Trade and Commerce within the meaning of section 91(2). We think it plain that \" credit \" (if not strictly confined to bank credit) here means credit which is dealt in as bank credit is dealt in, not such a credit, for example, as is created by a purchase of goods on credit in the ordinary course of business, but credit which is created, issued and so forth for the purpose of being dealt with as such.\nIn our opinion, legislation regulating credit from the aspect and with the purpose disclosed by the provisions of the statute as .a whole, read in light of the preamble and of the cognate statutes and bills, (if it is not banking legislation) is legislation respecting matters which fall strictly within Trade and Commerce and not within any of the matters contemplated as subjects of provincial legislation within the meaning of section 92.\nSection 7 of the statute is, in terms, identical with section 50 of the Social Credit Act and the observations with regard to that section apply equally to section 7.\nThe answer, therefore, to the question concerning this Bill is that it is ultra vires.\nThe next Bill to be considered is that respecting the Taxation of Banks: The question to be determined in relation to this Bill is this: Is it an enactment in exercise of the provincial power to raise a revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation, or is it legislation which, in its true character, relates to Incorporation of Banks and Banking.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee in Union Colliery Co. of B.C., Ltd. v. Bryden.[25] is sufficient authority for the proposition that the answer to this question is to be found by ascertaining the effect of the legislation in the known circumstances to which it is to be applied.\nThe rate of taxation is an annual rate of one-half of one per cent on the paid-up capital and one per cent upon the amount of the reserves as well as upon the amount of the undivided profits. It is proper, we think, to test the effect of the legislation by considering the case of a bank\u2014the Bank of Montreal, for example\u2014which carries on business in every province of Canada as well as in many other places in North America and elsewhere.\nThe population of Alberta, in round numbers, is 800,000 and that of the Dominion, in round numbers, 10,000,000. The ratio of the first figure to the second is expressed by the fraction two twenty-fifths. It is not, we think, for our present purposes an inaccurate assumption that the volume of business carried on by such a bank in Alberta would bear a ratio to the total business of the bank in Canada not materially greater than the ratio of the Alberta population to the population of the Dominion. The annual tax, therefore, in the case of such a bank of one-half of one per cent upon the paid-up capital may be regarded as a charge upon two twenty-fifths of its total business; and, in respect of its reserves and undivided profits, one per cent, borne by the same part of its business. Indeed, it is pretty obvious that the fraction two twenty-fifths expresses a considerably higher ratio than a figure strictly in accord with the facts. This would appear to give a fair and reasonable point of view for obtaining a just idea of the practical effect of such taxation.\nIt is plain, of course, that if such a bank were subjected to such a levy in each of the provinces but on a scale varying with the business done in the province, or the population of the province, the total levy charged upon its business throughout the Dominion would amount to an annual impost of six and one-quarter per cent upon its paid-up capital and twelve and one-half per cent upon each of the other funds\u2014the reserves and the undivided profits.\nIn our opinion, it requires no demonstration to show that such a rate of taxation must be prohibitive in fact and must be known to the Alberta legislature to be prohibitive. It is our duty, as judges, to take judicial notice of facts which are known to intelligent persons generally; and any suggestion that the profits of banking as carried on in Canada could be such as to enable banks to pay taxes to the provinces of such magnitude, having regard to the other burdens, such as municipal rates, which are levied upon them in Canada, as well as the taxes paid in foreign countries, would be incontinently rejected by anybody possessing the most rudimentary acquaintance with affairs.\nNow, this tax upon banks is of proportions which have no parallel in the Alberta system of taxation. In the same year there was a substantial increase in the taxes levied upon corporations generally, including banks. This levy now in question which was imposed later is directed exclusively against banks.\nSuch legislation, in effect prohibitive, although in form relating to taxation is, in truth, legislation \" directed to,\" to quote the phrase of Lord Haldane in Wharton's case[26], controlling the banks in the conduct of their business, by forcing upon them !a discontinuance of business, or otherwise. Such legislation, notwithstanding its form, is not within the powers of the provinces under section 92 because its subject-matter in truth is the Incorporation of Banks and Banking, one of the enumerated heads of section 91 (no. 15). The concluding paragraph of section 91 is explicit.\nTheir Lordships made reference to the circumstance that the concluding words of s. 91 of The British North America Act, \"Any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in. this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces,\" render it necessary to do more than ascertain whether the subject-matter in question apparently falls within any of the heads of s. 92. As is now well settled the words quoted apply, not only to the merely local or private matters in the province referred to in head 16 of s. 92, but to the whole of the sixteen heads in that section: A.-G. for Ontario v. A.-G. for Canada[27].\nThis is the language of the Judicial Committee in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[28].\nThe chartered banks in Alberta exercise their powers under the authority of a Dominion statute, the Bank Act. By that statute, a system of banking is set up by the Parliament of Canada and provision is made for the incorporation of individual banks which, on compliance with the statutory conditions, are entitled to carry on business subject to the provisions of the statute. This system of banking has been created by the Parliament of Canada in exercise of its plenary and exclusive authority in relation to that subject, and any legislation by a province which, to quote again the phrase of Lord Haldane, is \"so directed by the provincial legislatures\" as either directly or indirectly to frustrate the intention of the Bank Act by preventing banks carrying on their business or controlling them in the exercise of their powers must be invalid (G. W. Saddlery v. The King[29]).\nThis view of the effect of the legislation is greatly strengthened by the obvious relation of the Bill to the scheme of legislation to which the other Bills already discussed belong. This relation between the Bill in question and the Social Credit legislation as a whole enables us in some degree to understand a measure which would otherwise be simply incomprehensible.\nThere are two other points to which we think it advisable to refer briefly. As regards the excessive magnitude of the tax, the question may be asked: Where are you to draw the line? The answer to that is, any attempt to draw an abstract line is difficult and, in dealing with questions of the kind before us, it is inadvisable to attempt it unless it be absolutely necessary. This case presents no such necessity. It is plain on the face of the Bill that the purpose of it is not to raise a revenue for provincial purposes, and equally plain that taxation of this character throughout Canada, if operative, would completely frustrate the purposes of the Bank Act.\nThe next point concerns the decision of the Judicial Committee in the Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[30]. In that case counsel on behalf of the bank strongly pressed upon their Lordships the view upon which the Supreme Court of the United States acted in a series of cases (McCulloch v. Maryland[31] ; Osborn v. United States Bank[32] ; Railroad Co. v. Peniston[33]) that since, in the words of the famous dictum of Chief Justice Marshall \"the power to tax involves the power to destroy,\" the states must be held to be deprived of the power to tax the instrumentalities of the Federal government. Their Lordships declined to apply this principle of interpretation to The British North America Act partly, it would appear, on the ground that the legislation of the provinces is subject to control by the Dominion through the power of disallowance. But the tax there in question had no sort of resemblance to that we are now considering and the question now before us did not there arise. Taxation of such a magnitude as to crush banks out of existence was put as a bare possibility and their Lordships declined to hold that such a possibility was sufficient for denying the provinces the power to exercise the right of taxation in a legitimate way.\nIn Caron v. The King[34], Lord Phillimore, speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee, quoted with approval a passage from the judgment of Davies C.J. (then Davies J.) in Abbott v. City of Saint John[35] in these words:\nThe province does not attempt to interfere directly with the exercise of the Dominion power, but merely says that, when exercised, the recipients of the salaries shall be amenable to provincial legislation in like manner as all other residents * * * It is said the legislature might authorize an income tax denuding a Dominion official of a tenth or even a fifth of his official income, and, in this way, paralyse the Dominion service and impair the efficiency of the service. But it must be borne in mind that the law does not provide for a special tax on Dominion officials but for a general undiscriminatory tax upon the incomes of residents and that Dominion officials could only be taxed upon their incomes in the same ratio and proportion as other residents. At any rate, if, under the guise of exercising power of taxation, confiscation of a substantial part of official and other salaries were attempted, it would be then time enough to consider the question and not to assume beforehand such a suggested misuse of the power.\nThe judgment proceeds:\nIn Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[36] provincial legislation, which had the effect of precluding Dominion trading companies from carrying on their business in the Province unless they complied with certain special terms, was held ultra vires, as calculated to abrogate the capacity or derogate from the status which it was in the power of the Parliament of Canada to bestow; and ,a general principle was laid down that no provincial Legislature could use its special powers as an indirect means of destroying powers given by the Parliament of Canada.\nBy parity of reason the Parliament of Canada could not exercise its power of taxation so as to destroy the capacity of officials lawfully appointed by the Province.\nThe specific ground on which, in our opinion, this legislation is invalid is: It is not competent to the provinces of Canada, by the exercise of their powers of taxation, to force banks which are carrying on business under the authority of the Bank Act to discontinue business; and taxation by one province on a scale which, in a practical business sense, is manifestly prohibitive is not a valid exercise of provincial legislative authority under section 92. Such legislation, though in the form of a taxing statute, is \" directed to \" the frustration of the system of banking established by the Bank Act, and to the controlling of banks in the conduct of their business.\nThe answer, therefore, to the question concerning this, Bill is that it is ultra vires.\nWe now turn to Bill No. 9.\nThis Bill contains two substantive provisions. Both of them impose duties upon newspapers published in Alberta which they are required to perform on the demand of \" the Chairman,\" who is, by the interpretation clause, the Chairman of \" the Board constituted by section 3 of The Alberta Social Credit Act.\"\nThe Board, upon the acts of whose Chairman the operation of this statute depends, is, in point of law, a non-existent body (there is, in a word, no \" board \" in existence \" constituted by section 3 of The Alberta Social Credit Act \") and both of the substantive sections, sections 3 and 4, are, therefore, inoperative. The same, indeed, may be said of sections 6 and 7 which are the enactments creating sanctions. It appears to us, furthermore, that this Bill is a part of the general scheme of Social Credit legislation, the basis of which is The Alberta Social Credit Act; the Bill presupposes, as a condition of its operation, that The Alberta Social Credit Act is validly enacted; and, since that Act is ultra vires, the ancillary and dependent legislation must fall with it.\nThis is sufficient for disposing of the question referred to us but, we think, there are some further observations upon the Bill which may properly be made.\nUnder the constitution established by The British North America Act, legislative power for Canada is .vested in one Parliament consisting of the Sovereign, an upper house styled the Senate, and the House of Commons. Without entering in detail upon an. examination of the enactments of the Act relating to the House of Commons, it can be said that these provisions manifestly contemplate a House of Commons which is to be, as the name itself implies, a representative body; constituted, that is to say, by members elected by such of the population of the united provinces as may be qualified to vote. The preamble of the statute, moreover, shows plainly enough that the constitution of the Dominion is to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. The statute contemplates a parliament working under the influence of public opinion and public discussion. There can be no controversy that such institutions derive their efficacy from the free public discussion of affairs, from criticism and answer and counter-criticism, from attack upon policy and administration and defence and counter-attack; from the freest and fullest analysis and examination from every point of view of political proposals. This is signally true in respect of the discharge by Ministers of the Crown of their responsibility to Parliament, by members of Parliament of their duty to the electors, and by the electors themselves of their responsibilities in the election of their representatives.\nThe right of public discussion is, of course, subject to legal restrictions; those based upon considerations of decency and public order, and others conceived for the protection of various private and public interests with which, for example, the laws of defamation and sedition are concerned. In a word, freedom .of discussion means, to quote the words of Lord Wright in James v. Commonwealth[37], \" freedom governed by law.\"\nEven within its legal limits, it is liable to abuse and grave abuse, and such abuse is constantly exemplified before our eyes; but it is axiomatic that the practice of this right .of free public discussion of public affairs, notwithstanding its incidental mischiefs, is the breath of life for parliamentary institutions.\nWe do not doubt that (in addition to the power of disallowance vested in the Governor General) the Parliament of Canada possesses authority to legislate for the protection of this right. That authority rests upon the principle that the powers requisite for the protection of the constitution itself arise by necessary implication from The British North America Act as a whole (Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. Ltd. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. Ltd.[38]) ; and since the subject-matter in relation to which the power is exercised is not exclusively a provincial matter, it is necessarily vested in Parliament.\nBut this by no means exhausts the matter. Any attempt to abrogate this right of public debate or to suppress the traditional forms of the exercise of the right (in public meeting and through the press) would, in our opinion, be incompetent to the legislatures of the provinces, or to the legislature of any one of the provinces, as repugnant to the provisions of The British North America Act, by which the Parliament of Canada is established as the legislative organ of the people of Canada under the Crown, and Dominion legislation enacted pursuant to the legislative authority given by those provisions. The subject matter of such legislation could not be described as a provincial matter purely; as in substance exclusively a matter of property and civil rights within the province, or a matter private or local within the province. It would not be, to quote the words of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[39], \"legislation directed solely to the purposes specified in section 92 \"; and it would be invalid on the principles enunciated in that judgment and adopted in Caron v. The King[40].\nThe question, discussed in argument, of the validity of the legislation before us, considered as a wholly independent enactment having no relation to the Alberta Social Credit Act, presents no little difficulty. Some degree of regulation of newspapers everybody would concede to the provinces. Indeed, there is a very wide field in which the provinces undoubtedly are invested with legislative authority over newspapers; but the limit, in our opinion, is reached when the legislation effects such a curtailment of the exercise of the right of public discussion as substantially to interfere with the working of the parliamentary institutions of Canada as contemplated by the provisions of The British North America Act and the statutes of the Dominion of Canada. Such a limitation is necessary, in our opinion, \"in order,\" to adapt the words quoted above from the judgment in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[41] \"to afford scope \" for the working of such parliamentary institutions. In this region of constitutional practice, it is not permitted to a provincial legislature to do indirectly what cannot be done directly (Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[42]).\nSection 129 of The British North America Act is in these words:\n129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act, all Laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, at the Union, ,and all Courts of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal Commissions, Powers, and Authorities, and all Officers, Judicial, Administrative, and Ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been made; subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the respective Province, according to the Authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act.\nThe law by which the right of public discussion is protected existed at the time of the enactment of The British North America Act and, as far as Alberta is concerned, at the date on which the Alberta Act came into force, the 1st of September, 1905. In our opinion (on the broad principle of the cases mentioned which has been recognized as limiting the scope of general words defining the legislative authority of the Dominion) the Legislature of Alberta has not the capacity under section 129 to alter that law by legislation .obnoxious to the principle stated.\nThe legislation now under consideration manifestly places in the hands of the Chairman of the Social Credit Commission autocratic powers which, it may well be thought, could, if arbitrarily wielded, be employed to frustrate in Alberta these rights of the Crown and the people of Canada as a whole. We do not, however, find it necessary to express an opinion upon the concrete question whether or not this particular measure is invalid as exceeding the limits indicated above.\nThe answer to the question concerning this Bill is that it is ultra vires. CANNON J.\u2014The first question referred to us by His Excellency the Governor General in Council is :\nIs Bill No. 1 entitled \"An Act Respecting the Taxation of Banks\" or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent intra vires of the legislature of the province of Alberta?\nThis bill provides that every bank which transacts business in the province of Alberta shall annually pay to His Majesty for the use of the province, in addition to any tax payable pursuant to any other Act, the following taxes, namely:\n(a) a tax of one-half of one per centum on the paid-up capital thereof;\n(b) a tax of one per centum on the reserve fund and undivided profits thereof.\nIt is claimed :\n1. That the tendency of the tax is that it shall be passed on and is in reality an attempt to impose a tax on the paid up capital and reserves and profits throughout Canada and abroad and, therefore, is not \"direct taxation within the province\" ;\n2. The proposed taxation would destroy or nullify the status and capacity of the banks which are Dominion corporations;\n3. Taxation of the character in question, if within provincial competence and adopted by all provinces would strike at the very solvency of the banks and their ability to return moneys deposited with them.\nThe extraordinary expansion given to the recognized power of the provinces to levy direct tax for local purposes since the decision of the Privy Council in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[43], notably in Abbott v. City of Saint John[44] ; Caron v. The King[45] ; Forbes v. Attorney-General of Manitoba, confirmed by Privy Council[46] ; and also in Judges v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan[47] must be be reviewed in order to decide the question.\nIn Bank of Toronto v. Lambe43, the Privy Council said at pp. 586-587:\nThen it is suggested that the legislature may lay on taxes so heavy as to crush a bank out of existence, and so to nullify the power of parliament to erect banks. But their Lordships cannot conceive that when the Imperial Parliament conferred wide powers of local self-government on great countries such as Quebec, it intended to limit them on the speculation that they would be used in an injurious manner. People who are trusted with the great power of making laws for property and civil rights may well be trusted to levy taxes. There are obvious reasons for confining their power to direct taxes and licences, because the power of indirect taxation would be felt all over the Dominion. But whatever power falls within the legitimate meaning of classes 2 and 9, is, in their Lordships' judgment, what the Imperial Parliament intended to give; and to place a limit on it because the power may be used unwisely, as all powers may, would be an error, and would lead to insuperable difficulties, in the construction of the Federation Act.\nTheir Lordships have been invited to take a very wide range on this part of the case, .and to apply to the construction of the Federation Act the principles laid down for the United States by Chief Justice Marshall. Every one would gladly accept the guidance of that great judge in a parallel ease. But he was dealing with the constitution of the United States. Under that constitution, as their Lordships understand, each state may make laws for itself, uncontrolled by the federal power, and subject only to the limits placed by law on the range of subjects within its jurisdiction. In such a constitution Chief Justice Marshall found one of those limits at the point at which the action of the state legislature came into conflict with the power vested in Congress. The appellant invokes that principle to support the conclusion that the Federation Act must be so construed as to allow no power to the provincial legislatures under section 92, which may by possibility, and if exercised in some extravagant way, interfere with the objects of the Dominion in exercising their powers under section 91. It is quite impossible to argue from the one case to the other. Their Lordships have to construe the express words of an Act of Parliament which makes an elaborate distribution of the whole field of legislative authority between two legislative bodies, and at the same time provides for the federated provinces a carefully balanced constitution, under which no one of the parts can pass laws for itself except under the control of the whole acting through the Governor-General. And the question they have to answer is whether the one body or the other has power to make a given law. If they find that on the due construction of the Act a legislative power falls within section 92, it would be quite wrong of them to deny its existence because by some possibility it may be abused, or may limit the range which otherwise would be open to the Dominion parliament.\"\nIn the Forbes case[48], I urged that the whole question should be reconsidered and I gave some reasons why provincial interference with the exclusive federal power of fixing the salaries of Dominion civil servants could not be upheld. I said, at page 75:\nCan it be denied that, under existing, conditions in Canada since the war, the reduction of the salaries of Dominion employees in proportion to the needs of the provinces or municipalities, which in some cases are very great and are increasing alarmingly, would, if added to the reductions imposed by the Dominion Parliament, amount to confiscation of a substantial part thereof and would as a necessary consequence seriously impair the efficiency, morale and economic independence of the national service? It is a patent fact to anyone conversant with Canadian conditions, and any attempt by a Province to confiscate, even in part, the stipend fixed by Parliament, whatever name may be given to the operation, under whatever disguise it may be presented, is an unauthorized assumption of a power which is essentially national in its scope and operation and is expressly denied to the Province by the last phrase of section 91. The Dominion alone can fix the salaries; and once fixed, they cannot be changed or reduced by the Province. According to elementary common sense, without the necessity of recourse to learned legal distinctions or disquisitions, a salary minus a tax of 2, 5 or 10 per cent is a reduced salary pro tanto. Such reduction in the case of Dominion servants can be effected by Parliament only in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction under head (8) of 91. Now the respondent contends that the Act contemplates and contains such an interference.\nThe majority of this Court and the Judicial Committee refused to reconsider the conclusions reached about this power of taxation in the cases of Abbott v. City of Saint John[49] and Caron v. The King[50]. I quote the following from the judgment of My Lord the present Chief Justice[51] :\nIn. Abbott v. City of Saint John49, this Court had to consider the judgment of the very able judges who decided Leprohon v. City of Ottawa[52], and it may be worth while to devote a sentence or two to Leprohon's case52\nThe trial judge was Mr. Justice Moss52 (afterwards Chief Justice of Ontario). He proceeded upon principles which had been laid down in judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States, notably in the judgment of Marshall C.J. in McCulloch v. Maryland[53], the effect of which may be summed up in these words, quoted by Moss J. (4) from the judgment of Nelson J. in Buffington v. Day, 'reported sub nom. The Collector v. Day[54].\n* * * there is no express constitutional prohibition upon the States against taxing the means or instrumentalities of the General Government; but it was held, and we agree properly held, to be prohibited by necessary implication, otherwise States might impose taxation to an extent that would impair, if not wholly defeat, the operations of the Federal authorities when acting in their appropriate sphere.'\nMr. Justice Moss himself proceeds:\u2014\nIn. this case the central authority, in the exercise of its appropriate functions, appointed the plaintiff to a position of emolument. In the exercise of its proper powers it assigned to him a certain emolument. This emolument the plaintiff is entitled to receive for the discharge of duties for which the Central Government is bound to provide. I do not find in the British North America Act that there is any express constitutional prohibition against the Local Legislatures taxing such a salary, but I think that upon the principles thus summarized in the case which I have just cited there is necessarily an implication that such power is not vested in the Local Legislature.\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal for Ontario base their conclusions upon the same grounds.\nIn Abbott v. City of Saint John[55], four of the five judges of this Court were clearly, of the view that this reasoning was not admissible for the purpose of determining the limits of the powers vested in the provinces by The British North America Act. Davies J. said (at p. 606) :\u2014\nTime and again the Judicial Committee have declined to give effect to this anticipatory argument or to assume to refuse to declare a power existed in the legislature of the province simply because its improvident exercise might bring it into conflict with an existing power of the Dominion.\nAt page 618, I observed,\n* * * Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa[56] * * * was decided in 1877. Judicial opinion upon the construction of the British North America Act has swept a rather wide arc since that date; to mention a single instance only, it would not be a light task to reconcile the views upon which Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa56 proceeded with the views expressed by the Judicial Committee in. the later ease of The Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[57]. Indeed, although Leprohon v. The City of Ottawa56 has not been expressly overruled, the grounds of it have been so thoroughly undermined by subsequent decisions of the Judicial Committee, that it can,\u2014I speak, of course, with the highest respect for the eminent judges who took part in it,\u2014no longer afford a guide to the interpretation of the British North America Act.\nAbbott v. City of Saint John55 was approved in Caron v. The King[58] and both decisions are, of course, binding upon this Court.\nIn the same case of Forbes v. Attorney-General of Manitoba[59] Lord Macmillan, speaking for the Privy Council, answering the argument that if the provincial authorities can tax at 2 percent the salary which a federal employee receives from the Dominion to enable him to live in the province and discharge his duties there, they can tax his salary to such an extent as to render it impossible for him to live and perform his duties, says that a similar argument in terrorem was advanced and rejected in the case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[60] and adopts Lord Hobhouse's dictum that self-governing provinces who are entrusted with the great power of making laws for property and civil rights may well be trusted to levy taxes. I would also refer to the case of the Saskatchewan Judges v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan[61], where the Privy Council reaffirmed, as applying to judges' salaries, the view already expounded in Attorney-General of Manitoba v. Forbes[62], above mentioned.\nPrima facie, in view of the above decision, it would, therefore, seem that the assets of the banks cannot be protected by the courts against the alleged destroying power of provincial taxation any more than salaries of Dominion civil servants or the emoluments of His Majesty's judges.\nWhere the United States Supreme Court can exercise certain powers, the decisions above quoted seem to preclude this Court from doing the same, on account of the powers reserved to the central government under our constitution. The Privy Council has set no definite limit to the legislative competence of the provinces to levy direct taxation within the province in order to the raising of revenue for provincial purposes. If such power is used unwisely or extravagantly, against the best interest of the whole of Canada, the power of disallowance by the Governor-General in Council, or, as in this case, that of reservation by the Lieutenant-Governor, acting, presumably, according to his instructions from the central government, are the only means or safety valves provided in our \" carefully balanced constitution,\" to see that \" no one of the parts can pass laws for itself except under the control of the whole acting through the Governor-General.\"\nIt must be borne in mind, however, that in the two cases last cited the Attorney-General of Canada did not appear before the Court, did not interfere in any way to show that, in the opinion of the Federal Government, the interests of the Dominion as a body politic were at stake when the emoluments fixed by Parliament for the Judiciary or the civil service were reduced by provincial taxation. In the present reference, the Dominion takes a very strong stand and contends that this bill, linked with the two others, constitutes essential encroachment upon the exclusive powers of Parliament of legislating in relation to \" banking, incorporation of banks and paper money\" and is, therefore, ultra vires. Perhaps, under these altered circumstances, the Privy Council, if this matter is brought before Their Lordships, will reopen the question and reconsider the scope to be given to the decisions above quoted. They may even distinguish this reserved bill from the Quebec Act considered in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[63].\nAs to the question whether the tax is taxation within the province, \" any person found within the province may legally be taxed there if taxed directly,\" according to Bank of Toronto v. Lambe63, and also according to the same authority, \" whether the method of assessing this tax is I sound or unsound, wise or unwise, is a point on which we have no opinion, and are not called on to form one, for, if it does not carry the taxation out of the Province, it is for the legislature and not for the courts of law to judge of its expediency.\"\nFor my part, although I always believed that the efficiency of essentially federal services, like banking, cannot be impaired by provincial legislation, I, at first, felt myself bound by these concurrent and recent decisions to say that the Alberta Legislature is competent to enact a statute in the terms of this bill. But, after perusing with great advantage the reasons of my Lord the Chief Justice, I reach the conclusion that the bill, despite its form, does not seek to raise revenue for provincial purposes but, in its true character, aims, by erecting a prohibitive barrier, to prevent the banks from conducting their legitimate business in Alberta. Such purpose and effect must be declared ultra vires of the legislature of Alberta, which cannot use its special powers as an indirect means of destroying powers given by the Parliament of Canada.\nThe answer to the first question must be in the negative.\nII.\nThe second question in the order of reference is the following:\nIs Bill No. 8, entitled An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent intra vires of the legislature of the province of Alberta? After a full study of the matter and as I was ready to write my opinion in answer to this question, I had the advantage of reading the careful analysis of the bill prepared by my brother Kerwin and his criticism of its different clauses. I find that I could add nothing useful to his reasons. I agree with him and his conclusions; and I would, therefore, answer Question 2 in the negative. This Bill, if it became law, would constitute an invasion by the province of Alberta of the Dominion's exclusive power, of regulating banks and banking.\nIII.\nThe third question put to us is the following:\nIs Bill No. 9, entitled An Act to ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particulars or to what extent intra vires of the legislature of the province of Alberta?\nThe order-in-council represents that it has been and is the avowed object of the present government of the province of Alberta to inaugurate in the said province a \" new economic order \" upon the principles or plan of the theory known as the \"Social Credit\"; and that the said government has since secured the enactment of several statutes more or less related to the policy of effectuating the said object. The preamble of the bill, which I will hereafter call the \"Press bill\" recites that it is\nexpedient and in the public interest that the newspapers published in the Province should furnish to the people of the Province statements made by the authority of the Government of the Province as to the true and exact objects of the policy of the Government and as to the hindrances to or difficulties in. achieving such objects to the end that the people may be informed with respect thereto.\nSection 3 provides that any proprietor, editor, publisher or manager of any newspaper published in the province shall, when required to do so by the Chairman of the Board constituted by section 3 of the Alberta Social Credit Act, publish in that newspaper any statement furnished by the Chairman which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the government of the province published by that newspaper within the next preceding thirty-one days. And section 4 provides that the proprietor, etc., of any newspaper upon being required by the Chairman in writing shall within twenty-four hours after the delivery of the requirement\nmake a return in waiting setting out every source from which any information emanated, as to any statement contained in any issue of the newspaper published within sixty days of the making of the requirement and the names, addresses and occupations of all persons by whom such information was furnished to the newspaper and the name and address of the writer of any editorial, article or news item contained in any such issue of the newspaper.\nSection 5 denies any action for libel on account of the publication of any statement pursuant to the Act.\nSection 6 enacts that in the event of a proprietor, etc., of any newspaper being guilty of any contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, upon a recommendation of the Chairman, may by order prohibit,\n(a) the publication of such newspaper either for a definite time or until further order;\n(b) the publication in any newspaper of anything written by any person specified in the order;\n(c) the publication of any information emanating from any person or source specified in the order.\nSection 7 provides for penalties for contraventions or defaults in complying with any requirement of the Act.\nThe policy referred to in the preamble of the Press bill regarding which the people of the province are to be informed from the government standpoint, is undoubtedly the Social Credit policy of the government. The administration of the bill is in the hands of the Chairman of the Social Credit Board who is given complete and discretionary power by the bill. \" Social Credit,\" according to sec. 2 (b) of ,ch. 3, 1937, second session, of The Alberta Social Credit Amendment Act is\nthe power resulting from the belief inherent within society that its individual members in. association can gain the objectives they desire;\nand the objectives in which the people of Alberta must have a firm and unshaken belief are the monetization of credit and the creation of a provincial medium of exchange instead of money to be used for the purposes of distributing to Albertans loans without interest, per capita dividends and discount rates to purchase goods from retailers. This free distribution would be based on the unused capacity of the industries and people of the province of Alberta to produce goods and services, which capacity remains unused on account of the lack or absence of purchasing power in the consumers in the province. The purchasing power would equal or absorb this hitherto unused capacity to produce goods and services by the issue of Treasury Credit certificates against a Credit Fund or Provincial credit account established by the Commission each year representing the monetary value of this \"unused capacity\" \u2014which is also called \" Alberta credit.\"\nIt seems obvious that this kind of credit cannot succeed unless every one should be induced to believe in it and help it along. The word \" credit \" comes from the latin: credere, to believe. It is, therefore, essential to control the sources of information of the people of Alberta, in order to keep them immune from any vacillation in their absolute faith in the plan of the government. The Social Credit doctrine must become, for the people of Alberta, a sort of religious dogma of which a free and uncontrolled discussion is not permissible. The bill aims to control any statement relating to any policy or activity of the government of the province and declares this object to be a matter of public interest. The bill does not regulate the relations of the newspapers' owners with private individual members of the public, but deals exclusively with expressions of opinion by the newspapers concerning government policies and activities. The pith and substance of the bill is to regulate the press of Alberta from the viewpoint of public policy by preventing the public from being misled or deceived as to any policy or activity of the Social Credit Government and by reducing any opposition to silence or bring upon it ridicule and public contempt.\nI agree with the submission of the Attorney-General for Canada that this bill deals with the regulation of the press of Alberta, not from the viewpoint of private wrongs or civil injuries resulting from any alleged infringement or privation of civil rights which belong to individuals, considered as individuals, but from the viewpoint of public wrongs or crimes, i.e., involving a violation of the public rights and duties to the whole community, considered as a community, in its social aggregate capacity.\nDo the provisions of this bill, as alleged by the Attorney-General for Canada, invade the domain of criminal law and trench upon the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion in this regard?\nThe object of an amendment of the criminal law, as a rule, is to deprive the citizen of the right to do that, apart from the amendment, he could lawfully do. Sections 130 to 136 of the Criminal Code deal with seditious words and seditious publications; and sect. 133 (a) reads as follows:\u2014\nNo one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith,\u2014\n(a) to show that His Majesty has been misled or mistaken in his measures; or\n(b) to point out errors, or defects in the government or constitution of the United Kingdom, or of any part of it, or of Canada or any province thereof, or in either House of Parliament of the United Kingdom or of Canada, or in any legislature, or in the administration of justice; or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure, by lawful means, the alteration of any matter of state; or\n(c) to point out, in order to their removal, matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects.\nIt appears that in England, at first, criticism of any government policy was regarded as a crime involving severe penalties and punishable as such; but since the passing of Fox's Libel Act in 1792, the considerations now found in the above article of our criminal code that it is not criminal to point out errors in the Government of the country and to urge their removal by lawful means have been admitted as a valid defence in a trial for libel.\nNow, it seems to me that the Alberta legislature by this retrograde Bill is attempting to revive the old theory of the crime of seditious libel by enacting penalties, confiscation of space in newspapers and prohibitions for actions which, after due consideration by the Dominion Parliament, have been declared innocuous and which, therefore, every citizen of Canada can do lawfully and without hindrance or fear of punishment. It is an attempt by the legislature to amend the Criminal Code in this respect and to deny the advantage of sect. 133 (a) to the Alberta newspaper publishers.\nUnder the British system, which is ours, no political party can erect a prohibitory barrier to prevent the electors from getting information concerning the policy of the government. Freedom of discussion is essential to enlighten public opinion in a democratic State; it cannot be curtailed without affecting the right of the people to be informed through sources independent of the government concerning matters of public interest. There must be an untrammelled publication of the news and political opinions of the political parties contending for ascendancy. As stated in the preamble of The British North America Act, our constitution is and will remain, unless radically changed, \" similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\" At the time of Confederation, the United Kingdom was a democracy. Democracy cannot be maintained without its foundation: free public opinion and free discussion throughout the nation of all matters affecting the State within the limits set by the criminal code and the common law. Every inhabitant in Alberta is also a citizen of the Dominion. The province may deal with his property and civil rights of a local and private nature within the province; but the province cannot interfere with his status as a Canadian citizen and his fundamental right to express freely his untrammelled opinion about government policies and discuss matters of public concern. The mandatory and prohibitory provisions of the Press Bill are, in my opinion, ultra vires of the provincial legislature. They interfere with the free working of the political organization of the Dominion. They have a tendency to nullify the political rights of the inhabitants of Alberta, as citizens of Canada, and cannot be considered as dealing with matters purely private and local in that province. The federal parliament is the sole authority to curtail, if deemed expedient and in the public interest, the freedom of the press in discussing public affairs and the equal rights in that respect of all citizens throughout the Dominion. These subjects were matters of criminal law before Confederation, have been recognized by Parliament as criminal matters and have been expressly dealt with by the criminal code. No province has the power to reduce in that province the political rights of its citizens as compared with those enjoyed by the citizens of other provinces of Canada. Moreover, citizens outside the province of Alberta have a vital interest in having full information and comment, favourable and unfavourable, regarding the policy of the Alberta government and concerning events in that province which would, in the ordinary course, be the subject of Alberta newspapers' news items and articles. I would, therefore, answer the question as to Bill No. 9 in the negative.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ., re Bank taxation Act, was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014In an opinion released simultaneously with this, I have expressed my views with reference to Bill no. 8 of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta being An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act. The first question of the three referred to in that opinion relates to what is known as Bill no. 1, An Act respecting the Taxation of Banks, and it is to that Bill that I now direct my attention.\nBy section 2 (a) thereof:\u2014\n(a) \"Bank\" means a corporation .or joint stock company other than the Bank of Canada wherever incorporated and which is incorporated for the purpose of doing banking business or the business of a savings bank and which transacts such business in the province whether the head office is situate in. the province and elsewhere.\nBy section 3, every bank which transacts business in the province is required to pay annually to the Minister (the Provincial Secretary) on behalf of His Majesty for the use of the province, in addition to any tax payable pursuant to any other Act, a tax of one-half of one per centum on the paid-up capital thereof, and a tax of one per centum on the reserve fund and undivided profits thereof. The Bill provides for returns to be made by every bank according to forms to be prescribed by the Minister, and contains additional sections to ensure the filing of such returns and the payment of the taxes.\nOur attention has been called to the increase in the taxation of banks that would be effected by the provisions of this Bill. As provincial legislation stood prior to the First Session of the Alberta Legislature in 1937, the tax on all banks doing business in the province amounted to $72,200 per annum. By chapter 57 of that session a tax was imposed which would increase the sum realized by $140,000 per annum. The additional tax proposed by Bill 1 amounts to $2,081,925 in each year.\nIt is argued that the magnitude of the tax proposed for this one province is such that if it were applied by each of the other provinces, it would have the effect of preventing banks from exercising their functions. That, of course, is not the situation confronting us. This Bill has been passed by the Legislative Assembly of one province only and, considering the enactment by itself, the amount of the impost is to be determined by the competent taxing authority. It is not for a court to say that a certain tax is exorbitant because, in addition to any expression of opinion being the particular or, it may be, the peculiar view of an individual judge, or even of a number of judges, that is not the function of the judiciary.\nHowever, omitting any reference to other arguments which have been adduced against the power of the Alberta Legislature to enact into law such a Bill, I believe that the time has now arrived when the question left open by this Court in Abbott v. City of Saint John54, must be considered. In that case, which concerned the validity of a tax by provincial legislation on a Dominion official, Davies J., dealing with the contention that provincial taxation might paralyze the Dominion Civil Service, stated:\u2014\nIf, under the guise of exercising power, of taxation, confiscation of a substantial part of official and other salaries were attempted, it would be then time enough to consider the question and not to assume before-hand such a suggested misuse of the power.\nThe decision in the Abbott case[64] was approved by the Judicial Committee in Caron v. The King[65] and in Forbes v. Attorney-General for Manitoba[66]. As pointed out at page 270 in the latter, an argument in terrorem similar to that raised in the Abbott case54 had been advanced and rejected in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[67]. While Davies J. left the question open, Lord Hobhouse, speaking for the Board in the Lambe case57, contented himself with stating that\ntheir Lordships cannot conceive that when the Imperial Parliament conferred wide powers of local self-government on great countries such as Quebec, it intended to limit them on the speculation that they would be used in an injurious manner.\nIn none of the three cases decided by the Judicial Committee, nor in the Abbott case54 was it suggested that the Acts in question were not true taxing enactments but it is contended at Bar that the same cannot be said of the Bill under review and it therefore becomes necessary to investigate that submission. In that connection we have been referred to certain other enactments passed by the Alberta Assembly. The first of these is The Alberta Social Credit Act, chapter 10 of the First 1937 Session, an Act which is still in force. It is unnecessary to detail the provisions of that Act as that has been done in the opinion delivered by My Lord the Chief Justice on the validity of Bills 1, 8 and 9. An examination of these provisions leaves no doubt in my mind that the Act is an attempt to regulate and control banks and banking as those terms are used in head 15 of section 91 of The British North America Act.\nIn the Second 1937 Session was passed The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act. The recitals in that Act are as follows:\u2014\nWhereas Bank Deposits and Bank Loans in Alberta .are made possible mainly or wholly as a result of the monetization of the credit of the People of Alberta, which credit is the basis of the credit of the province of Alberta; and\nWhereas the extent to which property and civil Tights in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the principles governing the monetization of credit and the means whereby such credit is made available to the province and to the People collectively and individually of the province; and\nWhereas it is expedient that the business of banking in Alberta shall be controlled with the object of attaining for the People of Alberta the full enjoyment of property and civil rights in the province:\nThe Act then requires, by appropriate provisions, every banker carrying on the business of banking within the province at the time of the coming into force of the Act to take out a licence, and also every employee of a bank. Except that this Act refers to banks and the business of banking, by name, and includes employees of banks, the sections are practically the same as those of Bill 8. The first and third recitals are omitted but the second is identical in each enactment. For the reasons given by me when considering Bill 8, all of which apply with even greater force to this Act, I consider the legislation would be ultra vires of the province.\nChapter 2, An Act to provide for the Restriction of the Civil Rights of Certain Persons, also passed in the Second 1937 Session, recites:\u2014\nWhereas Bank Deposits and Bank Loans in Alberta are made possible mainly or wholly as a result of the monetization of the credit of the People of Alberta, which credit is the basis of the credit of the province of Alberta; and Whereas the extent to which property and civil rights in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the principles governing the monetization of credit and the means whereby such credit is made available to the province and to the People, collectively and individually, of the province; and\nWhereas it is expedient that the business of Banking in the province shall be controlled with the object of attaining for the People of Alberta the full enjoyment of property and civil rights in the province;\nSection 3 provides:\u2014\nAny person who is an employee of a banker and who is required to be licensed pursuant to any provision of \"The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act\" shall not while unlicensed for any reason whatsoever, be capable of bringing, maintaining or defending any action in any Court of Civil Jurisdiction in .the province which has for its, object the enforcement of any claim either in. law or equity,\nThis Act would fall with the one requiring a licence to be obtained.\nOn August 17, 1937, the Governor General in Council ordered that these two Acts together with one amending the Judicature Act be disallowed, and such disallowance was duly signified by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta dated August 27, 1937, and published in the Canada Gazette on September 11, 1937. The Third 1937 Session was opened on September 24, 1937, and it was at this session that Bills nos. 1 and 8 were passed and on October 5, 1937, reserved by the Lieutenant Governor for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor General.\nIt would appear to be relevant at this stage to refer to The Reciprocal Insurers case[68] and In Re The Insurance Act of Canada[69]. The extract from the judgment in the former case, which was quoted with approval in the latter and there paraphrased, might, I think not inappropriately, be quoted and re-paraphrased for the purposes of the present inquiry. But what is even more important in my \u2014view is the statement in the former case, at page 332 of the report, that two Dominion statutes passed on the same day, one intituled The Insurance Act, 1917, and the other An Act to Amend the Criminal Code were complementary parts of a single legislative plan and were \" admittedly an attempt to produce by a different legislative procedure the results aimed at by the authors of the Insurance Act of 1910 which in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Alberta[70] was pronounced ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament.\" In the present reference it is not admitted, by counsel for the Attorney-General of Alberta that Bill I is part of a single legislative plan but I can draw no other conclusion. It is true that none of the other legislation referred to has been previously declared beyond the competence of the provincial legislature, but I have already indicated that, in my opinion, The Alberta Social Credit Act, The Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, and An Act to provide for the Restriction of the Civil Rights of Certain Persons are of that character.\nThe sequence of events after the disallowance of the three Acts is so significant that I can find no escape from the conclusion that, instead of being a taxing enactment, Bill I is merely a part of a legislative plan to prevent the operation within the province of those banking institutions which have been called into existence and given the necessary powers to conduct their business by the only proper authority, the Parliament of Canada.\nIf this view be correct, then it follows that the Bill is not one covered by the decision of this Court in the Abbott case[71] nor by the decisions of the Judicial Committee in the three cases mentioned, but is governed by the Reciprocal Insurers case[72] and In Re The Insurance Act of Canada[73].\nFor these reasons I would answer question 1 in the negative.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ., re Credit Regulation, was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014On October 5, 1937, three Bills were passed by the Legislative Assembly of the province of Alberta but were reserved by the Lieutenant-Governor for the signification of the Governor General's pleasure. Pending consideration of the advice to be tendered to the Governor General as to the propriety of signifying or withholding signification of the Royal Assent to these Bills, the Governor General in Council referred to this Court three questions as to whether these Bills, or any of the provisions thereof, and in what particular or particulars, or to what extent, were intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Alberta. The Bills are numbered and intituled as follows : \u2014\nBill no. 1, \" An Act Respecting the Taxation of Banks.\"\nBill no. 8, \"An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act.\"\nBill no. 9, \" An Act to Ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information.\"\nI propose to consider question no. 2, referring to Bill no. 8.\nCounsel for the Attorney-General of Canada submit that it would be ultra vires of the provincial legislature to enact this legislation because the subject matter falls under one or more heads of section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867.\nIn the factum of the Attorney-General of Canada appears a great mass of material, some of which was referred to on the argument. The admissibility and relevancy of a great part of it was objected to, but the Court heard what counsel desired to say upon the subject without determining the issues raised. None of it was relied upon by counsel for the provincial Attorney-General. Some of this material is of such a character that it is clearly relevant and admissible while other parts are just as clearly irrelevant and inadmissible. However, it is unnecessary to determine the exact line that separates the one class from the other since, after a detailed examination of the provisions of the Bill itself, I have arrived at the conclusion that the Bill in toto is ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nThe Bill contains the following recital:\u2014\nWhereas the extant to which property and civil rights in the province may be enjoyed depends upon the principles governing the monetization of credit and the means whereby such credit is made available to the province and to the People collectively and individually of the province.\nSection 2 is the definition section and is as follows:\u2014\n2. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,\u2014\n(a) \" Credit Institution \" means a person or corporation whose business or any part of whose business is the business of dealing in credit;\n(b) \"Business of dealing in credit\" means all business transactions in the Province of a credit institution or any other person except The Bank of Canada, whereby credit is created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in by means of bookkeeping entries, in any ease and at any time when the aggregate amount of all credit so created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in is in excess of the total amount of legal tender in the possession of the credit institution so creating, issuing, lending, providing or dealing in such credit: and includes the following transactions relating to any credit so created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in, namely, the \"payment of cheques or other negotiable instruments made, drawn or paid in by customers, the making of advances and the granting of overdrafts; but does not include transactions which are banking within the meaning of the word 'banking' as used in subhead 15 of section 91 of The British North America Act, 1867 \";\n(c) \"Local Directorate\" means a local Directorate constituted pursuant to section 4 of this Act;\n(d) \"Provincial Credit Commission\" means the Commission constituted pursuant to section 4 of The Alberta Social Credit Act;\n(e) \"Social Credit Board\" means the Board constituted pursuant to section 3 of The Alberta Social Credit Act.\nBy subsection 1 of section 3 \" every credit institution which at the time of the coming into force of this Act is carrying on the business of dealing in credit within the province \" shall within twenty-one days thereafter apply for and obtain a licence from the Commission in respect of such business, and every application is to be accompanied by the necessary fee. By subsection 3 of section 3 every such application is also to be accompanied by an undertaking whereby the applicant undertakes to refrain from acting or assisting or encouraging any person or persons to act in a manner which restricts or interferes with the property and civil rights of any person or persons within the province. By subsection 4 of section 3 the Commission is given power at any time or from time to time and without notice, to suspend, revoke or cancel the licence of any credit institution which commits a breach of the undertaking.\nUnder section 5, any credit institution which carries on the business of dealing in credit in the province without having first obtained a licence, or who violates any other provisions of the Act or the regulations made thereunder, is to incur a penalty of ten thousand dollars for each day during which it carries on business without a licence, \"and every such penalty may be recovered by action brought on behalf of the Crown by the Provincial Treasurer in any court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due to the Crown.\" I refer to section 5 at this stage because by subsection 5 of section 3 any credit institution whose licence has been suspended, revoked or cancelled by the Commission is given a right to appeal to the Board but, as I read the concluding part of this subsection, no such right of appeal extends to any credit institution against which a judgment has been entered pursuant to section 5, on the ground or for the reason that the institution had acted, or assisted, or encouraged any person to act in a manner which restricts or interferes with the property or civil rights of any person within the province. That is, under section 5, the penalty referred to may be incurred by reason of several things but, if it happens that judgment is given for such penalty by reason of the specific matters referred to in the latter part of subsection 5 of section 3, the right which an institution would otherwise have to appeal to the Board from the suspension, revocation or cancellation of its licence by the Commission no longer exists.\nReverting to section 3, provision is made by subsections 6 and 7 thereof for an annual licence fee in such amount as may be fixed by the Commissioner, not exceeding an amount equivalent to one hundred dollars in respect of every building within the province in which the business of such credit institution is conducted; but, if the licence has been suspended, revoked or cancelled, the Commission may, for renewing the licence or issuing a new one, fix a fee in excess of that mentioned, provided that such increased fee is not to exceed one thousand times the fee paid or required to be paid in respect of the licence last issued to such institution.\nBy section 4 \"for the purpose of preventing any act by such credit institution constituting a restriction or interference, either direct or indirect, with the full enjoyment of property and civil rights by any person within the Province\", one or more Local Directorates (the number of which is to be in the absolute discretion of the Board) shall be appointed to supervise, direct and control the policy of the business of dealing in credit of such institution in respect of which such Local Directorate has been appointed. Each Local Directorate is to consist of five persons, three of whom are to be appointed by the Board and two by the credit institution, and provision is made for the dismissal of any of the Board's appointees.\nIt will be observed that under clause A of the definition section the entire business of a \"credit institution\" need not be that of dealing in credit but it is sufficient if part only falls within that category. By clause (b) of section 2, an institution is dealing in credit, either wholly or in part, only when \"the aggregate amount of all credit * * * is in excess of the total amount of legal tender in the possession of the credit institution.\" This is important because it is only in such an event that the \" business of dealing in credit \" means business transactions in the province \"whereby credit is created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in by means of bookkeeping entries,\" and the business transactions which the Bill purports to cover are only those whereby credit is created, etc., by means of bookkeeping entries.\nIn my opinion these transactions fall within the meaning of the term \" banking \" as used in head 15 of section 91 of The British North America Act. As pointed out by Lord Watson, speaking for the Judicial Committee, in Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[74], the words used in head 15 of section 91, \" Banking, Incorporation of Banks, and the Issue of Paper Money,\" are \"wide enough to embrace every transaction coming within the legitimate business of a banker.\" The nature of such business \"is a part of the law merchant and is to be judicially noticed by the Court,\" per Lord Campbell, during the course of the argument in The Bank of Australasia v. Breillat[75], referring to Brandao v. Barnett[76].\nAccordingly, upon referring to the New English (Oxford) Dictionary we find that the word \" credit,\" which is used in the Bill, is defined as \" a sum placed at a person's disposal in the books of a bank, etc., upon which he may draw to the extent of the amount; any note, bill or other document, on security of which a person may obtain funds\"; and at page 48 of the third volume of the 14th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, under the title \" Banking and Credit\" appears the following paragraph:\u2014\nBanks create credit. It is a mistake to suppose that bank credit is created to any important extent by the payment of money into the banks. Money is always being paid in by tradesmen and others who receive it in the course of business, and drawn out again by employers to pay wages and by depositors in general for use as pocket money. But the change of money into credit money and of credit money back into money does not alter the total amount of the means of payment in the hands of the community. When a bank lends, by granting an advance or discounting a bill, the effect is different. Two debts are created; the trader who borrows becomes indebted to the bank at a future date, and the bank becomes immediately indebted to the trader. The bank's debt is a means of payment; it is credit money. It is a clear addition to the amount of the means of payment in the community. The bank does not lend money. The borrower can, if he pleases, take out the whole amount of the loan in money. He is in that respect in the same position, any other depositor. But like other depositors he is likely in practice to use credit for all major payments and only to draw out money as and when needed for minor payments.\nIt is not necessary to refer to the various schools of economists with their divergent views as to the extent to which banks create credit or as to the wisdom or otherwise of a state empowering such institutions to do so. It suffices that by current common understanding a business transaction whereby credit is created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in by means of bookkeeping entries is considered to be part of the business of banking as it has been practised and developed. It is well known that in addition to creating credit banks also issue, lend, provide and deal in credit by means of bookkeeping entries.\nThat banks are contemplated by Bill 8 as being the credit institutions to be licensed seems evident from the direction in section 3, subsection 1, that an application for a licence is to be made by \"every credit institution which at the time of the coming into force of this Act is carrying on the business of dealing in credit within the province\"; thus envisaging only institutions of that character which are already carrying on business; and banks are the only ones answering that description under the restrictions embodied in that part of clause (b) of section 2 quoted in an earlier part of these reasons and italicized. A construction might be placed upon other provisions of the Bill that would embrace such other institutions that desired to commence the defined business, but such a construction would be strained and the other is more consonant with the evident intention of the Bill as disclosed by its terms.\nIn addition to the terms already commented on, banks are plainly indicated by the following extract from clause (b) of section 2, which follows the statement of what \" business of dealing in credit \" means:\u2014\" and includes the following transactions relating to any credit so created, issued, lent, provided or dealt in, namely, the payment of cheques or other negotiable instruments, made, drawn or paid in by customers, the making of advances and the granting of overdrafts.\" The transactions specifically mentioned form part of an ordinary banking business; and the exception of the Bank of Canada from \"a credit institution or any other person,\" in clause (b) of section 2, strengthens the conclusion that banks are the institutions covered by the provisions of the Bill.\nThe reference in the Bill to \" property and civil rights within the province \" does not touch the point as almost any Act of Parliament relating to the matters assigned to its jurisdiction would affect property and civil rights, and it would still be valid. According to several decisions of the Judicial Committee, even if in some aspects the matters dealt with by this Bill could be said to fall within head 13 of section 92 (as to which I express no opinion), the final words of section 91 exclude provincial authority as the pith and substance of the Bill bring it within one of the enumerated subjects assigned to Parliament \"notwithstanding anything in this Act.\"\nThe control to be exercised over credit institutions is far reaching. In addition to the undertaking required by every applicant for a licence and the provisions providing for a fee and an increased fee, and in addition to the powers conferred to suspend, revoke or cancel a licence, Local Directorates are to be appointed, a majority of whose members shall be nominees of the Board. Then, by section 8, the Commission, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, may make regulations: \u2014\n(e) prescribing the privileges, terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions to be granted to or observed by any licensee;\n(f) prescribing the conditions upon which licences may be issued and providing for the revocation, suspension or withholding of licences;\nThe regulations, however, are not restricted to the matters dealt with by the Bill. While undoubtedly they could not go beyond the powers possessed by the Legislature itself, it is sufficient, according to the opening phrase of section 8, that the regulations be \" not inconsistent with this Act.\" All these provisions are significant as indicating that the Bill is not a taxing enactment but an attempt to regulate and control every bank and the business of banking. There remains for consideration the effect of the concluding phrase in clause (b) of section 2,\u2014\nbut does not include transactions which are banking within the meaning of the word. \"banking\" as used in. subhead 15 of section 91 of The British North America Act, 1867.\nand of section 7:\u2014\nNo provisions of this Act shall be so construed as to authorize the doing of any act or thing which is not within the legislative competence of the legislature of the province.\nAs to the former, it is contended by counsel for Alberta that, if, omitting the concluding phrase, only banks would be covered, the entire clause is not unintelligible but there might remain in fact no institutions to which the clause could apply; that it would, therefore, be nugatory and it could not be declared to be beyond the competence of the provincial legislature to enact the Bill as a law. But it is a sound principle in the construction of enactments that the Court will not presume an intention to enact a meaningless statute or section and here the correct interpretation appears to be that banks were intended to be and are covered by the definition, and that the last part of section 2, clause (b) was added in an effort to save legislation which on the proper construction of the other provisions of the Bill is unconstitutional. The same remarks apply to section 7.\nIn The King v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd.[77], Lord Sumner, speaking for the Judicial Committee and discussing the effect of the repeal of a provision in the Alberta Liquor Act of 1916, which proposed to exclude from the operation of the Act \"bona fide transactions in liquor between a person in the province of Alberta and a person in another province or in a foreign country,\" said at page 136:\u2014\nIn their Lordships' opinion the real question is whether the legislature has actually interfered with inter-provincial or with foreign trade. The presence or absence of an express disclaimer of any such interference may greatly assist where the language of the provincial legislature does not in itself determine the question and define its effect. If, however, it is otherwise clear that there is such an interference, or that there is none, and the language actually used sufficiently decides that question, there is no such sovereign efficacy in such a clause as s. 72 as to make its presence or absence in an enactment crucial.\nThis statement would appear at first sight to be in conflict with the statement by Lord MacNaghten in Attorney General of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders' Association[78], where, in dealing with the question as to the constitutionality of the Manitoba Liquor Act of 1900, His Lordship observes:\u2014\nThe Liquor Act proceeds upon a recital that \"it is expedient to suppress the liquor traffic in Manitoba by prohibiting provincial transactions in liquor.\" That is the declared object of the legislature set out at the commencement of the Act. Towards the end of the Act there occurs this section:\n\"119. While this Act is intended to prohibit and shall prohibit transactions in liquor which take place wholly within the province of Manitoba, except under a licence or as otherwise specially provided by this Act, and restrict the consumption of liquor within the limits of the province of Manitoba, it shall not affect and is not intended to affect bona fide transactions in liquor between a person in the province of Manitoba and a person in another province or in a foreign country, and the provisions of this Act shall be construed accordingly.\" Now that provision is as much part of the Act as any other section contained in it. It must have its full effect in exempting from the operation of the Act all bona fide transactions in liquor which come within its terms,\nThe principle to which Lord Sumner referred was expressed somewhat differently by Viscount Haldane in Attorney General for Manitoba v. Attorney General for Canada[79]. That case had to do with the constitutionality of an Act of the Manitoba Legislature providing for the collection of a tax from persons selling grain for future delivery. At page 566 of the report Viscount Haldane refers to the principle by which the courts determine whether a tax is direct or indirect, and explains:\u2014\nIt does not exclude the operation of the principle if, as here, by s. 5, the taxing Act merely expressly declares that the tax is to be a direct one on the person entering into the contract of sale, whether as principal or as broker or agent. For the question of the nature of the tax is one of substance, and does not turn only on the language used by the local Legislature which imposes it, but on the provisions of the Imperial statute of 1867.\nIn Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada[80], the Judicial Committee determined that the Dominion Natural Products Marketing Act, 1934, was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. At page 387, Lord Atkin, speaking for the Board, deals with the argument advanced that certain portions of the Act at least should be declared valid. It was urged that section 9 of the Act there under consideration was a valid exercise of the powers of the Dominion Parliament because it purported to deal only with inter-provincial or export trade; and Part 2 of the Act because it went no further than similar provisions in the Combines Investigation Act and was a genuine exercise of the Dominion legislative authority over criminal law; and stress was laid upon section 26 of the Act:\u2014\nIf it be found that Parliament has exceeded its powers in the enactment of one or more of the provisions of this Act, none of the other or remaining provisions of the Act shall therefore be held to be inoperative or ultra vires, but the latter provisions shall stand as if they had been originally enacted as separate and independent enactments and as the only provisions of the Act; the intention of Parliament being to give independent effect to the extent of its powers to every enactment and provision in this Act contained.\nAt the foot of page 388 of the report his Lordship deals with this argument stating:\u2014\nThere appear to be two answers. In the first place, it appears to their Lordships that the whole texture of the Act is inextricably interwoven, and that neither s. 9 nor Part II can be contemplated as existing independently of the provisions as to the creation of a Board and the regulation of products. There are no separate and independent enactments to which s. 26 could give a real existence. In the second place, both the Dominion and British Columbia in their Cases filed on this appeal assert that the sections now said to be severable are incidental and ancillary to the main legislation. Their Lordships are of opinion that this is true : and that as the main legislation is invalid as being in pith and substance an. 'encroachment upon the Provincial rights the sections referred to must fall with it as being in part merely ancillary to it.\nAs applicable to the present case, the principle might be stated thus:\u2014Unless certain provisions of the Bill are severable, such expressions as are found in the last part of clause (b) of section 2 and in section 7 have no effect, if upon a consideration of the entire legislation the conclusion is reached that the subject matter dealt with is beyond the powers of the enacting authority. For the reasons given above, that is the conclusion I have arrived at and I would therefore answer question 2 in the negative.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ. re Press Act was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The third question submitted to the Court by the Governor General in Council asks our opinion as to whether Bill No. 9 of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, An Act to Ensure the Publication of Accurate News and Information, (hereafter referred to as the Press Bill) is intra vires of the legislature of that province. It has already been noted that this Bill was passed at the same time as Bills 1 and 8. After reciting that \"it is expedient and in 'the public interest that the newspapers published in the Province should furnish to the people of the Province statements made by the authority of the Government of the Province as to the true and exact objects of the policy of the Government and as to the hindrances to or difficulties in achieving such objects, to the end that the people may be informed with respect thereto,\" section 2(a) defines the word \"Chairman\" as used in the Bill as \"the Chairman of the Board constituted by section 3 of The Alberta Social Credit Act.\" By section 3 of the Press Bill \"every person who is the proprietor, editor, publisher or manager of any newspaper published in the Province, shall, when required so to do by the Chairman, publish in that newspaper any statement furnished by the Chairman which has for its object the .correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity .of the Government of the Province published by that newspaper within the next preceding thirty-one days.\" The additional provisions of section 3 do not require our attention nor do the provisions of section 5, which prohibit any action for libel by reason of the publication of such statement.\nSection 4 enacts that, within twenty-four hours after the delivery of a written requisition by the Chairman, every person who is the proprietor, etc., of any such newspaper shall give every source from which any information emanated, as to any statement contained in any issue of the newspaper published within sixty days of the making of the requirement. Six and seven are the penalizing sections, and whatever their effect (as to which counsel disagree) must stand or fall with the substantive sections 3 and 4.\nThe obligations imposed by these sections become operative only upon the requisition of the Chairman of a Board, which was to be constituted under the terms of another Bill which I have already indicated is, in my opinion, ultra vires. The peculiar situation therefore exists that, in answering the question as to one piece of legislation, it became necessary to consider the provisions of another, which was not specifically referred to the Court, and the conclusion was reached that the latter was ultra vires of the provincial legislature; and it is by a section of that Bill that the Board, by virtue of the actions of whose Chairman sections 3 and 4 of the Press Bill can have any operation, was established. However, the result appears to be that the Press Bill is part of the same legislative plan that, in my opinion, is outside the powers conferred upon the provinces, and that the part must suffer the fate of the whole.\nOther objections against the validity of the Press Bill were urged but I refrain from expressing any opinion upon them. They raise important constitutional questions, the consideration, which I prefer to postpone until the need to do so arises.\nFor the above reasons I would answer question 3 in the negative.\nHUDSON, J.\u2014I concur in the answers proposed by the other members of the Court on the various questions submitted in this reference.\nIt is clear that the three bills submitted are part of one legislative scheme, the central measure of which is The Alberta Social Credit Act. That Act has been the subject of a searching analysis by my Lord the Chief Justice and I concur in his reasons for holding that it is beyond the powers of the legislature.\nSection ninety-one of the British North America Act allots exclusive legislative authority to the Dominion in all matters coming within the following classes of subjects:\n91 (2) The regulation of trade and commerce;\n(14) Currency and coinage;\n(15) Banking, incorporation of banks and the issue of paper money;\n(16) Savings banks;\n(18) Bills of exchange and promissory notes;\n(19) Interest;\n(20) Legal tender.\nRead together these have a cumulative effect, I think, much greater than if individual headings were taken separately. This is especially so when the object of the measure under consideration is the establishment by a province of a new economic order such as The Social Credit Act. So read they strongly reinforce the reasons already given against the validity of this Act. It is interesting to observe that the Bank of Canada Act, 1934 (Dominion), establishes a central bank \"to regulate credit and currency in the best interests of the economic life of the nation, to control and protect the external value of the national monetary unit and to mitigate by its influence fluctuations in the general level of production, trade, prices and employment so far as may be possible within the scope of monetary action, and generally to promote the economic and financial welfare of the Dominion.\" No one doubts the constitutionality of this Act; in fact the bill entitled An Act to amend and consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act expressly exempts from its operations the Bank of Canada.\nIn essence the Alberta legislative scheme is one to set up a new form of credit and currency within a single province.\nI also concur in the reasons given by my Lord the Chief Justice for holding as beyond the legislative competence of the legislature the bills entitled respectively \"An Act respecting the taxation of banks \", and \" An Act to amend and consolidate the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act.\"\nI concur in the views of the other members of the Court that the bill entitled \"An Act to ensure the publication of accurate news and information\" is ultra vires, because it is ancillary to and dependent upon the Alberta Social Credit Act, but refrain from expressing any views as to the boundaries of legislative authority as between the provinces and the Dominion in relation to the press. It is a problem with many facets with which I hesitate to deal until presented to us in a more concrete form.\n[ScanLII Collection]\n[1] [1898] A.C. 700, at 715.\n[2] [1896] A.C. 348, art 359.\n[3] [1921] 2 A.C. 91, at 99.\n[4] (1887) 12 App. Cas, 575, at 587,\n[5] [1912] A.C. 333.\n[6] [1916] 1 A.C. 588.\n[7] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[8] [1925] A.C. 396.\n[9] [1937] A.C. 327.\n[10] [1937] AC. 377, at 387.\n[11] [1937] A.C. 327.\n[12] (1887) 12 App. Cas. 575.\n[13] [1912] A.C. 333.\n[14] [1922] 1 A.C. 191,\n[15] [1925] A.C. 396.\n[16] [1925] A.C. 396, at 410.\n[17] [1927] A.C. 327.\n[18] [1925] A.C. 396.\n[19] [1922] 1 A.C. 191.\n[20] [1896] A.C. 348, at 359.\n[21] [1922] 2 A.C. 128, at 136.\n[22] [1902] A.C. 73.\n[23] (1600) 1 Co.

Defendants maintained and operated for profit in the hospital an equipment for diathermic treatments. Plaintiff\u2019s physician (who had diagnosed his trouble as sciatica) ordered the nurse supervising the floor on which plaintiff was located, to see that he was given a diathermic treatment to relieve his pain; and a treatment was given. It was administered by a nurse who was a permanent member of the hospital staff and was in charge of such treatments. Plaintiff\u2019s physician had not (nor had any other physician) anything to do with the actual treatment. There was no suggestion of defect in the equipment or of lack of competence in the nurse to use it. In the treatment the plaintiff was severely burned. Plaintiff, alleging that the burn was caused by negligence of the nurse administering the treatment, sued defendants for damages. The trial judge gave judgment for plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1937] O.R. 512). Defendants appealed.\nHeld: (1) On the evidence, the finding in the courts below of negligence in the nurse must stand. (Comment, per Duff C.J., Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ., as to the proper application of the rule res ipsa loquitur. The rule is a special case within the broader doctrine that courts act and are entitled to act upon the weight of the balance of probabilities).\n(2) Defendants were liable in law for damages for the nurse\u2019s negligence.\nPer Duff C.J., Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: Upon the facts and circumstances of this case, the nurse was, at the time she committed the negligent act, acting as the agent or servant of the hospital within the ordinary scope of her employment. There was nothing in the evidence to take her, as between the hospital and herself, out of this relationship during the time she was administering the particular treatment to plaintiff.\nReview and discussion of cases, and of the rule stated by Kennedy L.J. in Hillyer\u2019s case, [1909] 2 K.B. 820, at 829. However useful that rule may be in some circumstances as an element to be considered, it is a safer practice, in order to determine the character of a nurse\u2019s employment at the time of a negligent act, to focus attention upon the question whether in point of fact the nurse, during the period of time in which she was engaged on the particular work in which the negligent act occurred, was acting as an agent or servant of the hospital within the ordinary scope of her employment or was at that time outside the direction and control of the hospital and had in fact for the time being passed under the direction and control of a surgeon or physician, or even of the patient himself. It is better to approach the solution of the problem in each case by applying primarily the test of the relation of master and servant or of principal and agent to that particular work. There may be cases where the particular work upon which a nurse may for the time being be engaged is of such a highly professional and skilful nature and calling for such special training and knowledge in the treatment of disease that other considerations would arise; but the present case is not such a case.\nPer Crocket J.: There was ample evidence to warrant the finding at trial that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by the negligence of the nurse in administering the treatment while acting in the course of her employment as defendants\u2019 servant.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Hope J. at trial, holding that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff in damages (in the sum of $3,056.60) for injuries alleged by the plaintiff to have been caused to him by negligence of a nurse in her administration of a diathermic treatment to him while he was a patient in the defendants\u2019 hospital.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Davis J. in this Court, now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nA.M. LeBel K.C. and E.A. Anglin for the appellants.\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. and R.W. Gray K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of Duff C.J. and Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The appellants are an incorporated society which owns and operates St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in the City of London, in the Province of Ontario. The respondent was admitted as a patient to the said hospital on the 22nd day of June, 1933, under a \u201ccontract\u201d with the appellants \u201cfor board, nursing and attendance,\u201d to use the words of the appellants in their statement of defence to the action. The respondent alleged in his action against the appellants that he was given a diathermic treatment by one of the nurses in the hospital, that during such diathermic treatment he suffered severe and permanent burns, that the nurse was a servant of the appellants and that the burns were caused by the negligence of the nurse, and he claimed damages from the appellants. The appellants pleaded that the treatment was administered without negligence but in any case was administered in accordance with and on the instructions of the respondent\u2019s own personal physician and that the nurse who administered the treatment was acting as agent of the personal attending physician of the respondent and not as a servant of the appellants. From the evidence developed at the trial it is plain that the nurse who administered the treatment was a permanent member of the appellants\u2019 hospital staff in charge of diathermic treatments in the hospital and that neither the personal physician of the respondent nor any other physician had anything to do with the actual treatment. It is further plainly established on the evidence, in fact it is really not disputed, that the diathermic department is run by the hospital and that the handling of the machine is solely a matter belonging to the hospital. The attending physician in this case merely gave an order to one of the hospital nurses, who was the supervisor of the floor on which the patient was located, to see that the patient was given a diathermic treatment and the nurse who administered the treatment admits that the order that was given by the physician was for a diathermic treatment \u201cfor pain.\u201d The respondent\u2019s attending physician said that the patient had pain which is usually associated with sciatic involvement and that he diagnosed the patient\u2019s trouble as sciatica. The nurse who was the supervisor of the floor says that she noticed, shortly after the treatment had been given, \u201ca small area\u201d upon the respondent\u2019s body \u201cthat looked just like dead flesh; it was a dead white\u201d; that \u201cit remained white like that until on towards evening. * * * We kept watching it and it turned dark red.\u201d\nThat the respondent was severely burnt and the resulting injuries of a serious nature are not in dispute. There are two questions, however, raised by the action. Firstly, Was the burn caused by the negligence of the nurse who administered the treatment? If so, secondly, Are the appellants liable in law for the result of her conduct?\nThe trial judge found against the nurse a specific act of negligence, that in giving the patient the treatment she turned on, by mistake, a much more powerful electrical current than she had intended to by putting the electric plug into, what we may for convenience call, the wrong one of two available sockets, and he held the hospital responsible to the patient for the damages resulting therefrom. The Court of Appeal for Ontario, for reasons to which we shall later refer, affirmed this judgment, and the hospital now appeals to this Court.\nOn the question of the negligence of the nurse, it is quite impossible for us on the evidence to reverse the finding against her. Counsel for the hospital, after a minute and very careful analysis of all the evidence, sought to escape from the finding upon two grounds. Firstly, he said the specific act of negligence found by the trial judge was not justified upon the evidence. Several facts, however, are not in dispute. The nurse only intended to apply 750 milliamperes and there were two sockets in the room, from one of which not more than 1,000 milliamperes could be obtained while from the other as much as 4,000 milliamperes were obtainable. The nurse says that as a matter of fact she only used 750 milliamperes in the treatment. But the needle on the dial that indicated the number of milliamperes unfortunately points to 750 and 3,000 at the same moment, the figure 750 being on an inner circle and the figure 3,000 being on an outer circle. The result would be that if the nurse had put the plug into one socket the milliamperes could run up to 4,000 but if she had put the plug into the other socket, the current could not run up beyond 1,000 milliamperes. In the latter case she would be entitled to rely upon the needle pointing to the figure 750 on the inner circle. Undoubtedly the nurse thought she put the plug into the socket with the lesser quantity of electrical energy and when she saw the needle on the dial pointing to 750 on the inner circle and 3,000 on the outer circle she accepted the figure 750 on the inner circle as indicating the exact quantity of current she desired to use. What is said against her, and found by the trial judge to be a fact, is that by an unfortunate act of negligence she put the plug into the wrong socket and got a quantity of 3,000 milliamperes with the disastrous results to the patient complained of.\nThere is no suggestion that the apparatus in use was in any way defective or that the nurse was not reasonably competent to administer heat treatments to relieve pain through the use of the apparatus. The question of fact is, Did she negligently apply an excessive quantity of heat to the patient? There is no doubt that the burns were caused by an intensive application of heat. Counsel for the hospital quarrels with the specific finding of negligence by the trial judge upon the ground that it rested upon the evidence of Dr. Mitchell that the plug was in the wrong socket. It is contended that this piece of evidence is a statement of fact by one who had no personal knowledge of the facts, that it was a mere guess on a matter of fact by an expert witness, and was something quite outside the limits of expert testimony. The exact evidence complained of is this:\u2014\nQ. The fact that he received a burn such as has been indicated, what does that indicate, in your opinion, with respect to the machine or the treatment?\nA. It would look as though it were on the high instead of the low.\nEven taken baldly and isolated from its context, the statement scarcely bears the interpretation put upon it, but read as part of all the evidence of Dr. Mitchell it means in effect nothing more than that the witness having, as an expert, stated that the patient could not be burnt by an application of 750 milliamperes for an indefinite period of time (the treatment here was only twenty-five minutes) and must have had, by the depth and extent of the burn, an application of heat far in excess of 750 milliamperes, and that as neither the apparatus nor the nurse could obtain any such quantity of heat unless the plug had been put in the wrong socket, he could not find any other possible explanation for the burn. The question put to the doctor was not objected to and his answer was not such as to involve any miscarriage of justice.\nSecondly, still on the question of the negligence of the nurse, counsel for the hospital says that the Court of Appeal did not affirm the trial judge\u2019s finding of the specific act of negligence but applied the res ipsa rule and found negligence in fact against the nurse upon the ground that there was no satisfactory explanation of the burn as something that might have happened without any lack of care on the part of the nurse. Counsel for the hospital argued that the physical condition of the patient at the time was in itself sufficient explanation to rebut the implication of negligence. But there is nothing in the evidence to show that the physical condition of the patient in any way accounted for the burn. The Court of Appeal did not reject the specific finding of fact of the learned trial judge, but, treating the case as one of res ipsa loquitur, concluded upon the whole evidence that the nurse had been negligent in giving the treatment. It is unfortunate that the maxim res ipsa loquitur, which serves satisfactorily when applied to certain cases in which the cause of the accident is known, has become a much over-worked instrument in our courts in recent years and has been extended to apply to a great many different sets of facts and circumstances to which the rule, when correctly stated and confined, has little or no application. The rule is a special case within the broader doctrine that courts act and are entitled to act upon the weight of the balance of probabilities. It was upon the broad doctrine, we are satisfied, that the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion upon the whole evidence that the plaintiff had made out a case of negligence against the nurse.\nWe should not be justified upon the evidence in interfering with the finding of negligence against the nurse.\nThe appeal raises, however, an important and difficult question of law, Whether the hospital is liable for the negligence of the nurse? The trial judge appears to have assumed that it is. He did not in his judgment discuss the matter as raising any question of law. The Court of Appeal, however, did consider the question of law and held the hospital liable upon the ground that the treatment by the nurse was a matter of routine in the hospital and that the giving of the treatment was assumed by the hospital as part of its contract to nurse the patient. Mr. Justice Masten, who wrote the unanimous judgment of the court, said that the facts of the case were\nwithin the category of that which formed the basis of the judgments in the Lavere case[2] and in the Nyberg case[3], that is to say, routine treatment.\nThe judgment, in effect, gives recognition to a different consequence in law in hospital cases between a routine or administrative act of a nurse, on the one hand, and the act of a nurse in a matter of professional care or skill, on the other hand.\nThe act of putting the plug in one or other of two sockets is in itself, of course, the merest sort of a routine act not to be dignified by any such words as \u201cprofessional\u201d or \u201cskilful,\u201d but the determining fact in point of law must be the character of the employment in which the nurse was engaged at the time that the putting of the plug into the socket was a mere incident in her work. One might, without using the word in any strict sense, speak of ascertaining the status of the nurse during the period of time in which she was giving the diathermic treatment to the patient. The language of Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer\u2019s case[4] has been very frequently quoted and adopted as a rule to determine the character of the employment of a physician or nurse at any particular time:\nIn my view, the duty which the law implies in the relation of the hospital authority to a patient and the corresponding liability are limited. The governors of a public hospital, by their admission of the patient to enjoy in the hospital the gratuitous benefit of its care, do, I think, undertake that the patient whilst there shall be treated only by experts, whether surgeons, physicians or nurses, of whose professional competence the governors have taken reasonable care to assure themselves; and, further, that those experts shall have at their disposal, for the care and treatment of the patient, fit and proper apparatus and appliances. But I see no ground for holding it to be a right legal inference from the cir- cumstances of the relation of hospital and patient that the hospital authority makes itself liable in damages, if members of its professional staff, of whose competence there is no question, act negligently towards the patient in some matter of professional care or skill, or neglect to use, or use negligently, in his treatment the apparatus or appliances which are at their disposal. It must be understood that I am speaking only of the conduct of the hospital staff in matters of professional skill, in which the governors of the hospital neither do nor could properly interfere either by rule or by supervision. It may well be, and for my part I should, as at present advised, be prepared to hold, that the hospital authority is legally responsible to the patients for the due performance of their servants within the hospital of their purely ministerial or administrative duties, such as, for example, attendances of nurses in the wards, the summoning of medical aid in cases of emergency, the supply of proper food, and the like. The management of a hospital ought to make and does make its own regulations in respect of such matters of routine, and it is, in my judgment, legally responsible to the patients for their sufficiency, their propriety, and observance of them by the servants.\nThat such a rule of difference between matters of professional care and skill and matters purely ministerial and administrative is most difficult of practical application to the varying facts of particular cases is very plain from a consideration of the judgments in the intervening years in the English, Scottish, New Zealand and Canadian courts. Some of these judgments were recently discussed and reviewed by Dr. C. A. Wright, the Editor of the Canadian Bar Review, in Vol. 14 (1936), pp. 699-708. Professor P. H. Winfield, in his valuable new work on the \u201cLaw of Tort\u201d (1937), refers to Dr. Wright\u2019s article in a foot-note at p. 127 as pointing to \u201cthe curiously diverse results which the courts have reached on this matter.\u201d\nIn the case before us, there being no suggestion of any defect in the equipment used and no lack of reasonable competence in the nurse to use the equipment, we are squarely faced with the issue, What, in point of law, is the proper determining fact in arriving at the conclusion whether or not the hospital is liable to the patient for the act of negligence of the nurse? This raises pointedly the question of the correctness of the broad rule stated by Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer\u2019s case[5] or the limitations within which the scope of such a rule must be confined. The House of Lords in the Lindsey County Council case[6] refrained from passing upon that question and left the matter open for a case, if it ever occurs in the House, when that issue must necessarily be decided. In that case the plaintiff developed puerperal fever, a very-dangerous and highly infectious disease, while a patient in a maternity home administered by a committee of a county council, under the provisions of the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, managed by a matron and advised by the medical officer and assistant medical officer of health for the county. The patients were attended by their own medical advisers. A patient in the home had become ill and was removed to a hospital where she was found to be suffering from puerperal fever. The matron and the two medical advisers of the home were informed of this and certain steps were taken to disinfect the home and the staff. The plaintiff was subsequently admitted to the home and after a few days she developed puerperal fever. She brought an action against the county council to recover damages for negligence and breach of duty on the part of the council and those for whom they were responsible. The jury found that those responsible for the administration of the home were guilty of breaches of duty in admitting new patients before having ascertained whether any of the staff were carrying infection, and without informing applicants for admission, or their medical advisers, of the case of the patient who had been suffering from puerperal fever and of the steps taken in consequence thereof to rid the home of infection. The decision of the House, as we understand it, rests upon the fact that the premises were unsafe for an invitee and that the authorities who administered the home knew or ought to have known that the premises were unsafe and should have notified the patient of the danger at the time inherent in the premises. The significance of the case to us lies in the language of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham[7], with reference to the series of cases decided upon the principle stated by Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer\u2019s case5:\u2014\nReliance was placed by the appellants upon a series of cases in English and Scottish courts, in which it has been decided that where a Public Authority carries on a hospital that Authority is not responsible to patients for mistakes in medical treatment or in nursing, provided that they have taken reasonable care to appoint competent doctors and nurses. The respondent challenged the correctness of these cases and referred your Lordships to the recent case of Powell v. Streatham Manor Nursing Home[8] to show that your Lordships\u2019 House gave judgment against the proprietor of a nursing home where the nurses employed by him had been guilty of negligence. It is true that the correctness of the earlier decisions is still open to review in your Lordships\u2019 House. But that review should only take place in a case in which the point is directly raised; the question as to the correctness and as to the limits of the doctrine is obviously one of great importance, both to those who are charged with the responsibility of carrying on hospitals and nursing homes, and to the public who make use of such hospitals and homes. In my judgment, those questions are not raised by the facts in this case and nothing that I have said must be taken as throwing any doubt upon the correctness of those decisions. The principle upon which those cases were determined is well stated in Hillyer v. The Governors of St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital[9] in the judgment of Kennedy L.J. The learned Lord Justice expresses the opinion that the legal duty which the hospital authority undertakes towards a patient, to whom it gives the privilege of skilled surgical, medical and nursing aid within its walls, is an inference of law from the facts, and he holds that the responsibility of the hospital authorities is limited to undertaking that the patient shall be treated only by experts, whether surgeons, physicians or nurses, of whose professional competence the Governors have taken reasonable care to assure themselves, and further that those experts shall have at their disposal for the care and treatment of the patient fit and proper apparatus and appliances. It is obvious that, if that is the correct view of the relationship between the hospital authorities and their patients, there is no breach by the authorities of such duty by reason of the fact that a competent doctor or nurse is guilty of negligence or lack of due care or skill in their treatment of a patient.\nThe Lord Chancellor did not think that this principle had any application to the facts of the case which was then before the House. The judgments in the Court of Appeal had largely rested upon the principle stated in Hillyer\u2019s case[10] but all the Law Lords refrained from putting their judgments upon that ground and confined the decision to the dangerous condition of the premises. The Lord Chancellor proceeded to say:\u2014\nThe reason why the hospital authorities were held not liable in Hillyer\u2019s case10 is because the doctors and nurses were held not to be acting as their agents or servants in the giving of medical treatment. There is no trace of any authority in those cases or elsewhere for the view that where a corporation acts by an agent its liability for the mistakes of that agent is any less where the agent is a medical man than where the agent belongs to any other profession or calling.\nLord Sankey in discussing Hillyer\u2019s case10 as establishing the doctrine that a hospital authority is not liable for the negligence of a doctor while acting in the exercise of his professional functions and knowledge, said:\u2014\nIndeed, Farwell L.J. puts it rhetorically as an example, that when once the doors of the operating theatre are closed upon them for an operation the doctors and nurses present in the operating theatre are no longer the servants of the authority. I am far from saying that this is not the proper legal result, but I should add that it may be necessary to delimit the frontiers of liability.\nLord Sankey did not find it necessary, he said, to discuss or lay down the law on the subject, having regard to the finding of the jury.\nLord Russell of Killowen only expressed his doubts as to the jury\u2019s findings on the question of negligence.\nLord Macmillan said that, there being evidence on which the jury could find that there was negligence on the part of those for whom the appellants were responsible in not knowing, as they ought to have known, that in admitting the respondent to the home they were exposing her to the risk of infection and consequently were negligent in not giving warning of that risk, he was of opinion that the verdict of the jury, so far as upheld by the Court of Appeal, must stand. At the very beginning of his judgment, however, Lord Macmillan made this general observation:\u2014\nThe appellants are responsible in law for the due administration of the institutions which they carry on in the performance of their statutory duties or in the exercise of their statutory powers. This responsibility extends to the actings of those through whose agency they perform their duties or exercise their powers. Consequently, if the respondent\u2019s unfortunate experiences in the Cleethorpes Maternity Home were due to the negligence of the appellants\u2019 agents or servants in the conduct of the home the appellants are answerable. It must be shown that the appellants owed a duty to the respondent, that the agents whom the appellants employed to perform that duty on their behalf were negligent in the discharge of it, and that the injury suffered by the respondent was directly attributable to such negligence.\nLord Wright thought that the facts in this case before the House were to be distinguished from those in Hillyer\u2019s case[11]. He said that not only the matron and nurses but the medical officers were, in his opinion, the servants of the appellants, and the fact that the appellants necessarily relied on their knowledge and judgment did not the less render them the appellants\u2019 agents to carry out the responsibility which rested on the appellants in operating the home.\nEvans v. Liverpool Corporation[12] was the case where a child with scarlet fever had been sent to an infectious diseases hospital maintained by the Liverpool Corporation under the Public Health Act, 1875. The child was discharged by the visiting physician while he was still in an infectious condition and when he got home he gave scarlet fever to three other children of the family. The jury found that the visiting physician in discharging the child had not shown the degree of skill and care which was reasonable in the circumstances and had been negligent. The visiting physician was an officer appointed by the Liverpool Corporation to act under the general direction of the hospitals committee and the rules provided that he should be responsible for\nthe treatment of the patients from the beginning to the end of their stay, and also for their freedom from infection when discharged.\nNotwithstanding that the physician was apparently acting as an agent in performing a wrongful act within the scope of his employment, the court held that the Liverpool Corporation was not liable because its legal obligation extended only to providing reasonably skilled and competent medical attendance for the patients and that the Corporation had discharged that duty.\nThe case was followed by Hillyer\u2019s case[13] above mentioned. The plaintiff was a medical man who entered the hospital for a gratuitous operation. He chose the surgeon to perform the operation. His claim in the action was that while he was unconscious on the operating table his left arm had been allowed to be burned by some vessels containing hot water and that his right arm had been pressed with great force against the end of the table and badly bruised, and that traumatic neuritis set in, both arms had become paralyzed, and that he had been unable to carry on his work as a medical practitioner ever since. The Court of Appeal reaffirmed that the only duty undertaken by the governors of a public hospital towards a patient who is treated in the hospital is to use due care and skill in selecting their medical staff; that the relation of master and servant does not exist between the governors and the physicians and surgeons who give their services at the hospital, and the nurses and other attendants assisting at an operation cease for the time being to be the servants of the governing body; further, that an operation creates a special set of circumstances. Farwell, L.J., said, in part, at p. 826:\u2014\nIf and so long as they are bound to obey (the orders of the defendants [the governors of the hospital] it may well be that (they are their servants, but as soon as the door of the theatre or operating room has closed on them for the purposes of an operation (in which term I include examination by the surgeon) they cease to be under the orders of the defendants, and are at the disposal and under the sole orders of the operating surgeon until the whole operation has been completely finished; the surgeon is for the time being supreme, and the defendants cannot interfere with or gainsay his orders. This is well understood, and is indeed essential to the success of operations; no surgeon would undertake the responsibility of operations if his orders and directions were subject to the control of or interference by the governing body. The nurses and carriers, therefore, assisting at an operation cease for the time being to be the servants of the defendants, inasmuch as they take their orders during that period from the operating surgeon alone, and not from the hospital authorities.\nIt is the dicta of Lord Justice Kennedy in that case that have been so much discussed in the subsequent cases.\nAnderson or Lavelle v. Glasgow Royal Infirmary[14] was somewhat similar in its facts to the case now before us.\nThat was an action in the Sheriff Court at Glasgow against an infirmary for damages for personal injuries. The plaintiff alleged that she attended the infirmary for ultra-violet ray treatment; that the nurse in charge, who was in the employment of the infirmary, allowed her to be exposed to the rays for too long a period; that she thereby sustained injury; and that the injury was due solely to the negligence of the nurse, for whom she sought to hold the infirmary responsible. She further alleged that she had relied on the knowledge and skill of the nurse in applying the treatment. She did not allege, however, that the infirmary had acted negligently in the selection of their medical or nursing staffs or of the apparatus employed. The infirmary, on the other hand, alleged, and the plaintiff did not deny, that their electrical department was in charge of, and was superintended by, a doctor, and that the treatment received by the plaintiff was administered by the nurse upon his instructions.\nThe Second Division of the Court of Session[15] dismissed the action on the pleadings, holding as a matter of law that the allegations of the plaintiff in her pleading were insufficient to support her action, in the absence of any averment that the nurse or the doctor was professionally incompetent or that the apparatus was defective. The judgments in the Court of Session rested largely upon the law as stated in the Evans[16] and Hillyer[17] cases. The case went to the House of Lords[18], and in the course of the argument for the plaintiff their Lordships asked counsel whether they would agree to the case being remitted to the Court of Session for a proof before answer in that Court and counsel agreed to the proposal. The House thereupon reversed the decision of the Court of Session and remitted the case for proof.\nViscount Dunedin, who delivered the judgment in the House of Lords and with whom Lord Buckmaster, Lord Warrington, Lord Thankerton and Lord Russell of Killowen agreed, said in part:\u2014\nIn this case the issue craved has been disallowed, and the action dismissed, upon the ground that the statements of the pursuer, taken along with the explanations of the defenders, disclose no cause of action. The decision is admittedly based on the case of Hillyer v. The Governors of St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital18, which was approved in the Second Division of the Court of Session in Foote v. Directors of Greenock Hospital[19].\nNow, it is clear that the actual facts in both these cases were not the same as the facts in this case, because in both cases what was complained of was the alleged negligence of a doctor in conducting an operation. But there is undoubtedly a dictum of Lord Justice Kennedy[20], not in any way disapproved of by his colleagues, which covers a much wider field, and would include certain cases of negligence on the part of a nurse. At the same time he indicates that, in certain other cases of negligence by a nurse, there would be liability on the ordinary ground of an employer\u2019s liability for his servants for a wrong to another person committed in the carrying out of the employer\u2019s business.\nThe present case therefore becomes very important, not alone to the parties, but as giving rise to an exposition of the law in your Lordships\u2019 House. I have felt from the first that it was very unsatisfactory, if not indeed impossible, to come to a proper decision without knowing precisely what the facts of the case were. Undoubtedly the parties are not absolutely agreed as to them.\nThe case came again before the Court of Session[21]. All the Judges held on the facts as then proved that no negligence on the part of the nurse had been established. The members of the Court, however, expressed their views on what Lord Hunter said was \u201cthe difficult and delicate question\u201d which had been fully debated as to the defenders\u2019 liability to a patient for injury suffered in consequence of the negligence of a nurse attached to the infirmary. Three of the four Judges who sat upon the case remained of the opinion which they had formerly expressed when the case had been before them on the pleadings[22], that is, that the infirmary could not be held responsible for the negligence of a nurse in the course of an electrical treatment given to a patient upon the facts and circumstances of that case. But it is the judgment of Lord Alness, who took a contrary view of the law, to which I desire to particularly refer.\nLord Alness said he knew of no express decision in England or in Scotland which affirmed or negatived the liability of such an institution as the Glasgow Royal Infirmary for the negligence of one of their nurses, and he treated the question of law, therefore, as far as authority went, as open.\nUnless the House of Lords had thought it was, the reason for an inquiry into the facts is not obvious to me. In other words, if an infirmary, having regard to its constitution and profession, may not be responsible for its nurses, then an inquiry into the facts would be superfluous and futile.\nAfter mentioning the Evans[23] and the Hillyer[24] and other cases, Lord Alness pauses to observe that in none of these cases is there any statement or suggestion\u2014apart from a view expressed by Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer\u2019s case24\u2014to the effect that a hospital is not, under ordinary conditions, liable for the negligence of a nurse in the discharge of her professional duties. As to the obiter of Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer\u2019s case24 it would, said Lord Alness, exempt a hospital from liability for the negligence of any member of its staff while performing professional duties, including, he presumed, nurses. From that view he said he respectfully dissented. Proceeding to draw a distinction between the position of a physician and that of a nurse when the physician exercises an uncontrolled direction in the treatment of his patient, and where the nurse is controlled by the superintendent, by the matron, by the doctors, and by the residents, he said,\nThat she is a servant and has a master seems to me indubitable. The problem is to find him. Lord Alness with that preamble sought to ascertain the legal principles upon which the solution of the problem depends. He said that the liability of the infirmary for the nurse, if it existed, depended on the principle of respondeat superior, and the onus, he thought, was on the infirmary to show that that principle did not apply. The maxim, said Lord Alness, gives rise to many problems, but the only problem with which the case before him was concerned was, Who is the superior?\nIn other words, What constitutes the relationship in law of master and servant?\nAfter taking the definition of Lord Justice Bowen in Moore v. Palmer[25],\nThe tests were, Who had the power of selecting, of controlling, and of dismissing?\nLord Alness said that while there may be no difficulty in the ordinary case in determining who selects, who pays, and who dismisses a servant, one must, he thought, be careful in interpreting the requirement of \u201ccontrol,\u201d which does not\nnecessarily connote control, at the moment of the negligence, of the operation then being conducted.\nKeeping in mind \u201cthese indicia of employment, if they are no more,\u201d Lord Alness found that the nurses of the infirmary were selected, were paid, and were subject to dismissal by the institution or its officers.\nAs regards control, it is no doubt true that the nurses are not controlled in the actual discharge of their executive duties\u2014which, in light of what I have said, is immaterial\u2014but that in every other sense they are controlled by the defenders and their officers. Why then, I ask, should the defenders not be liable for the negligence of their nurses?\nAnswering his own question, Lord Alness said in part:\nI cannot, with respect, assent to the view of Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer[26] that the staff of a hospital are in a different position while performing their professional duties from that in which they are while performing their ministerial and administrative duties. * * * I confess that I cannot find any principle or authority which warrants the distinction which the learned Lord Justice sought to draw.\nLord Alness then dealt with the final argument presented by the defenders that, in any event, treatment by ultraviolet rays may be equiparated to an operation, and that the principle of Hillyer\u2019s case26 applies. Lord Alness had no hesitation in rejecting that contention. The basis of the decision in Hillyer[27] was that there was a surgeon in supreme control of the operating theatre, and that the nurse was merely his auxiliary. The facts in this case exclude that view. On the occasion of the pursuers treatment there was no doctor on the scene. There was no supervisor under whose control the nurse was. What happened was that a doctor prescribed the treatment, but that the sole responsibility for administering it rested on the nurse. Moreover, to assimilate treatment by means of ultra-violet rays to what happens in an operating theatre seems to me a violent and illogical example of assimilation. Had a doctor been present and in command while the ultra-violet rays were being applied, a different question would have arisen for decision.\nDuring the argument we were referred to three recent decisions of single judges in the English courts: James v. Probyn[28], Swift, J.; Strangeways-Lesmere v. Clayton[29], Horridge, J.; and Dryden v. Surrey County Council[30], Finlay, J. The judgment of Swift J. in the first case was adopted and followed in the two later cases. But if the remarks of Swift J. in James v. Probyn28 are accurately stated in the British Medical Journal, 1935, Vol. I, p. 1245, that learned Judge said that while the principle in the Evans[31] and the Hillyer27 cases was binding upon him and he must find that the hospital was not in law responsible, he was much attracted by the reasoning of Lord Alness in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary case[32] and if he were deciding the matter for the first time in any court he might possibly follow this opinion rather than that expressed in Hillyer\u2019s case27.\nThe statement of Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer\u2019s case27 as to the difference between ministerial or administrative duties, on the one hand, and matters of professional care or skill, on the other hand, is entitled to great weight and respect, but even the decision in the case is not binding upon this Court. In fact, the only decision at all applicable to the facts of this case that is binding upon us is the judgment of our own Court in the Nyberg case[33]. In that case the patient\u2019s leg had been burnt by a hot water bottle which had been placed in the patient\u2019s bed following upon an operation. The trial judge had found that the proximate cause of the burn was in the first place the filling of the bottle with water that was much too hot without any testing of it and then the failure to investigate and see if any adjustment was necessary. This Court held that the evidence fully justified these findings of the trial judge and also the finding that the latter fact\u2014the failure to investigate\u2014was attributable to the nurse. Upon the question whether for that neglect and its consequences the hospital was legally responsible, this Court, after discussing the propositions laid down in Hillyer\u2019s case[34], held that that case had no application because the burning of the plaintiff\u2019s leg had occurred after the operation had been completed and the patient had been removed from the operating room to his bed in the ward. The duty of the nurse to see that hot water bottles were safely placed in the patients\u2019 beds was regarded not as a matter of special instructions for the occasion but as a matter of routine duty under a standing order of the hospital, and the failure of the nurse, after the appearance of the skin of the patient\u2019s chest had aroused her suspicion, to make sure that the hot water bottle at his leg was not a source of danger, was inexcusable and negligence in her capacity as a servant of the hospital in a matter of ministerial ward duty, if not of mere routine, which entailed responsibility on the hospital for its consequences. The negligence of the nurse was treated as the negligence of a servant of the hospital in the discharge of contractual obligations.\nWhile nothing was said by the majority of the judges in this Court in the Nyberg case[35] in adopting the ratio of the Ontario decision in Lavere v. Smith\u2019s Falls Public Hospital[36], to cast doubt upon the rule of Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer\u2019s case34, the rule did not require, in either of the cases, in the opinion of the Court, any minute analysis or examination. In the Lavere case36 the plaintiff had been burnt by an overheated brick being placed against her foot in her bed while she was still unconscious following upon an operation that had been performed upon her. It was held that the nurse in placing, as she did, the overheated brick to the foot of the patient was not following the doctor\u2019s orders but was merely carrying out a standing order of the hospital to warm the bed. The decision rested upon the fact that the hospital had contracted to nurse the plaintiff and that the duties of the nurse, when the default occurred, were not to assist the surgeon in matters of professional skill but to perform domestic duties in the way of seeing that the bed was right. As to Hillyer\u2019s case[37], Mr. Justice Riddell said that certain expressions which were used in that case had been strongly pressed upon the Court, \u201cbut all these must be read in connection with the facts of the case\u201d and further, \u201cthe expressions so made use of were not intended to be an exposition of the whole law, and are not to be taken literally in a case wholly different in its facts.\u201d\nAny broadly stated rule that necessarily raises on special facts the manifold difficulties which the rule stated by Lord Justice Kennedy in Hillyer\u2019s case37 has presented in so many subsequent cases is not a very practical rule of law. Lord Wright in the Lindsey County Council case[38] said:\nIn my judgment the facts in this case are to be distinguished from those in Hillyer\u2019s case37. It is not necessary to express here any opinion one way or the other about the correctness of that decision. That can be reserved until it comes, if it ever does, before this House: and the same may be said of Evans v. Liverpool Corporation[39], which presents some differences from Hillyer\u2019s case37. Nor is it necessary to consider what difficulties may arise in delimiting the respective frontiers of ministerial or administrative duties on the one hand and matters of professional care or skill on the other hand, if it ever becomes necessary to apply the distinction which Kennedy L.J. draws.\nAfter the most anxious consideration we have concluded that, however useful the rule stated by Lord Justice Kennedy may be in some circumstances as an element to be considered, it is a safer practice, in order to determine the character of a nurse\u2019s employment at the time of a negligent act, to focus attention upon the question whether or not in point of fact the nurse during the period of time in which she was engaged on the particular work in which the negligent act occurred was acting as an agent or servant of the hospital within the ordinary scope of her employment or was at that time outside the direction and control of the hospital and had in fact for the time being passed under the direction and control of a surgeon or physician, or even of the patient himself. It is better, we think, to approach the solution of the problem in each case by applying primarily the test of the relation of master and servant or of principal and agent to the particular work in which the nurse was engaged at the moment when the act of negligence occurred. In the light of that test, if it be the correct and sufficient test, it is not difficult to determine liability in this case. The hospital itself installed, maintained and operated, for profit, the equipment or apparatus that was used. The hospital made a special charge of $1 against the patient for the treatment. The patient\u2019s private physician in attendance upon him had nothing to do with the actual treatment. He says that, while he knew such treatment was recommended to relieve pain, he did not himself know anything about the treatment. The nurse says she knew nothing of the patient\u2019s disease or condition; all she knew was that the patient was to be given a treatment in an effort to relieve pain. She does not suggest that she thought the treatment was for any curative properties. Nor does the evidence indicate that the working of the apparatus entailed any special professional care or skill or that the treatment had any curative properties for any disease of the body. The physician merely told the floor nurse to see that the patient was given a diathermic treatment; she passed the word on to the nurse who had charge of that part of the hospital work. The treatment was not intended by the physician to be, and was not understood by the nurse herself to be, anything other than a treatment of heat to relieve pain. There was no special training or scientific knowledge required, or at least thought to be required by the hospital or by the nurse, to safely use the apparatus in administering the treatment. It is plain from the evidence of the nurse herself that she went to Toronto some years ago and took for \u201cabout one week\u201d what she called \u201can educational course put on by the manufacturers of the machine\u201d and that following this course in Toronto she had \u201ca practical course\u201d by one of the manufacturers\u2019 representatives who came to the hospital \u201cpart of a day\u201d to demonstrate the machine. The nurse states in her evidence that she gives as many as 1,600 of these treatments in a year.\nUpon the facts and circumstances of this particular case we must conclude that the nurse was, at the time she committed the negligent act, acting as the agent or servant of the hospital within the ordinary scope of her employ- ment. There is nothing in the evidence to take her, as between the hospital and herself, out of this relationship during the time she was administering the particular treatment to the patient. She had not passed from the direction and control of the hospital and become for the time being under the direction and control of any surgeon, physician, superior nurse or of the patient himself. The hospital cannot, therefore, escape from the consequences in law of the relationship and must be held liable for the damages which flowed from the negligent act of the nurse. There may be cases, we can readily conceive that there may be, where the particular work upon which a nurse may for the time being be engaged is of such a highly professional and skilful nature and calling for such special training and knowledge in the treatment of disease that other considerations would arise; but that is a totally different case from the one before us.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reason that there was ample evidence to warrant the finding of the learned trial Judge that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by the negligence of the nurse in administering the diathermic treatment while acting in the course of her employment as a servant of the defendant corporation.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Murphy, LeBel & Durdin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cowan, Gray & Millman.\n[1] [1937] O.R. 512; [1937] 2 D.L.R. 121.\n[2] (1915) 35 Ont.

The brokers\u2019 books indicated that they carried for the accounts of their numerous customers many securities, but only a small proportion thereof were held by them at the date of bankruptcy. It was difficult, if not impossible, except in a few cases, to identify securities on hand as those of any particular customer or to ascertain from the brokers\u2019 books and records when or how the securities indicated in the respective customers\u2019 accounts as being carried, but not in fact on hand, had, if ever, been bought or disposed of. In these circumstances, in order to have an equitable basis of distribution among the creditors, M. (the trustee) wrote up each customer\u2019s account by crediting him with the value, at market price on date of bankruptcy, of the securities indicated by the books as being carried for him, and then, by charging him with the amount, if any, of his indebtedness to the brokers, the customer\u2019s equity or surplus was arrived at. A statement of his account, so worked out, as of January 30, 1930, was sent by M. to each customer, concluding with the words: \u201cThe Jan. 30th credits or debits above given show the market values of the stocks carried for your account, long or short, as of that date.\u201d The statement sent to respondent shewed a credit balance in his favour of $76,295.91. On February 26, 1930, respondent filed with M. a proof of claim as an ordinary unsecured creditor in that amount. His claim was admitted as proved. The creditors generally proved their claims, for the purpose of ranking on the estate, on the same basis; and the administration of the estate proceeded upon that basis. But before any distribution among ordinary creditors bad been made, a scheme of arrangement was submitted and approved, under which a new company was to be incorporated, to which all the assets vested in M. were to be transferred, the new company to assume all debts provable in the bankruptcy and to issue its debentures in a sum sufficient to cover all claims proved as certified by M., the debentures to be delivered to M. and by him \u201cto creditors who have proved their claims, as in satisfaction thereof.\u201d Many creditors had not yet proved their claims. By the court order approving the scheme, the debts provable in bankruptcy to be assumed by the new company and the amounts thereof were required to be \u201cascertained by [M.] in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act relating to the proof of debts and all the said provisions, including the provisions relating to appeals from disallowance by the trustee shall apply to the proof of such debts, and [M.] shall certify the debts so proved for the purpose of the issue of debentures under\u201d the scheme. The new company was incorporated in August, 1930, it acquired the assets vested in M., issued its debentures, proceeded to realize upon the assets, made certain payments on the debentures, but not sufficient to meet requirements under the terms thereof, became in default, and was, in December, 1932, declared bankrupt. Its creditors proved their claims upon the debentures, and its trustee, on a realization of assets, paid certain dividends (in August, 1933, June, December, 1934, October, 1936).\nRespondent voted (in May, 1930, upon his claim as proved) for approval of the scheme, his claim (according to his proof of claim filed) was certified by M., the new company issued debentures for the amount thereof, which were delivered to respondent in settlement thereof and accepted by him, he filed his claim against the new company\u2019s estate in bankruptcy, basing it upon the amount of said debentures, he was made an inspector of that estate, attended 23 inspectors\u2019 meetings, and accepted the aforesaid dividends from that estate without protest. According to his evidence, he had at first assumed or believed that his securities were still on hand at the date of the brokers\u2019 bankruptcy, but learned to the contrary about the beginning of 1933. In November, 1936, he forwarded to M. an amended or additional claim in which there was substituted for the market value of some of his securities at the date of bankruptcy the market value thereof on the respective dates on which, according to respondent, they had been disposed of by the brokers prior to their bankruptcy, the respondent thus increasing his claim by $73,486.61. M. replied, in effect, that he had no power to entertain the amended claim. Treating this reply as the disallowance of a claim under s. 127 of the Bankruptcy Act, respondent appealed to the bankruptcy Judge, who dismissed his appeal ([1937] O.R. 559. at 559-561). On appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1937] O.R. 559) held that he was entitled to rank as a creditor in respect of his amended claim (subject to settlement of its amount) and that debentures be issued for the additional amount thereof (subject to s. 76 of the Bankruptcy Act). From this judgment the present appeal was taken (by special leave under the Bankruptcy Act) to this Court. Held (Kerwin J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the order of the Judge in Bankruptcy (declining to give effect to the amended claim) restored.\nSec. 76 of the Bankruptcy Act does not apply to a case such as this, where a creditor, having proved his claim in conversion on one basis of calculation (conversion at the date of bankruptcy), seeks in effect to withdraw his original proof and to substitute a proof for the same claim but on a different basis of calculation (conversion at the date of actual sales).\nIt is doubtful if the discretionary power in the court under s. 163 (4) of said Act applies to the filing or amending of claims with the trustee. But the court has in bankruptcy an equitable jurisdiction to deal with matters of this sort.\nIt could not be said that respondent was barred from his desired amendment on the ground of the doctrine of election. The evidence did not disclose that he bad such knowledge of the facts when he filed his original claim as would put him to an election.\nBut, in view of there having been so much delay and so much change of position in the course of administration of the brokers\u2019 estate between the date of bankruptcy and the date of filing the amended claim (nearly seven years); in view of circumstances which should have enabled respondent to obtain much earlier the information (as to the sales of his securities) which he had when he filed his amended claim; in view of the situation with regard to the new company (which after its bankruptcy could not properly issue more debentures, and, moreover, was not, as such company, before the court) and with regard to other creditors in similar position to respondent; and in view of all the facts and circumstances of the case, and bearing in mind that the allowance, under such or like facts and circumstances, of such amendments as that now sought might lead, in this case and in similar cases, to endless delays and confusion in the administration and distribution of stock brokerage brankruptcies, it must be said that the Judge in Bankruptcy had exercised a sound discretion in declining to give effect to the amended claim, and an appellate court was not justified (in the circumstances of the case) in interfering with his exercise of that discretion.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting): Sec. 76 of the Bankruptcy Act cannot be construed to prohibit under all circumstances a creditor who has filed a claim with a trustee in bankruptcy from withdrawing it and filing a new one or an amended one. Respondent was misled by the wording of M.\u2019s statement aforesaid to such an extent that he filed a claim believing his securities were available; and this misunderstanding continued (justifiably, under the circumstances) until he ascertained the true facts about the beginning of 1933. Nothing that he did or omitted to do should debar him from making a new claim or filing an amended claim. His delay from the beginning of 1933 (when he ascertained that his securities were not on hand at the date of bankruptcy) to the date of filing his amended claim (during which period or part thereof he was considering his position, watching certain proceedings, and tracing sales of his securities) should not be held to debar him from amending, as the position of the trustee of the brokers\u2019 estate and that of the trustee of the new company\u2019s estate have not altered nor has either trustee been prejudiced in any way. It has been held in the Bankruptcy Court in Ontario (In re Stobie, Forlong & Co.; ex parte Meyer Brenner, 14 C.B.R. 405) that the bankruptcy of the new company did not prevent M. from certifying to a debt against the brokers when proved; and the trustee of the new company\u2019s estate still has assets on hand. The circumstance that there may be other creditors in a position similar to that of respondent cannot affect his rights. (In re Safety Explosives Ltd., [1904] 1 Ch. 226, discussed. That case is not an authority applicable to the present question).\nAPPEAL by the trustee of the property of Stobie, Forlong & Company and by the trustee of the property of Stobie, Forlong Assets Ltd. from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which allowed the claimant Colwell\u2019s appeal from the judgment of McEvoy J.[2], sitting as Judge in Bankruptcy, dismissing the claimant\u2019s appeal from the refusal of the trustee in bankruptcy of Stobie, Forlong and Company to take cognizance of an amended claim of the said claimant.\nStobie, Forlong & Company, a firm of stock brokers, made an authorized assignment in bankruptcy on January 30, 1930. The claimant (the present respondent), a customer of the brokers, was one of their creditors, and filed a claim with the trustee in bankruptcy for $76,295.91, being the amount of the balance to his credit according to a statement (made out, along with statements for other creditors, on the basis and under the circumstances explained in the judgments now reported) sent him by the trustee.\nA scheme of arrangement was proposed and was accepted by the necessary majority of the creditors and was approved by an order of the court. Pursuant to this scheme of arrangement, Stobie, Forlong Assets Ltd. was incorporated, in August, 1930, and the assets of the brokers\u2019 estate were transferred to it and debentures of Stobie, Forlong Assets Ltd. were issued to those creditors of the brokers whose claims were duly proved and allowed by the trustee of the brokers\u2019 estate. Stobie, Forlong Assets Ltd., operating as a holding and realizing company for said creditors, made certain payments to its debenture holders. It was subsequently (in December, 1932) adjudged bankrupt. Its creditors proved their claims upon the debentures, and its trustee, on a realization of assets, paid certain dividends. In November, 1936, the claimant (the present respondent), alleging that he had ascertained that Stobie, Forlong & Company had, prior to their authorized assignment in bankruptcy, sold shares and securities belonging to the claimant without disclosing that fact to him and without giving him credit for the amounts received on such sales, made an additional claim for $73,486.61, the claim as amended by such addition being based on the market value of his securities on the respective dates on which, according to the claimant, they had been disposed of by the brokers, instead of the market value thereof on the date of the brokers\u2019 bankruptcy, the latter basis having been that adopted (as explained in the judgments now reported and for reasons there set out) in the statement sent to the claimant (as well as in the statements to other creditors) by the trustee, and according to which the claimant had filed his original claim. The claimant\u2019s right to allowance of his additional claim was the issue now in question.\nThe material facts and circumstances are more fully and particularly set out in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note.\nThe order of the Court of Appeal declared that the claimant was entitled to rank as a creditor of the estate of Stobie, Forlong & Company for the additional amount of his amended claim, ordered that the trustee of said estate certify to the trustee of the estate of Stobie, Forlong Assets Ltd. the amount of the amended claim, and that the trustee in bankruptcy of Stobie, Forlong Assets Ltd. do issue debentures of Stobie, Forlong Assets Ltd. to the claimant for the additional amount of his amended claim, subject to the provisions of s. 76 of the Bankruptcy Act. Provision was made for, if necessary, the determination of the amount of the amended claim.\nLeave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by an order of a Judge of this Court. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was allowed and the judgment of McEvoy J. restored (Kerwin J. dissenting).\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for the Trustee of the property of Stobie, Forlong & Company, appellant.\nE.R. Read K.C. for the Trustee of the property of Stobie Forlong Assets Ltd., appellant. A.W. Roebuck K.C. and G.B. Bagwell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (The Chief Justice, and Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This is an appeal by special leave under the Bankruptcy Act to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3]. The appeal arises out of a demand made by the respondent on November 13th, 1936, that he be permitted, in effect, to amend his proof of claim as an unsecured creditor in bankruptcy, filed February 26th, 1930, in the amount of $76,295.91 by increasing the amount of the said claim by the additional sum of $73,486.61.\nStobie, Forlong & Company were stock brokers carrying on business in partnership in Toronto. They made an assignment in bankruptcy on January 30th, 1930, to Martin, one of the appellants. The respondent had been a customer of Stobie, Forlong & Company with substantial transactions between September, 1929, and January, 1930. More than 4,000 claimants proved in the bankruptcy and their claims in the aggregate amounted to $3,835,794.12. The brokers\u2019 books of account indicated that they carried for the accounts of their numerous customers many securities, but as a matter of fact a very small proportion of these securities were held by them at the date of bankruptcy. The trustee in bankruptcy found it difficult, if not impossible, except in a few cases, to identify such securities as were on hand as the securities of any particular customer or to ascertain from the books and records of the brokers when or how the securities which were indicated in the respective customers\u2019 accounts as being carried, but which were not in fact on hand, had, if ever, been bought or disposed of. In these circumstances, in order to have an equitable basis of distribution among the creditors, the trustee, according to what is now a common and convenient method in stock-brokerage bankruptcies, wrote up each account by making an entry in it crediting the account with the value at the market price prevailing on the date of bankruptcy of the securities indicated by the books as being carried for the customer, and then, by charging the customer with the amount, if any, of his indebtedness to the brokers, the customer\u2019s equity or surplus in his account was arrived at. A statement of his account worked out in this way was sent by the trustee to each of the several customers, including the respondent.\nThe statement of account sent by the trustee to the respondent showed a credit balance in his favour of $76,295.91. On February 26th, 1930, the respondent filed with the trustee a proof of claim as an ordinary unsecured creditor in this exact amount. His claim was admitted as proved, and he did not ask to amend or to substitute any other proof of claim until November 13th, 1936.\nThe creditors generally proved their claims, for the purpose of ranking on the estate, on the same basis as the respondent and the administration of the estate proceeded upon that basis. But before any distribution among ordinary creditors had been made, a scheme for the arrangement of the brokers\u2019 affairs was submitted to a meeting of creditors on May 12th, 1930. The respondent voted, upon his claim as proved, in favour of the approval of the scheme. It may be significant that his voting letter was signed on May 10th, the day he wrote Martin, the trustee, the letter to which we shall refer later, though he had on May 5th signed a similar voting letter against the scheme. Under the scheme of arrangement a new company was to be incorporated and organized and all the assets vested in the trustee in bankruptcy were to be transferred to the new company. The new company was to assume all debts provable in the bankruptcy and to issue its debentures in a sum sufficient to cover all claims proved as certified by the trustee in bankruptcy, the appellant Martin. These debentures were to be delivered to the trustee and by him \u201cto creditors who have proved their claims, as in satisfaction thereof\u201d on the basis of par as against the amount of each claim. It is common ground that at that time many creditors had not yet proved their claims. By the terms of the order of Mr. Justice Orde in Bankruptcy approving the scheme, the debts provable in bankruptcy to be assumed by the new company as men- tioned in the scheme of arrangement and the amounts thereof respectively were required to be\nascertained by the trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act relating to the proof of debts and all the said provisions, including the provisions relating to appeals from disallowance by the trustee shall apply to the proof of such debts, and the trustee shall certify the debts so proved for the purpose of the issue of debentures under the provisions of the annexed scheme of arrangement.\nThe name of the new company, incorporated August, 1930, pursuant to the scheme of arrangement, was \u201cStobie, Forlong Assets, Limited\u201d and it acquired the assets vested in Martin as trustee. A certificate was duly issued by the trustee certifying the respondent\u2019s claim in accordance with his proof of claim filed. Thereupon the new company issued its debentures for the amount of this claim, and the debentures were duly delivered to the respondent in settlement of his claim and were accepted by him. The creditors generally were dealt with in the same manner. Stobie, Forlong Assets, Limited, under the management of a board of directors (five of the seven being required to be debenture holders), proceeded with the business of realizing upon the assets which had been vested in it under the scheme of arrangement. The company paid to debenture holders on November 1st, 1931, three per centum, and on May 1st, 1932, two per centum, of the amount of each debenture. These payments were not equal to the amounts required to be paid under the terms of the debentures; the company became in default; and on December 13th, 1932, was declared bankrupt. The appellant Higgins became trustee in bankruptcy of the company.\nAgain it became necessary for creditors to prove their claims, and the respondent duly filed with the appellant, Higgins, his claim against the company\u2019s estate, basing it upon the amount of the debentures he had received. The respondent was made an inspector of the company\u2019s estate in bankruptcy and during the course of the liquidation has attended twenty-three meetings of inspectors. The trustee of the company, on a realization of assets, has paid four dividends to creditors, including the respondent, as follows: August 2nd, 1933, three per centum; June 1st, 1934, two per centum; December 20th, 1934, three per centum; and October 2nd, 1936, three per centum. The respondent accepted all these dividends without protest and took no step to amend his claim until November, 1936. The claim of the respondent as originally filed was a claim for the balance of the equity in his account after deducting the amount he owed from the market value of the securities as of the date of bankruptcy. It is perfectly plain that the respondent had no credit balance upon any other possible basis than that of treating his securities as converted. He was indebted to the brokers in a sum in excess of $180,000 and only on the basis of a conversion of his securities could he rid himself of that indebtedness and turn it into a credit balance of $76,000 for which he filed his claim. In March, 1930, a month after he had proved his claim, the respondent says he was told by a relative, Midwood, who had been an employee of the brokers, that his securities were still on hand. Obviously it would have been to his advantage to obtain the securities and to pay what he owed against them rather than to rank as an ordinary unsecured creditor. The respondent accordingly wrote Martin, the trustee, on May 10th, 1930, demanding the return of the securities in his account. He admits now that the trustee did not in fact have any of his securities but he says he did not know that at the time. In any event, on May 12th of the same year, 1930, he attended a meeting of creditors and voted on his filed proof of debt in favour of the proposed scheme of arrangement. He now says he assumed, if he was not told by Martin, that the securities were in the trustee\u2019s hands and the trustee would not release them. A few months later, \u201cabout the end of 1930 or the beginning of 1931,\u201d he went to Mr. G.T. Clarkson, who had been made one of the directors of the new company, and asked him to investigate his claim to specific securities, giving him a list of some of the securities with the certificate numbers. Mr. Clarkson investigated and told him the securities were not on hand. The respondent now says that he assumed at that time that the bank had disposed of them. Subsequently the respondent obtained information while acting as an inspector of the new company\u2019s bankrupt estate, that his securities had been sold prior to the bankruptcy. He puts the date of this information not later than \u201cabout the beginning of 1933.\u201d And yet for nearly four years thereafter the respondent acted as one of the inspectors of the company\u2019s estate in bankruptcy and accepted the four dividends paid by the company\u2019s trustee and took no step to amend his claim as proved or to file another until, in November, 1936, he forwarded to Martin, the trustee of the brokers\u2019 original estate, an amended or additional claim in which there was substituted for the market value of some of his securities at the date of the bankruptcy the market value of these several securities on the respective dates on which, according to the respondent, they had been disposed of by the brokers prior to their bankruptcy. Upon this basis the credit to the respondent is increased by the sum of $73,486.61 above mentioned. No admission has been made by the appellants of the accuracy of this statement and the appellants say that they have no means at hand of verifying the dates on which the respondent alleges his securities were disposed of.\nOn December 15th, 1936, the trustee Martin wrote the respondent\u2019s solicitors with regard to the amended claim, stating briefly in effect that he had no power to entertain it. The respondent treated this letter as the disallowance of a claim under sec. 127 of the Bankruptcy Act, and appealed to the Bankruptcy Judge. Mr. Justice McEvoy, the Judge in Bankruptcy, did not regard the matter as the disallowance of a new claim under sec. 127 of the Act, but rather as an attempt by the respondent to amend a claim that had already been allowed. Whether sec. 163 (4) of the Act has any application to the proof of claims or whether it relates only to proceedings in the Court itself, the learned judge was of opinion that in the circumstances of this case no amendment of the claim should be allowed. Although the respondent\u2019s notice of motion by way of appeal was directed only to Martin, the trustee of the brokers, counsel for the trustee of the new company appeared on the motion and was heard in opposition to the granting of the relief sought.\nThe respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal. Counsel for both trustees again appeared and the matter was dealt with in the Court of Appeal broadly as an appeal from the disallowance of the claim. The learned judges in the Court of Appeal appear to have been in error in assuming that the respondent\u2019s first proof of claim was made after the approval of the scheme of arrangement; it was, of course, made before it. This understanding involved an omission to consider, if it is of any consequence, the position of the respondent as one who had proved his claim prior to the scheme of arrangement and who by virtue of that proof had voted for approval of the scheme. The Court of Appeal further appear to treat the case as if the respondent, in proving his original claim, did so on the assumption that his securities were then on hand and that he was claiming for the amount of his equity in these securities so on hand. If by this was meant that the respondent assumed that his securities were actually available to him, it is difficult to reconcile such an assumption with the claim as then filed. The respondent proved only for a sum of money as an ordinary unsecured creditor. It was for the equity in his account, not for an equity in securities, that he claimed. He did not claim any securities or any interest in them. The only difference between his first claim and the claim now in question is that an increase in amount is arrived at by taking the market values of some of the securities at the dates of their alleged sale by the brokers prior to bankruptcy instead of the market values of these securities prevailing at the date of bankruptcy.\nThe Court of Appeal was of opinion that, under sec. 76 of the Bankruptcy Act, the respondent is entitled to be considered, in respect of the additional amount, as a creditor who had not proved his debt, and who now comes in before final distribution of the bankrupt estate and asks to be allowed to participate. As an alternative ground, the Court was of the opinion that under sec. 163(4) there is power to make any necessary amendment to the claim as originally filed. The Court therefore held that the respondent is entitled to rank as a creditor of Stobie, Forlong & Company for the additional amount of his amended claim and to receive further debentures to make up the amount of his claim as amended, and ordered that the trustee of Stobie, Forlong & Company should certify the amount of the amended claim, and that debentures of Stobie, Forlong Assets, Limited, should thereupon be issued for the additional amount. A reservation for settling the accuracy of the new statement was part of the order. Counsel for the respondent contends that his client is entitled as of right to amend his claim and invokes sec. 76 of the Bankruptcy Act. That section reads as follows:\n76. Any creditor who has not proved his debt before the declaration of any dividend or dividends shall be entitled upon proof of such debt to be paid out of any money for the time being in the hands of the trustee any dividend or dividends he may have failed to receive, before that money is applied to the payment of any future dividend or dividends but he shall not be entitled to disturb the distribution of any dividend declared before his debt was proved by reason that he has not participated therein.\nBut this statutory provision does not apply to a case such as this where a creditor, having proved his claim in conversion on one basis of calculation, seeks in effect to withdraw his original proof and to substitute a proof for the same claim but on a different basis of calculation. The respondent\u2019s original claim was founded on a conversion at the date of bankruptcy; the new or amended claim is founded on a conversion at the date of actual sales in so far as they can be traced.\nIn the alternative, counsel for the respondent invokes sec. 163 (4) of the Bankruptcy Act. That subsection reads as follows:\n163. (4) The court may at any time amend any written process or proceedings under this Act upon such terms, if any, as it may think fit to impose.\nIt is doubtful if this discretionary power applies to the filing or amending of claims with the trustee. But the court in any event has in bankruptcy an equitable jurisdiction to deal with matters of this sort. Counsel for the appellants, however, contend that the respondent must fail on the doctrine of election, a doctrine which some historians think sprang from the jurisdiction of equity over bankruptcy and the administration of estates of deceased persons. But it is not established that the respondent, at the time he filed his original claim, was confronted by an option and put to his election. The trustee\u2019s statement to him carried an unfortunate, if not a misleading, footnote that the debits and credits showed the market value as of the date of bankruptcy \u201cof the stocks carried for your account, long or short.\u201d If the respondent thought that his securities were actually in the hands of the brokers at the date of the bankruptcy, it is obvious that he would not have filed a claim at that time as an ordinary unse- cured creditor in what must have appeared to be an almost hopeless situation, but would have taken up his securities and realized in cash the equity of some $76,000 at the then prevailing market prices of the securities or would have arranged to hold and carry the securities through some other agency. But the material before us does not make it at all plain what the respondent really did think or believe when he received the trustee\u2019s statement of \u201cthe stocks carried for your account.\u201d He says that when he found out at the end of 1930 or about the beginning of 1931 from Mr. Clarkson that his securities were not on hand, he assumed that the bank had disposed of them. It is not unreasonable to suppose that he may have thought, when he filed his original claim, that his securities had been either impounded by the trustee or had before the bankruptcy been pledged in mass by the brokers to their bankers and could not be released as individual transactions. It was not, he said, until the beginning of 1933 that he learned that the securities had not been on hand at the date of bankruptcy. The evidence does not disclose that he was in possession of such knowledge of the facts at the time he filed his original claim as would put him to an election.\nWhere, however, there has been so much delay and so much change of position in the course of the administration of the estate of the brokers during the period commencing with the date of bankruptcy, January 30th, 1930, to the date of the filing of the amended claim, November 16th, 1936 (close on to seven years), the question is whether the Court should lend itself under all the facts and circumstances of this case to the aid of the respondent.\nThe information the respondent acquired at the time he filed his amended claim in November, 1936, as to actual sales of his securities by the brokers before bankruptcy, was just as easily obtainable by him at the date of the bankruptcy or at the beginning of 1933 when, at latest, he learned, he says for the first time, that his securities were not on hand at the date of bankruptcy. It was only about three months before the bankruptcy, on October 29th, 1929, that he had transferred to Stobie, Forlong & Company a large trading account that he had been carrying with another firm of Toronto brokers. All that he had to do, and what in fact he subsequently did, was to ask these brokers for the numbers of the share certificates which they had delivered to Stobie, Forlong & Company when he closed and transferred his account with them, and then enquire from the transfer agents of the several companies as to the records on their books of the transfer of these particular shares. The date of registration of a transfer of a certificate is not, of course, evidence of the date of the sale by any particular holder of the certificate in question and if the amended claim were allowed it would necessitate further investigation to ascertain, if possible, the actual sale prices obtained by the brokers from the sale of the several securities.\nThe Assets Company went into bankruptcy in December, 1932, and, while it may be a subsisting company entitled to function within the circumscribed ambit of its curtailed powers (all its assets having become vested in its trustee in bankruptcy), it cannot after its bankruptcy properly issue more debentures. In any event, the company as such is not before the Court. Further, the debentures were transferable and the outstanding debenture holders are not before the Court except in so far as those of them who have filed claims with the company\u2019s trustee in respect of their debentures may be said to be represented by the company\u2019s trustee. The decision in this case will, no doubt, apply not only to other creditors of the same estate but will have a general application to similar cases that may arise in other bankruptcies. The allowance of such amendments may well lead to endless delays and confusion in the administration and distribution of stock-brokerage bankruptcies if, seven years after bankruptcy, the courts are to re-open the door to creditors with such amended claims as the respondent in these proceedings seeks to have admitted. The conduct of the stock brokerage business in Canada necessarily follows very closely, if indeed it does not precisely conform with, the practice in New York which seems to be the common practice throughout the United States, and in the case of a bankruptcy some plan of distribution or scheme of arrangement, as a practical matter, is usually accepted by the creditors, as it was in this case, to avoid endless litigation and delay in the distribution of the bankrupt estate. The learned Judge in Bankruptcy in the exercise of his discretion declined to give effect to the amended claim and referred to the language of Stirling, L.J., in In re Safety Explosives, Ltd.[4]:\nBut I prefer to rest my decision on the ground that the granting of leave to amend or to withdraw a proof is not a matter of right, but is subject to the control of the court, and leave ought not to be given in a case in which in the interval between the carrying in of the proof and the application for leave to amend the position of all parties, and of the liquidator in particular, has been altered.\nWe are of opinion that the Judge in Bankruptcy exercised a sound discretion in declining to give effect to the amended claim, and that an appellate court is not justified in the circumstances of this case in interfering with the exercise of that discretion.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the order of McEvoy J. restored. The appellants (trustees) should have their costs, as between solicitor and client, in the Court of Appeal and in this Court out of the estate of Stobie, Forlong Assets, Limited. There will be no order as to costs against the respondent, Colwell.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting).\u2014Section 76 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 11, enacts:\u2014\nAny creditor who has not proved his debt before the declaration of any dividend or dividends shall be entitled upon proof of such debt to be paid out of any money for the time being in the hands of the trustee any dividend or dividends he may have failed to receive, before that money is applied to the payment of any future dividend or dividends but he shall not be entitled to disturb the distribution of any dividend declared before his debt was proved by reason that he has not participated therein.\nIn my view this provision cannot be construed to prohibit, under all circumstances, a creditor who has filed a claim with a trustee in bankruptcy from withdrawing it and filing a new one or an amended one. I agree with the Court of Appeal that so to do would be placing too narrow a construction on the section.\nIt was then urged that under the circumstances here existing, the respondent should not be permitted to do either of these things, and it therefore becomes necessary to investigate what exactly did occur.\nIt appears that while respondent was a customer of the debtor brokers, Stobie, Forlong & Company, the latter sent statements to the former showing, as in exhibit 5, that the respondent owed the brokers a considerable sum of money, for which they held certain securities. This particular exhibit is dated January 11th, 1930. The debtors made an authorized assignment on January 30th, 1930, and a statement bearing that date was sent by the trustee, Martin, to the respondent. This statement shows a credit balance in favour of the respondent of over $76,000 and reads, at the bottom, in red ink:\u2014\nThe Jan. 30th Credits or Debits above given show the market value of the stocks carried for your account, long or short, as of that date.\nThe respondent argues that he relied on that statement and, believing it to be correct, filed his proof of debt. The declaration proving the debt is dated February 26th, 1930, and on the assumption that respondent\u2019s argument is correct, the statement in clause 3 of the declaration, that the creditor has no security for his claim, is true. That is, the respondent relied on the representation of Martin that the latter had in his possession or under his control the shares in question, and the respondent was satisfied to accept the valuation put upon those shares by Martin as of the date of the authorized assignment. It is not suggested that this valuation was not in fact correct.\nIt is true that the respondent voted for a scheme of arrangement under which a new company was formed; that he received debentures issued by the new company in pursuance of the arrangement, of the face value of his claim as proved; that he received dividends on these debentures and that he acted as an inspector of the estate of the new company as it, in turn, had become bankrupt; but can it be denied that he did all these things in ignorance of the true position? Attention should be directed to his letter of May 10th, 1930, in which he asked Martin for his securities. So far as the material indicates, he did not speak to Martin about the securities until some time in June, 1930, although he had received no reply to his letter. According to the evidence given by the respondent on his cross-examination on his affidavit, all that Martin said on that occasion was that if Colwell were given his securities, he (Martin) would be compelled to deal similarly with the other creditors. It is significant that in his affidavit, sworn to after the completion of Colwell\u2019s cross-examination, Martin does not deny this. The next step is that Colwell asked Mr. G.T. Clarkson to investigate to ascertain if the securities were on hand. It should be recollected that this could not be until after the new company had been formed, because it was only after Clarkson had been appointed a director of the new company that he was approached by Colwell. Clarkson was given a list by Colwell but after investigation he reported, according to Colwell, that he could not find the securities. Colwell explains that he thought this might mean that, if the securities had been pledged to a bank, the latter might still have them or might have disposed of them. It is not unreasonable that Colwell should be under this impression, because, when he had had his account transferred from other brokers to Stobie, Forlong and Company, the securities which Colwell had pledged with the former were actually transferred by the bank with whom the earlier brokers had done business.\nAs an inspector of the estate of the new company, Colwell discovered that his securities were not on hand at the date of the assignment in bankruptcy of the old company. The date of this discovery he places \u201cabout the beginning of 1933.\u201d He did not do anything immediately thereafter. From time to time other customers, (he states), were sued for their debit balances but escaped liability by showing that the securities they had instructed the brokers to purchase either had not been purchased or had not been carried for them by the brokers. It was only considerably later, after pondering over the matter from time to time, that Colwell obtained back from Clarkson the list and then made attempts of his own to find out what had happened to the securities; and it was in September, 1936, that he received a letter from National Trust Company showing the dates of transfer of various shares. Within two months after the receipt of that letter, Colwell filed a new claim, stating that Stobie, Forlong and Company had sold these shares without his knowledge or instructions and that he took the price which they had received as the basis of his new claim.\nThe order of the Bankruptcy Court, approving of the sale by the trustee of Stobie, Forlong and Company to the new company, provides that the debts of the bankrupt shall be assumed by the new company and the amounts thereof respectively shall be ascertained by the trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act relating to the proof of debts and all the said provisions, including the provisions relating to appeals from disallowance from the trustee shall apply to the proof of such debts, and the trustee shall certify the debts so proved for the purpose of the issue of debentures under the provisions of the annexed scheme of arrangement.\nIt has already been held in the Bankruptcy Court in Ontario that the mere fact that the new company had been declared bankrupt did not prevent Martin, as trustee, from certifying to a debt against the old company when proved; In re Stobie, Forlong & Co., ex parte Meyer Brenner[5]. This judgment was given on an application made by Martin for the Court\u2019s advice and direction. At page 407 the Judge in Bankruptcy states:\u2014\nIn my opinion the scheme of arrangement endures, notwithstanding the bankruptcy of Stobie, Forlong Assets Limited, and I direct the trustee to certify and deliver debentures for the sum of $100,000 to Meyer Brenner, in accordance with the scheme of arrangement hereinbefore mentioned, and the same procedure will be adopted with respect to other creditors as and when the amounts of their respective claims are determined or settled by agreement, notwithstanding the bankruptcy of Stobie, Forlong Assets Limited.\nIn my opinion, the respondent, Colwell, was misled by the representation made by Martin to such an extent that he filed a claim believing his securities were available, and that nothing he has done or omitted to do should debar him from making a new claim or filing an amended claim. Whether the claim now filed by him be treated as a new one or whether he be given liberty to withdraw his first proof of debt and to file a new one, is immaterial.\nThe only difficulty I have ever felt was caused by the fact that Colwell discovered in the early part of 1933 that his securities were not on hand at the time of the assignment in bankruptcy. But can he be blamed for taking some time to consider his position and in watching the proceedings taken by the trustee against certain alleged debtors, and in finally securing from Mr. Clarkson the list or memorandum he had left with the latter and then in tracing, through the transfer agents, the sales of his securities? I would say that if he had commenced the tracing process and had instituted these proceedings in 1933, there could be but one answer to that question. Should the answer be otherwise because of the delay that occurred? I conceive it should not, as the position of the trustee of Stobie, Forlong and Company and the position of the trustee of the new company have not altered nor has either trustee been prejudiced in any way. As I have already indicated, it has been held in the Bankruptcy Court in Ontario that the bankruptcy of the new company did not prevent Martin from certifying to a debt against the old company. The trustee of the new company still has assets on hand, according to his own affidavit. Colwell brings into account the dividends he has received, and in accordance with section 76 of the Act does not attempt \u201cto disturb the distribution of any dividend declared before his debt was proved.\u201d The circumstance that there may be other creditors in a position similar to that of the respondent cannot affect his rights.\nWhen Colwell had been misled by Martin\u2019s written statement of January 30th, 1930, by Martin\u2019s neglect to answer his letter of May 10th, 1930, and by Martin\u2019s equivocal statement to him when he personally demanded the return of his securities, why should a delay during which he endeavoured to make sure of his facts be held to debar him from amending his claim when no prejudice has been suffered by the trustee of either company? The case of In re Safety Explosives, Limited[6], referred to by the judge of first instance, does not appear to me to be of any assistance.\nIn that case, solicitors who had a lien for costs upon title-deeds of a company, which were in their possession, proved their debt in the winding-up of the company, stating in the proof that they held no security for the debt and voted at a meeting of creditors in respect of the whole debt. Subsequently, while acting for the liquidator in completing the sale of the company\u2019s property, they handed over the title-deeds to a purchaser upon receiving the purchase price, without any express bargain with the liquidator that their lien should not be prejudiced. They claimed to retain their debt out of the purchase money, and applied for leave to amend their proof by stating in it their security and the estimated value of it, or, in the alternative, to withdraw their proof and rely on their security for payment. Clause 8 of Schedule I of the Companies (Winding up) Act, 1890, governed the matter, which clause is as follows:\u2014\nFor the purpose of voting, a secured creditor shall, unless he surrenders his security, state in his proof the particulars of his security, the date when it was given, and the value at which he assesses it, and shall be entitled to vote only in respect of the balance (if any) due to him, after deducting the value of his security. If he votes in respect of his whole debt he shall be deemed to have surrendered his security, unless the court on application is satisfied that the omission to value the security has arisen from inadvertence.\nThe point for determination was whether what had been done constituted \u201cinadvertence\u201d within this clause. Vaughan Williams, L.J., was of opinion that the onus of showing that the proof was sworn by inadvertence had not been satisfied. While Stirling, L.J., was not prepared to say that inadvertence had not been made out, he preferred to rest his decision on the ground that the granting of leave to amend or withdraw a proof is not a matter of right\nbut is subject to the control of the court and leave ought not to be given in a case in which in the interval between the carrying in of the proof and the application for leave to amend the position of all parties, and of the liquidator in particular, has been altered.\nAs has already been mentioned, the title-deeds were in the hands of a third party and it is quite evident, as Vaughan Williams, L.J., points out in supplemental reasons, at page 238, \u201cthat an order giving leave to amend or withdraw the proof would under the circumstances be illusory.\u201d\nI must confess my inability to see how that decision can in any way be relied on as an authority governing this case.\nSo far no issue has been raised as to the correctness of the amount because the appellants took the position throughout that the respondent was not entitled to file any claim. Clause 4 of the order of the Court of Appeal provides:\u2014\nthat if the Trustee in bankruptcy of the Debtor Stobie, Forlong & Company herein is not satisfied that the amount of the amended claim is correct, and if the parties herein are unable to agree as to the proper amount of the amended claim, the amount shall be determined by the Registrar in Bankruptcy. This affords the trustee of Stobie, Forlong and Company an opportunity of investigating the correctness of the amended claim and disputing it, if so instructed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Trustee of the property of Stobie, Forlong & Company: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\nSolicitor for the appellant, Trustee of the property of Stobie, Forlong Assets Ltd.: E.R.

Both parties lived in the province of Quebec. The marriage was solemnized in 1913. On March 23, 1925, M. by deed transferred to his wife certain securities in fulfilment of said obligation (his wife accepting them in full payment and satisfaction thereof); and thereafter all dividends and revenues therefrom were receved by her and used as her absolute property. M. died in 1932, and in 1933 his estate was assessed for Dominion income tax in respect of income from said securities since their said transfer in 1925. The right to such assessment was disputed. It was agreed that the question of liability should be determined solely by reference to the assessment for income received in 1930. Angers J. in the Exchequer Court ([1937] Ex. C.R. 55) set aside the assessments. The Minister of National Revenue appealed.\nThe Income War Tax Act (Dom.) was first enacted in 1917 (c. 28). By s. 7 of c. 10. 1926, subs. 4 of s. 4 of the original Act was repealed and new subs. 4 substituted as follows: \u201c* * *(b) Where a husband transfers property to his wife, or vice versa, the husband or the wife, as the case may be, shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made\u201d S. 12 of the 1926 Act made s. 7 thereof (enacting said substituted subs. 4) applicable \u201cto the year 1925 * * * and to all subsequent years * * * and to the income thereof.\u201d In the R.S.C., 1927, c. 97 (Income War Tax Act), said subs. 4 (as enacted in 1926) appears as s. 32 (and under the caption\u2014not in the 1926 Act\u2014\u201cTransfers to Evade Taxation\u201d). The R.S.C., 1927, came into effect on February 1, 1928, by proclamation pursuant to \u201cAn Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada,\u201d c. 65, 1924. By force of s. 5 of that Act, and the proclamation thereunder, s. 12 of the 1926 Act stood repealed (on February 1, 1928), and it does not reappear in R.S.C., 1927.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Duff C.J., Davis and Hudson JJ.: Sec. 32 of c. 97, R.S.C., 1927, had not the effect of making M. liable to be taxed on the income derived in 1930 from the property transferred by him to his wife in 1925, in the circumstances mentioned, because s. 32, as it stands in the Revised Statutes, can have no application to properties transferred prior to the original enactment of it in 1926. The reproduction (as s. 32 of c. 97) in the R.S.C. of that original enactment of 1926 preserved that original enactment \u201cin unbroken continuity\u201d (passage in Licence Commissioners of Frontenac v. County of Frontenac, 14 Ont. R. 741, at 745, approved). But s. 12 of the Act of 1926 (making said original enactment applicable to 1925 and subsequent years) stood repealed and disappeared on February 1, 1928, and therefore ceased to have effect, unless its effect was preserved by s. 7 or s. 8 of c. 65, 1924 (Act respecting the Revised Statutes) or s. 19 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 1). It could not be said that, on February 1, 1928, within the meaning of any of those last mentioned statutory provisions, any \u201cliability\u201d had been \u201cincurred\u201d by M. to be taxed (or any correlative \u201cright\u201d of the Crown \u201cacquired\u201d) under the Act of 1926 in respect of income not derived from the transferred property until 1930\u2014the conditions of any such liability had not come into being (the \u201cliability\u201d preserved by s. 19 of the Interpretation Act is not the \u201cabstract\u201d liability imposed by the repealed enactment) (Hamilton Gell v. White, [1922] 2 K.B. 422, at 431); nor could the transfer of 1925 be relied upon, as a \u201ctransaction, matter or thing\u201d anterior to February 1, 1928, within s. 8 (2) of c. 65, 1924, as constituting a liability to be taxed in respect of income derived from the property in 1930; nor, on February 1, 1928, had any right to receive taxes in respect of the income of 1930 \u201caccrued,\u201d nor was any such right \u201caccruing,\u201d to the Crown.\nPer Cannon J.: Under the law of Quebec (arts. 1265, 1257, 778, C.C.), the transfer made in 1925, in order to be valid and binding, must necessarily be related and linked to the ante-nuptial contract of 1913; they must form one complete non-severable transaction. In order to transfer validly the securities to his wife, M. had to fact by force of and under the exceptional authority of the contract of 1913, which clearly, under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act which originated in 1917, is not governed thereby.\nPer Kerwin J.: At the time of the repeal, on February 1, 1928, of s. 12 of c. 10, 1926, no liability to the taxation in question (within the meaning of \u201cliability\u201d in s. 7 (1) of c. 65, 1924) had been incurred, since the only assessment period in question (1930) had not arrived. (Heston and Isleworth Urban District Council v. Grout, [1897] 2 Ch. 306; Abbott v. The Minister for Lands, [1895] A.C. 425; In re The Tithe Act, Roberts v. Potts, [1893] 2 Q.B. 33, at 37; Starey v. Graham, [1899] 1 Q.B. 406; Hamilton Gell v. White, [1922] 2 K.B. 422; and principles enunciated in those cases, reviewed). Nor was any such liability \u201caccruing\u201d within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 1). Moreover, even if there were such an accruing liability, it is shown by statements in Schedule A to the Commissioners\u2019 Roll, provided for in c. 65, 1924 (Act respecting the Revised Statutes) and having statutory force, that the preservation of such accruing liability was inconsistent with the object and intent of said c. 65, 1924, and therefore did not apply (Interpretation Act, s. 2).\nAPPEAL by the Minister of National Revenue from the judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] allowing the appeal of the Executors of the estate of Kenneth Molson, late of the City of Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, deceased, against certain assessments, affirmed by the Minister of National Revenue, Against the said estate under the Income War Tax Act (Dom.) for income tax alleged to have been payable in respect of income on certain property which had been transferred by the deceased to his wife in settlement of an obligation under an ante-nuptial contract of marriage.\nThe ante-nuptial contract of marriage was made in the Province of Quebec (where the parties resided) and was dated March 28, 1913. The marriage was duly solemnized two months later. The deed of transfer (of certain shares of the capital stock of certain corporations) in fulfilment of said contract was dated March 23, 1925. From that date all dividends or revenues from the transferred property were received by Mrs. Molson and used by her as her absolute property.\nMr. Molson died on April 9, 1932, at Montreal, Province of Quebec.\nIn assessing the deceased\u2019s estate for income tax, there was added to the income disclosed in the returns for the years 1925 to 1931, both inclusive, the income derived from the property transferred to his wife as aforesaid, and a tax was assessed by notices of assessment dated April 11, 1933. The additional assessment was, on appeal by the executors of the deceased\u2019s estate, affirmed by the Minister of National Revenue. In the litigation which ensued, it was agreed that the question of liability to the assessment in question should be determined solely by reference to the assessment for income received in 1930. The disputed assessment was set aside by the said judgment of Angers J. now appealed from.\nC. P. Plaxton K.C. and W. S. Fisher for the appellant.\nHugh O\u2019Donnell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The consideration of this appeal is much simplified by the agreement between counsel for the Minister, who appeals, and counsel for the Molson estate that the question of liability is to be determined solely by reference to the assessment for income received in the year 1930; and the question is whether or not, in respect of that assessment for the taxation period 1930, the reciprocal rights of the Crown and the respondent estate are governed by section 12 of chapter 10 of the statutes of Canada of 1926 which came into force on the 15th of June of that year.\nBy section 7 of the statute, subsection 4 of section 4 of the Income War Tax Act (chapter 28 of 1917) was repealed and for that subsection a new subsection was substituted in these terms:\n(4) For the purposes of this Act,\u2014\n(a) Where a person transfers property to his children such person shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such-property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made, unless the Minister is satisfied that such transfer was not made for the purpose of evading the taxes imposed under this Act.\n(b) Where a husband transfers property to his wife, or vice versa, the husband or the wife, as the case may be, shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made.\nIt is not necessary to consider the subsection thus repealed, since, in the view we take, it has no relevancy to the question before us. By section 12 of this statute of 1926 (chapter 10), it was provided that section 7, which brought into force the substituted subsection (and, consequently, the substituted subsection itself),\nshall apply to the year 1925 or fiscal periods ending therein and to all subsequent years or fiscal periods, and to the income thereof.\nThe Revised Statutes of Canada of 1927 came into effect on the 1st of February, 1928, in virtue of a proclamation of the Governor in Council made pursuant to section 4 of 14 & 15 Geo. V, chapter 65, entitled \u201cAn Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada,\u201d which was assented to on the 19th of July, 1924. In the Revised Statutes of 1927 the Income War Tax Act is chapter 97, and subsection 4 of section 4, chapter 28, Statutes of 1917, as introduced (by way of amendment) into that Act by section 7 of the statute of 1926, appears in chapter 97 as section 32, and under the caption \u201cTransfers to evade taxation.\u201d Section 12, however, of this statute of 1926, which made subsection 4 applicable to the year 1925 and subsequent years and to the income thereof, stood repealed (on the date on which the Revised Statutes came into effect, February 1, 1928) by force of section 5 of the statute (of 1924), already mentioned, (the Act respecting the Revised Statutes), and the proclamation thereunder; and that section (s. 12) does not reappear in chapter 97 or elsewhere in the Revised Statutes.\nThe question before us concerns the effect of this repeal in the circumstances we now proceed to state.\nOn the 28th of March, 1913, Kenneth Molson, now deceased, entered into a contract of marriage with his future wife, Miss Isabel Graves Meredith. That marriage was duly solemnized two months later. By clause 7 of the contract, he donated the sum of $20,000 to his future wife to be paid in one sum or by instalments or by investments in the name of his said future wife as he might see fit. On the 23rd of March, 1925, Kenneth Molson, by deed executed before a notary, transferred to his wife certain securities therein specified in fulfilment of this obligation under his marriage contract; and these securities were accepted by his wife in full payment and satisfaction of the obligation. It is not disputed that after this transfer all dividends and revenues accruing from the securities were received by Mrs. Molson and used by her as her absolute property and that her husband had no interest in them or in the corpus.\nMr. Molson died on the 9th of April, 1932; and by notice of assessment dated April 11th, 1933, the Molson estate was called upon to pay an additional income tax for the period of 1930, amounting to $302, on the ground that the income received by Mrs. Molson from the securities mentioned should have been included in her husband\u2019s income for purposes of taxation in virtue of subsection 2 of section 32 of chapter 97 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, which, as explained above, was originally enacted (by way of amendment) as subsection 4 of section 4 of the Income War Tax Act on the 15th of June, 1926.\nSince by the law of the Province of Quebec the transfer of 1925 would (in the absence of the antecedent marriage contract of 1913) have been incompetent as between spouses, it is contended on behalf of the respondent estate that this transfer is entirely outside the purview of section 32 of the Income War Tax. Act. It is also contended, and the learned trial judge has acted upon this contention, that the heading \u201cTransfers to evade taxation,\u201d which did not appear in the statute of 1926, but appeared for the first time in the Revised Statutes, manifests an intention that section 32 should have no application except to transfers made with such intent; and that in this case such intent is conclusively negatived by the fact that the transfer was executed pursuant to an ante-nuptial contract.\nWe do not think it necessary to consider either of these questions. We express no opinion upon them. In our opinion, section 32 of chapter 97 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, had not the effect of making the late Kenneth Molson liable to be taxed on the income derived in 1930 from the property transferred by him to his wife in 1925, in the circumstances mentioned, because that section, as it stands in the Revised Statutes, can have no application to properties transferred prior to the original enactment of it on the 15th of June, 1926.\nThe general effect of the Revision of 1927 is accurately stated (mutatis mutandis) in the following passage in the judgment of the late Chancellor Boyd in Licence Commissioners of Frontenac v. County of Frontenac[2], in which he discusses the revision of 1886:\nThe purpose of the revision was to revise, classify, and consolidate the public general statutes of the Dominion, and the repeal of the old statutes incorporated in the revision was rather for convenience of citation and reference by giving a new starting point than with a view of abrogating the former law. That is manifest from a study of the scope of 49 Vic., ch. 4(D), respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada. Sec. 5, subsec. 2, provides for the repeal of the Acts mentioned in Schedule A above mentioned. But this repeal is not to affect any matter pending at the time of repeal (sec. 7). By sec. 8 the Revised Statutes are not to be held to operate as new laws, but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law in the Acts repealed for which the Revised Statutes are substituted; but if on any point the provisions of the revision are not in effect the same as the earlier Acts, then the revision shall prevail as to all matters subsequent to their taking effect, and as to all prior matters the provisions of the repealed Acts remain in force. (See also Interpretation Act, R.S.C., ch. 1, sec. 7(51). The effect of the revision, though in form repealing the Acts consolidated, is really to preserve them in unbroken continuity.\nAs regards the enactments reproduced in the Revised Statutes, there is unbroken continuity. As regards enactments repealed by virtue of section 5 of the Act respecting the Revised Statutes (cap. 65 of 1924) and not re-enacted in the Revised Statutes, the effect of the revision is to be ascertained from sections 7 and 8 of this statute of 1924 and from section 19 of the Interpretation Act.\nIn the case before us, subsection 4, as introduced by the statute of 1926, though repealed, was uno flatu re-enacted as section 32 of chapter 97 of the Revised Statutes of 1927 and is, therefore, preserved in unbroken continuity; while section 12 of the statute of 1926 is repealed and disappears. Subsection 4 (which has become section 32 of chapter 97 in the Revised Statutes) applies only to the income of property transferred after the day on which it was originally enacted, June 15th, 1926.\nThe result would appear to be the same, for our present purpose, as if the revision had not taken place (that is to say, as if subsection 4 had not been repealed and re-enacted but had remained in force continuously in form as well as in substance), while section 12 had been repealed on the 1st of February, 1928. It is, as Boyd C. says, \u201cthe Acts consolidated\u201d which \u201care preserved in unbroken continuity.\u201d As to enactments repealed and not re-enacted in the Revised Statutes, they disappear and cease to have effect except as regards matters in respect of which their effect is preserved by the statutes mentioned: sections 7 and 8 of the statute of 1924 and section 19 of the Interpretation Act.\nIt is argued that, by force of the second subsection of section 8, section 12 of the Statutes of 1926 continues to govern the rights of the Crown and the liability of the taxpayer because, by that subsection,\nas respects all transactions, matters and things anterior to the said time [the 1st of February, 1928], the provisions of the said repealed Acts and parts of Acts shall prevail.\nThe deed of the year 1925 is said to be a \u201ctransaction, matter or thing\u201d within the meaning of this provision. It is further argued that, by force of section 19 (1) (c), the liability of the taxpayer is preserved. That section declares:\n19. Where any Act or enactment is repealed, or where any regulation is revoked, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such repeal or revocation shall not, save as in this section otherwise provided,\n* * *\n(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under the Act, enactment or regulation so repealed or revoked.\nThe liability in question in these proceedings is a liability alleged to have arisen in respect of income derived in the taxing period 1930, that is to say, in the year ending December 31st, 1930, from the securities transferred to Mrs. Molson by the deed of 1925.\nThe first point concerns the contention of the Crown that this was a liability in esse on the 1st of February, 1928, when the repeal of section 12 of the Act of 1926 took effect.\nWe are unable to perceive the existence of any liability in respect of the income in question on that date except in the sense that, if the law remained unrepealed and the conditions of statutory liability came into being, the taxpayer could be called on to pay. We do not think that \u201cliability\u201d in this sense is what is meant. The observations of Atkin L.J. in Hamilton Gell v. White[3] seem to be apposite:\nIt is obvious that that provision\u2019 was not intended to preserve the abstract rights conferred by the repealed Act, * * * It only applies to the specific rights given to an individual upon the happening of one or other of the events specified in the statute. Here the necessary event has happened, because the landlord has, in view of a sale of the property, given the tenant notice to quit. Under those circumstances the tenant has \u201cacquired a right,\u201d which would \u201caccrue\u201d when he has quitted his holding, to receive compensation.\nSo also \u201cliability\u201d in section 19 of the Interpretation Act is not the \u201cabstract\u201d liability to taxation under the statute of all persons to whose circumstances the terms and conditions of the statute apply. It would be a distortion of language to say that on the 1st of February, 1928, a liability had been \u201cincurred\u201d by Mr. Molson to be taxed under the statute of 1926 in respect of income not derived from the transferred property until 1930. The like considerations apply to sections 7 and 8 of the Statute of 1924 respecting the Revised Statutes. The only \u201cmatter or thing\u201d within section 7(f), and the only \u201ctransactions, matters and things\u201d within section 8, that are pertinent at the moment are those which are relied upon as constituting the liability now in question, the liability to be taxed in respect of the income derived during the taxation period 1930 from the property transferred in 1925. It is perfectly true that the transfer of 1925 was a condition sine qua non of the liability of Kenneth Molson in respect of any taxing period anterior to the 1st of February, 1928; and it is also true that, as regards income derived from that property prior to that date, he had incurred a liability to taxation, and the Crown had acquired a correlative right (s. 10, cap. 28, Income War Tax Act, 1917; s. 55, cap. 97, R.S.C., 1927); but, no such liability was \u201cincurred\u201d (within the meaning of s. 7 (a)) and no such correlative right was \u201cacquired\u201d in respect of the income of 1930 before that year.\nNor can it be said that any right to receive taxes in respect of the income of that year was on the 1st of February, 1928, \u201caccruing\u201d to the Crown. It is not suggested that even the income of that year, which is the basis of the assessment, was \u201caccruing\u201d on that date.\nOnce income was received, the liability to taxation was \u201cincurred\u201d and the right of the Crown was \u201cacquired\u201d; but the right would not strictly accrue before, at least, the day fixed by the statute for the taxpayer\u2019s return although, in the meantime, it might very well be said to be \u201caccruing.\u201d But that could not be affirmed of the right before the income was received.\nThe appeal will be dismissed with costs.\nCannon J.\u2014The Minister of National Revenue appeals from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Angers, rendered on the 9th January, 1937, allowing the respondents\u2019 appeal from a decision of the appellant affirming an assessment for additional income taxes. The additional taxes assessed against the respondents\u2019 estate are in respect of income received between the 23rd March, 1925, and the 31st December, 1931, by Mrs. Isabel Graves Molson on some stocks which she received on or before the 23rd day of March, 1925, and accepted in payment or execution of a donation inter vivos of $20,000 which her deceased husband made to her, as his future wife, by their ante-nuptial contract of marriage before Mtre. Charles Delagrave, Notary, at the City of Quebec on the 28th day of March, 1913.\nThe trial Judge maintained the appeal and found:\n1. That the gift of $20,000 made by the deceased to his future wife in the said ante-nuptial contract of marriage was a valid gift under the law of Quebec and was irrevocable;\n2. It was made before the Income War Tax Act came into force;\n3. The delivery of these stocks to Mrs. Molson by the deceased on or before the 23rd day of March, 1925, was in payment and in satisfaction of the obligation he had undertaken in his ante-nuptial contract of marriage, and the acceptance of the said stocks by Mrs. Molson in satisfaction of the said gift was not a \u201ctransfer of property\u201d to evade taxation within the meaning of the Income War Tax Act of 1917 and amendments thereto.\nThe clause of the ante-nuptial contract, which was duly registered in the registry office of Montreal West on the 28th day of May, 1913, reads as follows:\nSeventh\nIn view of there being no Community and no Dower and of the love and affection of said future husband for his said future wife, he the said future husband, doth by these presents give and grant by way of donation inter vivos and irrevocably unto his said future wife, thereof accepting: 1. The sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars, which the said future husband promises and obliges himself to pay to the said future wife at any time he may elect after the solemnization of said intended marriage, either in one sum or by instalments or by investments or investment in the name of the said future wife, and in such securities as he may see fit. Any investment so made shall operate as payment however, only in so far as the same may be accepted by the future wife, and any payment made by the said future husband to the said future wife on account of the said sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars, or any investment made by the said future husband in the name of the said future wife on account of the said sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars, shall be evidenced by a Declaration to that effect made and signed by the said future husband and the said future wife before a Notary Public and recorded in the office of such Notary. Should the death of the future husband occur before the said sum has been fully paid, the unpaid balance shall become due and exigible at his death, should the said future wife be then living, and it is also further agreed between the parties that should the said future husband during the existence of said intended marriage become Insolvent, without having first paid the sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars, in its entirety, then in such case the said future wife shall have the right to claim and demand the same or any part thereof then unpaid.\nTo have and to hold the said sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars unto the said future wife as her absolute property, but it is specially stipulated and agreed that in the event of her predeceasing her said future husband without having received payment in full of the said sum, the balance of the said sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars which shall not have been paid by the said future husband to the said future wife during her lifetime shall belong to the child or children issue of the said intended marriage, and in default of such child or children the said unpaid balance of the said sum of Twenty Thousand shall revert to the said future husband or his heirs.\nThe Income War Tax Act was first enacted by chapter 28 of the Statutes of 1917. Subsection 4 of section 4 of said chapter reads as follows:\nTransfer of property to evade taxation.\n(4) A person who, after the first day of August, 1917, has reduced his income by the transfer or assignment of any real or personal, movable or immovable property, to such person\u2019s wife or husband, as the case may be, or to any member of the family of such person, shall, nevertheless, be liable to be taxed as if such transfer or assignment had not been made, unless the Minister is satisfied that such transfer or assignment was not made for the purpose of evading the taxes imposed under this Act or any part thereof.\nWhile this provision was in force, and pursuant to the provisions of the marriage contract, Kenneth Molson appeared before Marchessault, Notary Public, on the 23rd day of March, 1925, and declared that, to fulfill the conditions of the said contract in so far as the sum of $20,000 was concerned, he transferred to his wife, duly accepting, certain shares of capital stock of different corporations therein enumerated in full payment and satisfaction of his pre-nuptial donation.\nFrom the date of the execution of the deed of the 23rd of March, 1925, all dividends or revenues accruing from these securities were received by the wife and used as her absolute property, Molson having no interest whatever in said dividends or revenues.\nThe original subsection 4 of section 4 of c. 28 of the statutes of 1917, concerning transfer of property to evade taxation, was repealed on the 15th June, 1926, by sec. 7 of c 10 of the statutes of that year, and the following subsection was substituted therefor:\nTransfer of property.\n(4) For the purposes of this Act,\u2014\n(a) Where a person transfers property to his children\nsuch person shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made, unless the Minister is satisfied that such transfer was not made for the purpose of evading the taxes imposed under this Act.\n(b) Where a husband transfers property to his wife, or vice versa, the husband or the wife, as the case may be, shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made.\nBy section 12 of said chapter 10 of 1926, it was provided that section 7 of the said Act:\u2014\nshall apply to the year 1925 or fiscal periods ending therein and to all subsequent years or fiscal periods, and to the income thereof.\nWhen the Revised Statutes of Canada of 1927 were brought into force on the 1st February, 1928, the above enactments were consolidated and the statutes repealed and were replaced by the following section 32, where they appear as follows:\u2014\nTransfers to Evade Taxation.\nTransfer of property.\n32. Where a person transfers property to his children such person shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made, unless the Minister is satisfied that such transfer was not made for the purpose of evading the taxes imposed under this Act.\n2. Where a husband transfers property to his wife, or vice versa, the husband or the wife, as the case may be, shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made.\nPrior to the institution of the appeal, it was agreed between the parties that the decision of the Exchequer Court with reference to the notice of assessment no. 88893 for the taxation period for 1930 shall apply to and include six similar notices of assessment, all bearing date the 11th April, 1933, and covering the other taxation periods included from the 23rd March, 1925, to the 31st December, 1931.\nFor that period of 1930, we must apply to the above facts parag. 2 of sec. 32, R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, which says:\nWhere a husband transfers property to his wife, or vice versa, the husband or the wife, as the case may be, shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made.\nI take it that the \u201ctransfer of property\u201d means and contemplates a valid and real transfer. This section, when property is transferred gratuitously between husband and wife or vice versa, cannot apply to consorts governed by the Quebec law, because, under section 1265 of the Civil Code,\nAfter marriage, the marriage covenants contained in the contract cannot be altered (even by the donation of usufruct, which is abolished), nor can the consorts in any other manner confer benefits into vivos upon each other, except in conformity with the provisions of the law, under which a husband may, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, insure his life for his wife and children.\nIn order to favour and encourage marriages, article 1257 of the Code says:\nAll kinds of agreements may be lawfully made in contracts of marriage, even those which, in any other act inter vivos, would be void; such as the renunciation of successions which have not yet devolved, the gift of future property, the conventional appointment of an heir, and other dispositions in contemplation of death.\nArticle 778 reads as follows:\nPresent property only can be given by acts inter vivos. All gifts of future property by such acts are void, as made in contemplation of death. Gifts comprising both present and future property are void as to the latter, but the cumulation does not render void the gift of the present property.\nThe prohibition contained in this article does not extend to gifts made in a contract of marriage.\nBoth litigants have considered the transfer as valid and binding on the parties. It appears from the above quotations that, in order to be valid and binding, the transfer made in 1925 must necessarily be related and linked to the ante-nuptial contract of March, 1913, whereby was created the obligation and indebtedness of the future husband to his future wife, and the deed of conveyance of the 28th March, 1925, which evidences the payments, satisfaction and discharge of this pre-nuptial obligation cannot be considered apart from the other, as they must, to be valid and legal under the law of Quebec, form but one complete non-severable transaction. The legislation which is now sought to be applied originated in 1917, years after the ante-nuptial contract; and subsection 4 of section 4 of 7 & 8 Geo. V, c. 28, applied only to a person who, \u201cafter the first day of August, 1917, has reduced his income\u201d by the transfer of any movable or immovable property to such person\u2019s wife or husband, as the case may be, if the Minister was satisfied that such transfer or assignment was made for the purpose of evading the taxes imposed under the Act.\nIn order to transfer validly the securities to his wife, Molson had to act by force and under the exceptional authority of the deed of 1913, which clearly is not governed by the provisions of the Act of 1917 and amendments thereto.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKerwin j.\u2014On March 28th, 1913, Kenneth Molson and his future wife, Isabel Graves Meredith, entered into an ante-nuptial contract by which Mr. Molson \u201cdoth by these presents give and grant by way of donation inter vivos and irrevocably unto his said future wife, thereof accepting,\u201d the sum of twenty thousand dollars, which the future husband promised and obliged himself to pay to the future wife at any time he might elect after the solemnization of the intended marriage, either in one sum or by instalments, or by investments or investment in the name of the future wife, and in such securities as he might see fit. Any investment was to operate as payment only in so far as the same might be accepted by his future wife.\nSome time after the marriage of these parties, viz., on March 23rd, 1925, certain securities of a total market value of approximately twenty thousand dollars were transferred by deed of conveyance by Mr. Molson to his wife. He had previously included the income on these investments in his income tax returns but after the transfer made no further reference to it. Mr. Molson died on April 9th, 1932, and in April, 1933, assessments for income were made against the executors of his estate, including therein as income of the deceased the income from the securities transferred by him to his wife by the conveyance of March 23, 1925. One assessment notice stated that, under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act and amendments, notice was given that for the 1930 taxation period the amount of tax assessed and levied upon Mr. Molson\u2019s income for that period was as indicated. There was a similar notice with reference to each of the other taxation periods of 1925 to 1931 inclusive.\nBelieving that the estate was not subject to taxation in respect of the income from the securities, the executors appealed to the Minister of National Revenue, and, upon the latter affirming the assessments, required their appeal to be set down for trial by the Exchequer Court. It is alleged in the statement of claim, which deals only with the assessment for the year 1930, and admitted in the statement of defence, that the parties had agreed that the decision of the court with reference to that assessment would apply to the assessments for the other years. The appeal was allowed, the assessments set aside, and the Minister now appeals to this court. In accordance with the agreement inter partes, we confine our consideration of respondents\u2019 liability to the year 1930.\nThat question depends upon the construction of several statutory enactments. At the time the notice of assessment was given, subsection 2 of section 32 of a consolidating statute, the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, chap. 97, provided:\u2014\n2. Where a husband transfers property to his wife, or vice versa, the husband or the wife, as the case may be, shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made.\nThe Revised Statutes of 1927 were brought into force on February 1st, 1928, by proclamation of the Governor General in Council, and as the transfer of securities occurred before that date it is apparent that the income on the securities would not be taxable by this subsection. However, chapter 65 of the 1924 Statutes intituled \u201cAn Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the Revised Statutes Act),\u2014after providing by section 5 that from and after the date of the coming into force of the Revised Statutes the enactments in schedule A to the Roll of the Commissioners appointed to revise the statutes should stand and be repealed to the extent mentioned in the third column of schedule A,\u2014further provided by subsection 1 of section\nThe repeal of the said Acts and parts of Acts shall not defeat, disturb, invalidate nor affect any * * * liability * * * incurred before the time of such repeal;\nand by subsection 2 thereof, that every such liability\nmay and shall remain and continue as if no such repeal had taken place, and, so far as necessary, may and shall be continued, prosecuted, enforced and proceeded with under the said Revised Statutes, and other the statutes and laws having force in Canada, and subject to the provisions of the said several statutes and laws, as if no such repeal had taken place.\nFortified with this enactment, the appellant accordingly rests his claim upon the provisions of subsection 4 of section 4 of the Income War Tax Act as enacted by section 7 of chapter 10 of the 1926 statutes and upon section 12 of the last mentioned Act. So far as material, subsection 4 of section 4 as so enacted is as follows:\u2014\n(4) For the purposes of this Act,\u2014\n(b) Where a husband transfers property to his wife, or vice versa, the husband or the wife, as the case may be, shall nevertheless be liable to be taxed on the income derived from such property or from property substituted therefor as if such transfer had not been made.\nSection 12 of the 1926 Act provides that section 7 thereof\nshall apply to the year 1925 or fiscal periods ending therein and to all subsequent years or fiscal periods, and to the income thereof.\nThe contention of the appellant is that these sections, 7 and 12, by their terms embrace the transfer of March 23rd, 1925, and that a liability to taxation had been incurred within the meaning of section 7 of the Revised Statutes Act which was preserved by its provisions.\nThis argument requires the consideration of other matters. Schedule A to the Commissioners\u2019 Roll already mentioned appears at the end of Volume IV of the Revised Statutes of 1927, and under the heading \u201c1926\u201d in the three columns headed respectively \u201cChap.\u201d, \u201cTitle of Act\u201d and \u201cExtent of Repeal,\u201d appear the following:\u2014\n10. An Act to amend The Income War Tax Act, 1917.\nThe whole, except s. 2, the first sentence of par. (\u0192) of s. 3, the last eighteen words of ss. 11 of s. 3, and s. 6.\nBy force of subsection 2 of section 5 of the Revised Statutes Act, both section 7 and section 12 of chapter 10 of the 1926 Act stand repealed. While not having similar statutory force, Appendix 1, printed at the commencement of Volume V of the Revised Statutes of 1927, contains a table of Acts of R.S.C., 1906, and Acts passed thereafter, showing how each has been dealt with; and at page 50 under the year 1926, with reference to chapter 10 under the heading \u201cDisposal,\u201d is the following:\u2014\nConsolidated, except s. 2, the first sentence of para. (\u0192) of s. 3 \u201c10,\u201d the last eighteen words of s. 3, \u201c11,\u201d not repealed nor consolidated; s. 4, \u201c(1A) (c),\u201d repealed 1927, c. 31, s. 3; ss. 2 of s. 4, spent; s. 6, not repealed nor consolidated; s. 12, spent.\nFrom this it is evident that, in the opinion of the Commissioners, the effect of section 12 of the 1926 Act was exhausted.\nThe first point to be determined is as to whether, at the time of the coming into force of the Revised Statutes of 1927, any liability had been incurred within the meaning of section 7 of the Act respecting the Revised Statutes. I know of no decision in our own courts in which the meaning of these words as so used has been determined, but in Heston and Isleworth Urban District Council v. Grout[4] the Court of Appeal in England dealt with the effect of an identical expression as used in paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of section 38 of the 1889 Interpretation Act. The decision there was that a certain statute of 1892 did not affect the validity or effect of a notice given by the plaintiff, while section 150 of the Public Health Act, 1875, was in force in the district, although after the adoption of the 1892 Act no fresh notice could be given under section 150; and that, if there would otherwise have been any doubt on the point, it was removed by section 38, subsection 2, of the 1889 Interpretation Act, which saves everything duly done, etc., and every right, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, or incurred under it before the repeal, etc., and that the subsequent proceedings of the local authority under the notice were sufficient. North, J., before whom the matter came in the first instance, states at page 309:\u2014\nthe matter stands in this way\u2014proceedings had been taken long before the adoption of the Act under s. 150 of the Act of 1875; those proceedings were in active progress at the time when the Act was adopted.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Lindley, L.J., with whom Lopes, L.J., and Rigby, L.J., agreed, was of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to succeed without the aid of the Interpretation Act. He thought, however, that that Act applied,\u2014referring as well to clause (b) as to clause (c) of subsection 2 of section 38. As this subsection has already been mentioned and will be referred to again, it is, perhaps, advisable to reproduce it so far as material:\u2014\n(2) Where this Act or any Act passed after the commencement of this Act repeals any other enactment, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the repeal shall not * * *\n(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed, or anything duly done or suffered under any enactment so repealed; or\n(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation, or liability acquired, accrued, or incurred under any enactment so repealed.\nThe position here is quite different. At the time of the repeal, by the Revised Statutes (February 1st, 1928), of the only enactments by virtue of which it is suggested the respondents could possibly be assessed for the income on the transferred securities, no liability to taxation had been incurred, since the only assessment period in question had not arrived. This proposition appears so obvious that no authority would, I apprehend, be required to substantiate it. Saunders v. Newbold[5], cited by Mr. Plaxton, does not assist the appellant. At page 277 of the report appears a discussion of the meaning of the word \u201cliable\u201d in a section of a statute which provided:\u2014\nAny court * * * may, at the instance of the borrower or surety or other person liable, exercise the like powers as may be exercised under this section, where proceedings are taken for the recovery of money lent.\nThe legislation there referred to is so different in form and intent that no analogy exists between it and the section at present under review.\nThe expression \u201cright accrued\u201d or \u201cright acquired\u201d in paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of section 38 of the English Interpretation Act has been considered in several cases, some of which are reviewed in Hosie v. County Council of Kildare and Athy[6]. Although decided on the provisions of a special statute, Abbott v. The Minister for Lands[7] is cited in this connection as the leading authority. There, a statute repealing an earlier one contained the following saving proviso:\u2014\nProvided always that notwithstanding such repeal\u2014\n(b) All rights accrued and obligations incurred or imposed under or by virtue of any of the said repealed enactments shall subject to any express provisions of this Act in relation thereto remain unaffected by such repeal.\nIt was held that the mere right, existing at the date of the repealing statute, to take advantage of the provisions repealed was not a \u201cright accrued.\u201d\nIn In re The Tithe Act, 1891, Roberts v. Potts[8], it is stated, at page 37, that the court doubted whether the general provisions of the Interpretation Act could, consistently with the context of the Act of 1891, be read into it so as to override the special provisions therein contained, but that even if the Interpretation Act was to be taken as modifying the Act of 1891, the provisions of the former would not seem to cover the case. The judgment continues:\u2014\nIn the present case, until the notices were given or some steps taken to enforce payment of the rates by the occupiers, there could not be even an inchoate right on the part of the occupiers to deduct the rates they had not paid from payments due to the landlord or to anyone else. As no notice was given nor steps taken to demand the rates from the occupiers until long after the passing of the Act of 1891, there were no existing rights to be preserved by the saving clause in the Interpretation Act.\nStarey v. Graham[9] decided that a patent agent who had been bona fide in practice prior to the passing of the Patents, Designs, and Trade-Marks Act, 1888, and who was consequently entitled under section 1, subsection 3, of that Act to be registered as a patent agent, must pay before registration the fee prescribed by The Register of Patents Agents Rules, 1889; and that the right which a person had prior to the passing of the 1888 Act, to practise as a patent agent and describe himself as such, was not a \u201cright acquired\u201d which was saved from the operation of the Act by section 27 thereof which provided:\u2014\nNothing in this Act shall affect the validity of any act done, right acquired or liability incurred before the commencement of this Act.\nIn Hamilton Gell v. White[10], the landlord of an agricultural holding, being desirous of selling, had given his tenant notice to quit. By an Act of 1914, when a tenancy was determined by a notice to quit, given in view of a sale, the notice was treated as an unreasonable disturbance within an Act of 1908, and the tenant was entitled to compensation upon the terms and subject to the conditions of that Act. One of the conditions of the tenant\u2019s right to compensation thereunder was that he should within two months after the receipt of the notice to quit give the landlord notice of his intention to claim compensation; and another condition was that he should make his claim for compensation within three months after quitting the holding. The tenant duly gave notice of his intention to claim compensation, but before the tenancy had expired and, therefore, before he could satisfy the second condition, the relevant provisions of the 1908 Act were repealed. He subsequently made his claim within the three months limited thereby and it was held that notwithstanding the repeal he was entitled to claim compensation under section 38 of the Interpretation Act because, as soon as the landlord had given the tenant notice, the latter \u201cacquired a right\u201d to compensation for disturbance, subject to his satisfying the conditions of the repealed provisions. In the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Bankes distinguished Abbott v. The Minister for Lands[11], pointing out that there the tenant\u2019s right depended upon some act of his own, while in the Gell case[12] it depended upon the act of the landlord. Lord Justice Scrutton stated that, as soon as the tenant had given notice of his intention to claim compensation, he was entitled to have that claim investigated by an arbitrator, although in the course of the arbitration he would have to prove that that right in fact existed, i.e., that the notice to quit was given in view of a sale. Lord Justice Atkin stated that section 38 of the Interpretation Act was not intended to preserve the abstract rights conferred by the repealed Act but that it applied only to the specific rights given to an individual upon the happening of one or other of the events specified in the statute; that the necessary event had happened and, therefore, the tenant had acquired a right, which would accrue when he had quitted his holding, to receive compensation. He referred to the Abbott case[13], pointing out that the Privy Council there determined that\nthe mere right (assuming it to be properly so called) existing in the members of the community or any class of them to take advantage of an enactment, without any act done by an individual towards availing himself of that right, cannot properly foe deemed to be a \u201cright accrued\u201d within the meaning of the enactment. None of these decisions is precisely in point but a review of the principles enunciated in them rather strengthens than otherwise the conclusion at which I have arrived that no liability to taxation had been incurred.\nIn view of the statement in section 13 of the Revised Statutes Act that\nThis Act * * * shall be subject to the same rules of construction as the said Revised Statutes,\nreliance was also placed on section 19 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 1, by which the repeal of any Act shall not\n(c) affect any * * * liability * * * accruing * * * under the Act * * * so repealed.\nIn my opinion no liability was accruing. Not merely had the time for Mr. Molson to make a return not arrived nor the time for the Government officials to make an assessment, but the value of the securities might depreciate or vanish before 1930. The remarks of Lord Tomlin, speaking for the Judicial Committee, in Dominion Building Corporation Limited v. The King[14], are, I think, apposite. After referring, at page 549, to the provisions of the Ontario Interpretation Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 1, s. 10, whereby it was provided that no Act should affect the rights of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, unless it was expressly stated therein that His Majesty should be bound thereby, his Lordship declared that the expression \u201cthe rights of His Majesty\u201d in the context meant the accrued rights, and did not cover mere possibilities, such as rights which, but for the alterations made in the general law by the enactment under consideration, might have thereafter accrued to His Majesty under some future contract.\nThere is another obstacle in the way of applying section 19 of the Interpretation Act to the case at Bar. By section 2 of the same statute section 19, in common with the other provisions of the Act, extends and applies to the Revised Statutes Act \u201cexcept in so far as any such provision[15] is inconsistent with the intent or object of such Act.\u201d It appears to me that, even if there were an accruing liability, the object and intent of the Revised Statutes Act are inconsistent with a determination that the statute meant to preserve it. And for this reason. Section 3 of chapter 10 of the 1926 Act, amending the Income War Tax Act by adding subsection 10 and other subsections to section 3 of the main Act, dealt with what were known as \u201cpersonal corporations,\u201d and the first sentence of paragraph (\u0192) of that section provides:\nThis subsection shall be applicable to income of the year 1925 and fiscal periods ending therein and to each year or period thereafter.\nThis sentence is not repealed according to the note under \u201cextent of repeal,\u201d which statement, as has already been shown, has the sanction of Parliament. Applying the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the conclusion seems inescapable that it was not the intention of Parliament to preserve the suggested accruing liability.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the respondents are not liable to assessment on the specified income for the year 1930, and by reason of the consent between the litigants the same result follows with respect to the income for the other years. In this view of appeal, it is unnecessary to deal with the other points mentioned in the argument.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

The basis of her claim was that has death was caused by his having taken insulin (for his diabetic condition) on the occasion in question in too large a dose. The policy by its terms insured against (inter alia) death resulting from \u201cbodily injuries, effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means.\u201d S. 5 (in force at the time of deceased\u2019s death) of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act provided that \u201cin every contract of accident insurance, the event insured against shall include any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency, and happening without the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act * * *\u201d At the trial the following (amongst other) questions were submitted to and answered by the jury: \u201cDid the insured accidentally, and by mistake, take an overdose of insulin?\u201d A. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWas [his] death caused solely by taking, accidentally, and by mistake, an overdose of insulin?\u201d A. \u201cYes, indirectly.\u201d \u201cWas [his] death caused by, or contributed to, by diabetes, Bright\u2019s disease, hardening of the arteries, or any other diseases?\u201d A. \u201cDiabetes indirectly.\u201d \u201cIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to question [last above preceding], in what way was [his] death so caused or contributed to?\u201d A. \u201cInsulin reaction.\u201d\nThe trial Judge dismissed the action, holding \u201cthat, upon the facts as proven and upon the law applicable to the questions at issue, notwithstanding the findings of the jury, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d The dismissal of the action was affirmed (by a majority) by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (11 M.P.R. 490). Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld: There should be a new trial. (Crocket J., dissenting, would dismiss the appeal).\nIn applying said s. 5 of the Accident Insurance Act to the case, the essential point was that in law (and upon the proper construction of s. 5) the external force or agency which occasions the bodily injury must be the proximate cause of death. The jury\u2019s answers had not determined the vital issue whether or not the taking of the insulin on the occasion in question was the proximate cause of the insured\u2019s death.\nTwo incidental issues were decided (and therefore excepted from the new trial) as follows: (1) As to the allegation of non-disclosure of material facts at the time the last certificate for renewal of the policy was delivered: The New Brunswick statutory law requires, in order to avoid a contract of insurance on the ground of non-disclosure, that there be a \u201cconscious concealment\u201d; and such a concealment was not established by the evidence. (2) As to a provision in the policy that it should \u201cnot cover for injuries or be in force upon any person over the age of 65 years\u201d\u2014deceased being under 65 at the date of delivery of the last renewal certificate, but reaching 65 years of age before the date of the alleged taking of the dose of insulin in question: The words in the policy were not sufficiently precise and definite to make the policy inoperative when the insured reached 65 years of age, the last renewal receipt having been issued when he was under that age.\nCertain cautionary remarks made with regard to admissibility in evidence of statements of deceased persons.\nPer Crocket J., dissenting: The appeal should be dismissed. There was no evidence that the Insured\u2019s death was caused by accident within the meaning of the policy or of said s. 5 of the Act. There could be no recovery without proof that his death resulted from bodily injury alone (effected as stipulated in the policy). Plaintiff\u2019s allegation, upon which her whole case rested, that deceased \u201caccidentally and by mistake \u201ctook an overdose of insulin, \u201cas a result whereof and not otherwise\u201d he came to his death, constituted the decisive issue at the trial, and the questions aforesaid left to the jury covered that issue. A fair summary of their answers was that they thought that, but for the diabetes, deceased would not have died. Whether or not they intended so to find, it was the clear effect of the whole evidence. Therefore plaintiff was disentitled to recover, under the explicit terms of the policy and upon a proper construction of said s. 5 of the Accident Insurance Act. S. 5 does not exclude the maxim causa proxima. There can be no recovery under a contract of accident insurance, for bodily injury or death resulting therefrom, unless external force or agency was the proximate cause of that injury. The admission, against objection, of evidence of a statement by deceased to plaintiff that he had taken too much insulin was improper as contravening the rule against hearsay evidence; in any event the statement could add nothing to plaintiff\u2019s case, it being as consistent with deceased having intentionally taken more insulin than he usually took as with his having taken it accidentally and by mistake; in no case, in view of the fact that he took it in the course of his treatment for his disease, as he had been regularly doing, could the objectionable evidence have any bearing upon the issue as to whether his death was directly caused by external force or agency within the meaning either of the policy or of said s. 5 of the Act.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], dismissing (Harrison J. dissenting) her appeal from the judgment of Barry, C.J., K.B.D., dismissing her action.\nPlaintiff sued to recover, as beneficiary, upon an accident insurance policy by which the defendant insured the plaintiff\u2019s husband against (inter alia) loss of life resulting (\u201cfrom such injuries alone within 90 days from the date of accident\u201d) from \u201cbodily injuries, effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means,\u201d for 12 months from March 1, 1924. The policy was renewed from year to year, the last renewal certificate being dated March 1, 1932, and renewing the policy up to noon of March 1, 1933. The insured became very ill in the afternoon of February 26, 1933, and died on March 1, 1933. The basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim under the policy was that the insured\u2019s death was caused by his having taken (at a time during the morning of February 26, 1933) insulin for his diabetic condition in too large a dose. Section 5 of the Accident Insurance Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 85 (which section was in force at the time of deceased\u2019s death, but has since been repealed) read as follows:\nIn every contract of accident insurance, the event insured against shall include any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency, and happening without the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act, and no term, condition., stipulation, warranty or proviso of the contract, varying the obligation or liability of the insurer shall, as against the insured, have any force or validity, but the contract may provide for the exclusion from the risks insured against of accidents arising from any hazard or class of hazard expressly stated in the policy.\nThe policy provided that it\nshall not cover for injuries or be in force upon any person over the age of 65 years, or cover for sickness or be in force upon any person over the age of 60 years, and shall not be renewed after the insured has reached the specified ages. Any premiums paid for any person over the specified ages shall be returned upon request.\nThe insured (according to a finding at the trial) reached the age of 65 years on February 14, 1933.\nThe case was tried by Barry, C.J., K.B.D., with a jury. Questions were submitted to and answered by the jury. Entry of verdict was reserved until after argument of questions involved. The argument was later heard, and subsequently the trial Judge delivered reasons, concluding as follows:\nAfter a careful consideration of the evidence in the case, I have come to the conclusion, that upon the facts as proven and upon the law applicable to the questions at issue, notwithstanding the findings of the jury, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in the action. A verdict is therefore entered for the defendant: the plaintiff\u2019s action is dismissed with costs.\nAn appeal by the plaintiff to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick was dismissed with costs (Harrison J. dissenting)[2]. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and J. F. H. Teed K.C. for the appellant.\nP. J. Hughes K.C. and J. E. Friel for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (The Chief Justice and Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014The appellant seeks in this action to recover against the respondent as the beneficiary of an accident insurance policy upon the life of her deceased husband. The real question in issue, broadly speaking, is whether or not her husband\u2019s death was caused by accident. The deceased husband was a medical practitioner, sixty-five years of age at the time of his death, and the basis of the claim under the policy is that his death was caused by his having taken insulin for his diabetic condition on the morning in question in too large a dose. There is no direct evidence that he took any insulin the morning in question but it is a fair inference, and really not in dispute, that he had taken insulin that morning, as he had been accustomed to do for several months each morning and each evening. Whether on the particular occasion the quantity he took was in excess of the quantity that had been prescribed for him and which he had been taking regularly for some months or whether he took the usual quantity that morning but it was too much for his system at that particular time is not made plain because, of course, no one knows the exact amount he did take. There is no suggestion that, whatever the amount was, there was any indication of suicide.\nA real difficulty in the case arises out of a section in the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act, which, while since repealed (as a similar provision in other provincial statutes has been repealed), was in force at the time of the deceased\u2019s death and governs the case. The section is as follows:\n5. In every contract of accident insurance, the event insured against shall include any bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency, and happening without the direct intent of the person injured, or as the indirect result of his intentional act, and no term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso of the contract, varying the obligation or liability of the insurer shall, as against the insured, have any force or validity, but the contract may provide for the exclusion from the risks insured against of accidents arising from any hazard or class of hazard expressly stated in the policy.\nThe section was obviously intended to put an end to defences by accident insurance companies which had raised technical and confusing issues and the statute therefore created liability in the companies whether the event insured against (i.e., the accident) happened \u201cwithout the direct intent of the person injured\u201d or \u201cas the indirect result of his intentional act.\u201d In applying the section to the circumstances of this case the essential point is that in law the external force or agency which occasions the bodily injury must be the proximate cause of the death.\nScrutton, J. (as he then was) in Coxe v. Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corporation, Limited[3], in construing a condition in an accident insurance policy, said:\nThe construction of this Condition is not very easy, and it is clear that several questions might arise upon it; but, dealing with the particular matter which is before me, namely, whether I ought to uphold the finding of the arbitrator that the death of the deceased was indirectly traceable to war, I start with the consideration that to all policies of insurance, whether marine or accident, the maxim causa proxima non remota spectatur is to be applied if possible. The immediate cause must be looked at, and not one or more of the variety of causes which if traced without limit might be said to go back to the birth of the assured. For that reason, when there are words which at first sight go a little further they are still construed in accordance with that universal maxim. Thus it has been held upon the words \u201cfrom all consequences of hostilities \u201cthat the proximate and direct consequences of hostilities are alone to be looked at: lonides v. Universal Marine Insurance Co.[4]. Where the words were \u201cdamage consequent on collision\u201d it was decided that only the immediate and necessary consequences of the collision were to be looked at, and not what happened at the port of refuge in consequence of the collision: Pink v. Fleming[5]. In Lawrence v. Accidental Insurance Co.[6], where the assured was killed by a train and was on the line because, just previous to the train passing, he had had a fit, and there was an exception that the policy did not insure in case of death arising from fits or any disease whatsoever arising before or at the time or following such accidental injury, the immediate muse was again looked at, and it was held that the assured\u2019s representatives could recover although a fit placed him on the line where the railway engine killed him. I have therefore to ascertain whether the language of this policy goes beyond and excludes the maxim.\nThe condition to which the policy was subject in that case was that the policy did not insure against death \u201cdirectly or indirectly caused by, arising from, or traceable to * * * war.\u201d Scrutton J. proceeded to say that the words in the condition \u201ccaused by\u201d and \u201carising from\u201d did not give rise to any difficulty. \u201cThey are words which always have been construed as relating to the proximate cause. * * *\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d he went on to say,\nthe words which I find it impossible to escape from are \u201cdirectly or indirectly.\u201d There does not appear to be any authority in which those words have been considered, and I find it impossible to reconcile them with the maxim causa proxima non remota spectatur.\nThe learned judge in that case concluded that the only possible effect which could be given to the words \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d was that the maxim causa proxima was excluded.\nIn the section of the statute which governs the case before us, the words are \u201cany bodily injury occasioned by external force or agency\u201d\u2014not, occasioned \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d by external force or agency. That being so, upon the proper construction of the section the external force or agency must be the proximate cause of the bodily injury insured against.\nThe case was tried with a jury and the real question for the jury was whether or not the taking of the insulin on the morning in question directly resulted in the death of the insured. There were twenty-one questions submitted to the jury and it is not at all surprising that their answers present a good deal of difficulty to us in ascertaining what their conclusion really was on the vital fact whether or not the insulin was the proximate cause of death. Four questions and answers may be mentioned:\n1. Q. Did the insured accidentally, and by mistake, take an overdose of insulin?\nA. Yes.\n2. Q. Was the insured\u2019s death caused solely by taking, accidentally, and by mistake, an overdose of insulin?\nA. Yes, indirectly.\n8. Q. Was the insured\u2019s death caused by, or contributed to, by diabetes, Bright\u2019s disease, hardening of the arteries, or any other diseases?\nA. Diabetes indirectly.\n11. Q. If you answer \u201cyes\u201d to question No. 8 by the Court, in what way was the death of the insured so caused or contributed to?\nA. Insulin reaction.\nIt is plain that the jury have not determined the vital issue as to whether or not the taking of the insulin on the morning in question was the proximate cause of death.\nIt is unfortunate that the case has to go back for a new trial but it seems to be inevitable. Two incidental issues must therefore be disposed of.\nFirst, the allegation of non-disclosure of material facts at the time the last renewal receipt was delivered. The New Brunswick statute requires, in order to avoid a contract of insurance upon the ground of non-disclosure, that there should be a \u201cconscious concealment.\u201d The evidence does not establish that there was any such concealment. The very serious change in the deceased\u2019s physical condition occurred after, and not before, the time of the delivery of the renewal receipt. Then there is the question of age. The deceased was under sixty-five at the date of the delivery of the renewal receipt but was sixty-five before his death. The words in the policy are not sufficiently precise and definite to make the policy inoperative when the insured reaches sixty-five years of age, the last renewal receipt having been issued to the insured when he was under that age.\nIn the event of a new trial being had, it may be necessary for the trial judge to deal specifically with the question of the admissibility of an alleged statement of the deceased that he had \u201ctaken too much of the damn stuff.\u201d It is inadvisable that we should discuss the matter other than to observe that statements of a deceased person should never be admitted except where their admissibility as a matter of law has been clearly established. The person who is said to have spoken is dead; he cannot be put on oath nor can he be cross-examined as to the exact words of his statement. There is always the danger of mistake that cannot be corrected; and there is inherent frailty in the repetition of such statements, however much good faith there may be. The rules of law as to the admissibility of statements of deceased persons are now well settled and it will be for the trial judge, if the question is raised, to apply whatever may be the proper rule to the given facts. Reference might be had to Garner v. Township of Stamford[7] and Amys v. Barton[8].\nWe would allow the appeal and direct a new trial except on the incidental issues of non-disclosure and of age. The respondent should pay the costs of this appeal and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick. The costs of the abortive trial shall abide the event of the new trial.\nCrocket J. (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reason that the record discloses no evidence that the death of the insured was caused by accident within the meaning either of the policy sued on or of s. 5 of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act which, though since repealed, was in force at the time of the insured\u2019s death. The policy itself insured the deceased against death resulting from \u201cbodily injuries, effected directly and independently of all other causes, through external, violent and accidental means\u201d within 90 days from the date of accident. That there could be no recovery thereon without proof that the insured\u2019s death resulted from such a bodily injury alone is, I think, too clear for argument. The appellant\u2019s whole case rested upon the allegation that her husband \u201caccidentally and by mistake took an overdose of insulin, as a result whereof and not otherwise [he] came to his death.\u201d This allegation constituted the decisive issue on the trial before Barry, C.J., K.B.D., and a jury, and His Lordship left to the jury two questions bearing upon and completely, as I think, covering that issue, i.e.,\n1. Did the insured accidentally, and by mistake, take an overdose of insulin?\n2. Was the insured\u2019s death caused solely by taking, accidentally, and by mistake, an overdose of insulin?\nTo the first of these questions the jury answered \u201cYes\u201d and to the second \u201cYes, indirectly.\u201d His Lordship, however, also left to the jury another question, No. 8, bearing upon the same issue, \u201cWas the insured\u2019s death caused by, or contributed to, by diabetes, Bright\u2019s disease, hardening of the arteries, or any other diseases?\u201d to which the jury answered \u201cDiabetes, indirectly.\u201d To still another question, which was placed before the jury at the request of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, as required by the Judicature Act, viz.: \u201cIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to question No. 8 by the court, in what way was the death of the insured so caused or contributed to?\u201d the jury answered \u201cInsulin reaction.\u201d\nNotwithstanding these answers, the learned trial Judge, after hearing argument upon a motion for the entry of judgment, dismissed the action, holding that there was not to be found in the whole record a particle of evidence to justify the jury\u2019s finding that the insured accidentally and by mistake took an overdose of insulin and that the answer to question No. 2 (which was really not responsive to the question put) was erroneous, and should have been \u201cno\u201d instead of \u201cyes, indirectly.\u201d\nI fully concur in the view expressed by the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick in the majority judgment in the Appeal Court that a fair summary of the jury\u2019s answers to questions 2 and 8 by the court and question 11 by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel is that the jury thought that, but for the diabetes, the man would not have died. Whether or not, however, that is what the jury really intended to find, that, in my judgment, is the clear and indisputable effect of the whole evidence and disentitles the plaintiff to recover under the explicit terms of the policy and upon a proper construction of the now repealed section of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act relied on.\nI agree with my brother Davis that this section did not exclude the maxim causa proxima and that it follows that there can be no recovery under any contract of accident insurance, whether for a bodily injury, or for death directly resulting from a bodily injury, unless such bodily injury was directly caused by external force or agency, or, in other words, unless external force or agency was the proximate cause of such bodily injury. This is precisely the construction which the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick and Grimmer, J., placed on the section in their majority judgment in the Appeal Court and upon which their decision affirming the dismissal of the action by the trial Judge was manifestly based. I should add, I also agree with Baxter, C.J.N.B., that the admission, against objection, of the testimony of the conversation between the appellant and the insured as to his having taken too much insulin was improper as contravening the rule against hearsay evidence, and that, in any event, the statement attributed by the appellant to her husband subsequently to the taking of the insulin, could add nothing to the appellant\u2019s case, as it is quite as consistent with his having intentionally taken more insulin than it was usual for him to take as with his having taken it accidentally and by mistake. In no case, in view of the undisputed fact that the insured had for many months previously been suffering from the disease of diabetes and took the insulin in the course of his treatment for that long pre-existing disease, as he had been doing twice a day regularly during that period for the purpose of reducing his blood sugar by its action, could the objectionable evidence have any bearing upon the issue as to whether his death was directly caused by external force or agency within the meaning, either of the policy or of s. 5 of the New Brunswick Accident Insurance Act. I can see, therefore, no justifiable ground upon which the case should be sent back for a new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs; new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1938: February 22; 1938: March 25.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUBIA\nMaster and servant\u2014Liability of master for servant's negligence\u2014Accident through alleged negligent driving of motor car by company's salesman on his way home from evening lecture arranged by company for its salesmen\u2014Question whether salesman was at the time acting in the course of his employment.\nThe action was for damages by reason of injuries suffered in an accident caused by alleged negligent driving of a motor car by H., and the question on the appeal was whether or not at the time of the accident H. was acting in the course of his employment by the defendant company, against whom liability was claimed.\nH. was employed by defendant company as a salesman, on salary, to sell oil, gasoline and other products in the district of New Westminster. The company's office was in Vancouver. In the first few months of his employment H. had resided in Vancouver, but had later moved to New Westminster, as being more convenient for his work. His place of residence was no part of his contract and the company had nothing to say about his moving. In selling the company's products, H. drove a motor car owned by himself, but the company supplied the oil and gasoline used, paid for the car licence and for repairs. H.'s normal working day was from 8.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. He had no office of his own but used a telephone at a filling station in New Westminster for messages sent or received. He reported to the company's office several times a week and generally telephoned to it daily. At the company's office in Vancouver a pigeon hole was provided for the salesmen in which messages were left. H. received a notice there of four evening lectures to be given, and stating that he was \"expected to attend.\" On the evening in question, H., whose own car was away for repairs, borrowed a car and drove to one of these lectures in Vancouver. He left it about 9 p.m. to go home and on the way the accident occurred.\nHeld: At the time of the accident H. was not under any control of the defendant company so as to render it liable for his negligence.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 52 B.C.R. 106, in setting aside the judgment at trial against the defendant company, affirmed.\nBain v. Central Vermont Ry. Co., [1921] 2 A.C. 412; St. Helens Colliery Co. Ltd. v. Hewitson, [1924] A.C. 59; Alderman v. Great Western Ry. Co., [1937] A.C. 454, and Blee v. London & North Eastern Ry. Co., [1938] A.C. 126, referred to.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] in so far as it allowed the appeal of the defendant Home Oil Distributors Ltd. from the judgment of Manson J.[2].\nThe action was for damages by reason of injuries suffered by the plaintiff Mabel Dallas (wife of her co-plaintiff) when she was struck by a motor car driven by the defendant Hinton. The plaintiffs alleged that the accident occurred by reason of negligence on the part of the defendant Hinton in the operation of the motor car, which, it was alleged, was being driven by him in the course and within the scope of his employment as a servant of the defendant Home Oil Distributors Ltd., against which company also the damages were claimed.\nThe trial Judge, Manson J., gave judgment against both defendants[3]. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia upheld the judgment against Hinton but (McPhillips J.A. dissenting) allowed the appeal of Home Oil Distributors Ltd. and set aside the judgment against it[4]. From the said allowance of the company's appeal, the plaintiffs brought the present appeal to this Court; and the question in issue on this appeal was whether or not at the time of the accident Hinton was acting in the course of his employment by the company.\nThe material facts and circumstances of the case, so far as the question in issue in this appeal is concerned, are sufficiently stated in the judgment of this Court, now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nJ. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellants.\nC. H. Locke K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nHUDSON J.\u2014This is an action for damages by a husband and wife for injuries sustained by the wife in the collision of an automobile negligently driven by the defendant Hinton, who was at the time of the accident a salesman in the employ of the co-defendant, the Home Oil Distributors Limited.\nThe action was tried at Vancouver before Mr. Justice Manson and judgment was given by him against both defendants[5]. On appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia the judgment of the trial judge against Hinton was sustained but the majority of the court held that at the time of the accident Hinton was not acting in the course of his employment and that, therefore, the defendant company was not liable[6].\nOn appeal to this Court the sole question submitted is whether or not the accident happened while Hinton was acting in the course of his employment.\nThere is little or no dispute about the facts bearing on this issue. Hinton was employed by the defendant company as a salesman working on a salary and selling oil, gasoline and other products in the district of New Westminster, which adjoins the city of Vancouver to the east. In the first few months of his employment he resided in the city of Vancouver but later on moved to New Westminster as being more convenient for his work. His place of residence was no part of his contract and his employers had nothing to say about his removal from Vancouver to New Westminster. In selling defendant's products Hinton drove an automobile owned by himself, but the defendant company supplied him with oil and gasoline and paid for the automobile licence and for necessary repairs to his car. His normal working day was from 8.30 a.m. until 5 p.m., and the company's sales manager said, on enquiry as to whether salesmen worked after those hours, that they did from time to time, that they might do the odd job if something of an emergency should arise, but that they were not asked to work after that time. Hinton had no office of his own but used the telephone at a filling station in New Westminster, from where he sent and at which he received messages. The office of the defendant company was in Vancouver and Hinton reported there several times during the week and generally communicated therewith by telephone daily. At this office a pigeon-hole was provided for the salesmen in which messages were left from time to time. On or about 14th May, 1935, a notice was put in Hinton's pigeon-hole at the Vancouver office, stating that four lectures would be given in the evening on certain dates mentioned and \"that you are expected to attend.\" Martin, the sales manager, said that attendance was not compulsory but desirable in the company's interests. At any rate, in the evening in question Hinton, whose own car was away for repairs, borrowed another car for the occasion and drove to the meeting at Vancouver. About 9 p.m. he left the meeting to go home in this car and shortly thereafter the accident took place.\nThe learned trial Judge held on these facts that the accident took place while Hinton was engaged in the course of his employment and, as above stated, the majority of the Court of Appeal took the opposite view. Before us it was argued on behalf of the plaintiffs that Hinton's attendance was in accordance with a special order arising out of his general employment, that he used a car in the performance of his duty that evening in the same way as when normally doing his daily work, that the special work took its colour from the general nature of his services, that he was engaged in his master's business in going to, attending and returning from the lecture, that in returning he was in fact returning to his business headquarters from where he would make his start on the following morning to perform his regular duties.\nOn behalf of the respondent it was argued that it was not part of Hinton's contract to attend the meeting in question, that in any event, as soon as he left there, he was a free agent to do as he pleased, that his employers had no control over him, that he could return to his home by any mode of transportation that he chose, that in returning to New Westminster he was, as he said, going home, that there was no evidence that he had other duties to perform for his employers that evening, that the situa- tion did not differ from what existed prior to removing his residence from Vancouver to New Westminster.\nThe question of when a servant can be held to be acting in the course of his employment has been the subject of numerous decisions in the courts and I shall refer to only a few of the more important.\nIn the case of Bain v. Central Vermont Railway Company[7], the appellant's husband was killed owing to the negligence of the respondent company's engine driver in disregarding the signals of another company upon whose line he was driving the engine under an agreement between the companies for joint working; each company paid the drivers employed in the joint service for the service on its own line. The appellant sued the respondents for damages. It was held that the respondent company was not liable, since at the moment of the accident the engine driver was under the control of the other company. Lord Dunedin in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, at page 416, quotes with approval a statement of Bowen L.J. in Donovan v. Laing Syndicate[8], as follows:\nWe have only to consider in whose employment the man was at the time when the acts complained of were done, in this sense, that by the employer is meant the person who has a right at the moment to control the doing of the act.\nSt. Helens Colliery Co. v. Hewitson[9]: A workman employed at a colliery was injured in a railway accident while travelling in a special colliers' train from his work to his home at M. By an agreement between the colliery company and the railway company the railway company agreed to provide special trains for the conveyance of the colliery company's workmen to and from the colliery and M., and the colliery company agreed to indemnify the railway company against claims by the workmen in respect of accident, injury or loss while using the trains. Any workman who desired to travel by these trains signed an agreement with the railway company releasing them from all claims in case of accident, and the colliery company then provided him with a pass and charged him a sum representing less than the full amount of the agreed fare, and this sum was deducted week by week from his wages:\u2014Held (by Lord Buckmaster, Lord Atkinson, Lord Wrenbury and Lord Carson; Lord Shaw of Dunfermline dissenting), that, there being no obligation on the workman to use the train, the injury did not arise in the course of the employment within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1906. Lord Buckmaster states at p. 67:\u2014\nThe workman, was under no control in the present case, nor bound in any way either to use the train or, when he left, to obey directions; though he was where he was in consequence of his employment, I do not think it was in its course that the accident occurred.\nLord Atkinson, at p. 81:\nIn my opinion, the evidence does not establish that the workmen of the appellants in travelling to or from the appellants' colliery in these provided trains were discharging any duty to their employers which their contracts of service bound them to discharge.\nLord Wrenbury, at p. 95:\nThe man is not in the course of his employment unless the facts are such that it is in the course of his employment, and in performance of a duty under his contract of service that he is found in the place where the accident occurs. If there is only a right and there is no obligation binding on the man in the matter of his employment there is no liability.\nAnd again at p. 96:\nIf I apply the other test which I have suggested, the workman when in the train owed no duty to obey an order the employers might there give him.\nIn Alderman v. Great Western Railway[10], the applicant was a travelling ticket collector in the employment of the respondent railway company, and had in the course of his duty to travel from Oxford, where his home was, to Swansea, where he had to stay overnight, returning thence on the following day to Oxford. Being also qualified as a guard and, as such, liable to be called upon in an emergency, he was required by the railway company to leave, and he in fact left with them, the address of his Swansea lodgings. Apart from this obligation he had an unfettered right as to how he spent his time at Swansea between signing off and signing on, and he could reach the station by any route or by any method he chose. In proceeding one morning from his lodgings to Swansea station to perform his usual duty, he fell in the street and sustained an injury in respect of which he claimed compensation. It was held by the House of Lords that while in the street proceeding from his lodgings to the station, the applicant was not performing any duty under his contract of service and that, therefore, the accident did not arise in the course of his employment and that consequently he was not entitled to compensation. Lord Russell of Killowen, at p. 460, said:\u2014\nAs I have already indicated there is no evidence of any contractual limitation at all of the man's choice of abode either at Swansea or Oxford. But even if there had been some term of the contract, which ensured that his lodging should not be unreasonably far from the Swansea station, it would still have been impossible to say that his contract of employment necessitated his presence on the spot where the accident occurred. He was there only because it lay on the route between the station and the particular house which he himself had happened to select. The case would still have failed to contain the element of fact which was the essential ground of the decision in the case of London & North Eastern Ry. Co. v. Brentnall[11], namely, the contractual obligation to go to the particular place where the accident happened.\nand again at p. 462:\u2014\nHe was *** subject to no control and he was for all purposes in the same position as an ordinary member of the public, using the streets in transit to his employer's premises.\nIn Blee v. London and North Eastern Railway Company[12], a ganger in the service of a railway company was, by the terms of his contract of service, liable to be called upon in case of emergency to go to the place where the emergency had arisen, notwithstanding that he might have finished his normal day's work, and when so called upon after his normal day's work he was entitled to be paid overtime from the hour he left his home in order to proceed to the place where the emergency had arisen. One night, after he had completed his day's work and after he had gone to bed, he received a message requiring him to go to a certain siding to assist in replacing a derailed truck, and in compliance with that order he rose and was proceeding to the siding when he was knocked down in the street by a motor car and sustained injuries from the effects of which he died. On a claim for compensation by his widow:\u2014\nHeld, by the House of Lords, that as the deceased man was obliged by the terms of his contract to obey an emergency call at any hour, as he was paid from the time he left his home in obedience to the call, and as he was obliged to proceed with reasonable despatch to the place where his services were required, there was evidence to support the finding of the county court judge that the accident arose out of and in the course of the deceased man's employment, and, therefore, that his widow was entitled to compensation.\nIn the course of his judgment, Lord Atkin states:\u2014\nThere can be no question that had the workman been going to his ordinary work in the morning he would not have been entitled to compensation for injury suffered from street risks incurred in transit. His time in such a case is his own; he arrives at the scene of his labours as he pleases; and though it is his duty to present himself at the appointed time yet his \"employment\" does not in ordinary circumstances begin for the purposes of the Act until he reaches the place where he is employed.\nand he quotes from the words of Lord Russell of Killowen in Alderman's case[13]:\u2014\nThe cases in which men are employed to work at a distance from their homes and have to find lodgings for themselves must be innumerable. Yet there is no case in the books, or at all events none was cited, in which such an one meeting with an accident when merely on his way to or from his work has been held entitled to compensation. In order to entitle him to compensation in such a case some other element must be present (involving the discharge of a contractual duty to the employer) which in law extends the course of his employment so as to include the moment of time when the accident occurred.\nThe learned Lord expressed some doubt but in the end arrived at the conclusion that on the special facts there was in that case a special duty to obey the emergency call, that he was paid from the time he left the house so that that time was his master's time and that he was under an obligation to proceed with reasonable despatch by the reasonably shortest route, which afforded evidence from which the judge could infer that from the time the workman started from his house he was actually engaged in the performance of his contract of service.\nLord Maugham concurred in the opinion of Lord Atkin and at p. 134 said:\u2014\nWe can test the view of the arbitrator by supposing that a superior officer of the company happened to meet the workman loitering on his way to the place or diverging from the proper route. Could not the officer properly have ordered the workman to proceed direct to the place to which he has been called? The circumstance as to payment affords, I think, a decisive answer in the affirmative.\nLord Roche, in concurring, at p. 134, stated:\u2014\nA workman may be acting in the course of his employment or, put more shortly, he may be on duty, when in a public street. Ordinarily he is not so acting when proceeding to the place where his work proper begins. But he may be so if he is proceeding to that place by a pre- scribed route or by a prescribed means of conveyance. The circumstances here are different in that neither route nor conveyance were prescribed.\nThe question whether a given act of an employee is within the scope of his employment, in the sense in which that phrase is used for the purpose of determining the employer's liability to third persons, is, strictly, not the same question as the question whether an injury received by an employee at a given moment in given circumstances was an injury received in the course of his employment for the purposes of applying the Workmen's Compensation Act. Nevertheless, judicial reasoning in respect of the latter class of questions may be, and in the circumstances of this case is, valuable and illuminating.\nIn our opinion, the question we have to consider is whether or not Hinton was on his master's business at the moment of the accident.\nHe had gone to the lecture on his master's invitation and, at least to some extent, for his master's benefit. The area of his business was some miles away and he had to return there in order to resume his work, but his home was also in the area of his business. It was a place of residence of his own choice, not that of his master. After leaving the meeting his day's work was done; he was free to do as he pleased and free to go home without any further control or direction from his master as to the route, mode of transportation or otherwise. His only obligation was to be at work in New Westminster the next morning at 8.30 a.m.\nUnder these circumstances, we cannot hold that Hinton was under any control of his masters so as to render them liable for his negligence and would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

An issue of its western edition contained a libel on respondents (plaintiffs). The Imperial News Co. Ltd. (hereinafter called the I.N. Co.) was the sole distributor for Manitoba of said western edition, and distributed copies to retail newsdealers, who in turn sold to the public. Respondents sued the I.N. Co. in Manitoba and recovered judgment for damages for the libel. They also sued in Manitoba a number of retail newsdealers, one of which suits went to judgment and the others were settled by payments. Respondents then sued in Ontario the appellant and one L. (the general distributor) for damages for the alleged publication of the libel to the I.N. Co. and to S. (its manager) and other of its employees, in sending in bundles the issue containing the libel to the I.N. Co. At the trial, respondents were non-suited on the ground that the defendants were joint tortfeasors with those against whom judgment had been recovered in Manitoba and therefore respondents were precluded from recovering in the present action; but the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1937] O.R. 341) held that the publication by defendants to the I.N. Co. and its employees complained of in the present action constituted a separate tort for which defendants were liable and that it was an entirely different cause of action from those sued on in the Manitoba courts, and gave judgment in favour of the present respondents, and directed a new trial, limited to assessment of damages. On appeal to this Court:\nHeld (Kerwin J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed as against appellant.\nPer Duff C.J. (who also agreed in substance with the reasoning of Cannon, Crocket and Davis JJ. as applied to the facts of this case): The I.N. Co. received delivery of the newspapers pursuant to its agreement with the publishers and was a party directly concerned in the shipping of the papers to itself, in the receipt of them by its employees, in the distribution to the newsdealers and in the latters\u2019 sales to their customers. It was engaged along with the publishers and appellant and L. in a joint commercial enterprise, the publication and distribution and ultimate sale of the newspapers. The aim of the whole enterprise was the purchase of the paper by the public; the shipments to the I.N. Co. were only one step in carrying this out. Publication to it, if there was such, consisted in the incidental publication to its servants as the paper passed through their hands on its way to the public through the newsdealers. It was a participant jointly with appellant and others in the shipment to itself, in the distribution to newsdealers and in the sale to the public. This was really, in said action against it, the plaintiffs\u2019 case on the pleadings and the questions put in issue in that action. The I.N. Co. was liable, and jointly liable, for every publication ensuing upon its act\u2014the joint act of itself and appellant and others\u2014in causing to be brought the newspaper to itself for distribution. A cause of action arising out of the delivery to the newsdealers in carrying out the business so jointly engaged in could not be substantially separated from the cause of action alleged in the present action, which, therefore, was one in respect of which the I.N. Co. was liable at suit of the plaintiffs. It would be an abuse of substantial justice to permit plaintiffs to proceed against the I.N. Co. in another action in respect of the publication now sued upon; and, since that company was jointly liable with appellant and others for that publication, proceedings against appellant must also fail.\nPer Cannon, Crocket and Davis JJ.: There was a complete remedy for respondents in the court in which the action against the I.N. Co. was started. Respondents should not be permitted to go on suing one person after another ad infinitum where a complete remedy was available in one action. (Williams v. Hunt, [1905] 1 K.B. 512, at 514, Macdougall v. Knight, 25 Q.B.D. 1, at 10, and others cases, cited). The jurisdiction to dismiss such an action as the present one exists as part of the inherent power of the court over its own process.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting): While appellant was responsible for the publications effected by the defendants in the Manitoba actions, there was no connection between the acts of those defendants and the acts of appellant. The publication set forth in the present action occurred without any of those defendants taking part in it. The pleading here avers a cause of action different from any set forth in the Manitoba actions, and evidence was led by respondents to substantiate the allegation. Therefore the judgments and settlements in Manitoba are not bars to the present action. (The Koursk, [1924] P. 140, particularly at 151, 157, 159-160; Brunsden v. Humphrey, 14 Q.B.D. 141; Buhner Rayon Co. Ltd. v. Freshwater, [1933] A.C. 661, cited). The fact that the paper was sent to the I.N. Co. and received by certain of its employees who opened and read it, was sufficient to establish the allegation of publication by appellant to the \u201cI.N. Co. and\/or [its] employees.\u201d In the circumstances of this case the respondents, residents of Manitoba, should not be held to have been obliged to join appellant, a resident of Ontario, as a defendant in any of the Manitoba actions and add a claim against him based on an entirely different cause of action, at the risk (in failing to do so) of ascertaining, when they bring an action on such separate cause of action in the jurisdiction where appellant resides, that their rights have been lost. This point (last mentioned) was not raised at trial and presumably was not argued before the Court of Appeal.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Thomson from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1. The respondents, who reside in Winnipeg, sued the appellant, as managing editor, and another defendant (Lichtman) as distributor, of a newspaper called Hush, published weekly in Toronto, for damages for libel by reason of a certain article contained in an issue of the western edition of said newspaper. The Imperial News Company, Limited, hereinafter mentioned, was the sole distributor for Manitoba of said western edition, and distributed copies to retail newsdealers in Manitoba (and also to some in Saskatchewan and Alberta), who in turn sold to the public. The respondents had sued the Imperial News Company, Limited, in Manitoba and recovered judgment against it for damages for the libel. They also had sued in Manitoba a number of retail newsdealers, one of which suits went to judgment, and others were settled by payments. Respondents then brought the present action in Ontario. They alleged in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim:\u2014\n10. The said defendants published the said article directly to the Imperial News Company Limited, which company is a wholesale vendor of newspapers throughout Western Canada, and to the servants and\/or employees of the said Imperial News Company Limited * * * The said defendants further delivered the said article to the above mentioned company and persons well knowing and intending that the above mentioned company and persons would and should re-deliver the said article to several hundred retail dealers, and well knowing and intending that such retail dealers would and should publish the said article to their individual customers. The natural and ordinary result of so delivering the said article was the re-delivery and sale of the said article. The said Imperial News Company Limited and\/or its servants and\/or employees did in fact re-deliver the said article to several hundred retail dealers and the said retail dealers did in fact sell and publish the said article to many thousand individuals * * *\nAt the trial, before McFarland J. and a jury, the trial Judge at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case gave effect to the defendants\u2019 motion for a non-suit and dismissed the action with costs, on the ground that the defendants in this action were joint tortfeasors with the defendants against whom judgments had been recovered in the Manitoba courts, and were therefore precluded from recovering in the present action.\nOn appeal by the plaintiffs (the present respondents), the Court of Appeal for Ontario gave judgment in their favour and directed a new trial limited to the assessment of damages2. The following extracts from the reasons of Rowell, C.J.O., indicate the ground for the decision of that Court as to the cause of action against the present appellant:\u2014\nAn examination of these records [in the actions in Manitoba] shows that in none of the actions was any claim made for publication by the defendants to the Imperial News Company Limited, and therefore the publication complained of in paragraph 10 of the plaintiffs\u2019 statement of claim is not the same publication as is complained of in any of the other actions.\nCounsel for the defendants contend that the defendants in the case at bar, the Imperial News Company Limited, and the other defendants sued in Manitoba, were all joint tortfeasors, and that as the plaintiffs have chosen to sue certain of these joint tortfeasors and take judgment against them, they cannot now sue the defendants.\n* * *\nIt is clear that the defendants in this action were joint tortfeasors with the Imperial News Company Limited in respect of the publication complained of in the action against the said company, and the plaintiffs, having sued and recovered judgment against the said company, cannot now claim damages against the defendants in respect of such publication. It is also clear that the defendants were joint tortfeasors with the Imperial News Company Limited and the United Cigar Stores Ltd. in respect of the publication complained of in that action [an action against the United Cigar Stores Ltd., in which the publication complained of was the sale by it of copies of the newspaper to individual customers], and that action having been settled, the plaintiffs cannot now claim damages from the defendants in respect of such publication. This principle applies to all other claims made and disposed of by action, or otherwise settled in the province of Manitoba or elsewhere.\nThe plaintiffs, however, contend that the publication by the defendants to the Imperial News Company Limited and its employees, complained of in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim in the present action, constitutes a separate tort for which the defendants are liable, and that it is an entirely different cause of action from those sued on in the Manitoba courts.\nI am of the opinion that the plaintiffs\u2019 contention is correct. Neither the Imperial News Company Limited nor any of the other parties sued in Manitoba is a party to the publication now complained of, and they are not joint tortfeasors with the defendants in respect of such publication. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the learned trial Judge was in error in non-suiting the plaintiffs, and that they are entitled to have the issue raised by paragraph 10 of their statement of claim tried.\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the present appellant by the Court of Appeal for Ontario3.\nBy the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was allowed and the action dismissed as against the appellant with costs throughout. Kerwin J. dissented.\nR.H. Greer K.C. and J.R. Cartwright K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.M. Bullen K.C. and R.M. Fowler for the respondents. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action for damages for libel against the appellant and his co-defendant Lichtman who are respectively described in the proceedings as the managing editor and the distributor of a newspaper called Hush which, it is shewn and admitted by everybody including the appellant, is (and has in Manitoba and elsewhere the reputation of being) a journal whose principal r\u00f4le is the publication of items of scandal, frequently prima facie libellous,\u2014the appellant himself asseverating that the publication of these items is in the interests of public morality.\nThe particulars of the libel, which was a peculiarly gross one, do not really concern us. At the material times, the paper was published weekly by the National Publishing Co., Ltd., of which the appellant says, in his examination for discovery that was put in evidence by the respondents, \u201cIt is my company.\u201d Lichtman was the general distributor,\u2014on what particular footing it does not appear. There is no evidence that he was, in point of law, the agent either of the appellant or of the publishing company.\nThere were two editions, a western and an eastern edition. The whole of the printing of both editions apparently \u201cwent to\u201d Lichtman as general distributor. As the libel appeared only in the western edition we are concerned with that edition alone.\nThe Imperial News Company at Winnipeg (of whom we shall speak as the Winnipeg distributors) were the sole distributors for Manitoba under an agreement with the publishers.\nLichtman shipped each week part of the issue destined for distribution in Winnipeg and its vicinity (greater Winnipeg) to the Winnipeg distributors direct and the residue for that province he shipped on behalf of the distributors to their retailer customers in the country, that is to say, outside of greater Winnipeg. The distributors settled with Lichtman, and the country retailers who received their shipments from Lichtman direct settled with the distributors, the unsold copies being returned or accounted for. We are solely concerned in this appeal with newspapers shipped by Lichtman to the distributors direct in Winnipeg.\nIn respect of the same libel, the respondents had brought actions and obtained judgments against the Winnipeg dis- tributors and against certain of their customers in Manitoba; and at the trial, a non-suit was granted on the ground that, by reason of these judgments, the respondents were precluded from recovering from the defendants in respect of the publications upon which the present action is based and which were established at the trial.\nI have had the advantage of reading and considering the judgment of Mr. Justice Davis and I agree with his conclusion and, in substance, with his reasoning as applied to the facts of this case; but there is a point of view from which the case before us may be regarded which I think it is not unimportant should be explained. From that point of view, it is essential to consider with some care the pleadings in the former action, the facts established in the record now before us, as well as what occurred at the trial and in the Court of Appeal.\nParagraph 10 of the statement of claim is in these words:\u2014\n10. The said defendants published the said article directly to the Imperial News Company Limited, which company is a wholesale vendor of newspapers throughout Western Canada, and to the servants and\/or employees of the said Imperial News Company Limited, namely, among others, R.J. Palmer, R. Halliley, M. McIntyre and W.J. Sinnot. The said defendants further delivered the said article to the above mentioned company and persons well knowing and intending that the above mentioned company and persons would and should re-deliver the said article to several hundred retail dealers, and well knowing and intending that such retail dealers would and should publish the said article to their individual customers. The natural and ordinary result of so delivering the said article was the re-delivery and sale of the said article. The said Imperial News Company Limited and\/or its servants and\/or employees did in fact re-deliver the said article to several hundred \u2018retail dealers and the said retail dealers did in fact sell and publish the said article to many thousand individuals throughout Ontario, Western Canada and British Columbia.\nAt the trial, counsel for the respondents principally relied upon the publication or publications alleged in the first sentence of this paragraph. It was contended that the respondents had proved publication of the libel to the Winnipeg distributors and to certain employees of the distributors and that this was a distinct publication in respect of which their right to recover was not affected by the judgment in the earlier proceedings because neither the Winnipeg distributors nor their employees could be held liable in respect of such publication. This, I repeat, was the main position upon which counsel for the plaintiffs at the trial rested as sustaining their right to sue, notwithstanding the previous judgments. Over and over again this is emphasized; for example:\u2014\nI do not think I can add anything other than to repeat that we are suing for something that could not have been the subject of a claim against the Imperial News Company. You cannot sue the recipient of a libel. We have a distinct publication, here from the defendants to the Imperial News Company and that is a distinct publication from the publication from the Imperial News Company to the retailers. As Gatley says, they are separate libels, and give a separate cause of action.\nThe point is that the publication with which the action is concerned is a publication in respect of which the Imperial News Company could not have been sued. It seems to be clear from the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal that this was the ground upon which the respondents\u2019 appeal to that court was based and upon which, as regards the appellant, the Court proceeded in granting a new trial. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario said:\u2014\nThe plaintiffs, however, contend that the publication by the defendants to the Imperial News Company, Limited, and its employees, complained of in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim in the present action, constitutes a separate tort for which the defendants are liable, and that it is an entirely different cause of action from those sued on in the Manitoba courts.\nI am of the opinion that the plaintiffs\u2019 contention is correct. Neither the Imperial News Company, Limited, nor any of the other parties sued in Manitoba is a party to the publication now complained of, and they are not joint tortfeasors with the defendants in respect of such publication. I am, therefore,, of the opinion that the learned trial judge was in error in non-suiting the plaintiffs, and that they are entitled to have the issue raised by paragraph 10 of their statement of claim tried.\nThe learned Chief Justice then proceeds to discuss paragraph 9, but only as affecting the respondents\u2019 right to recover as against Lichtman. On this appeal we need not consider that, as Lichtman does not appeal.\nIn this Court the respondents took a broader ground and contended as follows:\u2014\nIt is submitted further, that the defendants are liable for the publication of the libel alleged in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim by individual news vendors in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, who purchased copies of the issue of Hush dated December 17, 1981, from the Imperial News Company Limited, except in so far as such publications were the subject of claim in any actions in Manitoba against individual retail news vendors. The cause of action for such publications is not barred by the Manitoba actions.\nNo doubt (as respects news vendors in Manitoba) evidence was given in support of this claim at the trial and, no doubt also, it was put forth at the trial as a sort of addendum to the principal claim as already stated. It seems clear that the Court of Appeal did not regard this claim as open to the respondents as a separate claim. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario in his reasons for judgment treats the respondents\u2019 case against the appellant as resting solely upon a separate publication to Imperial News Company and their employees.\nThe respondents further contended in this Court that they are entitled to recover damages against the appellant in respect of publication by Lichtman to vendors having no connection with the Imperial News Company. This will be discussed later. At the trial, there was no suggestion of any right to recover in respect of any cause of action not set forth in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim, which is strictly limited to a claim in respect of newspapers delivered to Imperial News Company; nor does this argument appear to have been advanced in the Court of Appeal, although the learned Chief Justice of Ontario held the respondents were entitled to advance such a claim as against the defendant Lichtman under paragraph 9.\nBefore proceeding further, it is important to recall the relations between the publishers, the appellant and the Imperial News Company. The appellant was the owner, in the language of business, of the company publishing the newspaper, as well as the managing editor. With the publishers, the Winnipeg distributors had an agreement, in operation since 1930, under which they, as wholesalers, were the sole distributors in Manitoba, of the newspaper. They received weekly shipments from Lichtman, the general distributor, pursuant to this agreement and, in turn, sold to news vendors in greater Winnipeg, while Lichtman, on their behalf, shipped the newspapers direct to vendors in other places in the province. The publishers, the appellant and Lichtman were engaged in a joint commercial enterprise, the publication and distribution and ultimate sale of the newspaper. All their activities were designed for the sale of the newspaper to the public and the condition and aim of the whole enterprise was the purchase of the paper by the public. The shipments to the Winnipeg distributors were only one step in carrying out this business. The Winnipeg distributors, on the other hand, received delivery of newspapers from Lichtman pursuant to the agreement with the publishers and were parties directly concerned in the shipping of the papers to them, in the receipt of them by their employees, and in the distribution to the news vendors and in the sale of the papers to their customers.\nThomson, as managing editor, and Lichtman, as general distributor, knowing, as they did, the character of the paper, were responsible for the publication of any libel it might contain to the public as well as for any incidental publication of the libel which might occur in the ordinary course in the passage of the newspaper through the regular channels of distribution from the printer to the ultimate purchaser from the news vendor.\nAs regards the Winnipeg distributors, the plaintiffs in their statement of claim in their action against that company (paragraph 10) allege that\nthe defendant [the Imperial News Company] caused to be brought in to the city of Winnipeg many thousands of copies of the said publication, dated and designated \u201cVol. 4, No. 50, Toronto, December 17th, 1931,\u201d and thereupon on the 18th day of December, A.D. 1931, falsely and maliciously and with gross negligence and utterly careless and reckless as to the truth or falsehood of the article hereinafter set forth, published, sold and distributed many thousands of said copies to several scores of retail news vendors in the cities of Winnipeg and St. Boniface, and the municipalities adjacent thereto.\nThese newspapers, which the Imperial News Company \u201ccaused to be brought\u201d to themselves in Winnipeg and which they sold and distributed amongst the retail news vendors of greater Winnipeg, were brought to Winnipeg and distributed pursuant to the arrangement and with the object already mentioned; and pursuant also to an established course of business that had been proceeding for at least a year when the publication occurred which is complained of in this action. The Winnipeg distributors, it is admitted, were fully aware of the character of the paper, that it contained items prima facie libellous, and it was not the practice to take any measures to verify the facts stated. They were, in a word, participants jointly with the publishers and with the appellant and Lichtman in the shipments to themselves, in the distribution to the news vendors and in the sale to the public. They were, consequently, responsible for any publication which ensued in the ordinary course from their co-operation in this enterprise; in having the papers delivered to themselves as well as in the further distribution of them. They were, of course, (apart from their participation in the enterprise as a whole) in view of their knowledge, responsible for every publication of the libel to their employees as well as to others occurring in the ordinary course after these papers came into their possession. And, of course, since such publication was the direct result of the co-operative acts of the publishers, the appellant and themselves, they were responsible jointly with the appellant.\nIt is necessary to consider now with a little more particularity the pleadings in the respondents\u2019 action against the Imperial News Company. By the statement of claim it is alleged that the defendants in that action have been for several years the sole and exclusive wholesale agent and wholesale vendor for Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and Western Canada for a publication called Hush; and that, as such wholesale agent and vendor, they have distributed and published weekly for over two years hundreds of thousands of copies of Hush each week, selling them to a large number of retail news vendors; that the defendants well knew that Hush was likely to contain grossly defamatory matter and that it was the duty of the defendants to take great care in verifying the truthfulness of the \u201cpersonal news and statements\u201d therein contained; that\nthe defendant caused to be brought in to the city of Winnipeg many thousands of copies of the said publication, dated and designated \u201cVol. 4, No. 50, Toronto, December 17th, 1931,\u201d and thereupon on the 18th day of December, A.D. 1931, falsely and maliciously and with gross negligence and utterly careless and reckless as to the truth or falsehood of the article hereinafter set forth, published, sold and distributed many thousands of said copies to several scores of retail news vendors in the cities of Winnipeg and St. Boniface, and the municipalities adjacent thereto.\n* * *\n12. The said article was falsely, maliciously, recklessly, carelessly, shamelessly and wantonly published as aforesaid of and concerning the plaintiffs by the defendant, who was callously indifferent and reckless as to whether said article was true or not, and who took no care or caution as to whether said article was true or not.\nBy their defence the Imperial News Company denied all these allegations (par. 1) and alleged as follows:\u2014\n5. In the alternative, and by way of defence to the whole of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the defendant says that it is a wholesale bookseller and news vendor carrying on business as such on a very extensive scale in the province of Manitoba, and in many other cities throughout the Dominion of Canada. The defendant\u2019s servants in the course of their employment in the defendant\u2019s service received the newspaper containing the words complained of in the amended statement of claim from the owners and publishers thereof, the said National Publishing Company Limited, 52 McCaul street, Toronto, as referred to in paragraph 6 of the amended statement of claim and it was thereupon sold by the said defendant in the ordinary course of the defendant\u2019s business and without any knowledge of its contents including the libel complained of innocently and without intent to defame. Neither the defendant nor any of its servants or agents knew at the time when they sold the said newspaper that it contained, or was likely to contain, any libel on the plaintiffs, or either of them. It was not by negligence on the part of the defendant or any of its servants or agents that they did not know that there was any libel in the said newspaper nor did the defendant nor any of its servants or agents know that said newspaper was of such a character that it was likely to contain any libellous matter, nor ought the defendant or any of its servants or agents to have known it, wherefore the defendant says that it never published the said libel.\n6. In the alternative, and by way of defence to the whole of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the defendant says that if it sold any copies of the newspaper containing the libel complained of, which is not admitted but denied, it did so without negligence on the part of itself or any of its servants or agents and in the ordinary course of its business as a wholesale news vendor handling and distributing many hundreds of different newspapers and periodicals. The defendant did not know and had no ground for suspecting that the newspaper complained of was likely to contain libellous matter.\nImmediately upon receiving notice from the plaintiffs that the said newspaper in question contained the matter complained of the defendant withdrew the said newspaper from sale. Under the circumstances above set out the defendant contends that it did not publish the said libel.\n* * *\n8. In the further alternative, and by way of defence to the whole of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the defendant alleges that it was innocent of any knowledge of the libel contained in the newspaper complained of, that there was nothing in the said newspaper or the circumstances under which it came to the defendant or was sold by it which ought to have led the defendant to suppose that it contained the libel and that when the said newspaper was disseminated by the defendant it was not by any negligence on the part of the defendant that it did not know that the said paper contained a libel, wherefore the defendant says that it did not publish the said libel.\nThe respondents\u2019 allegations of fact having been denied by the defendant Imperial News Company, it was not only material, but necessary, in support of those allegations to prove the course of business as between the publishers and the appellant on the one hand and the defendants in that action on the other. In support of the allegation that the defendants had \u201ccaused to be brought\u201d the issue of the 17th of December to them at Winnipeg to be distributed by them, it would be material to present to the jury the history of the relations between the Toronto people and the Winnipeg people, including the agreement by which the defendants had been for more than a year prior to the publication of the libel the sole and exclusive distributors of the newspaper for Manitoba and the nature of the arrangements, as indicating that the profits of all would depend upon the volume of purchases by the public.\nThe defence by its allegations, which were put in issue by the respondents, of ignorance of the general character of the paper, of ignorance in particular of the presence of the libel in the issue of December 17th, and of innocence generally, made it not only material for the respondents, as plaintiffs, but most important for their case, to establish the fact proved in the present litigation that actual knowledge of the presence of the libel in that issue had been gained by employees of the Winnipeg distributors, including Sinnott, who was the general manager as well as the statutory attorney, in course of the distribution of the paper. Moreover, it was part of the respondents\u2019 case against the defendants that they continued the publication of the libel after the presence of it had come to Sinnott\u2019s knowledge. In these circumstances, it is proper to presume that evidence of Sinnott\u2019s knowledge was put before the jury in that action. It will be observed also that the respondents\u2019 case presented on these pleadings was that the defendants, in their capacity as the Winnipeg distributors, pursuant to the established course of business between them and the publishers of the newspaper, \u201ccaused to be brought\u201d to themselves in Winnipeg the copies destined for distribution among the news vendors in Winnipeg, that they did this with full knowledge of the character of the newspaper and that they sold and distributed thousands of copies of it to news vendors. It is perfectly true they allege that the libel was published to the news vendors, but they allege also that, with full knowledge of the character of the paper, the defendants, in their character as the Winnipeg distributors, sold and delivered many thousands of copies to such news vendors; and the defendants, having denied their knowledge of the presence of the libel, and this denial having been put in issue by the plaintiffs, the case, taken as a whole as presented to the jury, was not merely a publication of the libel to the news vendors, it was the sale and delivery to some scores of news vendors of many thousands of copies of the newspaper with full knowledge of its character and with knowledge of the presence of the libel in it.\nParagraph 10 of the statement of claim in this action alleges publication to the distributors and their servants, but the libel could only be published to the distributors in the strict sense by being brought to the knowledge of somebody whose knowledge was theirs. No doubt Sinnott, who was the attorney for the Company in Manitoba, stood in such a relation to the distributors that his knowledge was their knowledge and in that sense there was publication to the distributors; but the wrongful act was publication to Sinnott; and in respect of that the publishers and the appellant became joint tortfeasors for the reasons which sufficiently appear from what has already been said.\nIf publication to Sinnott constituted in any relevant sense publication to the Imperial News Company, there are not two separate publications. They are one and the same fact and, in respect of publication to Sinnott, the distributors were responsible for all the damages. If the respondents cannot maintain an action for the publication to Sinnott they are not helped, I think, by describing the same fact as publication to the Imperial News Company.\nThe parties must be taken to have contemplated the ordinary course of business. The bundles received by the Winnipeg distributors in Winnipeg would be opened and, to employ the phrase used by the witnesses, \u201cparcelled out\u201d for distribution to the retail news vendors. In course of this operation, the contents of the paper would naturally become known to servants of the company and for that, and for all other similar incidental publications, as well as for the ultimate publication to the public, all parties were jointly responsible. If the whole consignment to the Winnipeg distributors had been destroyed before any copy saw the light of day, there would, of course, have been no publication in respect of that consignment; but the proper conclusion from the facts proved is that the papers were distributed and reached the public in the ordinary course as expected and intended. I am unable, therefore, with respect, to agree with the Court of Appeal that the cause of action alleged in paragraph 10 is not one in respect of which the Imperial News Company were liable at the suit of the respondent. They were liable for every publication ensuing upon their act, which was the joint act of themselves and the publishers and the appellant in bringing the newspapers to themselves at Winnipeg, and jointly liable; and this applies to every act of delivery and publication alleged in paragraph 10.\nParagraph 10, in addition to the allegation of publication of the libel to the Imperial News Company and their servants, alleges delivery of it to them with knowledge and intention that it would be redelivered to retail news vendors and by them published to their customers and that it was so published. As already observed, the Chief Justice of Ontario, in his reasons delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court, implies that a separate and distinct cause of action founded on these allegations is not open to the respondents; and it should be stated that the evidence is that a consignment of the issue of December 17th containing the article was \u201ccaused to be brought\u201d to them at Winnipeg by the Imperial News Company, as the exclusive distributors in Winnipeg, pursuant to previous arrangements with the publishers, the appellant and an established course of business; and that, pursuant to those arrangements and that course of business, this consignment was distributed to the news vendor customers and by them sold to the public; unsold copies being returned. Publication to the Imperial News Company, if there was such, consisted in the incidental publication to the servants of that company as the paper passed through their hands on its way to the public through the news vendors. That is the case established at the trial and no refinement of pleading can give it a different character. I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that no separate cause of action is available in respect of any publications resulting from the sale and delivery of the newspapers by the Imperial News Company to the news vendors for the reasons I am about to mention.\nThe respondents\u2019 case in their action against the Imperial News Company having been such as has already been stated, and the Imperial News Company having been jointly responsible with the appellant and the publishers for bringing into Winnipeg and having in their possession there thousands of copies of the issue of Decem- ber 17th containing the libel complained of and for distribution and delivery of those copies with knowledge of the general character of the publication and of the presence of the libel to their customers, the news vendors, the facts which must be presumed to have been established in that case (since they were not only material to the plaintiffs\u2019 case but necessary to enable the plaintiffs to succeed in the issues presented upon the pleadings) constituted a sufficient foundation for recovery by the respondents of damages in respect of all publications which followed in the normal course as the direct or ordinarily incidental result of all those acts which they did in co-operation with the publishers and with the appellant. In these circumstances, I cannot think the respondents would have been permitted to proceed with a second action against the Imperial News Company to recover damages for the publication alleged in paragraph 10 although that paragraph, as we have seen, alleges publication and delivery in respect of which that company would have been jointly liable with the publishers and the appellant.\nThe parties were jointly concerned in a common enterprise, beginning with the bringing of the newspapers to Winnipeg and ending with the sale of them to the public. All these publications were involved in the execution of the business in which they were jointly engaged. I do not think that a cause of action arising out of the delivery of the papers to the news vendors in carrying out that business can be substantially separated from the cause of action alleged in paragraph 10.\nThe analogy between the delivery of a consignment of newspapers to the Imperial News Company for distribution among news vendors, or of a parcel of newspapers to a news vendor, and the delivery of an article by an author to an editor, is a wholly false one. The editor exercises an independent judgment determined by the character of the article. We are here in the presence of a wholly different situation, where a consignment of newspapers is dealt with as a commercial commodity and not otherwise. The analogy might be closer if a case could be adduced in which there was an arrangement between a writer of scurrilous articles and a publisher by which the publisher became the sole and exclusive publisher and distributor of such articles; but we have been referred to no such case.\nIt would, in my opinion, be an abuse of substantial justice to permit the respondents to proceed against the Imperial News Company in another action in respect of the publication now sued upon. And since the Imperial News Company were jointly liable with the publishers and the appellant for these publications, it follows, I think, that proceedings against the appellant must also fail.\nAs to the contention that the respondents are entitled to recover as against the appellant under paragraph 9 as amended in accordance with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. First of all, it seems to me clear that the learned Chief Justice of Ontario had no intention of authorizing an amendment except for the purpose of enabling the respondents to advance a claim against the defendant Lichtman, with whom we are not concerned on this appeal. Second, the amendment is only incidental to the judgment ordering a new trial on the ground that, at the trial and under the pleadings as they stood, the plaintiffs had established a cause of action against the defendants. As that judgment is to be reversed as respects the appellant, the ancillary order cannot affect him. The Court of Appeal had no intention of ordering a new trial solely for the purpose of enabling the plaintiffs to recover on a fresh cause of action.\nThe Court of Appeal acted upon a rule of practice, the effect of which appears to be that, when a defendant obtains in the case of a trial with a jury a judgment which is in effect a judgment of nonsuit, the defendant must abide by the evidence given as if it were the only evidence available. Under that rule I should have thought the plaintiff must be similarly bound, and, on the new trial for the assessment of damages alone, I cannot quite understand how under such a rule the plaintiff could justly be permitted to advance a wholly new cause of action not put forward at the first trial and not open to him on the pleadings. The limitation, I should have thought, must bind both the plaintiff and defendant.\nHowever that may be, I desire to say that I express no opinion on the question whether such a rule of practice could properly prevail against a statutory enactment re- quiring (in the absence of consent to the contrary) actions for libel to be tried by a jury. The observations of Lord Esher in Attorney-General v. Emerson4 are not without pertinency.\nAs to whether this question could be debated in this Court, the rule was laid down by the Court thirty years ago in Lamb v. Kincaid5 in these words:\u2014\nA court of appeal * * * should not give effect to such a point taken for the first time in appeal, unless it be clear that, had the question been raised at the proper time, no further light could have been thrown upon it.\nThe distinction is a familiar one between failure to take a point and failure to adduce all the arguments in support of a point when taken, even when it is only foreshadowed. Among the authorities in which this distinction is noticed, the judgment of Lord Bramwell in Borrowman v. Free6, cited in Lamb v. Kincaid5, may be referred to.\nI have treated the question of the effect of the evidence in determining the existence or non-existence of a cause of action as a question of fact for the Court of Appeal under the rule there followed; as the Court of Appeal itself did.\nThe judgment of Cannon, Crocket and Davis JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014The appellant was the managing editor of Hush, a weekly newspaper published in Toronto by a joint stock company, The National Publishing Company, Limited, in two editions, one for Ontario and eastern Canada and the other for Manitoba and western Canada. The western edition of December 17th, 1931, contained a false defamatory statement of the respondents (husband and wife) who resided at St. Boniface, in the province of Manitoba. It was a case of mistaken identity, but, none the less, a reckless and cruel libel against two perfectly innocent persons.\nLiability for libel does not depend on the intention of the defamer; but on the fact of defamation. as said by Russell, L.J., (as he then was) in Cassidy v. Daily Mirror Newspapers Ltd.7\nSamuel Lichtman of Toronto, who was one of the defendants in this action, was the general distributor of the western edition and the Imperial News Company, Limited, of Winnipeg, was the sole distributor for Manitoba and also distributed copies to retail news dealers in Saskatchewan and Alberta. That company distributed about 11,000 copies of the issue of December 17th, 1931, to some 350 or 400 retail news dealers who in turn sold to the public.\nThe respondents commenced an action in the Manitoba courts against the Imperial News Company, Limited, for damages for the libel and carried the action down to judgment. While the evidence in that case is not before us or the addresses to the jury or the Judge\u2019s charge, it is not unreasonable to assume that the case was developed at the trial at least as widely as set up in the pleadings, which were filed as an exhibit in this action. The following extracts are taken from the statement of claim in that action:\n3. * * * The plaintiff, Leon Lambent, * * * is widely known and has a large circle of friends and acquaintances throughout Manitoba, British Columbia. Alberta and Ontario, and is particularly well known in the city of Winnipeg, which adjoins the said city of St. Boniface, and in the said city of St. Boniface.\n4. * * * The plaintiff, Mary Lambert, has a large number of friends and acquaintances throughout Western Canada and is also well known in the city of Toronto, in the province of Ontario, where a number of her relatives reside.\n6. The defendant is and has been for several years the sole and exclusive wholesale agent and wholesale vendor for Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and Western Canada for a publication called Hush, * * * issued every Thursday by the National Publishing Company, Limited, 52 McCaul street, Toronto. As such wholesale agents and vendors the defendant distributes and publishes and has distributed and published weekly, for over two years, hundreds of thousands of copies of said Hush each week, selling them to a large number of retail news vendors throughout all the principal cities of Canada, particularly in Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver.\n10. Under the conditions and circumstances set forth in paragraphs 5 to 9, both inclusive, next preceding, the defendant caused to be brought in to the city of Winnipeg many thousands of copies of the said publication, dated and designated \u201cVol. 4, No. 50, Toronto, December 17th, 1931,\u201d and thereupon on the 18th day of December, A.D. 1931, falsely and maliciously and with gross negligence and utterly careless and reckless as to the truth or falsehood of the article hereinafter set forth, published, sold and distributed many thousands of said copies to several scores of retail news vendors in the cities of Winnipeg and St. Boniface, and the municipalities adjacent thereto, the names of many of which retail news vendors the plaintiffs are ready, willing and able to furnish to the defendant on request, three of said retail news vendors being United Cigar Stores Ltd., Western. News Agency Limited and Service Drug\nStore.\n24. In consequence of the said article and the words and language thereof and the publication thereof by the defendant as aforesaid the plaintiffs and each of them have been greatly injured in character and reputation and have been brought into public scandal, hatred, contempt,\nridicule and odium.\n25. Each of the plaintiffs therefore by reason of the matters set forth claims damages to the extent of $10,000.\nThe jury found for the respondents and awarded to each of them $1,500 damages. These amounts, together with costs taxed and allowed at $508.05, were duly paid.\nShortly after the institution of that action, the respondents commenced a second action in Manitoba against United Cigar Stores, Limited, in respect of the sales of\nthe paper in the several stores of that company. The claim was set out in somewhat similar language to that in the first action. This case was settled by payment 'by the defendant to the respondents of $2,000 damages and costs\nof $700.\nA third action was instituted in Manitoba by the respondents against the Roberts Drug Store, Limited, and Arthur John Roberts in respect of the sales of the paper\nin their stores. This action was taken to trial and the respondents obtained a judgment for $100 and $50 respectively, but, because of a larger payment into court with the defence and the disposition of costs, no actual\nrecovery resulted.\nThe respondents commenced ten or twelve further actions in Manitoba against different store proprietors or news agencies and subsequently made settlements and gave releases on payment of sums running from $25 to $200 each, apparently depending on what the traffic would bear. When the husband respondent was asked how many actions he had brought altogether, he said:\u2014\ntwelve or thirteen, something like that. * * * I can't tell exactly, there is so many. * * * I can\u2019t tell to-day. It was my lawyer, I didn't bother with it.\nThe respondents then came into Ontario and brought to trial in May, 1936, this action which they had commenced in Ontario by a writ issued in March, 1932. The basis of this action was what was regarded as a sort of residuum from the litigation in the, West, treating the sending of the western edition (of the particular date in question) in bundles by the publishing company, or its distributor, Lichtman, from Toronto to the said Imperial News Company, Limited, in Winnipeg, as a separate and independent cause of action in respect of which an additional amount of damages could be recovered over and above the recoveries that had been made in the several western actions. There is no evidence that anyone within Ontario saw the article. The basis of the claim, as put in the respondents' factum, is that the article was published\nto the Imperial News Company Limited of Winnipeg and to William James Sinnott, the manager of that company, and to various employees of that company including one Richard Halliley.\nThe action was originally brought against the publishing company as well as against the appellant Thomson and Samuel Lichtman. For some reason the action, before the delivery of the statement of claim, was formally discontinued by the respondents against the publishing company.\nAt the trial the respondents were non-suited upon the ground that the defendants Thomson and Lichtmen had been joint tortfeasors with the parties who had been sued in Manitoba. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario gave judgment against the two defendants Thomson and Lichtman and directed a new trial limited to the assessment of damages. Lichtman did not appeal, but\nThomson did.\nI would allow the appeal of Thomson upon the ground that there was a complete remedy for the respondents in the court in which the first action was started. Collins, M.R. (with whom Stirling, L.J., concurred) in Williams v. Hunt[1], said:\u2014\nWhere proceedings have been started, it is an abuse of the process of the court to divide the remedy where there is a complete remedy in the court in which the suit was first started. It may be observed that in a very recent case in England,\nMarchant v. Ford and others[2],, the plaintiff brought an action for libel against the defendant Ford, the author of a novel which the plaintiff alleged was a libel upon him, and in the same action he joined as defendants the printers and the publishers of the novel and also the printers of an illustrated advertising wrapper in which the book was sold. In Barber v. Pidgen[3], it was said that each publication of the same slander constituted a separate cause of action, but that was said in relation to the argument that the jury's verdict was not a valid one because separate damages were not awarded in respect of each publication complained of in the statement of claim; but, the jury having been asked, without objection, to give one verdict in respect of all the occasions on which the defamatory words were spoken, the defendants were disentitled to take the point that the jury should have been asked for a separate award of damages in respect of each publication.\nNo one would deny the respondents their remedy to repair the injury done to their rights of reputation by the publication of false and defamatory statements concerning them. But, as Maugham, L.J., (as he then was) recently said in the Court of Appeal in Ley v. Hamilton[4] :-\nIt would, indeed, be an ill day for the public and the courts if a libel action came to be looked upon in the light of a gold-digging operation.\nThe respondents should not be permitted to go on suing one person after another ad infinitum where a complete remedy was available in one action. The law is well employed when it puts an end to just such actions as this. Fry, L.J., in Macdougall v. Knight[5] said:\u2014 }\nThe injustice of allowing a litigant to select one portion of a libel 1 as the ground for 'one action and another as the ground for a second action, and so on indefinitely, is obvious. The whole publication would be before the jury in each case, and it would be quite impossible for the jury in each case to separate the damages due to the particular part of the libel relied on in that case from the damages arising from other parts of the libel. I think, therefore, that a plea of res judicata would succeed, and that we are bound to stay the action. Suppose, however, this to be otherwise, still, in such a case, I do not hesitate to say that such successive actions in respect of the same libel would be an abuse of the process of the court, and so, quacunque vi\u00e2 the application should succeed, and the action be stayed.\nIn the United States the law appears to be the same, that successive actions for the same libel would be an abuse of the process of the court. Galligan v. Sun Printing & Publishing Ass'n.[6].\nIn Brunsden v. Humphrey[7], Lord Justice Bowen referred to what Lord Coke had said in a note to Ferrer's case[8]: It has been well said, interest republicae ut sit finis litium, otherwise great oppression might be done under colour and pretence of law.\nThe jurisdiction to dismiss such an action as this exists as part of the inherent power of the court over its own process.\nIt is contended that, as the question of libel or no libel is for a jury, the court cannot, except by consent of the parties, determine that question. But the defamatory\nmatter complained of in this action is the same article in the same issue of the same newspaper that formed the basis of the Manitoba actions. The question of libel or no libel went to the jury in at least the first of those actions, that against Imperial News Company, Limited, above mentioned. But there was never any real question that there had not been a libel; it was sought to be excused upon the ground of a mistaken identity and a retraction.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial dismissing the action against the appellant should be restored, with costs to the appellant throughout.\nKERWIN J. (dissenting).\u2014At the trial of this action for damages for libel brought by the respondents against Thomson as editor and Lichtman as distributor of a weekly newspaper known as Hush, a motion for nonsuit was made at the close of the plaintiffs' case by counsel for each defendant and was granted.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the plaintiffs' appeal and ordered a new trial, confined to the question of damages against the defendants, with liberty to the plaintiffs to amend paragraph 9 of their statement of claim, which paragraph contained an averment against Lichtman only. The defendant, Thomson, now appeals to this Court.\nThe libel complained of appeared in the issue of Hush dated December 17th, 1931, and the respondents secured judgments or settlements in certain actions in the courts of Manitoba for damages for libel based upon the same article in the same issue. The appellant contends that he was a joint tortfeasor with the defendants in the Manitoba actions, and it was upon this ground that the nonsuit was granted. In the first action brought by the respondents in Manitoba, the defendant was Imperial News Company, Limited and the publication complained of consisted of the and distribution of the newspaper by the defendant to various retail news dealers in Winnipeg and adjoining territory. Judgment was entered for each respondent for $1,500 damages and costs, which were paid. In the second action, the respondents sued United Cigar Stores, Limited, and the publication there alleged was the sale by the defendant to members of the public. The action was settled by the payment of $2,000 and $700 costs, and a release was given to the defendant. The defendant in the third action in Manitoba was Roberts Drug Stores, Limited, and the publication alleged was the sale of the newspaper by the defendant to members of the public. It appears that because the defendant had paid into court more than the amount of damages awarded, the defendant's costs were set off against the damages. Various other actions were commenced by the respondents against other retail vendors, and these actions were settled or abandoned.\nIn the present litigation, the respondents, by their statement of claim, allege publication by appellant to \" Imperial News Company Limited * * and to the servants and\/or employees of the said Imperial News Company Limited \"; and that is the only publication alleged against appellant. The distinction in fact between a publication by Imperial News Company, Limited, or retail news vendors and a publication by the appellant to Imperial News Company, Limited, and the servants and\/or employees of that company, is obvious, but it is argued that that distinction cannot avail in an action based on a libel in a newspaper. In such a case, appellant contends, there can be in law but one publication, since, so far as the appearance of the libel in the newspaper is concerned, the writer of it, the editor, the printer, the distributor, and the retail vendors are all engaged in the common purpose of producing an article and distributing it to the\npublic.\nThe fallacy in that argument is that it overlooks the foundation of the action for damages for libel. The material part of the cause of action is not the writing\nbut the publication of the libel, and for the definition of \" publication \" the words of Lord Esher in Pullman et al. Hill and Co.[9] have always been relied on:\u2014\nThe making known the defamatory matter after it has been written to some person other than the person of whom it is written.\nIf one suppose a case where two people collaborate to write a libelous statement and go together, and deliver it, to a third person,\u2014that might be taken to be the combined, the joint action, of the two so as to give the libeled party an action for one publication only. But there may be distinct publications of the same libel by two individuals and for each publication the aggrieved party has a separate cause of action against each individual. The question then remains, was the appellant a joint tortfeasor with the defendants in the Manitoba actions?\nThe difficulty of defining the expression \" joint tortfeasors \" is shown in the judgments in The Koursk[10]. That was an admiralty case, but the common law as to what constituted a joint tortfeasor was considered, and the prior decisions wherein the point is referred to are set out and examined and they need not here be repeated. At page 151 Lord Justice Bankes states the result to be:\u2014\nThat in order to constitute a joint tort there must be some connection between the act of the one alleged tortfeasor and that of the other.\nAt page 157 Lord Justice Scrutton concludes:\u2014\nTo make the tort, you want a wrongful act causing damage; and to make the tort the same cause of action, both elements must be the same.\nAnd at pages 159-160 Lord Justice Sargant puts it thus:\u2014\nThere must be a concurrence in the act or acts causing damage, not merely a coincidence of separate acts which by their conjoined effect cause damage.\nApplying these principles to the present case, it is evident that with reference to this newspaper the appellant was responsible for the publications effected by the defendants in the Manitoba actions, but there was no connection between the acts of those defendants and the acts of the appellant. The publication set forth in this action occurred without any of those defendants taking part in it. The pleading here avers a cause of action different from any set forth in the proceedings in the Manitoba courts, and evidence was led by the respondents to substantiate the allegation. This being so, the judgments and settlements in Manitoba are not bars to the present action. Brunsden v. Humphrey[11]; Bulmer Rayon Company Limited v. Freshwater[12].\nIt was objected that there can be no publication to Imperial News Company Limited, a corporation, but no difficulty is raised, in my opinion, by this objection, as the evidence discloses publication to employees of the corporation and it is merely a convenient method of alleging publication, when a letter is addressed to a corporation or, as in the case at bar, a newspaper is sent to it, and opened and read by its employees. Nor is there any substance in the contention that, what was proved being a publication in Manitoba, it is necessarily a publication by the company to its own employees. The receipt of the paper by the company is proved by the receipt of it by the company's employees. There was no evidence, it is true, of any publication to Palmer and Maclntyre, two of the company's employees mentioned in paragraph 10 of the statement of claim, but evidence was given of the reading of the article complained of by, and hence the publication to, the other two employees mentioned, and that is all we are concerned with.\nThe only remaining point 'raised was that any publication proved occurred in Manitoba, and it was argued that there was no evidence that such a publication would be wrongful according to the laws of that province. It was long ago settled that in the absence of proof to the contrary, general foreign law is presumed to be the same as the common law of England. Smith v. Gould[13], and that principle has been applied in many cases in this Court.\nIf these conclusions were concurred in by the other members of the Court, they would be sufficient to confirm the order of the Court of Appeal setting aside the nonsuit as regards the appellant and directing a new trial, and it would then be necessary to consider the appellant's contention that the new trial should not be restricted, so far as he is concerned, to an assessment of damages. In view of the fact that I am alone in my views as to the main question, I refrain from investigating the subsidiary one.\nHowever, I desire to express, with deference, my dissent from the opinion that, in the circumstances of this case, the respondents, residents of Manitoba, were obliged to join the appellant, a resident of Ontario, as a defendant any of the Manitoba actions and add a claim against him based on an entirely different cause of action, at the risk (in failing to do so) of ascertaining when they bring an action on such separate cause of action in the jurisdiction where the appellant does reside, that their rights have been lost. We have not had the advantage of the views of the Courts below on the point. A perusal of the record shows that it was not raised before the trial judge and from the fact that it is not mentioned in the judgments in the Court of Appeal, I presume that it was not argued there.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae, Greer & Cart Wright.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McMaster, Montgomery, Fleury & Co.\n1 [1937] O.R. 341; [1937] 2 D.L.R. 662.\n2 [1937] O.R. 341; [1937]2 D.L.R. 662.\n3 [1937] 2 D.L.R. 673.\n4 (1889) 24 Q.B.D. 56, at 58.\n5 (1907) 38 Can.

During the descent, the infant plaintiff fell and caught his hand between the side of the moving steps and the unmoving side wall of the escalator, the hand remaining caught while he was carried to the bottom of the escalator and until after the escalator was stopped. Plaintiffs alleged (inter alia) that the escalator was negligently constructed and maintained.\nEvidence was given at the trial of inspections of the escalator by Government inspectors and of the granting of permits to operate it, under the provisions of the Elevator and Hoist Act, Man., 1919, c. 31, and regulations thereunder. Certain permits issued, with certificates thereon of re-inspection, were, against objection by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, admitted in evidence. It was further shown that on the morning after the accident a government inspector had made a further inspection, and a statement in his report thereon, that \u201cthe escalator was in good order and in perfect control\u201d was, against objection by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, read to the jury. After the evidence at the trial had been completed, the judge and jury went to the store and took a view of the escalator both at rest and in operation. It was admitted that it was then in the same condition as at the time of the accident. Following the Judge\u2019s charge the jury brought in a verdict denying negligence in defendant, and the action was dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (44 Man. R. 256) ordered a new trial, on the ground that the permits, and the inspector\u2019s report after the accident, had been improperly admitted in evidence, and further that part of the Judge\u2019s charge to the jury amounted to misdirection in law. Defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Crocket J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer curiam: The escalator was within the provisions of said Elevator and Hoist Act, and the said permits put in evidence were relevant and admissible.\nPer Duff C.J., Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: The statement read to the jury from the inspector\u2019s report after the accident was not admissible; its use was not justified under s. 31 of the Manitoba Evidence Act (Man., 1933, c. 11). Further, there was misdirection in the trial Judge\u2019s charge to the jury, in that he did not sufficiently differentiate the defendant\u2019s duty to a small child from its duty towards an adult, and, on the contrary, led the jury to believe that there was some duty to take care incumbent upon the child.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis J.: Having regard to the facts that, upon the evidence and the law, the child was not a trespasser, he was permitted to use the escalator, and on account of Ms age was incapable of negligence, the trial Judge\u2019s charge to the jury beclouded the child\u2019s legal position. Further, there should have been put clearly and fully to the jury the question as to the defendant\u2019s reasonable care, in permitting the child to use the escalator, in permitting such use without an attendant of defendant being present and without some means of immediately stopping the escalator when the child fell and got his hand caught. The real problem in the case was not put to the jury.\nPer Duff C.J.: On the issue raised by the allegation of negligence in construction and maintenance of the escalator, defendant was entitled to show compliance with the government regulations; and it is impossible to say that the facts of inspection and the issue of permits in the usual way had not some relevancy to that issue; further, even if the government department charged with the administration of the Elevator and Hoist Act had been in error in proceeding upon the footing that escalators are within the contemplation of the Act, nevertheless the facts of inspection and issue of permits by the department, in accordance with the duty imposed upon it under the departmental construction of the Act, would be equally relevant to the said issue. As to the inspector\u2019s report on inspection after the accident: It is plainly not a public document within Lord Blackburn\u2019s exposition in Sturla v. Freccia, 5 App. Cas. 623; and it is not made evidence by s. 31 of the Manitoba Evidence Act. No copy of entry should be received in evidence under s. 31 unless the proof offered identifies the book or other record in which the entry appears in such a manner as to enable the court to see dearly that the entry is one within the purview of the enactment. Further, only by a forced and non-natural reading of s. 31 can it be made to comprehend such a document as that in question; to admit the document as evidence of the facts of which it speaks, would give to s. 31 such a scope as to accomplish, in respect of documents on file in offices connected with any of the public services of the country, a fundamental change in the rules and principles of evidence. Enactments of the character of s. 31, which introduce a general exception to the rules of evidence, depriving the parties to legal proceedings of the usual safeguards in respect of evidence, should be strictly limited in their application to cases which are unmistakeably within their real intendment as well as within the literal meaning of the words employed.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting): From the evidence, the only possible ground upon which the jury could have attributed the child\u2019s injury to negligence charged against defendant was that the clearance between its moving steps and its stationary skirting was too wide. The crucial issue for decision, as the case was tried, was whether or not that clearance created a danger for young children of which defendant knew or ought to have known and have guarded against. The trial Judge made this issue clear to the jury. The jury having, after hearing the evidence, inspected the escalator and seen it in operation\u2014it being then in the same condition as at the time of the accident\u2014and having specifically found defendant not guilty of any negligence which caused the injury, it cannot be said that in the circumstances any substantial wrong or miscarriage was or could have been occasioned by any of the grounds complained of by respondents. Though, in view of the provisions of ss. 5 (a) and 50A of the Manitoba Factories Act ((R.S.M., 1913, c. 70, as amended), the extract from the inspector\u2019s report made after the accident might not be competent, it could not be said that its admission could have occasioned any substantial wrong or miscarriage within the meaning of s. 28 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act (Man., 1033, c. 6). As to the complaint that the trial Judge did not sufficiently differentiate defendant\u2019s duty to a small child from its duty towards an adult, the trial Judge made it clear to the jury that no negligence on the part of the mother could affect the child\u2019s right of recovery, and nothing that he said in reference to the child\u2019s own conduct, independently of his mother, could have had any influence upon the jury in relation to the crucial issue for decision above mentioned. Therefore a new trial on the alleged ground of misdirection would be barred by said s. 28 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act. The judgment at trial should foe restored. APPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], which allowed the plain-tiffs\u2019 appeal from and against the jury\u2019s verdict at trial (which denied negligence in defendant) and the judgment directed to be entered pursuant thereto by the trial Judge (Dysart J.), and set aside the said judgment at trial and ordered a new trial.\nThe action was to recover damages because of injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff (then four years and one month old) on April 19, 1933, when, along with his mother and a younger brother, he was on an escalator proceeding from the main floor to the basement floor of the defendant\u2019s departmental store in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The infant plaintiff fell and his hand got caught in the narrow space between the moving steps or treads of the escalator and its stationary side wall, and in that situation he was carried on down to the foot of the structure where the hand came in contact with the floor, and before he was released he was severely injured. The plaintiffs alleged that the injuries were caused as a result of the negligence of the defendant in (inter alia) the escalator being negligently constructed and maintained, and, as stated in the judgments now reported, the real question for decision at the trial, upon the pleadings and as the evidence developed, was whether or not the space between the wall and the moving part of the escalator created a danger for young children, of which danger the defendant either knew or ought to have known and have guarded against more effectively.\nThe grounds for the said judgment of the Court of Appeal (ordering a new trial) were, that there was improper admission in evidence of certain government permits, and certificates indorsed thereon, with respect to the escalator, based upon government inspection, and of a report made upon inspection by a government inspector on the morning of the next day after the day of the accident; and that there was misdirection in the trial Judge\u2019s charge to the jury.\nBy the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Crocket J. dissenting.\nT. N. Phelan K.C. and B. O\u2019Brien for the appellant.\nE. K. Williams K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the conclusion as well as in the reasoning of my brother Hudson as well as those of my brother Davis, but I desire to add one or two observations upon the points raised as to the admissibility of the permits and of the report of the inspector of the 24th of April, 1933.\nFirst then, as to the admissibility of the permits. Agreeing, as I do, with the views of my brother Hudson, that the provisions of the statute include within their purview hoisting apparatus of the type (escalator) that was in question here, nevertheless, I think the admissibility of the permits does not necessarily depend upon that.\nOn the strictly limited issue raised by the statement of claim that the escalator was negligently constructed and maintained; in other words, that the appellants failed to use reasonable care in respect of the construction and maintenance of it, the defendants were entitled to show that they had complied with the Government Regulations. It is impossible to say that the facts of inspection and the issue of permits in the usual way had not some relevancy to that issue. It appears to me, however, that if the Government department charged with the administration of the statute had been in error in proceeding upon the footing that escalators are within the contemplation of the statute, nevertheless, the facts of inspection and issue of permits by the department, in accordance with the duty imposed upon it under the departmental construction of the statute, would be equally relevant to this issue of reasonable care.\nThen, as to the inspector\u2019s report. It is plainly not a public document within Lord Blackburn\u2019s exposition in Sturla v. Freccia[2] and its admissibility could only be sustained on the ground that it is made evidence by section 31 of the Manitoba Evidence Act (Stats. of Man. 1933, ch. 11). By that statute a copy of any entry in any book, record, document or writing kept in any department of the Government of Canada or of the Province of Manitoba, or any other province of Canada, or in the office of any commission, board or other branch of the public service of Canada, or any such province, is receivable as evidence, not only of the entry itself, but also of the matters, transactions and accounts therein recorded, upon condition of proof (inter alia) that, at the time of the making of the entry, such book, record, document or writing in which the entry was made was one of the ordinary books, documents or record\u2019s kept in such department or office. It is quite obvious from inspection that the affidavit does not comply with the statutory requirements; and in my opinion no such copy should be received in evidence unless the proof offered identifies the book or other record in which the entry appears in such a manner as to enable the court to see clearly that the entry is one within the purview of the enactment.\nSince there is to be a new trial, however, it is necessary to decide upon the admissibility of this copy of the inspector\u2019s report. It professes to give an account of the accident and of the condition of the escalator on the day on which the accident occurred. Obviously, the inspector is not speaking of matters within his own knowledge. The safeguards by which the law protects litigants in respect of evidence adduced in legal proceedings, the oath or its equivalent with the attendant criminal sanctions, the rule against hearsay evidence, the right of cross-examination, are all absent when a document such as this is admitted as evidence of the facts of which it speaks. Moreover, if this report is receivable as evidence of such facts under the statute, then the statute is obviously of such a scope as to accomplish, in respect of documents on file in offices connected with any of the public services of the country, a fundamental change in the rules and principles of evidence. A report by a provincial constable to his superior officer, for example, preserved on file in some office where such documents are kept would appear to be admissible as evidence of the facts stated in any action between private individuals. Even a letter on file written by some official giving an account of some matter of departmental interest could be adduced as proof of the statements it contained in any civil proceeding between any parties.\nSuch, in my opinion, is not the proper view of the effect of the statute. Only by a forced and non-natural reading can it be made to comprehend such documents. Enactments of this character which introduce a general exception to the rules of evidence, depriving the parties to legal proceedings of the usual safeguards in respect of evidence, should be strictly limited in their application to cases which are unmistakably within their real intendment as well as within the literal meaning of the words employed.\nCrocket J. (dissenting).\u2014There is no doubt, I think, from the evidence that the only possible ground upon which the jury could have attributed the infant plaintiff\u2019s injury to the negligence of the defendant on account of the construction and maintenance of the escalator\u2014the principal negligence charged in the action\u2014was hat the clearance between its moving steps or treads and its stationary skirting was too wide. No guard or attendant and no such stop buttons as were suggested, whereby the motion of the escalator might have been more speedily stopped, would have prevented the unfortunate accident to the child. The learned trial Judge pointed this out clearly and, I think, quite correctly to the jury.\nThe crucial issue for decision as the case was tried, therefore, was, as pointed out by my brother Hudson, whether or not the clearance between the skirting and the moving steps created a danger for young children, of which the defendant either knew or ought to have known and have guarded against. In my opinion, the learned trial Judge made this issue clear to the jury. The jury, after hearing the evidence, themselves inspected the escalator and saw it in operation. There seems to be no question but that at the time the jury inspected it the escalator was in precisely the same condition as at the time of the accident. A specific question having been left to the jury by the learned trial Judge as to whether the defendant was guilty of any negligence which caused the injury to the infant plaintiff, and the jury having answered it \u201cnot guilty,\u201d I am not at all satisfied, in such circumstances, that any substantial wrong or miscarriage was or could have been occasioned by any of the grounds complained of in behalf of the respondent.\nI agree with my brother Hudson that the escalator in question falls within the provisions of the Manitoba Elevator and Hoist Act, and that the permits which were admitted in evidence in relation to its inspection under the provisions of that Act up to the time of the occurrence of the accident were relevant and admissible. As to the extract from the report made by the government inspector after the occurrence of the accident, I am inclined to think that in view of the provisions of ss. 5 (a) and 50A of the Manitoba Factories Act, R.S.M., 1913, ch. 70 (as amended\u2014see Consolidated Amendments, 1924), this report was not competent, but, as I have already indicated, I am not satisfied that its admission could have occasioned any substantial wrong or miscarriage within the meaning of s. 28 (1) of the Manitoba Court of Appeal Act, 1933, ch. 6. All the extract complained of stated was that the escalator was in good order and in perfect control, which the jury on their own examination and test apparently saw for themselves.\nWith regard to the complaint that the learned trial Judge did not sufficiently differentiate the defendant\u2019s duty to a small child from their duty towards an adult, it seems to me that His Lordship made it perfectly clear that no negligence on the part of the mother could affect the infant plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, and that nothing that he said in reference to the infant\u2019s own conduct, independently of his mother, could have had any influence upon the jury in relation to the crucial issue as to whether the child\u2019s injuries were caused by any negligence on the part of the defendant in relation to the construction and maintenence of the escalator. For this reason I think that a new trial would be barred on the alleged ground of misdirection by the said s. 28 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act.\nIn my opinion, the finding of the jury is unexceptionable, and the learned trial Judge had no other recourse than to enter a verdict for the defendant on the finding or to dismiss the action.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment, with costs throughout.\nDavis J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of my brother Hudson, but I would add a few observations of my own upon the question of the sufficiency of the learned trial Judge\u2019s charge to the jury.\nThat the staircase was in good working condition was only one of the essential facts in issue. That being proved, the question was then whether or not the defendant company had exercised reasonable care in relation to the infant plaintiff. The child of four years of age was not a trespasser\u2014that is important\u2014but was permitted to use the moving stairs, made on the endless chain principle, to go from one floor of the building to another. Was that a reasonable thing for the defendant to permit? The child, on account of its age, was incapable of negligence on its part. That was the position of the child in the problem for the jury. Instead of so directing the jury, the trial Judge, I fear, beclouded the child\u2019s legal position by telling the jury:\u2014\nThe mother was not holding the child. The child was not holding on to the mother. Those appliances are expected even for adults to require a little steadying at times, so they have a moving rail that adults rest on and therefore steady themselves. But you cannot have a moving rail for infants too small to reach up to it, and a child probably ought to hold on to its mother\u2019s skirts or have been guided or supported by the mother.\nAnd further in the charge:\u2014\nSupposing this child had fallen forward and tumbled down the escalator, head over heels to the bottom, and bumped its head, would there have been any action? There could not be. A child is supposed to walk standing up going down stairs. If he had bumped his head on some projection which was necessary there, there could be no action.\nThe jury would undoubtedly be led to believe that there was some degree of care incumbent upon the child when, as a matter of law, there was none. It is clear to me that the position of the child was not put to the jury.\nThen the position of the defendant as occupier of the premises, permitting a child of four years lawfully upon the premises to use the moving staircase, ought to have been put clearly and fully to the jury. What is a reasonable amount of care in one set of circumstances may not be so in another set of circumstances and reasonable care is the sole test of negligence. Professor Winfield in his new text-book on the Law of Torts (1937) says at pp. 581-582:\u2014\nVery few people who enter a shop, ship, factory, house or vehicle, or who go upon appliances connected with them, like a lift or gangway, have or can have full knowledge or control of the possible dangers that lurk in them. They must trust themselves mainly to the occupier even when they exercise reasonable care on their own behalf. Modern civilization has greatly increased the risks they run. Indeed this accounts, to some extent, for the comparatively recent evolution of the law on this subject, although another equally important factor has been the inroad made by the development of the law of negligence on the older idea that an owner can do what he likes with his land so far as visitors to it are concerned. (cf. Bohlen, Studies in the Law of Torts (1926) 162-163.) Machinery and appliances which are the commonplace fittings of modern dwelling-houses, to say nothing of factories and railways, were unknown little more than a century ago. The Common Law has rightly taken account of the increased perils which have resulted from this and has screwed the duty of the occupier to a proportionately higher pitch.\nThe escalator was maintained and operated by the defendants upon the premises for the use of the public. What may be reasonably safe for an adult may not be reasonably safe for a child of four years. Was it a structure of such a kind that the occupiers reasonably permitted a little child to make use of it? That was a question for the jury. Should the defendants have had an attendant present? So far as an attendant is concerned, the jury might conclude that the presence of the mother with the child removed the storekeeper from such duty; on the other hand, the jury might recognize what must be a fact that many parents shopping in the big cities are not really responsible persons having regard to the protection even of their own little children. Should there have been some means capable of stopping the moving stairs when the child fell and got his little hand caught in the narrow space between the stairs and the wall? Did the defendants act reasonably in permitting the child to use this apparatus in the absence of some such safeguard for the child\u2019s protection? That is a real problem that should have been put squarely before the jury. The presence of the mother would have nothing to do with the absence of some automatic means to bring the moving structure to a sudden stop when such an accident occurs. The moving staircase was likened, during the argument, to an elevator, but an elevator is in charge of a competent person who can bring it to a stop in a moment. The serious injury to the child does not appear to have been due to the fact that his little hand got caught in the apparatus but to the fact that the child was thereafter carried on down the staircase to the foot of the structure where the hand came in contact with the floor, almost pulling the hand off the child. The crying of the child arrested the attention of those present but no one was there to stop the motion. Was that negligence on the part of the defendants to the little child? Or was that something beyond the field of reasonable care? Or was the accident the sort of accident that a storekeeper operating these moving stairs would not be expected reasonably to foresee as likely to happen to a little child? Was it the consequence of an extremely rare and obscure accident which the jury think a storekeeper cannot, in a business sense, be reasonably expected to anticipate? All those questions were matters for the jury to consider. The real problem in the case was not put to the jury.\nAccordingly I would dismiss with costs the appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal that directed a new trial.\nThe Judgment of Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nHudson, J.\u2014The infant plaintiff, a boy of four years of age, was seriously injured while descending in an escalator in the defendant\u2019s departmental store in Winnipeg. This action was brought for damages in respect of such injuries.\nThe statement of claim alleges:\u2014\n5. The defendant maintains in the said store and invites persons in the said store to use a moving staircase or escalator operated by electrical power and furnishing a means of proceeding from the main floor to the basement floor of the said store, which will hereinafter be referred to as \u201cthe escalator,\u201d and the said Wilhelmina Wyrzykowski with the infant plaintiff and her other infant son got on to the said escalator and were proceeding from the main floor to the basement when the said infant plaintiff on account of the construction and operation of said escalator fell or was knocked or thrown so that he fell on the platform or steps of the said escalator, which was so negligently constructed and maintained that his right hand and lower arm was caught between the side of the moving steps or treads or platform of the escalator and the unmoving side of the said escalator and\/or caught in the machinery of the same and\/or pulled into the said machinery where it was held and he was carried to the bottom of the said escalator with his said hand and arm so caught and held, and so remained until the said escalator was stopped and until the same was dismantled in part so as to release the hand and arm.\nand sets out particulars of negligence.\nThe statement of defence denied all the charges of negligence and set up:\u2014\n16. The defendant says further that in the said escalator it maintains the most modern and up to date equipment obtainable, in perfect condition and regularly inspected, and that the same was in good working condition and order and is so constructed that it is impossible for the said escalator to jerk in its operation and to throw anyone off their balance, and that the defendant has thereby discharged its duty, if any, to the plaintiff or plaintiffs or anyone in charge of the infant plaintiff.\nIt was further alleged that the infant plaintiff was in charge of its mother, that she was familiar with the escalator and the use thereof and herself responsible for his falling.\nAt the opening of the trial, the defendants were permitted to amend by setting up as a further defence that they had been authorized to operate the escalator under the provisions of the Elevator and Hoist Act (Manitoba), and that pursuant to such Act the same had been inspected from time to time and all requirements thereunder fulfilled.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Dysart and a jury. Evidence was given of the accident and the injuries to the infant plaintiff, the character, condition and operation of the escalator, the inspection of same from time to time by employees of the defendants and by governmental inspectors under the provisions of the above Act. Some of the permits to operate were admitted in evidence, notwithstanding objections by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. It was further shown that on the morning after the accident a government inspector had made a further inspection and report. Over objections by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, there was read to the jury a portion of this report as follows:\u2014\nThe escalator was in good order and in perfect control.\nAfter the oral and documentary evidence had been completed, the trial Judge and jury went to the store and took a view of the escalator, both at rest and in operation. It was admitted that the escalator was then in the same condition as at the time of the accident.\nFollowing the judge\u2019s charge to the jury, a verdict was brought in exonerating the company from any charge of negligence and, on this, judgment was entered for them.\nFrom this judgment, the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground of improper admission of evidence and misdirection.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial, upon the ground that the report of the inspector and the permits had been improperly admitted, and, further, that a portion of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury amounted to misdirection in law.\nThe defendants now appeal to this Court on the ground that the documents referred to were properly admitted, that in any event they did not occasion any substantial wrong or miscarriage and that there was no misdirection. The respondents here relied on the reasons given by the Court of Appeal and further submitted that the charge to the jury, when read as a whole, did not present the real points of the respondents\u2019 case, that the learned trial Judge had misdirected the jury in regard to the negligence, if any, of the mother of the infant respondent, that he had wrongfully refused to charge the jury that the infant respondent was an invitee and that the appellant owed the highest duty to him, and that he had erred in refusing to direct the jury that the principle of res ipsa loquitur applied.\nThe Court of Appeal Act, 1933, ch. 6, sec. 28 (1), provides:\u2014\nA new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or of the omission to take the verdict of the jury upon a question which the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to the jury, or of any omission or irregularity in the course of the trial, unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\nDealing first with the admissibility of the documents, these consisted of: (1) a form of permit which read as follows:\u2014\nImportant\u2014Must be posted in elevator.\nDuplicates will be charged for.\nMANITOBA ELEVATOR PERMIT No. \/1121 861\nIn accordance with The Elevator and Hoist Act elevator located ....................Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, ....................Portage Avenue, ..................

That portion was, after referring to the date:\u2014\nThe escalator was in good order and in perfect control.\nThos. Horn, Inspector.\nIt was first objected by counsel for the respondents that the Manitoba Elevator and Hoist Act did not apply to the escalator in question. Section 2 of the Act provides for the appointment of a board, and section 3 provides that\nthe Board shall have power to adopt rules and regulations respecting the construction, operation, maintenance and carrying capacity of elevators, hoists, dumb-waiters and all other hoisting appliances installed in buildings in Manitoba.\nAlthough the word \u201cescalator\u201d is not specifically mentioned, it seems to me that it is an appliance of the character covered by this Act. The Act itself is part of a group of Acts such as The Manitoba Factories Act, The Shops Regulation Act and The Public Buildings Act, making general provision for the safety of persons rightly resorting to places where large numbers of the public are likely to be, and I think that, as such, the Act in question is entitled to a liberal construction. For this reason, in my opinion, the escalator in question does fall within the provisions of the Act, and it was competent for the Board to make regulations thereunder.\nPursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Board made regulations, Rule No. 3 being:\u2014\nNo elevator * * * shall be operated until a certificate of permit therefor has been issued by the Bureau of Labor and operation may be continued only as long as such certificate of permit remains in force. * * *\nRule 15 provides:\u2014\nBefore new elevators, escalators, or other hoisting apparatus are installed, or extensive alterations made, plans and detailed information shall be submitted to the Bureau of Labor.\nThe Rules also made general provision as to inspection and enforcement. The respondents, in their statement of claim, alleged that the escalator was negligently constructed and maintained. The defendants pleaded that the escalator had been subjected to governmental inspection and that authority had been duly given to operate the same.\nMoreover, the fact that these permits had been granted was established by oral evidence without objection before the permits themselves were put in. In my opinion, these permits were relevant and admissible.\nWith regard to the third document, however, which is an extract from a report made as to a visit on the day after the accident, the situation is somewhat different. The inspection leading up to this report was not of a routine character but was doubtless made in consequence of the accident and the jury must have known this. The inspector who made the report was not available for cross-examination because of the provision in the Manitoba Factories Act applicable to this inspector, providing that such inspector shall during his tenure of office not be competent to give testimony in any civil case with regard to anything which he has seen or done, or with regard to any information he has obtained, opinion he has formed (The Manitoba Factories Act, R.S.M., 1913, chapter 70, as amended, sections 5 (a) and 50A). While section 31 of the Manitoba Evidence Act provides that a copy of any entry or statement in any book, record, etc., kept in any department of the Government, shall be received as evidence, etc., it does not justify the use of a report under the circumstances existing here and, in my opinion, neither report nor the extract therefrom read to the jury was admissible.\nBefore dealing with the question of misdirection in this case, it might be well to set out the general principles which should guide a judge in charging a jury, and reference may be made to two cases in the House of Lords. The first is Jones v. Spencer[3]. Lord Herschell at p. 538:\u2014\nMy Lords: I am of the same opinion. I think that the hesitation of a court to set aside the verdict of a jury is very natural, and that it is expedient that verdicts of juries, when that is the tribunal to determine the question between the parties, should not be set aside, except where one is satisfied that there has been a miscarriage, because a verdict has been found that could not reasonably have been found if the attention of the jury had been directed to the whole of the facts of the case, and to the question in issue which they had to determine. But it seems to me to be a condition of any such rule that the question which had to be determined should have been so left to them that one is satisfied that it was before their minds, that their minds were applied to it, and that they did really on the determination of that question give their verdict. If we think the verdict wrong in this sense, that one would not have given the verdict one\u2019s self, still if one sees that the question was properly submitted to the jury, that is not enough ground for granting a new trial. But if one comes to the conclusion that the verdict is not one which one would have given, and is wrong in that sense, I think that one is perfectly justified in saying that there shall be a new trial if one sees that the real question that had to be determined was not so put before the jury as to reasonably satisfy the tribunal that has to determine the question whether there shall be a new trial or not that the mind of the jury was so applied to the question to be determined that they did determine the case upon the answer to that question.\nIn Swadling v. Cooper[4], Viscount Hailsham said:\u2014\nThese plain principles have been discussed and elaborated in a long series of cases, but I do not think that those discussions have in any way qualified or lessened the authority of the earlier decisions. It is manifest that a full discussion of these cases and of the judgments delivered in them would be wholly inappropriate in a summing up and would inevitably tend to confuse and bewilder the jury. In a summing up it is essential that the law should be correctly and fully stated; but it is hardly of less importance that it should be stated in simple and plain terms so that a jury unskilled in the niceties of legal phraseology may appreciate the direction which is being given to them. Such direction should be adapted to the special circumstances of the case. It is not the whole law of negligence that needs exposition in every case, but only that part of it which is essential to a clear understanding of the issue which the jury has to determine. The question here is whether having regard to the facts of this case the law was sufficiently stated to the jury.\nThe general principles applicable to the issues in this case are fairly well settled, and in the case of Indermaur v. Dames[5], Mr. Justice Willes made what has become the classical statement:\u2014\nThe common case is that of a customer in a shop: but it is obvious that this is only one of a class; for, whether the customer is actually chaffering at the time, or actually buys or not, he is, according to an undoubted course of authority and practice, entitled to the exercise of reasonable care by the occupier to prevent damage from unusual danger, of which the occupier knows or ought to know, such as a trap-door left open, unfenced, and unlighted * * * This protection does not depend upon the fact of a contract being entered into in the way of the shopkeeper\u2019s business during the stay of the customer, but upon the fact that the customer has come into the shop in pursuance of a tacit invitation given by the shopkeeper, with a view to business which concerns himself. And, if a customer were, after buying goods, to go back to the shop in order to complain of the quality, or that the change was not right, he would be just as much there upon business which concerned the shopkeeper, and as much entitled to protection during this accessory visit, though it might not be for the shopkeeper\u2019s benefit, as during the principal visit, which was. And if, instead of going himself., the customer were to send his servant, the servant would be entitled to the same consideration as the master.\nThe class to which the customer belongs includes persons who go not as mere volunteers, or licensees, or guests, or servants, or persons whose employment is such that danger may foe considered as bargained for, but who go upon business which concerns the occupier, and upon his invitation, express or implied.\nAnd, with respect to such a visitor at least, we consider it settled law, that he, using reasonable care on his part for his own safety, is entitled to expect that the occupier shall on bis part use reasonable care to prevent damage from unusual danger, which he knows or ought to know; and that, where there is evidence of neglect, the question whether such reasonable care has been taken, by notice, lighting, guarding, or otherwise, and whether there was contributory negligence in the sufferer, must be determined by a jury as matter of fact.\nIn the case of T. Eaton Co. v. Sangster[6], the principles above stated were held to apply to the case of a small child accompanying its mother in a departmental store.\nIt must be kept in mind further that a child of four years of age could not be held guilty of contributory negligence: Gardner v. Grace[7], and further, that if the mother in charge of the child is herself guilty of negligence this would provide no defence once it was established that there was negligence on the part of the defendants contributing to the accident\u2014see Oliver v. Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Co. Ltd.[8].\nThe real question for decision upon the pleadings here and as the evidence developed was whether or not the space between the wall and the moving part of the escalator created a danger for young children, of which danger the defendant either knew or ought to have known and have guarded against in some more effective way, as, for example, by a lower railing or some other device for the protection of such small children. The statements of the learned trial Judge bearing on this question here were as follows:\u2014\nThe first aspect of that duty is, did the infant plaintiff in this case exercise reasonable care on its own part for its own safety? That applies of course generally to adults. Children are not expected to take and do not take the same degree of care, but I will touch upon that later. Then later on:\u2014\nThe mother was not holding the child. The child was not holding on to the mother. Those appliances are expected even for adults to require a little steadying at times, so they have a moving rail that adults rest on and therefore steady themselves. But you cannot have a moving rail for infants too small to reach up to it, and a child probably ought to hold on to its mother\u2019s skirts or have been guided or supported by the mother. While I do not say it is a fact, apparently the child, with very little physical provocation, fell, and it was of such an age that a little assistance might have been required there.\nFurther:\u2014\nThe duty is on the storekeeper to keep his premises reasonably safe. What is \u201csafe\u201d? That step was safe for those who would stand on it. The stairway is safe for those who walk on it. Sleeping car berths are perfectly safe, but people fall out of them and sometimes injure themselves, and actions are brought as to why they are not better guarded. These things are measured by the use to which they are put. Supposing this child had fallen forward and tumbled down the escalator, head over heels to the bottom, and bumped its head, would there have been any action? There could not be. A child is supposed to walk standing up going down stairs. If he had bumped his head on some projection which was necessary there, there could be no action. Outside of the extra clearance and the insufficient skirting the thing was as safe as human ingenuity could make it.\n* * *\nI also want to refer to the child being attended by its mother and the possible effect upon an attendant at the stairway. You should not assume that the child is to be confined to the mother\u2019s conduct. Even though the mother was neglectful in her care of the child, that does not affect the right of the child. The child is not restricted by the want of due care on the part of its mother, but it has this effect, that the defendant or its attendant would not be expected to give the same degree of care or watchfulness of the child going down the escalator in the company of its mother that it would of a child going down alone.\nThis, I think, covers all the references to the fact of the special duty arising by reason of the tender years of the infant plaintiff. With respect, I am of the opinion that the learned judge did not sufficiently differentiate the defendants\u2019 duty to a small child from their duty towards an adult, and, on the contrary, led the jury to believe that there was some duty to take care incumbent upon the child.\nIt is with reluctance that I have felt that a new trial should be granted, because of the fact that the jury had made a personal inspection of the escalator at rest and in motion, and because the facts of the case were of such a character as to arouse the strongest sympathies of a jury in favour of the person against whom they finally felt obliged to decide. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Guy Chappell, DuVal & McCrea.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Aikins, Loftus & Company\n[1] 44 Man.

Auld and others (Plaintiffs) Respondents\n1938: February 18, 21; 1938: April 26.\nPresent:\u2014Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nExecutors and Administrators\u2014Action against administrator of deceased's estate for loss alleged to have been caused by failure to realize upon assets within reasonable time\u2014Long delay, through settling amount of succession duties, between date of fiat for grant and actual issue, of letters of administration\u2014Depreciation in value of assets\u2014Liability of administrator. The appeal was from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, [1937] 3 W.W.R. 368, which, by a majority, reversing the judgment of Ives J., held the defendant (the present appellant), to whom had been granted letters of administration of a deceased's estate, liable, in an action brought by certain of deceased's next of kin to recover for loss alleged to have been caused by defendant's failure to realize within a reasonable time upon assets of the estate.\nThe deceased died, intestate, on June 15, 1929. Defendant applied for letters of administration on November 28, 1929. The judge's fiat for issue of 'grant was made on January 30, 1930. A lengthy delay occurred in settling the amount of succession duties, and, in consequence (by reason of the Rules of Court and the Succession Duties Act, Alta.), letters of administration (which recited the date of grant as of January 30, 1930) were not issued until November 6, 1931. The case was dealt with throughout on the assumption that the loss complained of could not be said to have been attributable to acts or omissions of defendant after the last mentioned date.\nHeld, that defendant's appeal be allowed and the judgment at trial (dismissing the action) be restored.\nPer Duff C.J., Davis and Hudson JJ.: The fiat for the issue of grant of administration did not constitute the grant; defendant did not become an administrator until the actual issue of letters of administration on November 6, 1931; and he was not chargeable as administrator for anything that occurred prior to that date. It was difficult to find any principle on which he could be charged with liability as a trustee prior to that date (moreover, it appeared that plaintiffs were aware of the situation; also under the Judicature Act, Alta., plaintiffs had a right to have a public administrator appointed if they so desired); at any rate, that issue was not open under the pleadings, nor was it a case in which a court of appeal should now order an amendment.\nDuff C.J. further pointed out obstacles or difficulties which stood in the way of earlier realization, as going to show that the loss complained of was not due to any neglect of defendant. He agreed with the trial Judge's finding that, in all the circumstances, no lack of due diligence could be ascribed to defendant in respect of the delay in the payment of succession duties. Per Crocket and Kerwin. JJ.: The plaintiffs' claim, as set forth in their pleadings and as developed at the trial, was against defendant as administrator and in no other capacity and on no other basis. Even assuming that the assets in question were vested in defendant by virtue of the fiat, he could not, in view of the terms of the Succession Duties Act, deal with those assets until the succession duties were arranged. There was (agreeing with the trial Judge's finding) no reason to attach any censure for the delay between the application for letters of administration on November 28, 1929, and the issue thereof on November 6, 1931.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], which, by a majority, reversing the judgment of Ives J. at trial, held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover against the defendant for loss alleged to have been caused by defendant's failure to realize within a reasonable time upon assets of the estate in question.\nThe estate was that of John Davis, deceased, who died, intestate, on June 15, 1929, at Vegreville, in the Province of Alberta, which was his fixed place of abode at the time of his death. The defendant was a brother of the deceased. The deceased and defendant had large holdings in a grain company which they conducted, the defendant being the largest shareholder in the company. The chief assets of the deceased's estate, and about which the present litigation was mainly concerned, were 98 shares in the said company and a debt owing to deceased by that company.\nDefendant applied for letters of administration to the said estate on November 28, 1929. The judge's fiat for issue of the grant was made on January 30, 1930. A lengthy delay occurred in settling the amount of succession duties, and, in consequence (by reason of the Rules of Court and the Succession Duties Act, Alta.), letters of administration (which recited the date of grant as of January 30, 1930) were not issued until November 6, 1931. In the meantime there had been a depreciation in the value of the estate's a;ssets. The plaintiffs, who were entitled as next of kin to share in the estate, brought the action (which was begun in September, 1934) to recover for the loss, alleging that it was caused by defendant's failure to realize upon the assets of the estate within a reasonable time. The trial Judge, Ives J., dismissed the action. (His judgment provided for relieving defendant as administrator and appointing another administrator, if desired, owing to clash of interests).\nOn appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta (McGillivray J.A. dissenting)[2] gave judgment for the plaintiffs, holding that defendant should be personally liable for the amount of the debt (from said company to deceased) at the time of deceased's death, with interest, (credit being given for the amounts paid on account), and that plaintiffs recover from him their share thereof, and that plaintiffs recover from defendant their share of the value of the 98 shares held by deceased in the said company, such value to be ascertained as of June 15, 1930, being one year after the deceased's death.\nThe defendant appealed to this Court. By the judgment now reported, the appeal was allowed and the judgment of the trial Judge restored, the respondents to pay to the appellant the costs of the appeals to the Appellate Division and to this Court.\nC. H. Locke K.C. for the appellant.\nG. D. Noble for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with the conclusion as well as with the reasoning of my brother Hudson, but I desire to emphasize two findings of the learned trial Judge.\nFirst, he found in fact, as I understand his judgment, that any attempt to collect the claim of the estate against the Company before the sale of the Company's assets in the summer of 1930 would have been defeated by the assertion of the prior claim of the Bank and, consequently, that no loss accrued to the estate in consequence of the alleged neglect of duty under this head. I should add that, in my view, the probability is very high that any such attempt would have precipitated a liquidation and, among other undesirable results, would have extinguished the Company's shares as an asset of the estate.\nSecond, the learned trial Judge, in effect, found that in all the circumstances no lack of due diligence could be ascribed to the appellant in respect of the delay in the payment of succession duties. I agree with this finding. As regards the complaint respecting the failure to sell the shares, it should be remembered that the Company was a family company and it is altogether improbable, in view of rules 965 and 969 and section 15 of the Succession Duties Act, that any purchaser would have accepted a transfer of the shares before the issue of letters of administration. The circumstance that the Succession Duties Act was afterwards held to be ultra vires is really beside the point.\nI have read with great care the very able judgment of the Chief Justice of Alberta, if I may without offence so describe it, but, with all the respect which every view of the Chief Justice commands, I have been forced to a different conclusion.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored with costs throughout for the reasons given by my brother Kerwin.\nThe judgment of Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nHUDSON J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[3] which, by a majority, reversed the judgment delivered at the trial by Mr. Justice Ives in the trial division of the Supreme Court.\nThe respondents are next of kin of the late John Davis, deceased, and as such are entitled to a one-half interest in his estate. They brought this action against the appellant, alleging in their statement of claim, that by letters of administration dated 30th January, 1930, and issued out of the District Court of the District of Edmonton, the defendant was appointed administrator of the estate and effects of John Davis, deceased, who died intestate on or about the 15th May [June], 1929, that they had repeatedly requested the defendant to realize on certain assets of the said estate but defendant had refused and neglected to do so, and that he had failed and neglected to take reasonable and proper measures to obtain possession of outstanding estate property and to realize on same, and that meanwhile, by reason of such failure, the assets had seriously depreciated in value and the estate had suffered heavy loss; further, that the appellant's personal interests were inconsistent and conflicted with his duty as administrator; and claimed an accounting and the removal of the appellant from his administration.\nThe appellant in his statement of defence, besides making denials of charges in the statement of claim, set up that the letters of administration were not issued to him until the 6th of November, 1931.\nSubsequently to the commencement of the action, the appellant's accounts were passed by the proper court.\nAt the trial it was shown that the defendant had applied for letters of administration on the 28th of November, 1929, that on the 30th of January, 1930, the judge of the District Court had written on the application the words \"Let administration issue as prayed\" and signed the same, and that on the following day a letter was sent by the Acting Deputy Clerk of the Court to the defendant's solicitor in the following terms:\nRe: Estate of John Davis, Deceased.\nI beg to advise you that Fiat has been granted in this matter. I am now waiting for advice from the Collector of Succession Duties as to payment of his fees and when that arrives Letters will issue. The fees required by this Office will be $155 in addition to $2 each for any certified copies which you may require.\nFollowing this, there was a lengthy delay in settling the amount of succession duties and these were not finally paid until the autumn of 1931, and the letters were not actually issued, i.e., delivered out as an operative instrument, until the 6th of November, 1931. When issued they recited:\u2014\nBe it known that on the 30th day of January, A.D. 1930, Letters of Administration of all and singular the property of John Davis, * * * were granted by the District Court of the District of Edmonton, * * * to David Reese Davis.\nIt was further proved that in the interval between the application for letters of administration and the actual issue there was a great depreciation in the value of the assets of the estate. Such assets as might come under consideration here consisted only of shares which the deceased had owned in a grain company and of a debt of some $14,910.35 owing to him by such company. It was also proved that the appellant in his own right was the largest shareholder and in effective control of the company during the interval referred to.\nIt was claimed on behalf of the respondents that the appellant could, by the exercise of diligence and acting with sole regard to the interests of the estate, have obtained payment of the debt referred to at an early date, and could have settled the succession duties and divided up the shares in the company among the beneficiaries at a time when they could have been disposed of to advantage.\nMr. Justice Ives, in giving judgment at the trial, stated:\nI think that the whole difficulty perhaps might have been avoided if the defendant had realized at the time that he applied for administration, that the fact that all the assets of the estate were within the affairs or the property of the Grain Company, the Limited Company, and the future of the Limited Company was in any way uncertain, that it would have been very much better if he had not applied and had let someone else do so, because there has been no doubt about the clash of interests. On the other hand I cannot see from the evidence where one can reasonably say that with any other Administrator, or that by the conduct of this Administrator, any loss has been occasioned which would not have occurred inevitably at the time that he applied for Administration, and continuously thereafter until he put up his own money together with the proceeds of the sale of the elevators. The Bank of Montreal had a prior claim against the assets of this Company that would have defeated any pressure brought to bear by the Administrator to collect the $14,000 odd.\nIn consequence, he dismissed the action but directed that a new administrator should be appointed in the place of the appellant.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Chief Justice Harvey held:(1) that, in his opinion, there was no doubt that the appellant's duties arose at latest at the date of the grant, namely, the 30th of January, 1930;(2) that in any event the application for administration, not having been withdrawn but pursued to a grant, was sufficient to impose upon the appellant the obligation to use due diligence to acquire full status as administrator, that he had failed in this and that he had really constituted himself a trustee for the beneficiaries and had failed in his duties in that respect;(3) that the appellant was not entitled to any relief under the Trustee Act.\nMr. Justice Ford concurred generally in the reasons of the Chief Justice, talking the view, however, that it was unnecessary to express an opinion as to when the grant of letters of administration was made, because in his view of the facts the defendant assumed the trust of administering the estate on behalf of himself and the other next of kin.\nNeither of these members of the court held that there was any liability on the appellant as an executor de son tort.\nMr. Justice McGillivray dissented from the opinion of the other members of the court and held that:(1) the respondents in their pleadings had sought to charge the appellant only as an administrator;(2) the appellant did not become an administrator until the letters of administration had actually been issued to him;(3) any possible liability of the appellant as an executor de son tort was not open to be considered under the pleadings;(4) the position taken by the majority of the court that the appellant had put himself in the place of a trustee was equally untenable, inasmuch as he was not so charged under the pleadings; moreover, that the beneficiaries must be presumed to have known that they could have had a public administrator appointed at any time on showing that the appellant's delay was to the disadvantage of those interested in the estate; and concluded that, in his opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNowhere is it charged that the appellant had been guilty of any fraud or malfeasance in connection with the estate.\nThe formal judgment of the Court of Appeal awarded the respondents a judgment for $5,318 and one-half of the value of the 98 shares in the grain company which had been owned by the deceased, such value to be determined as of the 15th June, 1930.\nIt was assumed below, and from what was said before us I assume, that the loss and damage complained of cannot be said to have been attributable to the acts or omissions of the administrator after the date on which the letters of administration were delivered to him.\nI agree with Mr. Justice McGillivray in his view that the appellant did not become an administrator until the actual issue to him of the letters of administration, on the 6th of November, 1931. An administrator derives his authority entirely from the appointment of the court. Williams on Executors, page 272:\u2014\nWith respect to an administrator, the general rule is, that a party entitled to administration can do nothing as administrator before letters of administration are granted to him; inasmuch as he derives his authority entirely from the appointment of the Court.\nAnd also see 14 Halsbury, page 175.\nIn my opinion, the act of the judge of the district court in granting his fiat for the issue of the grant does not constitute the grant. That is something which is not complete until the letters have been signed and sealed by the clerk of the court and are capable of delivery. This is something which the clerk of the court had no right to do until he had, first, the fiat of the judge, and secondly, the certificate as required by the statute from the Provincial Treasurer fixing the amount of succession duties and that such succession duties have been paid or security furnished. The relevant statutes and rules are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice McGillivray and need not now be repeated. I would, however, refer to Rule of Court 965 which provides:\u2014\n* * * No grant of probate or administration shall issue, nor shall any grant be resealed, until after the receipt by the clerk of a certificate from the Provincial Treasurer fixing the amount of duty to be paid in respect of the estate, if any, nor until such duty is paid or security furnished as required by law.\nThe letter of the clerk of the court to the appellant's solicitor, quoted above, states the position which was taken and which is in accord with the rules.\nUntil the letters had actually been issued, the appellant had no right,(1) to get from a bank any moneys which might have stood to the credit of the deceased;(2) to sue and get judgment against any debtor of the estate;(3) to sell and transfer any land of the deceased;(4) to legally get a company to transfer any shares or securities of such company to himself or to any beneficiary of the estate;(5) to legally divide any of the assets of the estate among beneficiaries.\nFor these reasons, it seems to me quite clear that the appellant was not chargeable as administrator for anything that occurred prior to the actual issue to him of the letters of administration. The appellant is not charged in the pleadings as an executor de son tort, and, indeed, such an allegation would have been inconsistent with the respondents' demand therein. What they charge the appellant with is failing to get in assets and account for them, not with having wrongfully got possession of assets.\nAn administrator, unlike an executor, cannot be sued for failing to take out letters of administration. In Williams on Executors, at page 275, it is stated: \u2014\nThough a next of kin may have intermeddled with the effects, and made himself liable as executor de son tort, he cannot be compelled by the Court to take upon himself the office of administrator.\nThis statement is fully borne out by the decision of the court in the case of Ackerley v. Oldham[4].\nThere is difficulty in finding any principle on which the appellant could be charged with liability as a trustee prior to his appointment as administrator. Moreover, it appears that the respondents were aware of the situation and, on the 13th of November, 1030, wrote a joint letter to the solicitor for the appellant in regard to the estate. On December 2nd following, the appellant, in person, replied to this letter, stating the general position, and further said:\u2014\nYou must understand that I have not yet been formally appointed Administrator\u2014as this could not be done until the amount of the Succession Duties was settled and that amount paid. When my appointment is made I will proceed to administer the estate in the manner required by law and then will be ready to consider any suggestions you or any of the heirs have to make regarding the administration.\nUnder the Judicature Act, R.S.A., 1922, chapter 72, sections 48 and 50, the respondents had a right to have a public administrator appointed if they so desired.\nAt any rate, this issue is not open under the pleadings, nor is it a case in which a court of appeal should now order an amendment. For these reasons, it is not necessary to consider whether or not the trial Judge was correct in his view that there was no loss attributable to the acts or omissions of the appellant, or whether or not the explanations of the appellant for the delay in securing the letters of administration were sufficient, and it is also unnecessary to consider whether or not it is a case in which the appellant should be relieved under the provisions of the Trustee Act.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored, with costs of the appeals to the Appellate Division and to this Court.\nKERWIN J.\u2014This is an appeal from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[5] granting relief to the plaintiffs as next of kin of the late John Davis and thereby reversing the judgment at the trial, which had dismissed the action. The Chief Justice of Alberta states that \"the claim is against the defendant as administrator,\" and Mr. Justice McGillivray, who dissented, agreed with this. Mr. Justice Ford concurred in the result arrived at by the Chief Justice \"and, speaking generally, with his reasons therefor.\" But Mr. Justice Ford continued:-\u2014\nIn the view I take of the case it is unnecessary to express an opinion as to when the \"grant\" of letters of administration was made, because in my view of the facts the defendant at a time anterior to his application for letters of administration, and certainly by the time he so applied, assumed the trust of administering the estate of the deceased on behalf of himself and the other next of kin. He did not become simply an executor de son tort with the coincident limited liability attachable thereto.\nIn my view, the claim of the plaintiffs, set forth in their statement of claim and as developed at the trial, is against the defendant as administrator and in no other capacity and on no other basis. John Davis died June 15, 1929. The defendant, who was a brother and the one best entitled to administer, applied to the proper District Court for a grant on November 28th, 1929. On January 30th, 1930, the Judge of the District Court endorsed the following fiat on the application:\u2014\nJanuary 30, 1930.\nLet administration issue as prayed,\nLucien Dubuc J.\nWe are not concerned with the power of the defendant after the granting of this fiat to bring an action with respect to the assets of the estate and as to whether it would be sufficient for him to produce at the trial of such an action the letters of administration issued after the commencement of the proceedings, but it is important to refer to no. 965 of the Rules of Court, which provides:\u2014\n* * * No grant of probate or administration shall issue, nor shall any grant be resealed, until after the receipt by the clerk of a certificate from the Provincial Treasurer fixing the amount of duty to be paid in respect of the estate, if any, nor until such duty is paid or security furnished as required by law.\nIt is shown in the evidence that considerable delay occurred in arranging the amount of the succession duties and that, as a result of this delay, letters of administration were not delivered until November 6th, 1931.\nWhile the section of the Succession Duties Act in force at the time the application, for administration was made was ultimately declared ultra vires by the Privy Council, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta had declared it intra vires.\nRestricting, therefore, the claim of the plaintiffs to a claim for loss and damage by reason of the failure of the defendant as an administrator to realize upon the debt owing by the D. R. Davis Grain Co. Ltd. to the deceased, and upon the deceased's shares in the capital stock of that company, it is apparent that no matter what the force and effect of the District Court Judge's fiat may be, the defendant could not, in view of the terms of the Succession Duties Act, deal with either of these assets, even if it be assumed that they were vested in him by virtue of the fiat, and on that short ground I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action.\nIt so happened that the defendant was also President and sole Manager of the D. R. Davis Grain Co. Ltd., but no claim is made against him in that capacity, and it cannot be said that any damage or loss ensued from the failure of the defendant as administrator to realize upon the assets mentioned when, until the succession duties were arranged, he was never in a position to do anything in connection with such assets.\nComplaint was made of the long delay that occurred between the date of filing the application for a grant of administration and the actual delivery of the letters of administration to the defendant; but I agree with the finding of the trial Judge and \"see no reason to attach any censure for the delay between the end of 1929 and November, 1931.\" It was admitted by counsel for the respond- ents that the District Court had power to make an order in a proper case, expediting the application for administration and directing that, in default of that order being obeyed, administration issue to someone else, and it is common ground that no such steps were taken.\nIt is unnecessary to consider whether the appellant could be held liable as a trustee from the time he filed his application for administration, as no such claim was made in the pleadings or advanced at the trial. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1937] 3 W.W.R. 368; [1937] 4 D.LR. 439.\n[2] [1937] 3 W.W.R. 368; [1937] 4 D.L.R. 439.\n[3] [1937] 3 W.W.R. 368; [1937] 4 D.L.R. 439.\n[4] (1811) 1 Phill. 248; 161 English Reports at 974.\n[5] [1937] 3 W.W.R. 368; [1937] 4 D.L.R. 439.\n"}

The Court of Appeal gave judgment to the plaintiff against the defendants for $1,393.40 and costs. Special leave was given by the Court of Appeal to the defendant Derkson to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada[2].\nSection 85 of The Vehicles Act, 1935, Sask., (1934-35, c. 68), provided that:\u2014\nIn all cases when any loss, damage or injury is caused to any person by a motor vehicle, the person operating it at the time shall be liable for the loss, damage or injury, if it was caused by his negligence or improper conduct, and the owner thereof shall also be liable to the same extent as the operator unless at the time of the injury the motor vehicle had been stolen from him or otherwise wrongfully taken out of his possession or out of the possession of any person entrusted by him with the care thereof.\nSubsection 2 of that section, added by c. 106 of the statutes of 1936, provided that:\u2014\n(2) Except only in (the case of motor vehicles which are ordinarily used for carrying passengers for hire or gain, no action shall lie against either the owner or the driver of a motor vehicle by a person who is, after the date on which this subsection comes into force, carried as a passenger in that motor vehicle or by his personal (representative or next-of-kin for any injury, loss or damage sustained by such person by reason of the operation of that motor vehicle by the driver thereof, unless there has been gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the driver of the vehicle and unless such gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury, loss or damage in respect of which the action is brought.\nOn the hearing of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, on Friday, April 29, 1938, at the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the respondent, the members of the Court retired for consultation, and, on their returning to the Bench, the Chief Justice announced as follows:\u2014\n\u201cWe have come to the conclusion that in this case there are really no adequate grounds for reversing the finding of the learned trial Judge that there was no gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct.

(the suppliant\u2019s husband) purchased from the Government of Canada a life annuity, paying therefor $10,000, the major portion of his assets. He was then 73 years old, in very poor health and of unsound mind, having fixed delusions against his wife and son, in pursuance of which delusions his purchase was made. His condition of health and mind was known by the local postmaster through whom said $10,000 was paid (who did not encourage W., rather, perhaps, tried to discourage him from his course), but was not known or suspected by the administering officers of the Crown. The contract was in the Government\u2019s usual terms and made on its behalf in the ordinary course of business. After seven monthly annuity payments, aggregating $882.49, had been paid to W., he died. The action was to recover the sum paid to the Crown.\nHeld (Kerwin J. dissenting): The suppliant was entitled to recover $9,117.51 (the $10,000 less annuity payments made) with interest from date of the petition of right. Judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1937] Ex. C.R. 186, reversed.\nPer Duff C.J.: The contract, obviously improvident on W.\u2019s part in his state of health, and made in his said mental condition, was one which a court of equity would not allow to stand if entered into between W. and any private person (e.g., an insurance company) having knowledge of the facts\u2014the latter would be chargeable on equitable principles with fraud in the sense of taking an unconscientious advantage. The government officers would not be performing their duty to the Crown if they concluded a contract with an applicant for an annuity in circumstances which were such that, if they were acting in a private capacity, a court of equity would set aside the contract as one obtained by taking a fraudulent advantage of the purchaser\u2019s mental and physical weakness; and it would be their duty to the Crown not to retain the money paid for an annuity if before the execution of the contract it came to their knowledge that the intending purchaser had paid it in circumstances such as existed in this case. Having regard to the provisions of the Government Annuities Act, the regulations made thereunder, and the practice (as shewn in evidence) of the Government department administering the Act, the postmaster was an agent of the Crown in such a way that his knowledge of the facts should be imputed to the Crown (otherwise, semble, the suppliant would have been without a remedy); it was his duty to communicate to his superior officer, the\u2019 Superintendent of Annuities, facts coming to his knowledge which would render it the duty of the Crown officers, as between them and the Crown, not to conclude the contract. The fact that the consideration, for which W. paid the sum sought to be recovered, had been fully enjoyed, did not, in the circumstances, bar the obtaining of restitution. The circumstance that a contract has been executed on both sides is not in itself a bar to relief in the case of fraud. Though the benefit of the chances of a long life for W. could not strictly be restored, yet that always was obviously illusory; complete restitution could be made as to the property which actually passed; and there was no obstacle in the way of effecting practical justice. The case comes within the principle of the judgments of Buckley L.J. and Bray J. in Kettlewell v. Refuge Assce. Co., [1908] 1 K.B. 545, at 552; [1907] 2 K.B. 242, at 247, which seems to have been approved by the Lord Chancellor, [1909] A.C. 243, at 244, 245. The Crown cannot lawfully retain the money paid to its agent in the circumstances.\nPer Davis J.: Whether or not the local postmaster\u2019s knowledge could be imputed to the Crown, and assuming that the Crown had no knowledge of W.\u2019s incapacity, yet on the facts of this case\u2014an extraordinary one\u2014the court is not powerless to give relief according to the manifest justice of the case. The contract was an unfair bargain \u2014in the sense that no man with normal mentality, in W.\u2019s physical condition, would have purchased the annuity, and no one, if he knew W.\u2019s physical and mental condition, would honestly have entertained his application. No injustice would be done to the Crown if the moneys ($9,117.50) were returned. Though strictly the parties could not be placed in statu quo, yet the limitation in that regard as to the court\u2019s interference can have no practical application where the court is dealing only with a sum of money. It is not a case where disturbance of conditions following upon an executed contract would be highly inconvenient or unjust. (Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, 13th ed., p. 242; Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co. Ltd. v. McLaughlin, [1904] A.C. 776; 1 C.L.R. 243, at 280, 281; Niell v. Morley, 9 Ves. 478, at 481; York Glass. Co. Ltd. v. Jubb, 134 L.T.R. 36, at 43; and other cases, referred to). Per Kerwin J. (dissenting): Molton v. Camroux, 2 Ex. 487, affirmed 4 Ex. 17, may be taken to have firmly established the modern rule as to commercial contracts by a lunatic to this extent: that even if the lunatic was incapable of understanding what he was doing in the particular transaction, he will be bound by his undertaking where no advantage was taken of him and where the contract has been executed in whole or in part so that the parties cannot be restored to their original position, unless he can also prove that the other party knew of his state of mind or wilfully shut his eyes to means of knowledge thereof. Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co. Ltd. v. McLaughlin, [1904] A.C. 776, and Molyneux v. Natal Land & Colonization Co. Ltd., [1905] A.C. 555, have no bearing upon the rule to be applied here and are not in conflict with it. In the present case, while it was objected that W.\u2019s purchase was unwise, no objection was raised as to the consideration for the contract; nor was it suggested that there was practised any fraud or imposition by any one; furthermore, the annuity contract was delivered to him and he received the specified monthly payments to the time of his death. Under these circumstances the suppliant is prohibited from setting up W.\u2019s incapacity unless she can show that the other party to the contract was aware of W.\u2019s condition. As to that, the intervention of the postmaster, under the Act and regulations, in the manner established by the evidence, cannot assist her. Even if the postmaster could be termed an agent in any sense of the word, authority was not conferred upon him of such a nature as to impute to the Minister any knowledge he may have had of W.\u2019s condition. (Blackburn, Low & Co. v. Vigors, 12 App. Cas. 531, at 537-538, cited).\nAPPEAL by the suppliant from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the suppliant was not entitled to the relief sought by her petition of right, which asked that the Crown foe condemned to repay the sum paid to the Crown by the suppliant\u2019s husband, now deceased, for the purchase of an annuity. The suppliant was the sole beneficiary and executrix of the will of said deceased. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment now reported and are indicated in the above head-note. By the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was allowed and it was declared that the suppliant is entitled to the sum of $9,117.51 (being the sum, $10,000, paid for the annuity less the aggregate amount of the seven monthly annuity payments made to the said deceased before his death), with interest from the date of the petition of right, with costs throughout. Kerwin J. dissented.\nJ. J. Bench K.C. and H. P. Cavers for the appellant.\nF. E. Hetherington for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014The appellant and suppliant in the petition of right before us is the widow, sole beneficiary and executrix of the last will and testament of George S. Wilson, late of Merritton, deceased.\nOn the 30th of November, 1928, George S. Wilson, deceased, formally applied to the Government of Canada for the purchase of an annuity of $1,512.86 payable in monthly instalments, having previously paid therefor on the 24th of November, 1928, the sum of $10,000. A contract was, accordingly, entered into dated the 11th of December, 1928, in the terms of the application. Wilson died in the following July, some seven months after the date of this contract, having received seven monthly instalments of the annuity.\nThe appellant claims a return of the sum of $10,000 on the ground that, at the date of the application for the contract, the deceased George S. Wilson was, to the knowledge of the Crown, of unsound mind and incapable of managing his affairs.\nIt is not seriously open to dispute that Wilson was of unsound mind. It is established by the evidence, and the learned trial Judge has so found, that he was under the influence of fixed delusions with regard to his wife and his son and had been so for some years, which delusions led him to believe that they had designs against his life, and, moreover, that the purchase of the annuity was the direct result of them. The evidence seems to be conclusive that in spite of the remonstrances of all his friends and advisers he acted on the determination to invest practically the whole of his assets in the purchase of an annuity which would come to an end with his life, partly with the direct object of gratifying his desire that his wife and son should derive no benefit from his estate on his death and partly with the purpose of removing the pecuniary motive which he believed was prompting them to make such attempts.\nNor does there appear to be room for dispute that the postmaster through whom the price of $10,000 was paid was fully aware of these facts. It would be difficult indeed to separate his personal knowledge from his knowledge as postmaster. Wilson\u2019s plan of procuring an annuity had been the subject of discussion between them some years before the date of the contract and it is, I think, established that in his capacity as postmaster, as well as personally, he was aware of Wilson\u2019s mental derangement and that his determination to purchase an annuity was the direct consequence of that derangement. Furthermore, it is a necessary inference, I think, that he knew Wilson\u2019s physical condition and knew that no person of Wilson\u2019s advanced age and in his precarious state of health and capable of any reasonable appreciation of his own interests could have thought of entering into such a transaction involving the payment over of nearly the whole of his assets in return for an annuity terminable with his life.\nThere can be no doubt that if the postmaster, Schooley, had been acting in his own behalf the transaction would have been impeachable on equitable principles on the ground that advantage had been taken of Wilson\u2019s weakness. Nor can there be any doubt, I think, that if the facts known to Schooley had been in the possession of the Superintendent of Annuities, the transaction would have been impeachable on the same ground by Wilson in his life time or by a representative, as for example, a committee.\nWe have not before us a simple case of a contract with a person of unsound mind. The contract, improvident as it was from the point of view of Wilson, to the knowledge of Schooley, in his known mental and physical condition, was one which a court of equity would not allow to stand if entered into between Wilson and any private person, such, for example, as an insurance company, having knowledge of the facts. The necessary inference from the established facts would be that such a person contracting with Wilson in such circumstances was taking advantage of Wilson\u2019s weakness to Wilson\u2019s detriment and to his own benefit, and such a transaction would be set aside by a court of equity on the well settled principles which protect people in Wilson\u2019s condition from being victimized for the benefit of others (Allcard v. Skinner[2]).\nSchooley\u2019s own personal conduct except in one point may well not have been blameworthy. There is no suggestion in the evidence that he encouraged Wilson in the course he had decided upon and, indeed, the facts, apart from some evidence not admissible against the Crown, would point to the contrary. In so far as the circumstance is favourable to the Crown, the Crown is entitled to say there is evidence that Schooley endeavoured to prevent Wilson proceeding with his design. He ought, however, to have communicated the facts to his superior officers.\nIn this case it cannot be said that there was any unfairness in the actual terms of the contract. As regards the Department the contract was one made in the ordinary course and the terms were the usual terms of a contract made with a person of Wilson\u2019s age.\nUnfair, the contract unquestionably was from Wilson\u2019s point of view because of the obvious improvidence of it in the precarious state of his health. It is not necessary for the purposes of this case to go so far as to say that every person dealing with a lunatic, knowing his incapacity, is presumed to perpetrate a meditated fraud upon him and his rights, which appeared to be the view of Wigram V.-C. in Price v. Berrington[3].\nIt is undisputed that the Superintendent of Annuities had no knowledge in fact of the condition of Wilson either physical or mental. A correspondence passed between them both before and after the granting of the annuity and nothing in that correspondence was calculated in the slightest degree to arouse any suspicion on the part of the Superintendent as to the capacity of Wilson to manage his own affairs. Nor is there any suggestion whatever that the Superintendent of Annuities had any knowledge or suspicion of the state of Wilson\u2019s health which made the purchase by Wilson so improvident on his part.\nThe contract as it presented itself to the Superintendent of Annuities was a perfectly fair contract. That is to say, it was fair in its terms. On the other hand, having regard to the condition of Wilson\u2019s health, it was, as already observed, a most improvident arrangement. If the Superintendent of Annuities, having no knowledge in fact, is not to be regarded as having constructive notice of the state of Wilson\u2019s mental and physical health, then I think on the authorities the appellant is without a remedy. If the contract had been unfair in its terms, not, that is to say, a contract in the usual terms of the departmental contracts and not made in the ordinary course of business, another question might have arisen which it is unnecessary to consider.\nThe real question for decision before us is whether, having regard to the ignorance of the Minister and the Superintendent of the cardinal facts, the representatives of Wilson are entitled to restitution, especially in view of the fact that the consideration, for which the sum they now seek to recover was paid, has been fully enjoyed. The phase of that question which it will be convenient first to consider is whether Schooley\u2019s knowledge is imputable to the Crown.\nBy section 4 of the Government Annuities Act, authority is given to His Majesty, represented and acting by the Minister appointed by the Governor in Council to administer the Act, to contract with any person, subject to the provisions of the Act and of any order in council made under the authority of it, for the sale of annuities.\nBy section 5, the purchaser may, by payment of any sum not less than ten dollars, or by payment of a stipulated sum periodically at fixed and definite intervals \u201cto any agent of the Minister appointed under the provisions of this Act,\u201d purchase an annuity under the provisions thereof.\nIt is provided by section 14 that all moneys received under the provisions of the Act shall form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund; and, by section 9, that the Minister may refuse to contract for an annuity in any case where he is of opinion that there are sufficient grounds for refusing to do so. By section 13, the Governor in Council is authorized to make regulations not inconsistent with the Act, inter alia,\n(d) as to the selection of agents of the Minister to assist in executing the provisions of this Act, and the remuneration, if any, to such agents therefor;\nand,\n(h) for the doing of anything incidental to the foregoing matters, or necessary for the effectual execution and working of this Act and the attainment of the intention and objects thereof.\nAt the period with which we are concerned, the Act was administered by the Minister of Labour who was the Minister appointed by the Governor in Council in that behalf. Regulations were made under the authority of section 13 and, by section 7 of the Regulations, it is provided as follows:\u2014\n7. Payments on account of the purchase of Canadian Government Annuities may be made at any Post Office or Sub-Post Office in the Dominion of Canada where a Money Order Office is established, during the hours at which the office is required to be open for the transaction of Post Office business, and the Postmaster or Acting Postmaster of such office is hereby authorized and required to receive such payments, and to remit the same in manner instructed by the Superintendent of Annuities; or the purchaser may, if he prefers, send his payments direct to the Superintendent of Annuities by registered letter; or payments may be made in person at the Annuities Department, Ottawa. Where payment is made by cheque, bank draft, money order, or postal note, it should be drawn to the order of the Receiver General of Canada.\n(a) Every Postmaster or Acting Postmaster of any Post Office or sub-post office in the Dominion of Canada where Money Order business is transacted, other than those whose salaries are paid on a city office basis, shall be allowed a commission of five per cent on all moneys remitted by him for the purchase of deferred annuities.\n(b) A commission of one per cent, shall be allowed to any Postmaster or Acting Postmaster as aforesaid on all moneys remitted by him for the purchase of Immediate Annuities.\n(c) The said rates of commission shall be allowed the Postmaster or Acting Postmaster not only on all moneys remitted by him, but also on all moneys remitted to the Department direct by or on behalf of a purchaser where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Department that the Postmaster or Acting Postmaster was instrumental in inducing the said purchaser to purchase.\n(d) The said rates of commission shall be payable on moneys remitted before as well as since the passing of the Order.\nThe practical operation of this section of the Regulations at the time with which we are concerned is explained by Mr. Blackadar, the Superintendent of Annuities, in his evidence. In the case of post offices in the smaller places where the postmaster as such was paid by commission, and not by salary as in the larger towns and cities, such postmasters were encouraged to press the sale of annuities. Section 4 of the Regulations makes provision with respect to agents \u201cpermanently appointed to assist in executing the provisions of this Act\u201d and for their remuneration. Such agents and the provision for their remuneration are to be approved by the Governor in Council on recommendation of the Minister of Labour.\nAppointment of such agents began in 1927, but, in 1928, there were, as Mr. Blackadar explains, very few and none in Merritton. Mr. Blackadar said that the real agent for the sale of annuities in Merritton would be Mr. Schooley, the postmaster. At that time the Department was by advertisement inviting the public to make application to the local postmaster in respect of contracts of annuities. A circular letter is produced which it is convenient to reproduce in full:\u2014\nDepartment of Labour\nGovernment Annuities Branch,\nOttawa\nDear Sir:\nI am forwarding to you under separate cover all supplies necessary for the transaction of Government Annuities business.\nI am also sending to you herewith a copy of Instructions to Postmasters as to the proper method of handling payments received for the purchase of annuities.\nThe posters should be placed in a conspicuous position in your office where they may be seen by the public. The descriptive booklets are, of course, for distribution to persons who make enquiry, or to those persons who you feel might be interested in the purchase of Government Annuities.\nPostmasters who are on a commission basis are allowed a commission of eleven-fortieths of one per cent. on applications secured or payments received for the purchase of immediate annuities and one per cent. on deferred annuities.\nMany postmasters throughout Canada who devote a portion of their time towards the sale of Government Annuities receive a considerable proportion of their income from this source. I would, therefore, suggest that you familiarize yourself with the various plans of annuity available in order that you may be in a position to intelligently deal with persons making enquiry.\nThe Department of Labour is actively promoting the sale of these annuities and it would be to your personal advantage to do what you can to increase the number of applications being received from your vicinity.\nIf there should be any further information or supplies desired at any time, I shall be glad to hear from you again.\nYours truly,\nE. G. Blackadar,\nSuperintendent.\nThis letter is undated but, admittedly, it was circulated some time prior to November, 1928. The rate of remuneration mentioned was subsequently changed and, in 1928, was that prescribed by section 7 of the Regulations. Mr. Blackadar, on his examination, agreed that the Department was anxious that postmasters should take an active interest in the sale of Government Annuities as the letter, indeed, sufficiently shews.\nIt is not very difficult, I think, to understand the nature of the functions of agents, including postmasters, appointed under the authority of the Act. They had no authority to conclude contracts for the sale of annuities. That is sufficiently clear from the provisions of the statute and section 10 of the Regulations, which provides that all contracts shall be signed by the Actuary and Deputy Minister or Superintendent holding office under the Act for the time being.\nThe postmaster was the agent of the Crown for the purpose of receiving, pursuant to section 5 of the statute, payments for the purchase of annuities which he received for the Annuities Branch of the Labour Department and for which he was required to account to the Superintendent of Annuities.\nIt is true that section 5 speaks of \u201cagent of the Minister\u201d and subsection (d) of section 13 uses the same phrase. But postmasters, at all events, who are already officers of the Crown and authorized as such to receive payments by section 7 of the Regulations, as well as by section 5 of the statute, would appear (inasmuch as moneys received under the provisions of the Act become by section 14, already referred to, part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund), in the receipt of such moneys, to be acting as agents of the Crown.\nBy the provisions of section 7 of the Regulations a postmaster not receiving a salary, such as the postmaster at Merritton, is paid a commission on moneys transmitted by him for the purchase of annuities and on moneys transmitted direct to the Department where the application had been brought about by his efforts.\nIn view of the terms of section 7, the practice of the Department, as illustrated by the circular already reproduced, and as explained by Mr. Blackadar in his evidence, in regarding and treating postmasters within the contemplation of subsections (a), (b) and (c) of section 7, as the postmaster at Merritton, as the \u201creal\u201d agents of the Department would appear to be justified. As such, it would be within the scope of their functions and it would be their duty to give all suitable explanations and proper assistance to persons contemplating the purchase of Government Annuities under this statute. They would also be acting within the scope of their functions under the Regulations in inducing people to become purchasers. Section 7 constitutes a formal representation by the Crown, acting through the Governor in Council, to that effect. These Regulations, it should be noticed, are, by section 16, to be laid before Parliament and are, therefore, public documents intended for the information, not only of all persons who are expected to act under them, but also of the public generally.\nThe difficult question is thus presented: can the knowledge which Schooley possessed, as already explained, of Wilson\u2019s mental and physical weakness and of the obvious improvidence of a purchase by Wilson in the circumstances existing of an annuity terminating with his life, properly be imputed to the Crown? My conclusion is that the question should be answered in the affirmative, although, in expressing that conclusion, I do so with the greatest respect for the President of the Exchequer Court and those who take another view because I fully agree that weighty considerations can be urged against it.\nThe foundation upon which my view rests is this: While full discretion is vested in the Minister in respect of the circumstances in which applications for grants of annuities are to be accepted or rejected; and while, as between the Crown and third parties, the authority of the Minister is co-extensive with this discretion, I nevertheless think that as between the Crown and its officers, who are nominated by Order in Council to execute contracts under the statute, it would be the duty of such officers not to retain the purchase money paid for an annuity if before the execution of the contract it came to their knowledge that the purchase money had been paid by the intending purchaser in circumstances such as have been established as existing in this case.\nAs I have already observed, a private individual entering into such a contract with Wilson with full knowledge of the circumstances would be chargeable on equitable principles with fraud in the sense of taking an unconscientious advantage of the weakness, mental and physical, of the party with whom he was dealing. In my opinion, the departmental officers would not be performing the duty they owe to the Crown if they concluded a contract with an applicant for an annuity in circumstances which were of such a character that, if they were acting in a private capacity, a court of equity would set aside the contract as one obtained by taking a fraudulent advantage of the purchaser\u2019s incapacity to understand and protect his interests. And in speaking of duty, I am speaking of legal duty, not the moral duty which a high minded official recognizes as owing to himself as well as to the public service in which he is employed.\nIt would, moreover, I think, be the plain duty of Schooley\u2014and, once again, I mean by that his legal duty\u2014to communicate to his superior officer, the Superintendent of Annuities, facts coming to his knowledge which would render it the duty of the officers concerned, as between those officers and the Crown, not to conclude the contract for which the application was being made.\nThere still remains the question whether Wilson, having fully enjoyed the consideration, is on that account disabled from obtaining restitution.\nThere is nothing in the judgment in Molton v. Camroux[4], either in the Exchequer Court or in the Exchequer Chamber, to justify the inference that, if advantage had been taken of the lunatic in the bargain there complained of, his representatives would have been without a remedy. Nor is there anything in Lord Cranworth\u2019s judgment in Elliott v. Ince[5] to suggest such an inference. The circumstance that a contract has been executed on both sides is not in itself a bar to relief in the case of fraud. In the present case complete restitution can be made in so far as concerns the property which actually passed. The benefit of the chances of a long life for Wilson cannot, of course, strictly be restored, but in the circumstances of the case that is, and always was, obviously, illusory and there seems to be no obstacle in the way of effecting practical justice.\nMy conclusion is that this case comes within the principle of the judgments of Buckley L.J. and Bray J. in Kettlewell v. Refuge Assurance Co.[6] which seem to have met with the approval of the Lord Chancellor[7]; and that the Crown cannot lawfully retain the money paid to its agent in the circumstances.\nI concur with the disposition of the appeal proposed by Mr. Justice Davis. Crocket, J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and that it should be declared that the suppliant was entitled to receive $9,117.51 with interest from the date of the petition of right.\nDavis, J.\u2014The facts of this case are very exceptional. The deceased, Wilson, on November 30th, 1928, made application to the Government of Canada for the purchase of an annuity which provided monthly payments to him of $126.07, commencing on December 24th, 1928. He paid the local postmaster in the town of Merritton, in the county of Lincoln, in the province of Ontario, which was his place of residence, the sum of $10,000 in cash for the purchase of this annuity. He died on July 24th, 1929, having received pursuant to the provisions of the contract for annuity the total amount of $882,49. The deceased was, at the date of the application for the annuity, in his seventy-fourth year of age. His widow, as executrix of his last will and sole beneficiary, claimed in this action by way of petition of right against the Crown that she was entitled to repayment of the moneys (her counsel admitting that the $882.49 actually received by the deceased should be deducted) upon the ground that her husband was insane at the time he purchased the annuity.\nThe deceased was plainly insane at the time he paid the $10,000 to the Government and remained insane until his death a few months later. The learned trial Judge was satisfied on that point; the conclusion was irresistible upon the evidence. The peculiarity of the case lies in the fact that the deceased\u2019s insanity manifested itself in the most insane delusions as to his wife and son. He was married to his wife in 1884 and they lived together until the time of his death. She had assisted him very materially in the conduct of the small fire insurance business which he carried on in Merritton. The $10,000 had been invested in government bonds prior to the purchase of the annuity and was the major portion of his assets. In fact, he had nothing else but two small dwelling houses, appraised for probate purposes at $4,500, and three bonds of $100 each. His purpose in purchasing the government annuity with the $10,000 was directly in pursuance of his insane delusions against his wife and son. His insane desire was to cheat them out of this money. The learned trial Judge has found, and the evidence fully supports the finding, if I may say so with respect, that the deceased when he entered into the contract to purchase the annuity was incapable of knowing what he was doing except, perhaps, the mechanical act of signing his name to some letters and other documents referable to the contract. But the trial judge, although he found that the local postmaster well knew the physical and mental condition of the man, did not think he was able to give relief to the widow because, in his view, the postmaster\u2019s knowledge could not be imputed to the Crown. The claim was rejected upon the basis of the decision in Molton v. Camroux[8], where Chief Baron Pollock, at pp. 502-503, stated this conclusion:\u2014\nWe are not disposed to lay down so general a proposition, as that all executed contracts bon\u00e2 fide entered into must be taken as valid, though one of the parties be of unsound mind; we think, however, that we may safely conclude, that when a person, apparently of sound mind, and not known to be otherwise, enters into a contract for the purchase of property which is fair and bon\u00e2 fide, and which is executed and completed, and the property, the subject-matter of the contract, has been paid for and fully enjoyed, and cannot be restored so as to put the parties in statu quo, such contract cannot afterwards be set aside, either by the alleged lunatic, or those who represent him. And this is the present case, for it is the purchase of an annuity which has ceased.\nWhile I readily accept and apply that statement of the law to the case of a contract with a lunatic, I would not, without the most careful further consideration (unless the decisions were binding upon this Court), be prepared to accept and apply some of the subsequent decisions which have extended the rule.\nChief Baron Pollock, it is to be observed, presupposed for the purpose of his rule \u201ca contract for the purchase of property which is fair.\u201d No question of the unfairness of the contract in question was raised in the Molton case[9]. A special verdict had been agreed upon in the case which embodied, amongst other findings of fact, the following:\u2014\nThe purchases of the annuities by Thomas Lee were transactions in the ordinary course of the affairs of human life, and the granting of the annuities to him in the manner and upon the terms before mentioned, were fair transactions, ***** When the case went to appeal in the Exchequer Chamber before eight Judges[10], the unanimous judgment of that Court, delivered by Patteson, J., referred to the findings of the special verdict and said:\u2014\nThis does not shew such a state of mind in the grantee as to render him necessarily incapable of knowing the nature of his act, and it negatives all knowledge by the Society of his state of mind, and any suspicion whatever of fraud or unfairness of any kind.\nThe judgment continued:\u2014\nThe question, therefore, is broadly raised, whether the mere fact of unsoundness of mind, which was not apparent, is sufficient to vacate a fair contract executed by the grantee, by payment of the consideration money, and intended bon\u00e2 fide to be executed by the grantor, by payment of the annuity.\nThe judgment concluded:\u2014\n* * * according to the facts stated in this special verdict, the contract in question was not void at law, so as to enable the representatives of the grantee to maintain this action for money had and received.\nStory in his Equity Jurisprudence, 13th ed., Vol. 1, at p. 242, after dealing with fraud as the ground upon which courts of equity interfere to set aside contracts and other acts, however solemn, of persons who are idiots, lunatics and otherwise non compotes mentis, proceeds to say in the next paragraph:\u2014\nBut Courts of Equity deal with the subject upon the most enlightened principles, and watch with the most jealous care every attempt to deal with persons non compotes mentis. Wherever * * * the contract or other act is not seen to be just in itself or for the benefit of these persons, Courts of Equity will set it aside or make it subservient to their just rights and interests. Where indeed a contract is entered into with good faith and is for the benefit of such persons, such as for necessaries, there Courts of Equity will uphold it as well as Courts of Law. And so if a purchase is made in good faith without any knowledge of the incapacity, and no advantage has been taken of the party, Courts of Equity will not interfere to set aside the contract if injustice will thereby be done to the other side, and the parties cannot be placed in statu quo, or in the state in which they were before the purchase.\nFor the purpose of determining this appeal I have considered the case upon the assumption that the Crown had no knowledge of the incapacity of the deceased, and have asked myself the question whether or not the contract can be said to have been a fair bargain in the sense that it was one with which the court should not interfere. The emphasis at the trial, and in fact upon the appeal as well, was put upon the question whether the knowledge of the local postmaster could be imputed to the Crown. The other issue, as to whether or not the contract was in any event a fair bargain, was not stressed. The pleadings very definitely raised the issue. The appellant as suppliant alleged that the annuity was not for the deceased\u2019s benefit nor was it a fair bargain and the Crown pleaded that the purchase of the annuity was for the benefit of the deceased and was a fair bargain. It is somewhat difficult to separate the mental from the physical condition of the deceased for the purpose of determining the rights of the parties, but it is perfectly plain that no man in the physical condition the deceased was in at the time he purchased the annuity would in his right mind have done so. Dr. Chapman, who had treated the deceased off and on quite frequently during the three or four years before the deceased died, said that in November, 1928, when the annuity was purchased, the deceased \u201cwas in a very weakened condition\u201d and that\nyou would not expect him to live a very long period of time. It is a matter of months. The man had had high blood pressure, he was suffering from marked arteriosclerosis for some time previously, he had some kidney trouble and he had a chronic heart that goes along with that picture. Those cases may live a few months or they may pass out in a few weeks.\nIn July, 1929, the deceased attempted to commit suicide by cutting his throat and was examined by Dr. Currey, the local Medical Officer of Health, at the request of a Dr. Ludwig who was of the opinion that Wilson should be sent to the Ontario Hospital for the Insane at Hamilton. Dr. Currey refused to sign the necessary certificate for that purpose. He said at the trial that it would not have been humane to send the man to the institution. \u201cHe was insane but he was so weak that I realized it was only a matter of hours or days at the outside that he would live.\u201d Dr. Currey considered Wilson to be suffering from senile dementia. This type of case, the doctor said, was of very long standing. He did not think he had ever seen a case that took less than two years, at least, to come on, of the type that Wilson had. Another local physician, Dr. Poirier, had been called in in May, 1929, to see Wilson. Dr. Poirier said that Wilson had been sick a long time; he had a very high blood pressure and thickened arteries; he was suffering from what was evidently a progressive deterioration, beginning as a circulatory thing, he judged, and a kidney condition, that was affecting his mental condition, \u201cand that was the progressive affair that evidently had been in progress for some time, a long time.\u201d No one in his senses, in the physical condition this man was in, would have considered handing over to the Government $10,000 for an annuity of $126 a month. It is absurd to think that men dealing at arm\u2019s length and dealing fairly and honestly in terms of an annuity for a man in Wilson\u2019s physical and mental condition would consider a payment of $10,000 for monthly payments of $126 during lifetime as a fair bargain. It would be regarded as an unconscionable thing. Dr. Chapman said he advised the deceased against buying the annuity because he did not think it was wise for a man in his condition. The deceased then told him that several lawyers in St. Catharines had told him the same thing but the deceased said they were \u201call in a ring\u201d and they all said the same. The deceased told him that he considered it good business to save his life and not have others poison him for the sake of getting his money. The deceased\u2019s common expression appears to have been that he would buy this annuity to cheat his wife out of the money.\nIt is contended by counsel for the Crown that, assuming knowledge cannot in this case be imputed to the Crown, the Court is powerless upon the authorities to give any relief and therefore the Crown is entitled to retain the $9,117.51 which remains of the $10,000. I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that on the facts of a case such as this the Court is helpless to do the manifest justice of the case. It is quite true that government annuities are worked out on an actuarial basis solely with reference to age and that it would be a very serious matter in every case in which the annuitant lives but a short time to permit an inquiry into the wisdom of the annuitant in having entered into a contract with the Government. The whole system of government annuities, and a most beneficial system it is to the people of this country, is based upon the natural uncertainty of life. But the case we are dealing with is an extraordinary case. No one would suggest that, if the Government had known the facts, they would for a moment have entertained the application. The Superintendent of Annuities, the officer of the Crown charged with the administration of that branch of the government business, said that the Department does not at any time inquire into the physical condition of applicants for annuities unless representation is made by some interested person who thinks that the party making the application is making an improvident arrangement, and that in such a case, as a matter of practice, the case is taken into consideration and the application may be refused.\nThe contract here in question was made by an insane person and was plainly not a fair bargain, having regard to his physical and mental condition. The contract \u201cis not seen to be just in itself,\u201d to adopt the words of the great Story above quoted. But Story goes further and says that if a purchase is made in good faith without any knowledge of the incapacity and no advantage has been taken of the party (which for my purpose I am assuming to be so in this case) the courts of equity will not interfere to set aside the contract\nif injustice will thereby be done to the other side, and the parties cannot be placed in statu quo, or in the state in which they were before the purchase.\nNo injustice will be done to the Crown in this case if the $10,000 less the $882.49 is returned. Strictly the parties cannot be placed in statu quo, but that limitation can have no practical application where we are dealing only with dollars and cents. One can quite understand the application of that limitation to cases such as Price v. Berrington[11], where the conveyance of the property sought to be set aside had been long executed, with the knowledge of the family, and the purchaser had acted bona fide and had dealt with the estate believing it to be his own and had made important family arrangements upon that footing, the disturbance of which would have been not only highly inconvenient, but unjust. In many cases where contracts with lunatics have been executed, the consequences of setting them aside would be so extensive and so inconvenient that the court ought not to interfere. In the case of Elliott v. Ince[12], Lord Cranworth considered the law on this subject and referred with approbation to the case of Molton v. Camroux[13], stating the principle of that case to be very sound\u2014namely, that an executed contract, where parties have been dealing fairly, and in ignorance of the lunacy, should not afterwards be set aside. He added: \u201cThat was a decision of necessity, and a contrary doctrine would render all ordinary dealings between man and man unsafe.\u201d\nThe case in this appeal was not an ordinary dealing between man and man, and, while in one sense the parties may be said to have been dealing fairly, that is, without any fraud, or imposition or undue influence, the contract was not a fair bargain in the sense that no man with normal mentality would have purchased the annuity in the physical condition Wilson was in at the time of the purchase and no one if he knew the physical and mental condition of Wilson would honestly have entertained the application.\nThere is no difficulty in the limitation against interference where the parties cannot be placed in statu quo. Here it is purely a money matter. The Judicial Committee in Daily Telegraph Newspaper Company Ltd. v. McLaughlin[14], in refusing leave to appeal from the High Court of Australia, after having had the advantage of hearing argument on both sides, said that they saw no reason to doubt that the judgment of the High Court was right. In the High Court it had been said[15]:\u2014\nIt would, however, be an eminently unsatisfactory result of this litigation if he [the plaintiff] were able to recover the shares themselves and also to retain the benefits which were conferred on him, although without his consent or knowledge, by the application of the proceeds of the shares. His counsel have expressly offered to give the defendants the benefits of these proceeds.\nAnd the Court directed that there should be embodied in the decree:\u2014\nthe plaintiff\u2019s submission to indemnify the defendants to the extent of all moneys received by his pretended attorney as the proceeds of the shares in question, against any loss which they may sustain, or any liability which they may incur to other persons by reason of obedience to the decree[16].\nThat was part of the judgment which their Lordships in the Privy Council said they saw no reason to doubt was right.\nIn Neill v. Morley[17], the court refused to set aside a contract of a lunatic, where it appeared to be fair and without notice; especially where the parties could not be reinstated. But Sir William Grant, the Master of the Rolls, at p. 481 said this:\u2014\nThen it comes to the mere fact, that he was a lunatic. The question with reference to that is, how far, under all the circumstances, this Court will interfere to set aside the whole of the lunatic\u2019s transactions; supposing them void at law. That will depend very much upon the circumstances; and no general rule can be laid down upon it.\nIn York Glass Co. Ltd. v. Jubb[18], Lord Justice Sargant at p. 43 reserved a difficulty which a strict application of the decision in Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone[19] might lead to in the future, in that he had not found a single case in which a contract of a lunatic had been binding except where the contract was an ordinary reasonable contract, and declared:\u2014\nI mention that because Warrington, L.J., in his judgment, cited a passage from the judgment of Lord Esher in Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone19 in which he says nothing at all about fairness. On the other hand, Lopes, L.J., deals with it in this way: \u201cIn order to avoid a fair contract on the ground of insanity, the mental incapacity of the one must be known to the other of the contracting parties.\u201d It is possible a question may arise in some future case, with which we have not to deal at present, whether, in the case of a contract which is not a reasonable one and which is made by an insane person that contract can be enforced, the other person not knowing of the insanity. I have looked through a number of cases and I have not found a single case in which a contract has in fact been binding except where the contract was an ordinary reasonable contract. I do not in any way want to attempt to express my own view on that point because the point has not been argued before us. It has not been argued before us because the finding of the learned judge is such as to render the point unnecessary for argument and because he has found, and I agree with his finding, that the contract here was a fair one for a fair and reasonable price. I only want to guard myself by saying that my mind is entirely open on the question whether the fairness of the bargain is an essential element to the enforceability of the bargain against a person who was in fact a lunatic although not known to be such by the other contracting party.\nThough the prayer of the suppliant, strictly read, was to have the contract declared void and the Crown condemned to repay the sum of $10,000, counsel for the appellant never sought to recover more than the amount which remained in the Government\u2019s hands, $9,117.51.\nI would allow the appeal and declare that the suppliant was entitled to the said sum of $9,117.51 with interest from the date of the petition of right, and her costs throughout. Kerwin, J. (dissenting).\u2014Accepting the finding of the President of the Exchequer Court in appellant\u2019s favour that her husband, George S. Wilson, at the time he purchased the annuity was insane so as not to be capable of understanding what he was about, and accepting the finding that Schooley, the postmaster at Merritton, was aware of Wilson\u2019s condition, it is impossible to hold that that knowledge is sufficient to impose liability upon the respondent.\nIt was argued by counsel for appellant that there was in fact no contract, since one of the parties was insane, and reliance was placed upon Daily Telegraph Newspaper Company, Limited v. McLaughlin[20] and Molyneux v. Natal Land and Colonization Company, Limited[21]. In the first of these cases leave was refused to appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Australia[22], and, at pages 779 and 780, Lord Macnaghten, speaking for their Lordships, states that they, \u201chaving had the advantage of hearing argument on both sides, see no reason to doubt that the judgment of the High Court is right.\u201d The question there was as to a power of attorney executed by a man who to the knowledge of the attorney was insane and under which the attorney transferred certain shares of a joint stock company. It was admitted that the company knew nothing of the insanity of the principal. The High Court of Australia held that, having registered the principal as a holder of its shares, the company could not be relieved of its liability to the shareholder by showing that it had transferred the shares on the strength of a document executed by a person who to the knowledge of the appointee did not know what he was doing; that the ordinary rule applied, whereby a party alleging agency is bound to prove it; and that upon the facts as found the company could do this no more than if the power of attorney had been a forgery.\nThe determination of the issues in the Molyneux case21 depended upon the Roman-Dutch law which prevailed in Natal but Sir Henry De Villiers, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, at page 563, stated:\u2014\nEven if the law of England had been applicable to the present case, their Lordships are unable to agree with the majority of the Natal Court that the bond sued upon would have been enforceable. The bond referred to was a mortgage bond which had been passed by virtue of a power of attorney executed by an insane person, and it was held to be legally unenforceable where it appeared that the mortgagor derived no benefit from the bond even though the mortgagee had no knowledge of the insanity.\nThese two cases have no bearing upon the rule to be applied here and are not in conflict with it. In Bawl] Grain Co. v. Ross[23], Mr. Justice Davies, as he then was, points out, at page 234, that a contract such as the one there in question, i.e., a contract entered into by a man whilst in a state of drunkenness,\nis on the same footing as a contract made by a person of unsound mind, whose mental incapacity, in order to avoid the contract, must be known to the other of the contracting parties.\nIn the same case the present Chief Justice of this Court, at page 241, states:\u2014\nThe course of development in the English law of the rule governing the rights of a person entering into a contract or going through the form of entering into a contract while insane is very clearly traced in the judgment of Fry, L.J., in The Imperial Loan Co. v. Stone[24]. Under the old rule the incapable person was by law precluded from setting up his incapacity in answer to an action on the so-called contract. Under the modern rule this disability is removed where it is shewn that the other party had at the time of the transaction knowledge of the incapacity of the other.\nMolton v. Camroux[25] may be taken to have firmly established the modern rule as to commercial contracts by a lunatic to this extent: That even if the lunatic was incapable of understanding what he was doing in the particular transaction, he will be bound by his undertaking where no advantage was taken of him and where the contract has been executed in whole or in part so that the parties cannot be restored to their original position, unless he can also prove that the other party knew of his state of mind or wilfully shut his eyes to means of knowledge of such infirmity. The rule has been extended by the Court of Appeal in Imperial Loan Company v. Stone24 and in York Glass Co. Ltd. v. Jubb[26], but with such amplications we are not concerned. In the present case, while it was objected that the purchase of the immediate annuity by Wilson, a man in the seventy-fourth year of his age, for the sum of ten thousand dollars, which formed the greater part of his assets, was an unwise transaction for a man of his age and general health, no objection was raised as to the consideration for the contract. Nor was it suggested that there was any fraud or imposition practised by anyone upon Wilson in connection with the purchase. Furthermore, the annuity contract was delivered to him upon payment of the money and he received the specified monthly instalments down to the time of his death.\nUnder these circumstances we are bound to hold that the appellant is prohibited from setting up her husband\u2019s incapacity to enter into the annuity contract unless she is able to show that the other party to the contract was aware of Wilson\u2019s condition. The trial judge has found that Schooley was aware of that condition and it therefore becomes necessary to determiner the position he occupied and his authority under the Government Annuities Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 7, and the relevant regulations.\nBy section 3 of the statute, the Act is to be administered by the Minister of Labour. By section 4, His Majesty, represented and acting by the Minister, may contract with any person for the sale of an immediate annuity to any person resident or domiciled in Canada, for the life of the annuitant. By section 7, all contracts for the purchase of annuities are to be entered into in accordance with the values stated in tables prepared under regulations made pursuant to section 13 and for the time being in use. By section 9 the Minister may refuse to contract for an annuity in any case where he is of opinion that there are sufficient grounds for refusing so to do. By section 13 the Governor in Council may make regulations,\n(b) as to the preparation and use of tables for determining the value of annuities; and the revocation of all or any such tables and the preparation and use of other tables;\n(c) as to the mode of making, and the forms of, contracts for annuities, including all requirements as to applications therefor;\n(d) as to the selection of agents of the Minister to assist in executing the provisions of this Act, and the remuneration, if any, to such agents therefor;\n(h) for the doing of anything incidental to the foregoing matters, or necessary for the effectual execution and working of this Act and the attainment of the intention and objects thereof. Number 1 of the Regulations adopts certain tables thereto annexed as the tables to be used for determining the cost and value of an annuity, and Regulation 4 provides:\u2014\nThat the agents permanently appointed to assist in executing the provisions of this Act, and their remuneration, shall be such as may be recommended by the Minister of Labour and approved by the Governor in Council; but the Minister may from time to time employ such temporary assistance as in his opinion is required, and upon such terms as may be agreed upon.\nRegulation 7 (a), (b) and (c) and extracts from a sample of a circular letter forwarded by the Government Annuities Branch to Postmasters are set forth in the reasons for judgment of the learned President and need not be repeated.\nWe were told that annuity contracts are not preceded by an examination of the applicant and that the tables are based upon age only. Schooley was not an agent of the Minister of Labour, selected to assist in executing the provisions of the Act under Regulation 4, issued by virtue of section 13 (d) of the statute. He had no authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the Minister nor had he the power to refuse to contract for an annuity, as such power is conferred by section 9 of the Act upon the Minister only. As a matter of convenience to the public, he was authorized to receive the purchase price of an annuity and was then required to remit it to the Superintendent of Annuities; and that is all he did, with the exception of writing on Wilson\u2019s behalf certain letters, mentioned in the judgment of the President, requesting information with respect to the purchase of an annuity. He received a commission of one per cent. on the basis of the purchase price received and remitted by him and not on the footing that he was \u201cinstrumental in inducing the said purchaser to purchase.\u201d\nIf the annuity had been purchased by direct correspondence between Wilson and the Superintendent of Annuities, in the absence of knowledge by the latter of the former\u2019s infirmity, it could not be contended that the contract was voidable. The intervention of Schooley, under the Act and Regulations, in the manner established by the evidence cannot assist the appellant. Even if Schooley might be termed an agent in any sense of the word, authority was not conferred upon him of such a nature as to impute to the Minister any knowledge he may have had of Wilson\u2019s condition. As stated by Lord Halsbury in Blackburn, Low and Co. v. Vigors (1):\u2014\nI cannot but think that the somewhat vague use of the word \u201cagent\u201d leads to confusion. Some agents so far represent the principal that in all respects their acts and intentions and their knowledge may truly be said to be the acts, intentions, and knowledge of the principal. Other agents may have so limited and narrow an authority both in fact and in the common understanding of their form of employment that it would be quite inaccurate to say that such an agent\u2019s knowledge or intentions are the knowledge or intentions of his principal; and whether his acts are the acts of his principal depends upon the specific authority he has received.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed, but, under the circumstances, without costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Code, ss. 1016, 1024; Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35.\nOn the occasion of a quarrel between appellant and S., appellant killed S., and then killed S.\u2019s wife who had not been present at the quarrel or the killing of S. but on hearing shouts had appeared at her house door a few feet away. Appellant was tried on the charge of murder of S. and was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years penal servitude. He was later tried on the charge of murder of Mrs. S. and was convicted of the crime charged. This conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered on the ground that the trial Judge had misdirected the jury on the question of provocation ([1937] O.R. 693; [1938] S.C.R. 18). Appellant was then tried again on the charge of murder of Mrs. S. and convicted of the crime charged. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed ([1938] O.R. 385), but two Judges dissented, holding that there was error in certain respects in the trial Judge\u2019s charge to the jury and there should be a new trial. Appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (allowing the appeal): There was a mistrial. The conviction should be set aside. The putting before the jury, in the trial Judge\u2019s charge, of a sentence, taken from the judgment of one of the Judges of the Court of Appeal on the appeal from the first conviction of appellant of murder of Mrs. S., that the said Judge in Appeal was \u201cfar from suggesting that the conduct of the accused would not justify a verdict of wilful murder,\u201d constituted, in the circumstances, error of such gravity as to vitiate the verdict. While the trial Judge was entitled, if so advised, to express his own opinion as to the effect of the evidence actually before the jury, it was inadmissible to present to them the opinion of any one that on the former trial the evidence was sufficient to justify a conviction for murder. Moreover, the effect of this was probably accentuated by the record of appellant\u2019s conviction of the murder of Mrs. S. endorsed on the indictment which was put in the jury\u2019s hands, said record being \u201cGuilty\u2014Sentenced to be hanged, May 31, 1937.\u201d In the circumstances of the case, said record should have been withheld from them; a copy of the indictment with the endorsement omitted would have served every legitimate purpose.\nAnother serious objection was that the trial Judge, in answering a question from the jury with regard to provocation, did not direct them in the precise and unambiguous terms in which they ought to have been instructed. Moreover, the terms in which the jury\u2019s question was expressed manifested an erroneous impression that, in proving the killing, the Crown had disposed of the presumption of accused\u2019s innocence and that they must find him guilty of murder unless he affirmatively established to their satisfaction provocation in the pertinent sense; and their question should have been answered in such a manner as to remove this error from their minds; it ought to have been made clear to them that in the last resort the accused could not properly be convicted of murder if, as the result of the evidence as a whole, they were in reasonable doubt whether or not he was guilty of that crime.\nAs to an objection taken by the dissenting Judges in the Court of Appeal to the effect that the trial Judge erred in instructing the jury that they were not concerned with the fact that appellant had been acquitted of the charge of murder of S. and found guilty of the less grave offence of manslaughter:\nHeld per Duff C.J., Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: (1) Plainly, the trial Judge would have committed an error in law if he had told the jury that a finding of provocation in appellant\u2019s trial for murder of S. was conclusive upon the issue of provocation then before them; the issue of provocation was not the same in the two cases. (Opinion expressed that said dissenting Judges had not meant to suggest otherwise on this point).\n2. As to the suggestion that the trial Judge ought to have told the jury that they must take it as an established fact that the acts of S. constituted sufficient provocation to reduce the homicide committed upon him to manslaughter, and, starting from that point, consider the issue of provocation in its bearing upon the charge against appellant of murder of Mrs. S.: Such a direction would probably be calculated to confuse and mislead the jury in respect of the actual issue upon which it was their duty then and there to pass. Moreover, such a direction would have been wrong; the evidence given at the earlier trial (for the killing of S.) was not placed fully before the court nor was the trial Judge\u2019s charge; nor, with such material before him, could the trial Judge (on the trial for the kill- ing of Mrs. S.) have been warranted in directing the jury that at said earlier trial any issue of provocation had been decided; the jury may on that (earlier) trial have thought, without passing upon any such issue, that the evidence raised a sufficient doubt as to accused\u2019s guilt in respect of the charge of murder to require an acquittal on that charge.\nCrocket J., in view of the principle as to the question of provocation which he took to be clearly deducible from this Court\u2019s decision in The King v. Manchuk, [1938] S.C.R. 18, in view of the established fact that appellant, on his trial for murder of S., had been found guilty of manslaughter only, and in view of the circumstances attending the killing of S. and Mrs. S., and it being quite apparent (as he held) that appellant in attacking Mrs. S. was acting upon the same impulse as that which caused him to attack S., was strongly inclined to agree with the reasoning of the dissenting Judges in the Court of Appeal on the applicability of the principles of res judicata.\nAs to the order that ought to be made by this Court:\nPer Duff C.J., Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.: It was clear that the jury must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter; and the Court of Appeal would have authority under s. 1016, Cr. Code, to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the jury and to pronounce sentence upon appellant (Rex v. Hopper, [1915] 2 K.B. 431). By force of s. 1024 Cr. Code, coupled with the enactments of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 35), this Court has authority, not only to order a new trial, or to quash the conviction and direct the prisoner\u2019s discharge, but also to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal was empowered to give in virtue of s. 1016 (2), Cr. Code. Under the exceptional circumstances of the case the last mentioned course is the proper one. The conviction should be set aside, a verdict of manslaughter substituted for the jury\u2019s verdict and appellant sentenced to imprisonment for life.\nPer Crocket J. (dissenting on this point): Considering the proceedings already undergone and in the anomalous circumstances of the case, justice would best be served by quashing the present conviction absolutely. Further, there is no doubt as to this Court\u2019s right to quash the conviction; there may be some doubt as to its right to enter a judgment which necessarily involves its rendering a verdict in a criminal case and itself passing sentence upon it; the wisdom of the latter course is very doubtful; it would signalize an entirely new departure in the exercise of the jurisdiction of this Court in criminal cases.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] sustaining (Middleton and Gillanders JJ.A. dissenting) his conviction, on trial before Hope J. and a jury, of the murder of Amy Seabright at St. Catharines, Ontario, on June 8, 1936.\nJust before the accused killed Amy Seabright, he had killed her husband, John Seabright, in a quarrel. Accused was tried on the charge of murder of John Seabright and was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years penal servitude. He was later tried on the charge of murder of Amy Seabright and was convicted of the crime charged. This conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered on the ground that the trial judge had misdirected the jury on the question of provocation[2]. Accused was tried again on the charge of murder of Amy Seabright and convicted of the crime charged. An appeal by the accused to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed (Middleton and Gillanders JJ.A. dissenting)[3]. From that dismissal the present appeal to this Court was brought. The dissent in the Court of Appeal was, as expressed in the formal judgment of that Court, on the question as to whether there was error in the charge of the learned trial judge, and whether such error amounted to a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The dissenting judges held that there should be a new trial.\nBy the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was allowed; the judgment of the Court of Appeal was set aside; the Court directed that the verdict of murder be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter be entered. Crocket J., dissenting, would quash the conviction absolutely. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for life.\nJ.C. McRuer K.C. and J.J. Bench K.C. for the appellant.\nW.B. Common K.C. and C.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (The Chief Justice and Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.) was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014On the 8th of June, 1936, the appellant William Manchuk killed, first, John Seabright, and, shortly afterwards, his wife, Amy Seabright. Evidence was given by Mrs. Lewis, the daughter of John and Amy Seabright, that, after killing her father, and before the attack upon her mother, Manchuk attempted an attack upon her with the axe with which he killed her parents, but she succeeded in escaping. These tragic events were the culmination of a dispute about the location of a line fence between the properties respectively occupied by the Seabrights and the Manchuks. On the day on which the homicides occurred, John Seabright was engaged in excavating post holes and setting up posts for a fence which would encroach upon property that Manchuk believed to be exclusively his. Manchuk and his wife protested against these proceedings in violent and threatening language and, eventually, Manchuk who, as the evidence shows, notwithstanding his wife\u2019s incitements to violence, had for a time succeeded in keeping himself under control, yielded to a passion of rage and committed the fatal assault on John Seabright, killing him by blows delivered with an axe.\nThe scene of the killing of John Seabright is only a few feet from the porch of the Seabrights\u2019 house. Mrs. Seabright had been within the house during the occurrences just described and had no visible connection with them. She appeared at the door on hearing the shouts of her daughter and was immediately attacked by Manchuk who, with the same weapon, inflicted upon her wounds from which she died shortly afterwards.\nManchuk was tried for the murder of John Seabright, and John Seabright\u2019s acts, already mentioned, were relied upon as constituting provocation. The jury found Manchuk guilty of manslaughter and he was accordingly sentenced to twenty years penal servitude. Manchuk was then tried under an indictment charging him with the murder of Amy Seabright and was convicted of the crime charged. This conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered[4]. The learned trial judge had (it was held by this Court[5], confirming a judgment of the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal) erroneously directed the jury that there was no evidence upon which they could properly find the attack upon Amy Seabright to have been delivered under such provocation as to justify a finding of manslaughter.\nIn the judgment of this Court, the law concerning the nature of provocation in the relevant sense and its effect in justifying a verdict of manslaughter, when in its absence the proper verdict would be one of murder, was in its application to the circumstances of this case explained for the guidance of the trial judge at the new trial. In effect it was stated that, on the issue of provocation, the jury ought to be directed to consider, first, whether the acts of provocation, which proceeded immediately from John Seabright, were of such a character as to deprive a normal person of his self-control to such a degree as might lead such a person to commit an attack upon Mrs. Seabright of the character of that of which Manchuk was guilty; and, second, whether Manchuk in fact did act under such provocation while still under the dominion of the passion excited thereby and under the belief that she was concerned in the acts of provocation relied upon. But the judgment proceeded to say that the learned trial judge would, of course, warn the jury that, on the ultimate issue (raised by the charge of murder), unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Manchuk was guilty of the more heinous crime, it would be their duty not to convict him upon that charge.\nAt the new trial, the accused was found guilty of the murder of Amy Seabright and convicted and sentenced accordingly. An appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed (Mr. Justice Middleton and Mr. Justice Gillanders dissenting)[6] and the case now comes before this Court on appeal from that judgment.\nThe appeal is by law necessarily limited to the grounds upon which those learned judges dissented. Those grounds are three in number. First, the learned judge erred (the learned dissenting judges held) in instructing the jury that they were not concerned with the fact that Manchuk had been acquitted of the charge of murder of John Seabright and had found him guilty of the less grave offence of manslaughter. If we read the judgment of the learned judges rightly, it seems to say that the learned trial judge ought to have told the jury that they must take it as an established fact that the acts of John Seabright constituted sufficient provocation to reduce the homicide committed upon him to manslaughter; and, starting from that point, consider the issue of provocation in its bearing upon the charge against the accused of the murder of Amy Seabright. It sufficiently appears from what has already been said that the issue of provocation was not the same in the two cases, and, plainly, the trial judge would have committed an error in law if he had told them that a finding of provocation in the trial of Manchuk for the murder of John Seabright was conclusive upon the issue of provocation then before them, and we do not think the learned dissenting judges meant to suggest this.\nPutting other considerations aside for the moment, we should have been disposed to think that such a direction as that suggested would foe calculated to confuse and mislead the jury in respect of the actual issue upon which it was their duty then and there to pass; it would, as we are inclined to think, demand from the jury the application of a degree of critical acumen which they could hardly be expected to exercise; and would probably have nullified the judgment of this Court as applicable to this case.\nMoreover, such a direction would, in our opinion, have been wrong. The evidence given at the earlier trial was not placed fully before the court nor was the charge of the learned trial judge. Nor, with such material before him could Mr. Justice Hope have been warranted in directing the jury that at the first trial any issue of provocation had been decided. The jury may on that trial have thought, without passing upon any such issue, that the evidence raised a sufficient doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner in respect of the charge of murder to require an acquittal on that charge.\nWe think, however, that the two other grounds of dissent are well taken and, accordingly, that there was a mistrial.\nThe first of these arises in this way: The learned trial judge put before the jury the following sentence taken from the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Middleton on the last occasion when the case was before the Court of Appeal for Ontario:\u2014\nIn the case in hand I am far from suggesting that the conduct of the accused would not justify a verdict of wilful murder.\nThis, we think, constituted in the circumstances error of such gravity as to vitiate the verdict.\nWhile the learned trial judge was entitled, if he had been so advised, to express his own opinion as to the effect of the evidence actually before the jury, we can have no doubt that it was inadmissible to present to the jury the opinion of any one that on the former trial the evidence was sufficient to justify a conviction of the accused of the murder of Amy Seabright. The mischief was enhanced by the circumstance that this opinion was ascribed to an eminent judge whose authority would naturally carry great weight with the jury. We think nothing said in the charge, either before or later, had or could have the effect of neutralizing this statement of the learned trial judge and rendering it innocuous.\nWe think, moreover, that the effect of it was probably accentuated by the record of the conviction of Manchuk of the murder of Amy Seabright endorsed on the indictment which was put in the hands of the jury. The record was in these words, \u201cGuilty\u2014Sentenced to be hanged, May 31, 1937.\u201d We agree with the dissenting judges that, in the circumstances of the case, this record should have been withheld from them. A copy of the indictment with the endorsement omitted would have served every legitimate purpose.\nWe attach even greater importance to another ground upon which the learned dissenting judges proceeded. The jury, having had the case under consideration for some time, requested the assistance of the learned trial judge upon a difficulty which they explained in the following question:\u2014\nIn order to reduce a murder charge to a manslaughter charge, is it necessary to establish the fact that the person killed committed the act of provocation?\nIn the opinion of the dissenting judges, the jury were not given a direction in the precise and unambiguous terms in which they ought have been instructed in answer to their request; and we find ourselves in agreement with them. The learned trial judge appears to have read, interlarded with comments of his own, nearly the whole of the judgment of this Court, but with the significant exception presently to be noted, on the appeal already mentioned. The judgment contained a considerable amount of discussion of principle and authority as touching the point on which we found ourselves unable to accept the view of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. In the earlier part of his charge the learned trial judge had discussed the subject of provocation in a manner calculated to convey an impression that there were differences of opinion among Canadian judges upon the very question which the jury had addressed to him. We are not satisfied that the lengthy answer of the learned trial judge, expressed as it was in general terms, was calculated to convey to the jury a right conception of what might constitute provocation under the law.\nThe dissent of the learned dissenting judges, moreover, embraces another objection to this part of the charge, which, in our opinion, is, perhaps, still more serious. The terms in which the question is expressed manifest plainly that (notwithstanding some observations in the earlier part of the charge as to the burden resting upon the Crown up to the end of the case of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt) they had fallen into the very natural error of thinking that, in proving the killing, the Crown had disposed of the presumption of the prisoner\u2019s innocence and that they must find the prisoner guilty of murder unless he affirmatively established to their satisfaction provocation in the pertinent sense. The interrogatory of the jury ought to have been answered in such a manner as to remove this error from their minds. It ought to have been made clear to them that in the last resort the prisoner could not properly be convicted of murder if, as the result of the evidence as a whole, they were in reasonable doubt whether or not he was guilty of that crime. The last sentence of the judgment of this Court which was put before the jury almost in its entirety, deals with this point and that sentence was not even read to them (Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7]).\nThere remains for consideration the grave question as to the order that ought to be made by this Court. We have concluded, after full consideration, that, by force of section 1024, coupled with the enactments of the Supreme Court Act, this Court has authority, not only to order a new trial, or to quash the conviction and direct the discharge of the prisoner, but also to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal for Ontario was empowered to give in virtue of s. 1016 (2); and we have no doubt that this last mentioned course is the proper one in the very exceptional circumstances of this case. The accused has been tried three times under charges of murder arising out of a succession of occurrences which occupied in time not more than a few minutes. The last two convictions have both been set aside by reason of the irregular conduct of the trials leading to those convictions; the first by a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed by this Court; and, now, the second, by the judgment of this Court. We cannot think that to order a fourth trial would be entirely consonant with the spirit of our criminal procedure; and we think the ends of justice will be met by the judgment we now pronounce.\nThe finding makes it clear that the jury must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and we are, consequently, of opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority under s. 1016 to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the jury and to pronounce sentence upon the prisoner (Rex v. Hopper[8]).\nThe conviction should be set aside, a verdict of manslaughter should be substituted for the verdict of the jury and the accused sentenced to imprisonment for life.\nCROCKET J. (dissenting as to the order to be made)\u2014In December last this Court on an appeal by the Crown affirmed a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal setting aside a conviction of Manchuk for the murder of one, Amy Seabright, and ordering a new trial on the ground that the trial judge by instructing the jury that there must be provocation by the victim had withdrawn from their consideration the question of provocation[9]. The clear implication of this decision, as I view it, is that, notwithstanding there was no evidence of any provocation whatever on the part of the victim herself, there nevertheless was evidence upon which the jury might reasonably have found that in attacking her as he did he did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation within the meaning of s. 261 of the Criminal Code, that is to say, caused by any wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, if the offender acts upon it on the sudden and before there has been time for his passion to cool. No other principle, to my mind, is fairly deducible from that decision as regards the question of provocation than that it is not always necessary to constitute provocation under s. 261 of the Criminal Code that it should proceed immediately and directly from the victim herself, but that, on the contrary, a wrongful act or insult, committed or given by a third person under such circumstances as the evidence in this case disclosed, may constitute such provocation if the offender in his attack upon the victim acted upon it on a sudden and before his passion had time to cool and under the belief that the victim was a party to any such act, although not implicated in it in fact.\nIt was admitted by counsel for the Crown and for the appellant that the evidence on the second trial, bearing on the crucial issue of provocation, was to all intents and purposes the same as that on the first trial.\nThis shews that Manchuk had been previously tried on an indictment charging him and his wife jointly with the murder of John Seabright on June 8th, 1936, upon which he was found guilty of manslaughter only; that during the forenoon of that day, while John Seabright was attempting against the protests of both Mr. and Mrs. Manchuk to replace a post of a board fence, which a sworn surveyor had found to encroach between one and two feet on Manchuk\u2019s home property and which as a consequence had recently been removed, the accused, after having succeeded in restraining his wife from attacking Seabright with a stone and later with an axe which he took away from her, and after having himself requested Seabright to desist and go home, finally became so enraged at Seabright\u2019s determined defiance of his property rights, that, while the latter\u2019s daughter (Mrs. Lewis) was standing by the post hole with a hammer in her hand, he struck him three times in rapid succession with the axe he still had in his hand, and killed him; and that within the course of a moment or two at the most, after first attempting an attack upon Mrs. Lewis, who yelled and ran away, he rushed across the driveway to the back porch of the Seabright house, in which Mrs. Seabright had suddenly appeared, and there on or in front of the steps at a distance of but 11 feet from the spot where he had killed her husband, struck her with the same axe and caused her death. There is absolutely nothing to shew that Mrs. Seabright said or did anything before Manchuk saw her that morning, and it is quite apparent that in attacking her he was acting upon the same impulse as that which caused him to attack her husband at the post hole. This obviously is the view of Mr. Justice Middleton, and the basis on which he has so interestingly dealt with the question of the applicability of the principles of res judicata. While I am strongly inclined to agree with his reasoning in this regard, it does not seem to be necessary to consider it beyond its possible bearing on the question of the final disposition of this appeal. If it were recognized in this case that the rule that a question of fact distinctly put in issue and directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be disputed in a subsequent proceeding between the same parties or their privies was as applicable to criminal as well as to civil proceedings, it would have the merit, at least, of rendering impossible the repetition of such an extraordinary and anomalous development as that which this unfortunate and tragic case illustrates.\nWith great respect, I should be disposed to think that a person who has been tried on an indictment charging him with murder in the killing of S. and found guilty, not of murder but of manslaughter only\u2014clearly on the ground of provocation\u2014and sentenced therefor to 20 years penal servitude; has subsequently undergone a trial on another murder indictment for the killing of S.\u2019s wife practically at the same time and within but a few feet of the spot where he slew her husband, and apparently acting upon the same provocation, and nevertheless been convicted on that indictment for murder and undergone the ordeal of waiting for the infliction of the necessary death penalty; and then, in consequence of this conviction having been set aside on the ground that the all important question of provocation was improperly withdrawn from the jury, having undergone a second trial on the same indictment, and been again erroneously convicted and sentenced to death while still serving a sentence of 20 years imprisonment for killing Seabright in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation\u2014has surely suffered adequate punishment for the crime to which he was provoked under such circumstances and which in those circumstances can be treated as two separate and distinct offences only by the application of the strictest rules of law.\nIn my opinion, as this Court has unanimously decided that there was such error in the conduct of the second trial as to vitiate the verdict for the reasons stated in the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice, justice will best be served in the anomalous circumstances of this case by quashing the present conviction. To send the accused back on what will really be his fourth trial for murder is so repellent that it ought to be avoided, if at all possible. I confess that I have great doubt as to the wisdom of this Court entering a judgment which necessarily involves our rendering a verdict in a criminal case and ourselves passing sentence upon it. There may possibly be some doubt as to our right to do so. There can be none as to our right to quash the conviction.\nIf a new conviction is now found by us, it can only be for manslaughter in causing the death of Mrs. Seabright by reason of the accused having attacked her while still in the heat of passion caused by the same provocation under which he slew her husband. The infliction upon him now of any further term of imprisonment to run concurrently with that of the 20-year sentence he is now serving would really add nothing to his punishment, while it would signalize an entirely new departure in the exercise of the jurisdiction of this court in criminal cases.\nAppeal allowed; the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside; direction that the verdict of murder be quashed and a verdict of manslaughter entered; appellant sentenced to imprisonment for life.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.J.

Stephens married Colonel Hamilton Gault at Montreal where they were both domiciled. They lived together in matrimony until 1914, when Colonel Gault went to France in command of a Canadian regiment and remained a member of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in France and in England until the end of the war. In the years 1916 and 1917 difficulties arose between Gault and his wife. In 1917 cross actions for separation from bed and board were commenced and subsequently abandoned; and petition and cross-petition for divorce were lodged and also subsequently withdrawn. About November, 1917, dame Stephens went to London, then to Paris, where she carried on works of charity in aid of victims of the war. In the fall of 1918, Colonel Gault and his wife, being both in France, engaged in their respective duties, because of the war, the latter instituted an action for divorce against her husband before the Civil Tribunal of First Instance of the Department of the Seine, Paris, which action was maintained by a judgment of that Tribunal, on the 20th of December, 1918. On the 14th of October, 1919, the respondent went through a form of marriage in Paris with dame Stephens, in compliance with all the formalities required by French law, the marriage having been preceded by an execution of a marriage contract, whereby inter alia the parties to it purported to submit their matrimonial affairs to the laws of Italy. They lived together as man and wife until the end of July, 1925, when they executed a separation agreement in Rome by which inter alia the respondent acknowledged payment of $5,000 in consideration of which he waived all present or future claim for aliment. At that time dame Stephens ceased to cohabit with the respondent and shortly afterwards returned to the province of Quebec where she continued to live until her death in 1930. An action was brought in May, 1931, by the respondent against the appellant as executor of the last will and testatment of the late dame Stephens; and the respondent\u2019s claim was that, as the husband or the putative husband of the late dame Stephens, he was entitled, in virtue of Italian law, to the usufruct of one-third of the estate of the latter. The trial judge and the appellate court held the respondent was entitled to succeed; and accordingly an accounting was directed.\nHeld, that the Court in France had no jurisdiction to pronounce a decree of divorce and to dissolve the marriage tie, such judgment not being recognizable in the courts of Quebec where the domicile of both spouses was situated at the date of the judgment; and that therefore the marriage between the respondent and dame Stephens was null ab initio; but\nHeld, Cannon J. dissenting, that, the good faith of the respondent not being disputed, the marriage was a putative marriage in the sense of the Italian law as well as of the law of Quebec and that the status of dame Stephens and the respondent was during her lifetime that of putative spouses within the intendment of articles 163 and 164 of the Civil Code. Thus the marriage settlement and the putative marriage itself produced their \u201ccivil effects\u201d quoad property as if the putative marriage had been a real one; and, both by the law of Quebec and that of Italy, among these \u201ccivil effects\u201d would be included any share of the husband or wife in good faith in the succession of his or her consort. Therefore, the respondent, his nationality having remained unchanged, has the right, among the rights flowing from the putative marriage, to demand the share in the succession of his putative wife to which he would have been entitled by Italian law, had the marriage been valid[1].\nPer Cannon J. dissenting.\u2014The courts of the province of Quebec should merely declare, in deciding the issues raised by the respondent\u2019s action, that the marriage invoked by the latter and the marriage settlement preceding it should receive no effect before these courts, and no declaration should be made as to their validity, as such a decision would not be within the scope of their jurisdiction. Even assuming such jurisdiction, the first husband not having been made a party to the respondent\u2019s action, no judgment concerning the validity of the divorce granted in Paris would be binding on him\u2014Moreover, the respondent cannot claim the advantages insulting from the provisions of article 163 C.C. Even assuming good faith, the respondent cannot include among the \u201ccivil effects\u201d of the putative marriage a change of nationality for dame Stephens from British to Italian; and the respondent has not established otherwise that dame Stephens had acquired Italian nationality through a marriage recognized as valid by the courts of Quebec and that she had retained such nationality at the time of her death. Therefore the respondent\u2019s action should be dismissed.\nBerthiaume v.

Stephens.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C., Geo. H. Montgomery K.C. and L. H. Ballantyne K.C. for the appellant.\nJohn T. Hackett K.C. and J. E. Mitchell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The action out of which this appeal arises was brought by the respondent Falchi against the appellant as executor of the last will and testament of the late Marguerite Claire Stephens. The respondent\u2019s claim in brief was that, as the husband or the putative husband of the deceased Marguerite Claire Stephens, he was entitled, in virtue of Italian law, by which he alleged the determination of the issue is governed, to the usufruct of one-third of the estate of the appellant\u2019s de cujus.\nThe trial judge, Mr. Justice Philippe Demers, and the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench unanimously held the respondent entitled to succeed and, accordingly, an accounting was directed, further adjudications being reserved.\nA brief statement of the facts is unavoidable. The late Marguerite Claire Stephens and Colonel Hamilton Gault were married in Montreal on the 16th of March, 1904, both being British subjects and domiciled in the province of Quebec. They lived together in matrimony until 1914 when Colonel Gault went to France in command of a Canadian regiment; he remained a member of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in France and in England until the end of the war, returned to Canada for demobilization and was struck off the strength of the Expeditionary Force on the 21st of December, 1919.\nDifficulties arose between Colonel Gault and his wife in the years 1916 and 1917, cross actions for separation were commenced, and on the 30th of March, 1917, a judgment of separation was given in the wife\u2019s action against her husband. There was an appeal but the judgment was desisted from and proceedings on both sides were abandoned.\nA little earlier, petition and cross-petition for divorce had been lodged with the Senate of Canada and, subsequently, withdrawn. On the 20th of December, 1918, a judgment of divorce was pronounced between them at the instance of the wife by the Civil Tribunal of First Instance of the Department of the Seine, Paris.\nIt is not seriously open to dispute that at the date of this judgment the domicile of both spouses was in Quebec. The French tribunal had, therefore, no authority recognizable by the courts of Quebec to pronounce a decree dissolving the marriage tie. By the law of Quebec, marriage is dissoluble only by Act of Parliament or by the death of one of the spouses. By article 6 of the Civil Code, status is determined by the law of the domicile.\nThe facts resemble those under examination in the case of Stevens v. Fisk[3]. The husband was domiciled in Quebec and there also, since they were not judicially separated, by the law of Quebec, was the domicile of the wife. The wife having complied with the conditions of residence necessary to enable her under the law of New York to sue for divorce in that state and, under those laws, to endow the courts of the State with jurisdiction to grant her such relief, obtained there a judgment for divorce a vinculo; the husband having appeared in the proceedings and taken no exception to the jurisdiction. It is not quite clear that the wife, had she been free to acquire a separate domicile, would not have been held to have done so; here there is no room for dispute that Mrs. Gault never acquired a French domicile in fact.\nIn both cases, therefore, the domicile of both consorts was in Quebec; in the one, in fact; in the other, in case of the wife, by force of law. It may at this point be recalled that, by the law of Quebec (Art. 207 C.C.) the wife acquires, as one of the consequences of separation from bed and board, the capacity to choose for herself a domicile other than that of her husband. The critical issue in Stevens v. Fisk3 was whether in these circumstances the Quebec courts should recognize the New York divorce. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench by a majority (of whom Dorion C.J. was one) held the divorce invalid in Quebec. This judgment was reversed in this Court[4] but Mr. Justice Strong dissented, explicitly agreeing with the conclusion as well as the reasoning of the majority of the Queen\u2019s Bench. The consid\u00e9rants I am about to quote express the grounds of the judgment in the Queen\u2019s Bench and, as we shall see, are entirely in accord with the principles now established by judgments of the Privy Council. At the time, it had the weighty support of the two great judges whose names I have specified.\nThe consid\u00e9rants are these:\u2014\nConsidering that the parties in this cause were married in the year 1871 in the state of New York, one of the United States of America, where they were then domiciled;\nConsidering that shortly after, to wit, about the year 1872, they removed to the city of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, with the intention of fixing their residence permanently in the said province;\nAnd considering that the said appellant has been engaged in business and has constantly resided at the said city of Montreal since his arrival in 1872, and that he has acquired a domicile in the province of Quebec;\nAnd considering that the female respondent has only left the domicile of her husband at the city of Montreal in 1876, and obtained her divorce from the appellant in the state of New York, in the year 1880, while they both had their legal domicile in the province of Quebec;\nAnd considering that under article 6 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, parties who have their domicile in the province of Quebec are governed even when absent from the province by its laws respecting the status and capacity of such parties;\nAnd considering that according to the laws of the province of Quebec marriage is indissoluble, and that divorce is not recognized by said laws, nor are the courts of justice of the said province authorized to pronounce for any cause whatsoever a divorce between parties duly married;\nAnd considering that the decree of divorce obtained by the female respondent in the state of New York has no binding effect in the province of Quebec, and that notwithstanding such decree, according to the laws of the said province the female respondent is still the lawful wife of the appellant, and could not sue the said appellant for the restitution of her property without being duly authorized thereto.\nThese consid\u00e9rants rest upon the principles of law applicable to the question now before us. The governing principle is explained in the judgment delivered by Lord Watson, speaking for the Privy Council in Le Mesurier v. Le Mesurier[5] as follows:\u2014\nTheir Lordships have in these circumstances, and upon these considerations, come to the conclusion that, according to international law, the domicile for the time being of the married pair affords the only true test of jurisdiction to dissolve their marriage. They concur, without reservation, in the views expressed by Lord Penzance in Wilson v. Wilson[6] which were obviously meant to refer, not to questions arising in regard to the mutual rights of married persons, but to jurisdiction in the matter of divorce;\nIt is the strong inclination of my own opinion that the only fair and satisfactory rule to adopt on this matter of jurisdiction is to insist upon the parties in all cases referring their matrimonial differences to the Courts of the country in which they are domiciled. Different communities have different views and laws respecting matrimonial obligations, and a different estimate of the causes which should justify divorce. It is both just and reasonable, therefore, that the differences of married people should be adjusted in accordance with the laws of the community to which they belong, and dealt with by the tribunals which alone can administer those laws. An honest adherence to this principle, moreover, will preclude the scandal which arises when a man and woman are held to be man and wife in one country and strangers in another.\nThis principle has since been applied in Lord Advocate v. Jaffrey[7] and Attorney-General for Alberta v. Cook[8].\nThe principle of this judgment is, in my opinion, applicable to the circumstances of this case. The rule laid down by article 185 of the Civil Code is in itself unequivocal. \u201cMarriage,\u201d it says,\ncan only be dissolved by the natural death of one of the parties; while both live, it is indissoluble.\nSo long as both the spouses have their domicile in Quebec, dissolution of marriage can, as already observed, only be affected by an enactment of a competent legislature. The wife, it is true, has capacity to acquire a domicile separate from her husband where a judicial separation has been pronounced and is in force; and, by article 6, the laws of Lower Canada\ndo not apply to persons domiciled out of Lower Canada, who, as to their status and capacity, remain subject to the laws of their country.\nDifficult questions may arise in the application of these rules and principles of the Code in respect of jurisdiction in matrimonial proceedings where a decree of judicial separation having been pronounced the husband remains domiciled in Quebec While the wife has acquired for herself a domicile elsewhere. It is unnecessary to enter upon a discussion of this subject. One conceivable view is that in such a case no court has jurisdiction to pronounce a decree of divorce between the parties recognizable by the law of Quebec.\nAs regards the divorce proceedings to which reference has just been made, I can see no reason for refusing to apply the principle of the judgments of the Privy Council in view of the fact that both parties were at the time domiciled in Quebec.\nOn the 14th of October, 1919, the respondent went through a form of marriage in Paris with Mrs. Gault (the late Marguerite Claire Stephens), the marriage having been preceded by the execution of a marriage contract on the 3rd of October, 1919, whereby inter alia the parties to it purported to submit their matrimonial affairs to the laws of Italy. They lived together as man and wife in Italy, France and the province of Quebec until the 2nd of July, 1925, when they executed a separation agreement in Rome by which inter alia the respondent acknowledged payment of the sum of $5,000 in consideration of which he waived all present or future claim for aliment and declared:\u2014\nI approve the above payment and declare that I renounce every other payment that my wife might be obliged to make after her death.\nOf this agreement the respondent undertook to obtain confirmation by the proper tribunal but failed to do so; there is unanimity of opinion in the courts below that this document could not operate as a valid renunciation of rights in an unopened succession. At this time the late Marguerite Claire Stephens ceased to cohabit with the respondent, and shortly afterwards returned to the province of Quebec where she continued to live until her death.\nThe learned trial judge and three of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench came to the conclusion that this marriage was null ab initio,\u2014and with this I agree. It is not, I think, without relevancy that Marguerite Claire Stephens was a British subject and, as regards her, therefore, this marriage was under the ban of the Statute of James, (Earl Russell\u2019s case[9]).\nBefore proceeding further, I ought to notice an argument to the effect that Colonel Gault, having appeared in the divorce proceedings in Paris instituted by the late Marguerite Claire Stephens, the judgment in those proceedings must be taken as valid as against the appellant, on the ground that she in her lifetime was estopped from disputing the jurisdiction of the Paris court and that he is in no better position; and, again, that the Paris divorce stands as a valid judgment until it is competently set aside. This view was accepted by the majority of the judges of this Court in Stevens v. Fisk[10]. It will not be necessary to examine those judgments. It results from Le Mesurier v. Le Mesurier[11] and the decisions based upon it that, the court having no jurisdiction to dissolve the marriage tie, the judgment cannot be recognized in the courts of Quebec. It follows also from the principles laid down in those judgments that consent on the part of the spouses to the exercise of jurisdiction is of no significance.\nI have come to the conclusion that the good faith of the respondent not being disputed, the marriage was a putative marriage in the relevant sense. It is, nevertheless, important, as Mr. Geoffrion contended, in considering the \u201ccivil effects\u201d to be ascribed to that marriage for the benefit of the respondent, to bear in mind that it was in the strict sense a bigamous marriage, a marriage which could not deprive the putative wife of her British nationality because her nationality remained that of her lawful husband. It could not, moreover, as I humbly think, confer upon the respondent any rights incompatible with the recognition of the status of the lawful husband as bound to Marguerite Claire Stephens as such, or of the status of Marguerite Claire Stephens as bound to him as his lawful wife.\nSo long as the vinculum of the real marriage subsisted, no act, as I humbly think, of either of the spouses, no form of marriage in which either of them might participate could deprive her of the legal status of his wife or him of the legal status of her husband.\nThe status of Marguerite Claire Stephens and the respondent was during her lifetime that of putative spouses within the intendment of articles 163 and 164. As I venture to think, the true position is stated by Pothier in the following passage. (Pothier, Vol. 6, 197, nos. 437 and 438):\u2014\nle cas auquel un mariage, quoique nul, a des effets civils, est lorsque les parties qui l\u2019ont contract\u00e9, \u00e9taient dans la bonne foi, et avaient une juste cause d\u2019ignorance d\u2019un emp\u00eachement dirimant qui le rendait nul.\nOn peut apporter pour exemple le cas auquel la femme d\u2019un soldat qu\u2019on avait vu, le jour d\u2019un combat, couch\u00e9 parmi les morts sur le champ de bataille, et qu\u2019on avait en cons\u00e9quence cru mort, quoiqu\u2019il ne le fut pas, se serait mari\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre homme, sur la foi d\u2019un certificat de mort de son mari, en bonne forme, qu\u2019elle aurait du major du r\u00e9giment. Si longtemps et depuis qu\u2019elle a eu des enfants de ce second mariage, son premier mari, qu\u2019on croyait mort, vient \u00e0 repara\u00eetre, il n\u2019est pas douteux que le second mariage que cette femme a contract\u00e9, est nul; qu\u2019elle doit quitter son second mari, et retourner avec le premier; son premier mariage qui a toujours subsist\u00e9, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 un emp\u00eachement dirimant du second; mais quoique ce second mariage soit nul, la bonne foi des parties qui l\u2019ont contract\u00e9 lui donne, par rapport aux enfants qui en sont n\u00e9s, les effets civils que produisent les mariages, en donnant aux enfants les droits de famille, et tous les autres droits qu\u2019ont les enfants n\u00e9s d\u2019un l\u00e9gitime mariage. En cons\u00e9quence les enfants n\u00e9s de ce second \u00abmariage viendront aux successions de leurs p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, et m\u00eame concourrent \u00e0 celle de leur m\u00e8re avec les enfants qu\u2019elle a eus de son premier mariage.\nComment, direz-vous, ce mariage qui est nul peut-il donner ces droits aux enfants qui en sont n\u00e9s? car, quod nullum est, nullum producit effectum. La r\u00e9ponse est que si ce mariage, en tant qu\u2019il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme nul, ne peut pas les leur donner, la bonne foi des parties qui l\u2019ont contract\u00e9 les leur donne, en suppl\u00e9ant \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard au vice du mariage.\n438. La bonne foi des parties qui ont contract\u00e9 un mariage nul, donne-t-elle pareillement \u00e0 ce mariage les effets civils, \u00e0 l\u2019effet de confirmer entre elles leurs conventions matrimoniales, et de donner \u00e0 la femme un douaire? Il y a m\u00eame raison.\nOn opposera que les conventions matrimoniales d\u00e9pendent de la condition, si nuptias sequantur, laquelle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplie, puisqu\u2019on ne peut pas dire qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies d\u2019un mariage entres les parties; celui qui a suivi n\u2019\u00e9tant pas un v\u00e9ritable mariage, puisqu\u2019il est nul. La r\u00e9ponse est, que la bonne foi des parties qui l\u2019ont contract\u00e9, suppl\u00e9e \u00e0 la nullit\u00e9 de ce mariage, et fait regarder la condition comme accomplie, de m\u00eame qu\u2019elle fait regarder comme l\u00e9gitimes les enfants qui en sont n\u00e9s.\nIt will be observed that Pothier says not a word to sanction the view that the solemnization of the second marriage affects the status of the parties to the lawful marriage. He is very careful to make it clear that the rights which that solemnization engenders are rights springing from the good faith by which the parties were actuated; rights which would have been \u201ccivil effects\u201d of the ceremony if the former husband, erroneously supposed to be dead, had been dead in truth.\nI shall have to revert to this topic.\nBefore proceeding further, it is necessary to consider the question of the domicile of Marguerite Claire Stephens at the time of her death.\nMr. Geoffrion earnestly pressed upon us the contention that, since the decree of separation pronounced in 1917 was desisted from with the consent of the husband, the cause was thereby by force of section 548 of the Code of Civil Procedure, put in the same position \u201cas it was in before the judgment.\u201d I should have been disposed to think, were it not for the views expressed in the Quebec courts, that since the law favours the removal of obstacles to the reunion of separated spouses, and since the d\u00e9sistement from the judgment in due form with the common consent of both parties would be one step on the way, effect ought to be given in the case of a judgment of separation to this article of the Code of Civil Procedure as in the case of other judgments. On this point, however, I defer to the views of the Quebec judges. Mr. Justice Demers appears to entertain no doubt that the only way in which the separation decree could be abrogated would be by actual reunion of the husband and wife as contemplated by article 130; and the majority of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench appear to agree with him.\nThe question whether or not the putative wife did acquire a domicile separate from that of her lawful husband by reason of the putative marriage is a question to be settled by the law of Quebec. The courts of Quebec administer the law of Quebec and no other law. If they apply the rules of the law of another country, it is because the law of Quebec commands them to do so in the circumstances. Whether or not the conditions are such as to require the application of the rules of law of another country is a question they must decide under their own law as to what constitutes domicile and what are the conditions under which a change of domicile takes place.\nIf, at the date of the putative marriage, the judicial separation was not still in force, the Quebec domicile of the putative wife was not, I think, lost in consequence of that marriage because she could not acquire another domicile consistently with due recognition of the existing lawful marriage; as such recognition imports identity of domicile of the spouses.\nIf the judicial separation was still in force (and I am accepting that view) there are great difficulties, as I see it, in holding that ipso jure her domicile became the domicile for the time being of the putative husband.\nThese alternatives, however, do not exhaust the possible situations. Since, on the last mentioned hypothesis, by the law of Quebec, she was free to acquire another domicile in fact, it is, on that hypothesis, a question of fact whether or not a change of domicile did take place. In my view of the facts, the marriage contract, the putative marriage, the residence in Italy, constitute evidence from which the inference ought to be drawn that she acquired an Italian domicile in fact. I think, nevertheless, that in point of fact she reverted to her domicile of origin when she ascertained the invalidity of the putative marriage and returned to reside in Quebec. Before she had ascertained the true legal position she was living separately from her putative husband by agreement, and, once she ascertained the truth, it was, as Pothier points out, her duty no longer to cohabit with him. The evidence, it appears to me, points conclusively to an intention on her part to establish herself permanently in Quebec.\nThis brings us to the precise question raised by the appeal: Has the respondent the right, among the rights flowing from the putative marriage, to demand the share in the succession of the putative wife to which he would have been entitled by Italian law had the marriage been valid and the nationality of the husband remained (as it has remained) unchanged?\nSince the litigation is in the courts of Quebec and the domicile of the de cujus was, at her death, in the province of Quebec, this question must be determined by the law of Quebec, regard being had, of course, to the Italian law to the extent to which, for this purpose, the law of Quebec recognizes and applies it in the circumstances. As regards the \u201ccivil effects\u201d of putative marriage, there appears to be no pertinent difference between the law of Italy and that of Quebec.\nThe claim of the respondent, accordingly, rests upon the principle of articles 163 and 164 of the Civil Code which are in these terms:\u2014\n163. a marriage although declared null, produces civil effects, as well with regard to the husband and wife as with regard to the children, if contracted in good faith.\n164. If good faith exist on the part of one of the parties only, the marriage produces civil effects in favour of the children issue of the marriage.\nNow, the first thing to be observed is that these articles are not limited in their operation to marriages in Quebec. In Berthiaume v. Dastous[12] the marriage had been celebrated in France; although by French law in point of form radically null, \u201cvoid,\u201d as the judgment of the Privy Council says, \u201cab initio,\u201d and consequently (as the cause of nullity concerned solemnization) null by the law of Quebec on the principle locus regit actum. The right which was there affirmed (right to alimony after a declaration of nullity) was recognized as one of the \u201ccivil effects\u201d of this marriage solemnized in France. Here, the personal law of each of the spouses at the critical moment, the death of Marguerite Claire Stephens, recognizes the \u201ccivil effects\u201d produced by putative marriages; and in their application to the circumstances of this case according to the same principles.\nMy conclusion is that, both by the law of Quebec and that of Italy, among the \u201ccivil effects\u201d would be included any share of the husband or wife in good faith, as the case might be, in the succession of his or her consort. I am now considering the scope of \u201ccivil effects\u201d in the general sense, and I think the proper conclusion is that it includes any share in the inheritance to which the putative consort in good faith would be entitled in the events which have actually happened if the marriage had been a real one; subject, in the case of a bigamous marriage, to full recognition of the lawful marriage and the rights arising out of it. In this case, there is no suggestion that the rights of the real husband come into competition. That, as I understand it, is in substance the view of Mr. Justice Demers.\nLord Dunedin points out, if I may say so, with great force, that the children are linked with husband and wife in these articles. Pothier, it will be noticed, in the passage quoted above, expressly includes hereditary rights among the \u201ccivil effects\u201d of which the children take the benefit. Hereditary rights are included under Scotch law (Fraser, Husband and Wife, Vol. I, 152) and, as regards Italian law, there is no serious dispute.\nLaurent (2 Br. Civ., nos. 510 and 511, pp. 646-648) says:\u2014\n510. Si les deux \u00e9poux sont de bonne foi, dit l\u2019article 201, le mariage annul\u00e9 produit les effets civils \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Ils ont donc tous les droits qui naissent d\u2019un mariage l\u00e9gal, d\u2019abord sur la personne et les biens de leurs enfants; ils exercent la puissance paternelle et l\u2019usufruit qui y est attach\u00e9. Voil\u00e0 un effet qui se prolonge au del\u00e0 du jugement qui prononce la nullit\u00e9, et par la force des choses. Il en est de m\u00eame des conventions matrimoniales des \u00e9poux, des donations qu\u2019ils se sont faites. Tous ces effets sont incontestables. Mais que faut-il dire des effets que le mariage produit entre les \u00e9poux? Il est certain qu\u2019il ne peut plus \u00eatre question du devoir de fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, ni de la protection que le mari doit \u00e0 sa femme, ni de l\u2019ob\u00e9issance que la femme doit \u00e0 son mari. Mais si l\u2019un des \u00e9poux \u00e9tait sans fortune, ne pourrait-il pas demander une pension alimentaire de son conjoint? Le code donne ce droit au conjoint qui a obtenu le divorce (art. 301). Il nous semble que cette disposition doit recevoir son application, par analogie, au mariage putatif. Il y a, en effet, m\u00eame raison de d\u00e9cider. L\u2019\u00e9poux sans fortune doit compter sur la subsistance que le mariage lui assure; combien d\u2019unions sont contract\u00e9es dans cette vue! Ce serait donc tromper l\u2019attente des contractants que de les priver de cet avantage.\n511. * * * La vraie difficult\u00e9 est donc celle-ci: la fiction s\u2019\u00e9tend-elle au droit h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaire? La loi maintient le droit d\u2019h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 au profit des enfants, des p\u00e8re et m\u00e8re, et m\u00eame des parents; pourquoi ne maintiendrait-elle pas le droit de succession au profit du conjoint? N\u2019est-ce pas l\u00e0 un des effets civils du mariage? D\u00e8s lors ne faut-il pas dire que cet effet est produit par le mariage putatif? La seule objection s\u00e9rieuse que l\u2019on puisse faire au conjoint, c\u2019est que le mariage annul\u00e9 ne peut plus produire de nouveaux effets \u00e0 partir du jugement qui a prononc\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9; or, le droit de succession est un nouvel effet. Mais cet argument ne peut pas \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 aux enfants; pourquoi donc l\u2019opposerait-on \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poux?\nIn Berthiaume v. Dastous[13], the Privy Council had to consider a case in which they held the marriage to be null and it was so declared. The principal question was whether the right to alimony is one of the \u201ccivil effects\u201d subsisting after nullity has been decreed. An imposing array of French authorities was cited to the effect that since the duty of cohabitation was gone, the duty of maintenance had disappeared with it. This view was rejected by the judgment of the Privy Council which applies the test stated thus: \u201cThose rights subsist which are consistent with a real marriage not existing.\u201d And again, as already observed, the judgment emphasizes the circumstance that the spouses and the children are linked together in articles 163 and 164 C.C.\nThe authorities cited before the Privy Council put alimony and hereditary rights on the same footing and exclude them from the \u201ccivil effects\u201d for the same reason. The view of Laurent as touching hereditary rights would appear to be more consistent with the judgment than the opposite view.\nAs against all this, Mr. Geoffrion takes his stand on two propositions. First, as regards Italian law, the right of the husband is necessarily conditioned upon the Italian nationality of the putative wife because, admittedly, the Italian law of succession in terms regulates only the successions of Italian nationals; second, given domicile in Quebec, the Quebec courts must apply the Quebec law of succession, including the right of testamentary disposition. After a good deal of reflection, I have been forced to the conclusion that the putative marriage in question here being a marriage in contemplation of articles 163 and 164 C.C., and a putative marriage within the meaning of Italian law, the marriage settlement and the putative marriage itself produced their \u201ccivil effects\u201d quoad property as if the putative marriage had been a real one in accord with the law as explained by Pothier and Laurent, subject, of course, to the rights of the lawful husband, and that, in the events that happened, the \u201ccivil effects\u201d of the contract and the putative marriage quoad property include the right now in question here.\nSince (as the judgment in Berthiaume v. Dastous[14] lays down) \u201call civil rights appendant to real marriage\u201d which are consistent with the non-existence of real marriage are \u201cproduced by a putative marriage,\u201d I cannot agree that the jus mariti in relation to succession is excluded because the domicile and nationality of the putative wife were not in the circumstances those of the putative husband. Disunity of nationality was the necessary correlative of the bigamous character of the marriage and the invalidity of the marriage was a necessary condition of the acquisition by Marguerite Claire Stephens of a Quebec domicile. These legal results or incidents of nullity cannot really affect the question of the admission of this particular jus mariti as one of the \u201ccivil effects\u201d since, ex hypothesi, the inclusion of it within that category is not incompatible with the recognition of the non-existence of a real marriage between the respondent and the putative wife. The obligations of the marriage contract subsist, as Pothier says, although the contract was entered into in contemplation of marriage and if there had been no marriage in fact would fail of effect. The good faith of the parties in the putative marriage is recognized by the law as fulfilment of the condition. Effect ought to be given to the stipulation that the parties are to be governed by Italian law so far as that can be done consistently with recognition of the non-existence of a real marriage between the respondent and Marguerite Claire Stephens and of the continued existence of the actual, legal marriage between her and her real husband, Colonel Gault. My view summarized in a word is that the marriage between the respondent and the putative wife, having been a marriage in good faith, a putative marriage in the sense of the Italian law as well as of the law of Quebec, the civil effects of which the putative husband is entitled to the benefit do not necessarily rest upon the hypothesis that he acquired the status of husband of Marguerite Claire Stephens, or that she acquired his nationality or his domicile, but simply upon the fact that the marriage was entered into in good faith a fact which has certain juridical consequences. These consequences would appear (Berthiaume v. Dastous)[15], to include quoad property such consequences of a real marriage as are consistent with the nonexistence of a real marriage and, in the case of a bigamous marriage, such as are consistent with the continued existence and recognition of the status and rights of the lawful husband arising out of the lawful marriage.\nThere remains a point taken on the argument, viz., that judgment for the appellant could not be given in the absence of Colonel Gault as a party on the record. It may be noted that it is stated in the respondent\u2019s factum as an undoubted fact that Colonel Gault is domiciled in England. Such being the case, the Quebec courts are not competent to pronounce against him or in his favour a judgment in rem affecting his marital status or his status in any respect. The Quebec courts have, however, complete jurisdiction to deal with suits concerning questions of property and, incidentally, to decide inter partes questions touching the validity of divorces in so far as they are relevant to the determination of the issues directly involved.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nCannon, J.

Le savant juge Demers dit qu\u2019il constate comme certain que ni la femme ni le mari n\u2019\u00e9taient domicili\u00e9s \u00e0 Paris lors du jugement de divorce du tribunal de la Seine; et il trouve que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes de droit international reproduits \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 C.C. ces deux \u00e9poux \u00e9tant domicili\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec lors du divorce, il faut d\u00e9cider que ce divorce est nul et, en cons\u00e9quence, le mariage du demandeur nul. Le premier juge ajoute que la loi italienne s\u2019applique et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, comme en France, le mariage entach\u00e9 de bigamie doit \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9 et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul; autrement il produit ses effets civils jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019annulation, si les \u00e9poux sont de bonne foi.\nCette question de bonne foi est r\u00e9solue en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 par le premier juge; et il conclut que, le mariage du demandeur n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul, Dame Stephens est r\u00e9put\u00e9e sa femme et, en cons\u00e9quence, r\u00e9put\u00e9e italienne. Il conclut que cette question est discut\u00e9e en Italie et en France; mais cela lui semble la solution la plus logique.\nEn appel, le juge-en-chef de la province ne croit pas n\u00e9cessaire ni opportun de d\u00e9cider de la validit\u00e9 du divorce des \u00e9poux Gault; il se contente, vu la bonne foi du deman-deur-intim\u00e9, de lui donner le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un mariage putatif. Le jugement de la cour d\u2019appel modifie sur ce point de nullit\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et fait dispara\u00eetre des consid\u00e9rants la d\u00e9claration de nullit\u00e9 du second mariage bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019existence du premier, mais, chose \u00e9trange, applique \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 les dispositions de l\u2019article 163 C.C., comme si la cour avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul le second mariage; ce que, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle a refus\u00e9 de faire. Pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019au moment de sa mort Marguerite Stephens \u00e9tait de nationalit\u00e9 italienne, l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue d\u2019abord son mariage c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 \u00e0 Paris et produit le certificat suivant:\nLe quatorze octobre mil neuf cent dix-neuf, dix heures quarante-cinq minutes, devant nous, Cl\u00e9ment Legoueix, adjoint au maire du seizi\u00e8me arrondissement de Paris, ont comparu publiquement en la maison commune Luigino Gaspero Guiseppe Falchi, commandant dans l\u2019aviation italienne, n\u00e9 \u00e0 Montopoli (Italie) le onze d\u00e9cembre mil huit cent soixante-dix-neuf, domicili\u00e9 \u00e0 Montopoli, et r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 Paris, avenue Henri Martin 67, fils de Isidore Falchi, et de C\u00e9line Mainardi, \u00e9poux d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s; d\u2019une part, \/- Et Marguerite Claire Stephens, propri\u00e9taire, n\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (Canada) le vingt six ao\u00fbt mil huit cent quatre-vingt-trois, domicili\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, et r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 Paris, rue Pierre Charron 54, fille de George Washington Stephens, et de Frances Ramsay McIntosh, \u00e9poux d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s; divorc\u00e9e de Andrew Hamilton Gault, d\u2019autre part;\u2014sans opposition, un contrat de mariage a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u le trois octobre courant, par Ma\u00eetre Durant des Aulnois, notaire \u00e0 Paris. Luigino Gaspero Guiseppe Falchi et Marguerite Claire Stephens ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019un apr\u00e8s l\u2019autre vouloir se prendre pour \u00e9poux et nous avons prononc\u00e9 au nom de la loi, qu\u2019ils sont unis par le mariage.\nL\u2019appelant a ni\u00e9 que cette union p\u00fbt avoir aucun effet dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, vu que le premier \u00e9poux de Marguerite Stephens \u00e9tait encore vivant lors de cette comparution devant le maire, \u00e0 Paris; le divorce all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pouvait \u00eatre reconnu dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, vu que les deux conjoints, Gault et Dame Stephens avaient, de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et dans le but de se lib\u00e9rer des obligations de la loi de leur domicile, demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un tribunal \u00e9tranger de dissoudre leur lien conjugal, ce qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pu obtenir au Canada, ni devant les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ni devant le parlement du Canada.\nUne \u00e9tude attentive du dossier m\u2019a convaincu qu\u2019en effet les \u00e9poux Gault, apr\u00e8s avoir renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir un divorce au Canada, ont profit\u00e9 de leur s\u00e9jour en France pour recouvrer leur libert\u00e9 de tenter, chacun de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, une nouvelle aventure matrimoniale. La jurisprudence a toujours refus\u00e9 de donner effet \u00e0 toute tentative de secouer le joug des obligations impos\u00e9es pour des raisons d\u2019ordre public, par le code civil \u00e0 toutes personnes dont le domicile l\u00e9gal, lors de leur mariage, \u00e9tait dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Je citerai, entre autres, la cause de Gregory v. Odell[16], o\u00f9 les juges Malouin, McCorkill et Letellier, si\u00e9geant en revision, confirmant Langelier A.C.J., jugent que A decree of divorce by a foreign court purporting to dissolve a marriage contracted in this province, and made while the consorts still had their domicile herein, is without effect and cannot be set up by one of them as a plea by the other to enforce obligations arising out of the marriage.\nDans Mouette v. Larivi\u00e8re[17], la Cour du Banc du Roi a decide que le d\u00e9cret de divorce prononc\u00e9 aux Etats-Unis et d\u00e9clarant dissous le mariage de deux \u00e9poux, mari\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 tous deux \u00e9taient domicil\u00e9s au moment de leur mariage, et dont l\u2019un y est encore domicil\u00e9, est sans effet \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, parce que seules les lois de cette province leur sont applicables. Le juge en chef Tellier, \u00e0 la page 354, disait que Ton ne peut contraindre la d\u00e9fenderesse en cette cause, dont le domicile lors du mariage et depuis \u00e9tait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 la loi d\u2019un pays \u00e9tranger et faire d\u00e9pendre ses droits matrimoniaux d\u2019une loi que ne la concerne pas. Il ajoutait qu\u2019aucune d\u00e9cision d\u2019un tribunal \u00e9tranger\u2014dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, celui des Etats-Unis\u2014ne peut, dans ces circonstances, affecter soit son mariage, soit ses droits matrimoniaux.\nLe juge Rivard dit: p. 352:\u2014\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, le mariage est indissoluble; il ne se dissout que par la mort naturelle de l\u2019un des conjoints (art. 185 C.C.). De cette loi d\u2019un ordre sup\u00e9rieur on peut rapprocher ce principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accept\u00e9: le droit des gens n\u2019oblige pas un Etat \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre une loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re, lorsque cette loi \u00e9trang\u00e8re n\u2019a pas de droit naturel (sic), que son \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel n\u2019est pas la conservation des bonnes m\u0153urs, et qu\u2019elle est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du syst\u00e8me juridique de cet Etat. * * * Il n\u2019est donc pas \u00e9tonnant qu\u2019on puisse soutenir que chez nous les divorces obtenus devant les tribunaux \u00e9trangers ne devraient pas \u00eatre reconnus.\nEt \u00e0 la page 360:\nIl n\u2019y a pas de doute que les lois du mariage et du divorce forment un statut personnel (5 Laurent, Nos 119 et 122). Le divorce est en effet relatif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat des \u00e9poux, puisqu\u2019il change cet \u00e9tat. La loi personnelle dont les parties rel\u00e8vent a donc seule comp\u00e9tence en cette mati\u00e8re (Weiss, Manuel de droit international priv\u00e9, 7\u00e8. \u00e9d. p. 505; Foelix, Dr. int. pr., pp. 53 et 112; Surville, Dr. Int. pr. 7\u00e8. \u00e9d. No 300).\nEnfin, je citerai une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9cente, Stern v. Stern[18], o\u00f9 D\u00e9saulniers J., a d\u00e9cid\u00e9:\u2014\nEst sans effet dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec un divorce obtenu dans l\u2019un des Etats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique par des personnes qui ont contract\u00e9 mariage dans cette province.\nLe juge pose d\u2019abord en principle que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a pas juridiction pour annuler un divorce prononc\u00e9 par un tribunal am\u00e9ricain; et je suis aussi d\u2019avis que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a pas juridiction pour annuler un divorce obtenu \u00e0 Paris par les \u00e9poux Gault et que seuls les tribunaux fran\u00e7ais auraient juridiction en cette mati\u00e8re.\nMais j\u2019adopte le d\u00e9claration du juge D\u00e9saulniers que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les lois de notre province, un divorce obtenu aux Etats-Unis, entre des citoyens de Qu\u00e9bec qui se sont mari\u00e9s dans ses limites, n\u2019a aucun effet chez nous. L\u2019article 185 du code civil nous dit que le mariage est indissoluble et qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre dissous que par le mort de l\u2019un des conjoints. Ce principle domine la mati\u00e8re et est, chez nous, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du consentement au mariage; or le consentement et ses suites sont r\u00e9gis par la loi nationale. Il serait vraiment singulier que les tribunaux \u00e9trangers eussent plus de pouvoir et d\u2019autorit\u00e9 que les n\u00f4tres. Ce que les citoyens de cette province ne peuvent obtenir ici, ils pourraient l\u2019obtenir ailleurs. Ce serait un non-sens. La seule autorit\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente pour annuler un mariage validement c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec par deux non-catholiques qui y sont domicil\u00e9s est la parlement du Canada.\nJe suis donc dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que le divorce obtenu par les \u00e9poux Gault \u00e0 Paris n\u2019a aucun effet dans cette province et ne saurait y l\u00e9gitimer le second mariage de Marguerite Stephens du vivant de Gault; nous pouvons donc consid\u00e9rer, pour les fins du pr\u00e9sent litige, lors de sa mort, Marguerite Stephens, comme justiciable de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, toujours l\u2019\u00e9pouse de Hamilton Gault.\nVoir sur tous ces points les autorit\u00e9s cit\u00e9es par Johnson, Conflict of Laws, vol. 2, pp. 132 \u00e0 170.\nIl est important de remarquer une divergence entre le droit et la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et le droit anglais, comme Johnson, \u00e0 son deuxi\u00e8me volume, pp. 74 et 152, le souligne:\nIn English law * * * the motive of a change of domicile will not be investigated, provided there is an actual change. That the new domicile is taken because a divorce can there be more readily obtained, does not, in the eyes of English courts, invalidate the divorce.\nIn Quebec, a change of domicile ad nutum, so far as its effect upon status at least, would be deemed no change at all. We apply this principle in matters of separation from bed and board and marriage. What might be a \u201cgenuine\u201d domicile in the English view, because actual, might in the Quebec view be neither bona fide nor genuine, because it is in fraud of our law. Et j\u2019adopte cette conclusion:\nBut the case where consorts were married domiciled in Qu\u00e9bec, and there has been no change of domicile by either, is clear. A decree of divorce by a foreign court is without effect.\nJe suis d\u2019avis que notre Cour, dont les pouvoirs sont aussi restreints que ceux des cours de la province de Qu\u00e9bec quand il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9clarer la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019un mariage ou d\u2019un divorce, c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 ou obtenu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, doit se contenter, comme la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure aurait d\u00fb le faire, de d\u00e9clarer, pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente cause, que le mariage invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 et le contrat qui l\u2019a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 entre lui et Dame Stephens, \u00e9pouse de Hamilton Gault, ne doivent recevoir aucun effet devant les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui sont charg\u00e9s de faire respecter l\u2019indissolubilit\u00e9 du mariage unissant des personnes domicili\u00e9es dans Qu\u00e9bec et y ayant conserv\u00e9 leur domicile. Mais nous devons aussi refuser de donner un effet extra-territorial au d\u00e9cret de divorce, quand le tribunal fran\u00e7ais a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les limites de sa juridiction en statuant de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 affecter l\u2019\u00e9tat et la capacit\u00e9 de Marguerite Stephens, alors, ainsi que son mari, domicili\u00e9e non en France, mais \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al.\nSi, pour les raisons ci-contre, le mariage en question n\u2019est pas annul\u00e9 ou d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul, peut-on, comme l\u2019ont fait les deux cours inf\u00e9rieures, accorder \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des articles 163 et 164 du code civil qui disent:\n163. Le mariage qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul produit m\u00e9anmoins les effets civils, tant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des \u00e9poux qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des enfants lorsqu\u2019il est contract\u00e9 de bonne foi.\n164. Si la bonne foi n\u2019existe que de la part de l\u2019un des \u00e9poux, le mariage ne produit les effets civils qu\u2019en faveur de cet \u00e9poux et des enfants n\u00e9s du mariage.\nLe demandeur-intim\u00e9 s\u2019est adress\u00e9 aux tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec pour leur demander de donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019union qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend avoir exist\u00e9 entre lui et feu Marguerite Stephens, au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de cette derni\u00e8re . et de l\u2019ouverture de sa succession; et il r\u00e9clame sa part des droits que la pr\u00e9tendue nationalit\u00e9 italienne de cette dame r\u00e9sultant du mariage invoqu\u00e9 lui assurait en vertu de la loi italienne sur les biens laiss\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec par Marguerite Stephens.\nPour les raisons que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9es plus haut, les tribunaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec doivent refuser de donner effet \u00e0 ce mariage, sans cependant le d\u00e9clarer nul, pour la raison que sa validit\u00e9 \u00e9chappe \u00e0 leur juridiction. Par ailleurs, M. Hamilton Gault n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause et aucun jugement affectant d\u00e9finitivement quant \u00e0 lui la validit\u00e9 du divorce accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Paris ne saurait \u00eatre rendu, m\u00eame si la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec avait juridiction, sans qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 et ait eu l\u2019occasion de se faire entendre.\nBien que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les termes expr\u00e8s de l\u2019article 163 C.C., il n\u2019y aurait pas lieu, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de faire jouer, comme l\u2019a fait la cour d\u2019appel, en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 la fiction du mariage putatif, il est bon, je crois, vu. que les jugements des cours inf\u00e9rieures sont bas\u00e9s sur cette fiction, d\u2019en dire quelques mots. La condition essentielle pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse jouir des avantages que lui conf\u00e9rerait notre article 163 C.C., c\u2019est la bonne foi. Peut-on dire qu\u2019il ignorait, lors du mariage dont il se pr\u00e9vaut, le fait que les \u00e9poux Gault s\u2019\u00e9taient rencontr\u00e9s \u00e0 Paris dans le but expr\u00e8s de se soustraire \u00e0 l\u2019indissolubilit\u00e9 de leur union, qui les emp\u00eachait de divorcer et de contracter un nouveau mariage tant et aussi longtemps qu\u2019ils conservaient leur domicile dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec? Sur ce point de fait, il ne saurait faire de doute que le domicile conjugal n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 et que Hamilton Gault avait, lors du divorce, son principal \u00e9tablissement \u00e0 Montreal, o\u00f9 il est revenu pour \u00eatre d\u00e9mobilis\u00e9, avant son d\u00e9part pour l\u2019angleterre o\u00f9 il a v\u00e9cu depuis 1919 environ. L\u2019intim\u00e9 admet que Marguerite Stephens lui aurait dit, avant leur mariage, qu\u2019elle se proposait de divorcer pour pouvoir l\u2019\u00e9pouser.\nQuoi qu\u2019il en soit, m\u00eame s\u2019il faut, comme les juges de premi\u00e8re instance et ceux de la Cour du Banc du Roi conclure \u00e0 la bonne foi de l\u2019intim\u00e9, peut-on compter parmi les effets civils du mariage putatif invoqu\u00e9 comme derni\u00e8re ressource par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour maintenir son action, un changement de nationalit\u00e9 de Marguerite Stephens? Peut-on aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du droit public de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et du Canada et sanctionner, en vertu d\u2019une fiction l\u00e9gale, un changement de nationalit\u00e9 fictif, quant \u00e0 nos tribunaux, dans les circonstances de la cause, pour permettre \u00e0 un aubain de jouir des droits que Marguerite Stephens a l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par testament \u00e0 l\u2019appelant?\nBien qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour de cassation, en France, re Edwards[19], semble affirmer que le changement de nationalit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un effet civil d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un mariage putatif, il y a lieu de se demander si cette jurisprudence peut s\u2019appliquer dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. En effet, chez nous, le droit civil a \u00e9t\u00e9 conserv\u00e9 par l\u2019Acte de Qu\u00e9bec, 14 Geo. III (1774) ch. 83, toujours en vigueur sur ce point; et la section 8, en substance d\u00e9cr\u00e8te ce qui suit:\nHis Majesty\u2019s Canadian subjects may hold and enjoy their property and possessions, together with all customs and usages relative thereto with all other their civil rights. * * * as may consist with their allegiance to His Majesty and subjection to the Crown and Parliament of Great Britain; and that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort shall be had to the laws of Canada as the rule for the decision of the same; all causes * * * in courts, shall, with respect to such property or rights be determined agreeably to the said laws and customs of Canada, until this shall be varied or altered by competent authority.\nEt la section 10 introduit chez nous la libert\u00e9 de tester, nonobstant toute loi \u00e0 ce contraire. Il semble donc que toute question d\u2019all\u00e9geance au souverain et de nationalit\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9e comme n\u2019\u00e9tant pas mati\u00e8re de droit civil, mais de droit public. Or, la loi anglaise, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la loi du domicile conjugal des Gault, \u00e0 la mort de l\u2019\u00e9pouse de ce dernier alors \u00e9tabli en Angleterre, et notre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant la naturalisation et la nationalit\u00e9 canadienne ignorent ce qu\u2019on est convenu d\u2019appeler mariage putatif; et la question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est de savoir si, dans les circonstances, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, on peut conclure, comme les juges des cours inf\u00e9rieures, que, parmi les effets civils d\u2019un mariage putatif en faveur du conjoint \u00e9tranger de bonne foi, il y aurait, comme on le pr\u00e9tend en cette cause, eu un changement de nationalit\u00e9 de sa femme canadienne, et ce mariage putatif, fiction de la loi, aurait-il eu pour effet de faire perdre \u00e0 la d\u00e9funte son all\u00e9geance \u00e0 la Couronne britannique, sa nationalit\u00e9 canadienne et son droit illimit\u00e9 de tester?\nTous s\u2019accordent \u00e0 dire que, pour r\u00e9ussir, Falchi doit prouver qu\u2019au moment de sa mort, Marguerite Stephens \u00e9tait de nationalit\u00e9 italienne, afin de la soumettre \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration des lois d\u2019Italie qu\u2019invoque le demandeur. En vertu de l\u2019article 6 du Code civil italien,\nL\u2019\u00e9tat et la capacit\u00e9 des personnes et les rapports de famille sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par la loi de la nation \u00e0 laquelle les personnes appartiennent;\net, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 8,\nLes successions l\u00e9gitimes et testamentaires en ce qui concerne l\u2019ordre de succ\u00e9der, la mesure des droits h\u00e9r\u00e9ditaires et la validit\u00e9 intrins\u00e8que des dispositions, sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par la loi nationale du de cujus, quelle que soit le nature des biens et dans n\u2019importe quel pays ils se trouvent.\nJe trouve aux Rapports des Codificateurs (Vol. ler, p. 186) ce qui suit:\nLa disposition qui oblige la femme \u00e0 suivre son mari partout o\u00f9 il veut r\u00e9sider, et par implication, m\u00eame en pays \u00e9tranger, conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article 214 du Code Napol\u00e9on, avait d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e comme amendement \u00e0 la loi actuelle; mais sur consid\u00e9ration ult\u00e9rieure, l\u2019on s\u2019est convaincu que cette r\u00e8gle, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le droit civil, est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et absolue; que l\u2019exception quant au pays \u00e9tranger que l\u2019on faisait autrefois, si elle existe r\u00e9ellement, est fond\u00e9e sur le droit public et ne soul\u00e8ve qu\u2019une question d\u2019all\u00e9geance, savoir: si le mari peut forcer sa femme \u00e0 la changer et \u00e0 abdiquer sa patrie; question \u00e9trang\u00e8re au droit civil, et par cons\u00e9quent \u00e0 notre code, et dont la solution, ainsi qu\u2019il fut dit dans les discussions au conseil d\u2019Etat \u201cdoit \u00eatre abandonn\u00e9e aux m\u0153urs et aux circonstances.\u201d C\u2019est pour ces raisons que l\u2019article est propos\u00e9 comme conforme \u00e0 la loi actuelle.\nIl est vrai que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la Loi de Naturalisation (R.S.C. 1927, c 138, sec. 13), l\u2019\u00e9pouse d\u2019un aubain est cens\u00e9e \u00eatre un aubain. Mais ceci n\u2019est pas en vertu des dispositions de notre code civil mais bien en vertu des pouvoirs exclusifs confi\u00e9s par la constitution au parlement du Canada de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en tout ce qui concerne la naturalisation et l\u2019acquisition ou la perte de la qualit\u00e9 de citoyen canadien. Quelle que soit la doctrine adopt\u00e9e en France ou dans d\u2019autres pays o\u00f9 le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif est confi\u00e9 en entier \u00e0 un organisme unique, nous ne pouvons ignorer chez nous que certaines mati\u00e8res\u2014et pour ce qui concerne cette cause, les effets civils du mariage putatif\u2014sont, quant \u00e0 la naturalisation et au changement d\u2019all\u00e9geance au Souverain, de par les dispositions expresses de l\u2019Acte de Qu\u00e9bec (1774) et de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, en dehors de la comp\u00e9tence de la l\u00e9gislature de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Comme les codificateurs l\u2019ont fait remarquer, c\u2019est l\u00e0 une question de droit public concernant les droits et les obligations politiques des sujets canadiens, comme citoyens, non d\u2019une province, mais de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration. Sur ce point, nous avons uniformit\u00e9 de l\u00e9gislation, laquelle ne saurait varier d\u2019une province \u00e0 l\u2019autre, comme en mati\u00e8re de droit purement civil ou priv\u00e9.\nJe suis donc d\u2019avis que, m\u00eame si nous pouvions appliquer \u00e0 cette cause, en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la fiction du mariage putatif, nous ne pourrions aller jusqu\u2019au point de conc\u00e9der en sa faveur comme un de ses effets civils le pr\u00e9tendu changement de nationalit\u00e9 de Marguerite Stephens. Pour \u00e9tayer sa th\u00e8se et sa cause, l\u2019intim\u00e9 admet qu\u2019il lui faut \u00e9tablir: 1o que la d\u00e9funte \u00e9tait devenue italienne par un mariage valide aux yeux de la loi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec; et 2\u00b0 qu\u2019au moment de sa mort la testatrice avait conserv\u00e9 cette nationalit\u00e9 italienne. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli \u00e0 ma satisfaction ces points primordiaux et essentiels pour lui donner le droit de recueillir une partie des biens laiss\u00e9s par Dame Stephens.\nPour ces raisons, avec beaucoup de respect pour la d\u00e9cision des savants juges des cours provinciales\u2014devant lesquels certains des points de droit plaides devant nous ne semblent pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s\u2014je maintiendrais l\u2019appel et d\u00e9bouterais l\u2019intim\u00e9 de son action avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours contre lui.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hackett, Mulvena, Foster, Hackett and Haimen.\n[1] Reporter\u2019s note.\u2014Petition for special leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council dismissed with costs, July 25th, 1938.\n[2] [1937] 3 D.L.R. 605.\n[3] (1883) 6 L.N. 329, at 333.\n3 (1883) 6 L.N. 329, at 333.\n[4] (1885) 8 L.N. 42.\n[5] [1895] A.C. 517, at 540.\n[6] (1872) L.R. 2 P. & D. 435, at 442.\n[7] [1921] 1 A.C. 146.\n[8] [1926] A.C. 444.\n[9] [1901] A.C. 446.\n[10]\n[11] [1895] A.C. 517.\n[12] [1930] A.C. 79.\n[13] [1930] A.C. 79.\n[14] [1930] A.C. 79.\n[15] [1930] A.C 79.\n[16] (1911) Q.R. 39 S.C. 291.\n[17] (1926) Q.R. 40 K.B. 350.\n[18] (1932) Q.R. 70 S.C. 549.\n[19] [1936] Dalloz, Jur.

The Controller of Chinese Immigration, acting in pursuance of the powers set out in the Chinese Immigration Act, examined the appellant as to her right to enter Canada, and, on the 23rd of September, 1936, found that the appellant was not in fact the person she was represented to be and that she had not been born in Victoria; and therefore he ordered her deportation. An application was then brought for a writ of Habeas Corpus; and, on the hearing, new evidence was adduced by and on behalf of the appellant. The trial Judge found that the appellant was in fact a Canadian citizen born in Victoria and issued an order discharging the appellant from the custody of the Controller. These findings were not disputed before the appellate court, the only question there raised was as to whether or not the trial Judge had the right under the Chinese Immigration Act to review the decision of the Controller and to receive additional evidence, the appellate court holding that the trial Judge had no such jurisdiction.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the order of the trial Judge, discharging the appellant from the custody of the Controller, should be restored.\nPer The Chief Justice and Cannon, Davis and Hudson JJ.\u2014\u2014It was not the intention of the Parliament of Canada, in enacting the Chinese Immigration Act, to prevent Canadian citizens of Chinese origin or descent generally from entering Canada. In view of sections 8 and 11 of that Act, the provisions of section 5 of that Act cannot be interpreted as exacting that the only Canadian citizens permitted to enter Canada are such as fall within section 5, subsection (b). The proper construction of section 5 is that the classes of persons enumerated in subsections (a), (b) and (c), and they alone, are permitted to enter and land in Canada without regard to any question of allegiance or citizenship; and the effect of that section is not to take away the right of Canadian citizens to enter or land in Canada. Therefore the return of the Controller was insufficient to establish conclusively that his detention of the appellant was a lawful one and to preclude inquiry into the issue of citizenship, such return being virtually limited to setting forth his decision that the appellant did not fall within any of the classes enumerated in section 5.\nPer Crocket J.\u2014\u2014Upon its true construction, section 37 of the Chinese Immigration Act does not preclude a judge of a provincial court of first instance from hearing an application under the Habeas Corpus Act for the purpose of proving that, notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the Chinese Immigration Controller, the applicant was in fact born in Canada and as a Canadian citizen was entitled to be discharged from that officer's custody.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, McDonald J., whereby the latter ordered, upon an application for Habeas Corpus, that the appellant be set free from the custody of the Controller of Chinese Immigration.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head\u2014note and in the judgments now reported.\nDenis Murphy for the appellant.\nElmore Meredith for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Cannon, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014\u2014I have read the Chinese Immigration Act many times and am still in real doubt as to the precise meaning of some of its cardinal provisions. I do not think I am justified in concluding that it was the intention of Parliament to prevent Canadian citizens of Chinese origin or descent generally from entering Canada.\nSection 8 prohibits certain classes of persons of Chinese origin and descent from entering Canada, including idiots and insane persons, persons afflicted with a loathsome disease, criminals, prostitutes, procurers, professional beggars and vagrants, persons who are likely to become a public charge, members of unlawful organizations, persons who are certified as mentally or physically defective, persons who are utterly illiterate. But even as respects these classes, section 8 has no application to a person who is a Canadian citizen within the meaning of the Chinese Immigration Act.\nSection 11 contains a proviso that Canadian citizens shall be permitted to land in Canada.\nNow, in view of these provisions, it would be an extraordinary thing if it were enacted in section 5 that the only Canadian citizens permitted to enter Canada are such as fall within section 5, subsection (b). I am by no means satisfied that such is the proper construction of that section. I am disposed to think it means that the classes of persons enumerated in subsections (a), (b) and (c), and they alone, are permitted to enter or land in Canada without regard to any question of allegiance or citizenship; and that the effect of the section is not to take away the right of Canadian citizens (British subjects domiciled in Canada or persons born in Canada who have not become aliens) to enter or land in Canada.\nThe question is, no doubt, a debatable one, but the construction adopted by the Controller and contended for by the Crown ought, I think, not to be accepted in the absence of plain language. This view I think is strengthened by reference to section 37 which, inferentially, appears to recognize the right of persons who are Canadian citizens or persons who have acquired a Canadian domicile to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts to review the decision or order of the Minister or Controller relating to \"status, condition, origin, descent, detention or deportation.\" One naturally differs from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on such a point with very considerable hesitation. The subject has been frequently before that Court, and, although there are no reported reasons of the Court of Appeal before us, we have been given to understand that, in arriving at their decision the Court of Appeal followed the observations of Mr. Justice Martin in Re Low Hong Hing[1] in delivering the judgment of the Court.\nEspecially, however, in dealing with a statute of the Parliament of Canada affecting the fundamental rights of Canadian citizens, it is our duty to give effect to the views concerning the construction of the statute at which, after due consideration, we ourselves have arrived.\nA number of authorities have been cited which appear to show that the view of the statute indicated in this judgment has been acted upon more than once in British Columbia. I refer to In Re Lee Chow Ying[2] (Hunter C.J.); Rex v. Jung Suey Mee[3] (Macdonald C.J. and McPhillips J.A.); The King v. Lim Cooie Foo[4] (Macdonald C.J.); Re Munshi Singh[5] (Irving J. A. and Martin J.A.).\nSuch being our opinion as to the effect of the statute, it follows that the return of the Controller was insufficient to establish conclusively that his detention of the applicant was a lawful one, and to preclude inquiry into the issue of citizenship, for it is virtually limited to setting forth his decision that the applicant did not fall within any of the classes enumerated in section 5.\nI am not insensible to the difficulties attending the administration of the Chinese Immigration Act. If, however, it was the intention of Parliament to pass an enactment taking effect conformably to the argument of the Crown presented in this case, that intention could and ought to have been expressed in words of unmistakeable meaning.\nThe appeal is allowed and the order of McDonald J. restored with costs throughout. CROCKET J.\u2014\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowing an appeal from the decision of Honourable Mr. Justice McDonald on the return of an order nisi for a writ of Habeas Corpus and Certiorari in aid, ordering the discharge of the applicant out of the custody of the Controller of Chinese Immigration of the city of Vancouver.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal merely states that upon hearing counsel for the parties and upon reading the appeal book the judgment of Mr. Justice McDonald is set aside, with costs to be paid by the respondent to the appellant forthwith after taxation thereof, and does not disclose the particular ground or grounds upon which the judgment proceeded.\nIt is stated, however, in the appellant's factum in this court that the evidence taken before the trial judge was not introduced into the appeal book on the appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal; that the learned trial judge's finding on the hearing before him that the applicant was in fact a Canadian citizen and was born in the city of Victoria was not disputed on the appeal; that the only question that arose was as to whether or not the learned judge had the right under the Chinese Immigration Act to review the decision of the Controller; and that the Court of Appeal without itself reviewing the evidence substantiating the Controller's finding held that the learned trial judge had no jurisdiction to do so.\nThis statement is not disputed and seems to be borne out by the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, so that I think it must be taken that the judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeded wholly on the ground that Mr. Justice McDonald had no jurisdiction to review the finding of the Controller on the Habeas Corpus application.\nThe Crown contends that His Lordship was precluded from doing so by s. 37 of the Chinese Immigration Act, R.S.C., c. 95, which reads as follows:\u2014\u2014\nNo court and no judge or officer thereof shall have jurisdiction to review, quash, reverse, restrain or otherwise interfere with any proceeding, decision or order of the Minister or of any controller relating to the status, condition, origin, descent, detention or deportation of any immigrant, passenger or other person upon any ground whatsoever, unless such person is a Canadian citizen, or has acquired Canadian domicile.\nThere seems to be no doubt that the intention of this section is to restrain the courts of justice throughout the country from determining the validity of any proceeding, decision or order of the Minister of Immigration, or any Controller of Chinese Immigration, under which any immigrant, passenger or other person may be detained in custody, upon any ground whatsoever, if the person affected is not a Canadian citizen or has not acquired Canadian domicile. No exception is made in favour of British subjects, who are not Canadian citizens or have not acquired Canadian domicile. The concluding words \"unless such person is a Canadian citizen or has acquired Canadian domicile\" are the only reservation in the otherwise all embracing enactment.\nThe learned counsel for the Crown contends that the question as to whether the person affected by the proceeding, decision or order of the Minister or of the Controller of Chinese Immigration, is or is not a Canadian citizen or one who has acquired Canadian domicile, is a question for the determination of the Controller only, subject to appeal to the Minister. If this contention were upheld it is self-evident that the prohibition, which is so expressly directed against all courts of justice throughout Canada, would be absolute so far as any proceeding, decision or order in relation to the administration of the Chinese Immigration Act is concerned. Under no circumstances, once a Controller of Chinese Immigration had, rightly or wrongly, found that a person seeking entry into Canada was not a Canadian citizen or one who had acquired Canadian domicile, and had taken such person into his custody, would any court have any power to entertain an application for a writ or order in the nature of a writ of Habeas Corpus for the purpose of obtaining his discharge from the Controller's custody on any ground whatever.\nThe question of the constitutionality of an enactment of the Parliament of Canada to prohibit provincial courts from judicially investigating the validity of the detention of British subjects in connection with the administration of the Chinese Immigration Act does not arise on this appeal. The only question with which we are concerned is whether upon its true construction s. 37 precludes a judge of a provincial Supreme Court from hearing an application under the Habeas Corpus Act for the purpose of proving that, notwithstanding the contrary opinion of the Chinese Immigration Controller, the applicant was in fact born in Canada and as a Canadian citizen was entitled to her discharge from that officer's custody.\nWith great respect I am of opinion that it does not do so. Reading the whole section it seems to me that its clear intendment is that where the applicant for discharge from the Controller's custody is in fact a Canadian citizen or one who has acquired Canadian domicile, the prohibition against the courts has no application at all. The words \"upon any ground whatever\" manifestly apply to the intended prohibition against the courts. I think it is equally clear that the words \" unless such person is a Canadian citizen,\" etc., which immediately follow, do the same, so that their collocation would seem necessarily to imply that the fact of the applicant being a Canadian citizen or a person who has acquired Canadian domicile, is for the determination of the court or judge, to whom the application for discharge is made, and not for that of the Immigration Controller who is himself responsible for the alleged illegal custody.\nIf the section were open to any other possible construction, I should have no hesitation in accepting that one which does least violence to the long recognized right of the judges of the Supreme Courts of the provinces, in the matter of Habeas Corpus, to protect, by means of this time-honoured writ or by an order in the nature thereof, the personal liberty of any Canadian citizen, or indeed of any other person, by investigating the legality of the warrant, process or order under which anyone has been arrested and is detained in custody within their territorial jurisdiction.\nIt is now the settled law of England that nothing short of express language, or language which admits of no other possible construction, can avail to defeat the object of the Habeas Corpus Act and also that, once a writ of Habeas Corpus has been directed to issue by a competent court and the discharge of a prisoner has been ordered, no appeal lies from such order to any Superior Court. See judgment of the House of Lords in The Secretary of State for Home Affairs v. O'Brien[6], and the authorities there discussed in the reasons of Lords Birkenhead, Dunedin, Finlay and Shaw. The ground of the decision in that case was that the essential feature of the procedure under the Habeas Corpus Act, as stated by Lord Birkenhead, was to provide a swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint and confinement. It is interesting to note in this connection that the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, a court of five judges, sitting en banc, in the case of Ex parte Byrne[7], unanimously refused in 1883 to rescind an order of Mr. Justice Weldon for the discharge of a prisoner from a county gaol upon precisely the same grounds as those set forth in the O'Brien case[8] in the House of Lords forty years later. The grounds of this New Brunswick decision were recognized by the judges of the Appeal Division of that Court in 1921, after the coming into force of the Judicature Act, in the case of The King v. Lantalum, exparte Offman[9], in which it was held that, although the language of the appeal provisions of the Judicature Act could not be relied upon to provide an appeal from an order of discharge made under the Habeas Corpus Act for the reasons given in Ex parte Byrne[10], those reasons did not apply to the case of an order refusing an application for discharge and that an appeal, therefore, does lie from an order refusing to discharge a prisoner from custody.\nIn 1932 this Court considered an appeal from the Appeal Court of British Columbia, which on an equal division sustained a judgment of Mr. Justice Murphy refusing the application of a Japanese subject, one Samajima, under a writ of Habeas Corpus for his discharge from custody on a complaint for violation of the provisions of the general Immigration Act. The British Columbia Court of Appeal Act, it should be said, expressly provides for an appeal to that Court from any judgment or order of a judge of the Supreme Court in any and every matter, and specifically names Habeas Corpus so that, notwithstanding the settled law of England, and of other provinces of Canada, an appeal from an order of discharge would appear to lie in that province from an order of discharge granted on a writ of Habeas Corpus as well as from an order refusing a discharge. In the Samajima case[11], this Court allowed the appeal, and directed the discharge of the applicant per Duff, Lamont and Cannon JJ., Anglin C.J. and Smith J. dissenting, on the ground that the original complaint on which the applicant was detained for deportation was not an order made in accordance with the provisions of the Act and was, therefore, void. It seems that Mr. Justice Fisher on a previous application had ordered the discharge of the applicant on the ground that the complaint against him was defective, and that the applicant had been rearrested on an amended warrant. This Court held that the first warrant, being void, could not be amended. The case involved the consideration of s. 23 of the general Immigration Act, as the Lantalum case[12] in New Brunswick did in 1921. In delivering judgment, Duff J., as our present Chief Justice then was, said:\u2014\nI gravely fear that too often the fact that these enactments are, in practice, most frequently brought to bear upon Orientals of a certain class, has led to the generation of an atmosphere which has obscured their true effect. They are, it is needless to say, equally applicable to Scotsmen. I admit I am horrified at the thought that the personal liberty of a British subject should be exposed to the hugger-nugger which, under the name of legal proceedings, is exemplified by some of the records that have incidentally been brought to our attention. Courts, of course, must often draw the distinction between what is merely irregular and what is of such a character that the law does not permit it in substance. I have no difficulty in giving a construction to section 23, which does not deprive British subjects who are not Canadians, of all redress, in respect of arbitrary and unauthorized acts committed under the pretence of exercising the powers of the Act.\nI refer to these cases merely for the purpose of exemplifying the reverence with which the law of England regards the ancient writ of Habeas Corpus and the strictness with which the courts, not only of the Mother Country, but of Canada, scrutinize all enactments affecting the liberty of the subject.\nQuite independently, however, of these cases I think the clear intendment of s. 37 of the Chinese Immigration Act is, as I have already said, that the prohibition against the courts has no application to any case where the applicant is a Canadian citizen or a person who has acquired Canadian domicile, and that this is always a question for the decision of the judge to whom the application is made. I think the appeal must be allowed and the applicant discharged.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Harold Freeman.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Elmore Meredith.\n[1] (1926) 37 B.C.R. 295, at 300, 301.\n[2] (1929) 39 B.C.R. 322.\n[3] (1933) 46 B.C.R. 535.\n[4] (1931) 43 B.C.R. 56,\n[5] (1914) 20 B.C.R. 243, at 263, 276.\n[6] [1923] A.C. 603.\n[7] (1883) 22 N.B.

The workmen removed their tools to one side and stood to one side themselves. Appellant\u2019s son, who was driving the car, although he knew the time at which the respondent\u2019s car was expected, attempted to drive across the rails at spot where the planks were still in place. The car skidded and stalled and was hit by the incoming train. Appellant\u2019s husband, who was in the car, was killed and the automobile demolished. The jury in answer to questions found that the workmen were negligent in \u201cremoving planks * * * too close to train time\u201d and in \u201cfailing to replace temporarily same on approach of auto.\u201d The jury also found that the driver of the car was not negligent. On appeal, a new trial was ordered.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal ([1937] 2 W.W.R. 282), that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored: the answers to the questions by the jury were justified by the evidence and the jury\u2019s finding that the driver of the automobile was not negligent, was not perverse.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Morrison, C.J.S.C., on the verdict of a jury and ordering a new trial.\nH. J. Sullivan K.C. for appellant.\nJ. W. deB. Farris K.C. for respondent. The material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In my view the respondent by removal of the planks created a situation which, the jury might reasonably find, had the effect of attaching a wholly unnecessary risk to the exercise by the deceased Charles Joseph Staley of his rights in the use of the highway; and that, accordingly, they were justly chargeable with negligence. At the same time, the jury might quite consistently take the view that the risk was not in all the circumstances, and particularly in view of the conduct and attitude of the track men present, so obvious to the driver of the automobile as to render his act in attempting to cross the railway a negligent one. They might not unreasonably think that, at the highest, he was chargeable with nothing graver than mistake of judgment, both natural and excusable.\nI have read with care the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal and, with the greatest respect, I feel constrained to say that, in the reasons given by Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald, the case is put in a way that appears to me to be unanswerable.\nAs to the effect of the jury\u2019s answers, I concur with my brother Kerwin.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald that the answers of the jury to the first two questions are sufficient to impose liability upon the respondent. These questions with their answers are:\u2014\n(1) Q. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendants\u2019 servants which caused the accident?\nA. Yes.\nQ. If so, in what did such negligence consist?\nA. Removing planks at crossing too close to train time and failing to replace temporarily same on approach of auto.\nThese answers are justified by the evidence. It was shown that the foreman of the work crew knew the time at which the car of the respondents would reach the station to the east of the railway crossing in question and that, although the men arrived at the crossing but a few minutes before the car was expected, they proceeded with their work and removed two planks. It was also open to the jury to consider that the actions of the workmen amounted to an invitation to the driver of the automobile to proceed over the crossing. While the latter also knew the time at which the respondent\u2019s car was expected, he stated that he did not have that information in mind at the relevant time, and although, when he stopped twenty-five or thirty feet from the crossing, he saw that the two planks had been removed, the jury must have determined that it was not negligence on his part in thinking that he could safely cross at the spot where the planks were still in place. It is impossible to say that it was not open to the jury to find that the acts of the respondent\u2019s employees were the cause of the accident.\nIt was argued that the jury\u2019s finding, that the driver of the automobile was not negligent, was perverse. It is not necessary to repeat the considerations that apply in determining this question as they have been discussed in several recent cases in this Court, the latest of which is Warren v. Gray Goose[2]. I agree with Mr. Justice Martin (now Chief Justice of British Columbia) that there is nothing in this case to indicate that the jury failed to perform their duty.\nHaving negatived any negligence on the part of the driver of the automobile, the jury answered question 9 as follows:\u2014\n(9) In what degree of fault was either party liable?\nQ. (a) The defendants\u2019 servants?\nA. We consider that the speed of the tram car was excessive, especially in view of the fact that two crossings had to be negotiated and we refer as well to our answer to question no. 2.\nQ. (b) The driver of the auto?\nA. None.\nThe answer to 9 (a) is really not responsive but there is nothing to show that the jury were in any way departing from their answer to the crucial question, no. 1, as to negligence which caused the accident. In fact, the words \u201cand we refer as well to our answer of question no. 2\u201d really reiterates and emphasizes the earlier answer. Even without applying the admonition in Pronek v. Winnipeg, Selkirk and Lake Winnipeg Railway Co.[3], that \u201cthe language of a jury in explaining the reasons for their verdict ought not to be construed too narrowly,\u201d it is plain, I think, that the appellant is entitled to judgment on the answers to questions 1 and 2, and that nothing in the answer to question 9 (a) can derogate from that right.\nThe effect of the original negligence of the respondent\u2019s employees continued down to the time of the impact. The jury being justified if finding no negligence on the part of the driver of the motor car either in the first instance of alter he found his automobile had straddled the north rail of the respondent\u2019s tracks, it is unnecessary to consider the other questions discussed at bar. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs throughout\nAppeal allowed with cost.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Harr J. Sullican.\nSolicitor for the respondent: V.

We have considered the argument addressed to us by Mr. Calder. The power of the Court in respect of orders made by a Judge in Chambers is discussed at large in Re Smith v. Hogan[1].\nIn that case an application for leave to appeal under the Bankruptcy Act was dismissed by the judge who heard it on the ground of lack of jurisdiction because the period for making such application fixed by rule 72 of the Bankruptcy Act had expired. This Court held that the time having been competently extended by an order of Chief Justice Barry of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, sitting as a bankruptcy judge, the applicant had a legal right to have his application heard on the merits and that he was entitled to proceed with his application. The decision proceeded upon the ground that the dismissal of the application constituted a refusal to entertain an application which the applicant was legally entitled to have heard and decided on the merits.\nThere is nothing in that judgment, or in any of the previous judgments there referred to, which suggests that, consistently with the intendment of the provisions of the Railway Act, or the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, for example, this Court could, after an application for leave to appeal has been fully heard on the merits and dismissed by the judge to whom the application was made, review the decision on the merits and allow the application; and we think that applies with equal force to applications under the provisions of article 1025 of the Criminal Code.\nHere the application was made to Mr. Justice Hudson, was fully heard by him and dismissed, and we think that must be final.\nMotion dismissed.\n[1] [1931] S.C.R. 652.\n"}

The judgment of the trial judge, maintaining the inscription in law and dismissing the action, was reversed by the appellate court, which held that under art. 2233 C.C. husband and wife cannot prescribe against one another. Upon a motion by the respondent to quash an appeal to this Court for want of jurisdiction,\nHeld, that jurisdiction lies in this Court to entertain the appeal. The judgment appealed from is a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of section 2 (b) of the Supreme Court Act; the right in controversy under the inscription in law (i.e., the respondent\u2019s right to institute the action notwithstanding the lapse of time) is a \u201csubstantive right * * * in controversy\u201d in a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d and, unless reversed on appeal, the decision of the appellate court will be binding on the parties throughout all stages of the litigation and thus finally determines the issue in respect of that right.\nMOTION by the respondent to quash an appeal to this Court for want of jurisdiction from a judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec (1), dismissing an inscription in law by the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nVictor Lynch-Staunton K.C. for motion.\nL. H. Ballantyne, (the appellant) contra.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014By the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench[1], now under appeal to this Court, the defendant\u2019s inscription in law was dismissed. By that judgment it was decided that the defendant\u2019s objection in point of law to the action, on the ground that the action when instituted was prescribed, was incompetent because, under article 2233 C.C., husband and wife cannot prescribe against one another.\nThe right in controversy under the inscription in law (the right, that is to say, of the plaintiff to institute the action notwithstanding the lapse of time) is a \u201csubstantive right * * * in controversy\u201d in a \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d within the meaning of section 2 (6) of the Supreme Court Act.\nUnless reversed on appeal, the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench[2] will be binding on the parties throughout all stages of the litigation and thus finally determines the issue in respect of that right. The judgment is, therefore, a final judgment within the definition of our statute.\nThe motion to quash consequently fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Cannon and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014This is a motion by the respondent to quash an appeal to this Court for want of jurisdiction.\nCatherine Sophie Edwards, wife separated from her husband, Linton H. Ballantyne, brought an action against him, claiming damages in the sum of $22,799.28, made up of $2,799.28, said to be costs incurred by her to fight a petition for divorce before the Senate of Canada and $20,000 for libel and slander committed by her husband and his agents concerning the life and habits of the respondent. The defendant inscribed in law against the whole of the action.\nMr. Justice Surveyer, on the 10th June, 1937, dismissed the action on the ground that the right of action was prescribed at the time of the action, under 2267 C.C.\nOn appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench2, the appeal was allowed and the defendant\u2019s inscription in law dismissed, Mr. Justice Galipeault and Mr. Justice Saint-Germain dissenting. The Court of King\u2019s Bench2 held that, under art. 2233 of the Civil Code, husband and wife cannot prescribe against each other. Is this judgment appealable as final under section 2 (b) of our Act, or, in other words, is it a judgment, rule, order or decision which determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding?\nI am of opinion that, as far as the provincial courts are concerned, the question raised by the inscription in law is finally determined. When the case comes back before the Superior Court, if the facts were proven as alleged, the trial judge would be bound in law by the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that, under 2233 C.C., prescription could not run against the plaintiff in favour of the defendant.\nIn Shaw v. St. Louis[3], Taschereau, J., said:\u2014\nThe judgment of the Superior Court * * * was undoubtedly right. As it holds in one of its consid\u00e9rants, its hands were tied by the previous judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nThough the Roman law says that:\u2014\n\u201cit often happens that the appeal court\u2019s judgment is the wrong one, and that he who judges the last does not always judge the best.\u201d still it must be conceded that the relative functions of courts of first instance and of appeal cannot be so inverted as to have authorized the Superior Court, in this instance, to reverse the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. It had to, unreservedly, submit to it, as it did * * *\nIt had no alternative.\nThe maxim \u201cl\u2019interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge\u201d cannot have any application to an interlocutory judgment given by an appeal court and transmitted to the Superior Court for execution. This maxim applies to the very tribunal that rendered the interlocutory judgment, that is to say, if the Superior Court, for instance, renders a purely interlocutory judgment, it may, in certain cases, at the final judgment, not be bound by this interlocutory.\nBut to extend this doctrine to the judgment of a court of appeal, and make it say \u201cl\u2019interlocutoire de la cour d\u2019appel ne lie pas le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance\u201d seems to me untenable.\nAt p. 405 of the report, I find the following quotations:\u2014\nCette maxime, que \u201cl\u2019interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge\u201d, qu\u2019il peut toujours s\u2019en \u00e9carter, judex ab interlocutoris discedere potest, n\u2019est vraie qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des simples jugements interlocutoires qui se bornent \u00e0 ordonner une mesure d\u2019instruction pr\u00e9jugeant le fond, et qui ne contiennent aucune d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive sur tous ou quelques-uns des chefs du d\u00e9bat. Ce sont les seuls qui ne soient pas susceptibles de passer en force de chose jug\u00e9e. Il convient donc de distinguer entre les divers jugements interlocutoires, et m\u00eame dans chaque jugement interlocutoire proprement dit, les d\u00e9cisions qui n\u2019ont pour objet qu\u2019une simple mesure d\u2019instruction, et celles au contraire par lesquelles il est statu\u00e9 \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive. Les d\u00e9cisions de cette derni\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce passant, \u00e0 raison de leur caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif, en force de chose jug\u00e9e, aussi bien que les jugements ordinaires, qui n\u2019ont aucun caract\u00e8re interlocutoire. (Larombi\u00e8re, 5 vol., page 212).\nTout jugement n\u2019a pas l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9somption de v\u00e9rit\u00e9, qui est attach\u00e9e aux jugements, implique qu\u2019ils d\u00e9cident une contestation. * * * De l\u00e0 la cons\u00e9quence que la chose jug\u00e9e ne r\u00e9sulte que des jugements qui statuent d\u00e9finitivement sur la contestation. Il ne faut pas entendre le principe en ce sens que l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e ne soit attribu\u00e9e qu\u2019au jugement qui met fin au proc\u00e8s. Il peut, dans une m\u00eame affaire, intervenir plusieurs jugements d\u00e9finitifs, en ce sens, qu\u2019ils d\u00e9cident d\u00e9finitivement certains points d\u00e9battus entre les parties. Tous ces jugements ont l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e. * * *\nQuand un jugement, interlocutoire en apparence, d\u00e9cide r\u00e9ellement un point contest\u00e9 entre les parties, il est d\u00e9finitif, et il a, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e. (20 Laurent, Nos. 22, 25 et seq.)\nPigeau says (vol. 1, p. 390):\u2014\nQuelquefois le jugement est interlocutoire et d\u00e9finitif en m\u00eame temps, c\u2019est lorsque les juges se trouvent en \u00e9tat de statuer d\u00e9finitivement sur un chef et ont besoin d\u2019\u00e9claircissement sur un autre.\nI, therefore, reach the conclusion that we have before us a \u201cjugement d\u00e9finitif\u201d determining the merits in law of the plea of prescription raised by the defendant. It may also be mentioned that a similar judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench was appealed to this Court in Rattray v. Larue[4], under exactly the same circumstances. The judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench dismissing the \u201cd\u00e9fense en droit\u201d was treated as a final judgment, and this Court took and exercised jurisdiction. It must be said, however, that, there, the question of jurisdiction was not raised by a motion to quash; but this Court could not acquire jurisdiction by the consent of the parties.\nI also refer to the authorities quoted in Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[5] by Fitzpatrick C.J.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the motion with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] (1937) Q.R. 64 K.B. 27.\n[2] [1937] Q.R. 64 K.B. 27.\n2 [1937] Q.R. 64 K.B. 27.\n2 [1937] Q.R. 64 K.B. 27.\n[3] (1883) 8 Can.

Snyder K.C., C.P. Hope K.C. and H.B. Johnson K.C. for the appellant.\nR.H. Greer K.C. and James A. Maloney for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal by the Crown against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] by which that court quashed a conviction of the respondent, John A. Comba, after a verdict of guilty upon an indictment for murder, Latchford C.J.A. dissenting.\nIt was stated before us by counsel for the Crown that the Attorney-General, after reviewing the proceedings at the trial, had, because of certain rulings of the trial judge, decided that the verdict of the jury could not be allowed to stand and that a new trial would be necessary. The difference of opinion between the majority of the court and Latchford C.J.A. concerned solely the question whether there should be a further trial or, as the four judges who constituted the majority of the court unanimously held, the conviction should be quashed and the prisoner discharged on the ground that the proof adduced did not establish a case sufficiently free from doubt to justify a finding that the crime charged was committed by him.\nHaving examined the evidence minutely and weighed with care the argument addressed to us on behalf of the Crown, we think our judgment should be pronounced without further delay.\nIt is admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the verdict rests solely upon a basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by the long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the guilty person.\nWe have no doubt that the facts adduced have not the degree of probative force that is required in order to satisfy the test formulated by this rule; which is one that courts of justice in Canada are governed by and are bound to apply.\nWe agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal, whose reasons for their judgment we find convincing and conclusive, that the learned trial judge ought, on the application made by counsel for the prisoner at the close of the evidence for the Crown, to have told the jury that, in view of the dubious nature of the evidence, it would be unsafe to find the prisoner guilty, and to have directed them to return a verdict of acquittal accordingly.

It has been held by the Courts of Appeal of Alberta and Ontario in two recently decided cases that only persons appointed by the Governor General were capable of exercising the powers so conferred (Kazakewich v, Kazakewich, 1936, 3 W.W.R. 699; Clubine v. Clubine, 1937, O.R. 636). In one of these cases, the Honourable the Chief Justice of Ontario described the question of jurisdiction as being of great public interest and importance and stated that it was desirable that it should be settled by the Court of final resort.\nThe Attorney-General of Ontario has represented to the Minister of Justice that there are four Ontario Statutes of widespread application in relation to which this question arises, namely-the Adoption Act; the Children's Protection Act; the Children of Unmarried Parents Act, and the Deserted Wives' and Children's Maintenance Act, and that judi\u00adcial powers under these Acts are exercisable by Justices of the Peace, Magistrates and Juvenile Court Judges, and, in some cases concurrently with these officials, County or District Court Judges.\nThe Attorney-General of Ontario further represents that the effective administration of the aforesaid statutes has been greatly impeded by the doubt that has been raised as to the validity of their provisions relating to the exercise of judicial powers and has requested that the same be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada in order that the doubt may be set at rest.\nAnd whereas for the aforesaid reasons and having in view the im\u00adportance of the questions involved, it is deemed desirable to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada,\nThe questions referred to the Court were as follows:\n1. With reference to the Adoption Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 218, has\u2014\n(a) the Judge or Junior or Acting Judge of County or District Court;\n(b) a Judge of the Juvenile Court designated a Judge by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council pursuant to the aforesaid Act\nauthority to perform the functions which the legislature has purported to vest in him by the provisions of the said Act, and, if not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent does he lack such authority?\n2. With reference to the Children's Protection Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 312, has\u2014\n(a) the Judge or junior or Acting Judge of the County or District Court; or (b) a Police Magistrate or Judge of the Juvenile Court designated a Judge by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council pursuant to the aforesaid Act; or\n(c) a Justice of the Peace\nauthority to perform the functions which the legislature has purported to vest in him by the provisions of the said Act, and, if not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent does he lack such authority?\n3. With reference to the Children of Unmarried Parents Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 217, has\u2014\n(a) the Judge or Junior or Acting Judge of a County or District Court; or\n(b) a Police Magistrate or Judge of the Juvenile Court designated a Judge by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council pursuant to the aforesaid Act\nauthority to perform the functions which the legislature has purported to vest in him by the provisions of the said Act, and, if not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent does he lack such authority?\n4. With reference to the Deserted Wives' and Children's Maintenance Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 211, has\u2014\n(a) a Justice of the Peace; or\n(b) a Magistrate; or\n(c) a Judge of the Juvenile Court\nauthority to perform the functions which the legislature has purported to vest in him by the provisions of the said Act, and, if not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent does he lack such authority?\nThe answers of the Court to all the said questions were in the affirmative.\nDue notice (pursuant to order of the Court) of the hearing of the said Reference was given to the respective Attorneys-General of the several Provinces of Canada.\nJ. C. McRuer K.C. and F. A. Brewin for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nW. B. Common K.C., C. R. Magone and J. J. Robinette for the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nP. H.

Moyer K.C. for the Attorneys-General of Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan.\nG. B. Henwood K.C. for the Attorney-General of Alberta. W. L. Scott K.C. for the Canadian Welfare Council.\nThe reasons for the answers aforesaid were delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: The starting point for the consideration of the statutes referred to us is this: In point of substantive law it is not disputed that the matters which are the subjects of this legislation are entirely within the control of the legislatures of the provinces. We are not concerned with any ancillary jurisdiction in respect of children which the Dominion may possess in virtue of the assignment to the Dominion Parliament by section 91 of the subject Marriage and Divorce. Whatever may be the extent of that jurisdiction, we are not con\u00adcerned with it here and I mention it only to put it aside.\nThe control by the legislatures over these subjects is supreme in this sense, that the Legislature of Ontario, for example, has for that province legislative authority in re\u00adspect of them just as unqualified, subject to the powers of reservation and disallowance, as that of the Imperial Parliament. It is well not to forget, in examining the constitutionality of enactments of the character of those before us, that by section 93 (subject to provisions having for their purpose the protection of religious minorities) education is committed exclusively to the responsibility of the legislatures; and that, as regards that subject, the powers of the legislatures are not affected by the clause at the end of section 91. We should perhaps also recall that section 93 (as is well known) embodies one of the cardinal terms of the Confederation arrangement. Education, I may add, is, as I conceive it, employed in this section in its most comprehensive sense.\nIt is pertinent also to observe that the subject of relief, relief of persons in circumstances in which the aid of the State is required to supplement private charity in order to provide the necessaries of life, has become one of enormous importance; and that, primarily, responsibility for this rests upon the provinces; the direct intervention of the Dominion in such matters being exceedingly difficult, by reason of constitutional restrictions. The responsibility of the state for the care of people in distress (including neglected children and deserted wives) and for the proper education and training of youth, rests upon the province; in all the provinces the annual public expenditure for education and the care of indigent people is of great magnitude, a magnitude which attests in a con\u00adclusive manner the deep, active, vigilant concern of the people of this country in these matters. Moreover, while, as subject matter of legislation, the criminal law is entrusted to the Dominion Parliament, responsibility for the admin\u00adistration of justice and, broadly speaking, for the policing of the country, the execution of the criminal law, the suppression of crime and disorder, has from the beginning of 1 Confederation been recognized as the responsibility of the provinces and has been discharged at great cost to the 1 people; so also, the provinces, sometimes acting directly, sometimes through the municipalities, have assumed responsibility for controlling social conditions having a tendency to encourage vice and crime.\nThe statutes before us constitute a part of the legislative measures in Ontario directed to these various ends. It would be competent to the Province of Ontario to put in effect a Poor Law system modelled upon that which prevails in England today. The province has not seen fit to do that but in some important respects the statutes that we have to consider embody features of the Poor Law system.\nPerhaps the most important of these enactments now before us is the Children's Protection Act. The plan to which it gives effect is aimed at producing effective cooperation between organized voluntary services and public authorities, police officers, probation officers, justices of the peace, police magistrates, and a special tribunal known as the Juvenile or Family Court. The statute, as well as similar statutes in other provinces, has proved an admirable agency for the purpose for which it was designed. The practical problem raised by this reference is whether or not it is competent to the province to invest the officers presiding over these special tribunals, as well as justices of the peace and police magistrates, with the powers of summary adjudication conferred upon them by the statute, or whether, on the other hand, as is contended by those who attack the legislation, they are disabled in some important respects by Section 96 of the B.N.A. Act from taking advan\u00adtage of this convenient summary procedure which has proved so efficacious.\nNow, it seems to be indisputable that sections 96 and 97 of the British North America Act contemplate the existence of provincial courts and judges other than those within the ambit of section 96. Indeed, it would be a non-natural reading of those sections to construe them as applying to such courts of summary jurisdiction as magistrates and justices of the peace. Besides, such a construction, having regard to the circumstances, even if the language in its ordinary sense extended to such judicial officers, would seem to be excluded by the fact that all judges appointed by the Governor General are to be selected from the bars of the respective provinces. That the statesmen respon\u00adsible for Confederation could in fact have contemplated such a restriction upon the appointment of magistrates and justices of the peace would be a supposition that nobody having any knowledge of the circumstances of the country could countenance.\nNor so far as I know, has it been contended since 1892 that magistrates and justices of the peace and courts presided over by them at the time of Confederation fell within the intendment of section 96. Nevertheless, the argument before us in support of the attack on the constitutionality of the legislation based upon some dicta and decisions of the last few years appears logically to involve the con\u00adclusion that magistrates and justices of the peace exercis\u00ading civil jurisdiction are within the purview of sections 96 and 97 and it is necessary to examine the validity of this position.\nIn the early years of Confederation, the view was advanced and found vigorous support for nearly a quarter of a century that, since the appointment of all judges, including technically magistrates and justices of the peace, was matter of prerogative (and since, as was contended, every prerogative had been vested exclusively in the Gov\u00adernor General as the sole representative of the Sovereign in the Dominion), the Lieutenant-Governors possessed strict\u00adly in point of law no authority to appoint such function\u00adaries and the legislatures none to legislate with regard to such appointments. Shortly after the B.N.A. Act came into force, the view was put forward by the Department of Justice in report\u00ading on provincial legislation that no prerogative rights of property and no prerogative power passed to the provinces and that the provinces had no legislative jurisdiction in respect of such rights or powers. Notwithstanding the convincing argument set forth in a memorable state paper by Mr. Mowat, in which he expounded the views of the government of Ontario touching the relation of the pro\u00advincial executive to the Crown; notwithstanding the de\u00adcision in Regina v. Coote[1] affirming the unanimous judg\u00adment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Quebec; notwith\u00adstanding the decisions of the Ontario judges supporting the doctrine advocated by Mr. Mowat on which the Ontario legislation was based (Regina v. Wason[2] ; A.-G. for Canada v. A.-G. for Ontario[3] ), the Department of Justice did not yield the ground it had taken up in this contro\u00adversy until the decision of the Privy Council in the Maritime Bank's case[4]. That decision gave final judicial sanc\u00adtion to the views of Ontario as expounded by Mr. Mowat nearly twenty years before. In the meantime, the author\u00adity of the provinces in respect of the appointment of justices of the peace and other judicial officers of summary jurisdiction had come before the courts. In 1877, the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (in Ganong v. Bayley[5]) had to consider the validity of provincial legislation constituting a small debts court with limited jurisdiction in contract and in tort presided over by judicial officers designated as commissioners. The legislation was sus\u00adtained by the majority of the court; but the minority, the Chief Justice and Duff J., held it unconstitutional upon the ground that it dealt with matter of prerogative over which the province had no jurisdiction, and declared at the same time that another statute of that province, passed in 1873, dealing with the appointment of justices of the peace, was ultra vires because that matter, the appointment of justices of the peace, being likewise matter of prerogative, was also beyond the powers of provincial legislatures under the subject, the administration of justice and constitution of courts.\nThis view expressed by the minority of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick met with no concurrence in the Canadian courts until, in the year 1890, Drake J., of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, pronounced a decision in Burk v. Tunstall[6] based in part at least upon the same grounds, a decision which has assumed a great importance in the discussion of these matters and to which particular reference will be made later.\nIn the meantime, in Ontario, judicial authority and opinion had pronounced themselves finally against this view of the minority of the New Brunswick court. The subject of the authority of the provinces in relation to the appointment of justices of the peace came before a Divi\u00adsional Court in Ontario in 1888 (Armour C.J., Street J. and Falconbridge J.) in Regina v. Bush[7]. Street J., a judge of exceptional experience in such matters, reviewed the subject in an admirable judgment in the course of which he said that, subject to sections 96, 100 and 101, the words of paragraph 14 of section 92\nconfer upon the Provincial Legislatures the right to regulate and provide for the whole machinery connected with the administration of justice in the Provinces, including the appointment of all the judges and officers requisite for the proper administration of justice in its widest sense, reserving only the procedure in criminal matters.\nIt is clearly the intention of the Act that the Provincial Legislatures shall be responsible for the administration of justice within their respective Provinces, excepting in so far as the duty was cast upon the Dominion Parliament. The only duty cast upon the Dominion Parliament in the matter is contained in the clauses to which I have referred, by which the appointment of the judges of certain courts is reserved to it. The administration of justice could not be carried on in the Provinces effec\u00adtually without the appointment of justices of the peace and police magis\u00adtrates, and the conclusion seems to me to be irresistible that it was intended that the appointment of these and other officers, whose duty it should be to aid in the administration of justice, should be left in the hands of the Provincial Legislatures. (pp. 403-405.)\nIn 1896, In re Small Debts Act[8], the full court of the Supreme Court of British Columbia had to pass upon a controversy touching the validity of a statute investing justices of the peace with small debts jurisdiction up to $100. The argument based upon the absence of authority in the provinces to legislate touching the prerogative was rejected on the authority of the Maritime Bank's case[9], which had, in the meantime, been decided. I do not dwell upon the able judgments delivered by McCreight and Walkem JJ. but it is necessary to take note of that of Drake J., in view of the importance that has been attached to some language of his in the earlier judgment, already mentioned, delivered some six years before in 1890 and before the decision in the Maritime Bank's case9. In his judgment in 1896, Mr. Justice Drake makes it plain that in his view sections 96 and 97 of the British North America Act recognize provincial courts and judges other than those enumerated in section 96; and at the conclusion of his judgment he uses these words:\nIn holding this particular Act intra vires, I do not intend to lay down any strict line of demarcation between the courts over which the Dominion Government have the power of appointing and paying the judges, and those other smaller and inferior courts which the Provincial Legislature may establish. No line can be drawn; every case must depend on the particular circumstances, and will be dealt with when the necessity to do so arises.\nI consider it important to call attention to these words because a construction has been put upon a passage which has been cited and relied upon in his earlier judgment in Burk v. Tunstall[10] which would give to section 96 a wider scope and make it applicable to all provincial courts. The discrepancy is easily understood when the judgment in Burk v. Tunstall10 is read as a whole. In that case, which was an application for a writ of prohibition, nobody appeared in opposition to the application and there was no argument in support of the validity of the impugned legislation. The controversy concerned the Mining Court of British Columbia, a court established prior to Confederation. After Confederation the jurisdiction of this Court had been increased by successive increments until the jurisdiction exercised by the Mining Court was vastly more important than that exercised by any County Court in Canada. In British Columbia from the beginning there were officials styled Gold Commissioners who within their respective districts were charged with very important ad\u00administrative functions under the Mineral Act, under other statutes and in still other respects. By the Act constituting the Mining Court, the Gold Commissioner of the District was made the judge of that Court. Mr. Justice Drake undoubtedly held the view that the Mining Court, as constituted in 1890, was a court within the contempla\u00adtion of s. 96; but it is right to point out that there is no sort of resemblance between the jurisdiction and powers of the Mining Court of British Columbia at that date and the jurisdiction of the tribunals we have now to con\u00adsider. The Mining Court was a court of record and was in explicit words invested with the authority of a court of law and equity to deal with all manner of disputes con\u00adcerning mining lands, mining property, mining rights, and in respect of claims for supplies against free miners (who would virtually constitute every corporation and individ\u00adual of the population of a mining district) without restric\u00adtion as to amount or value, with authority to issue writs of ca. sa. ne exeat and so on. I do not doubt that the actual decision of Mr. Justice Drake in that case was right.\nA passage from his judgment expressing certain views as to the construction of section 96 is quoted with approval in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Martineau v. Montreal City[11]. Their Lordships' observations are in these words:\nBut by s. 92, head 13, of the Act, as is well remembered, there is conferred upon the Provincial legislature the exclusive right of making laws in relation to property and civil rights in the Province and (by head 14) in relation to the administration of justice in the Province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of Provincial Courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in these Courts. These exclusive Provincial powers have made it extremely difficult in many cases to draw the line between legis\u00adlation which is within the competence of the Province under s. 92 of the Act, and legislation which is beyond its competence by reason of s. 96. This observation may be illustrated by two instances, neither of them remote from the present case, the first on the one side of the line and the second on the other, In Regina v, Goole[12] it was held by this Board, in an appeal upon which, it must be noticed, the respondent was not represented, that certain statutes of Quebec appointing officers named \" fire marshals,\" with power to examine witnesses under oath and to inquire into the cause and origin of fires and to arrest ,and commit for trial in the same manner as a justice of the peace, was within the competence of the Provincial legislature. On the other hand, in a British Columbia case in 1890\u2014Burk v. Tunstall[13]\u2014it was held by Drake J. that while it was within the competence of the Province to create mining courts and to fix their jurisdiction, it was not within its competence to appoint any officers thereof with other than ministerial powers. The learned judge, in the course of his judgment, referring to s. 96 of the Act, observes, as their Lordships think with reason:\nIt is true that the language used in that section is limited to the judges of the superior, district and county courts in each Prov\u00adince, and it might be contended that these Courts having been expressly named, all other Courts were excluded. If this were so the Provincial legislature would only have to constitute a Court by a special name to enable them to avoid this clause. But in the section itself, after the special Courts thus named, the Courts of probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are excepted from the operation of the clause, thus showing that s. 96 was intended to be general in its operation.\nThis passage in their Lordships' judgment is the basis on which the argument directed against the jurisdiction of courts of summary jurisdiction in this and in other cases of recent years, has mainly rested. It has, I venture to think, been misunderstood but it has been cited again and again as authority for the proposition that it is incompetent to the provincial legislatures to legislate for the appointment of any officer of any provincial court exercising other than ministerial functions, and for the proposition that s. 96 is general in its character in the sense that all provincial courts come within its scope, including courts of summary jurisdiction such as justices of the peace, and that, as re\u00adgards all such courts exercising, at all events, civil jurisdiction, the appointment of judges and officers presiding over them is vested exclusively in the Dominion.\nIt is quite clear, I think, that this is a wholly unwar\u00adranted view of Martineau's case[14] and I shall revert to the judgment of their Lordships a little later. It is neces\u00adsary, I think, before doing so, to consider a little further the judgment of Mr. Justice Drake in Burk v. Tunstall[15].\nThat judgment is based on two grounds. One ground is that the appointment of all judges, without distinction, being matter of prerogative right, is, conformably to the view of the minority of the judges of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in Ganong v. Bayley[16] (which in 1890 was still the view of the Department of Justice), entire\u00adly outside the ambit of provincial jurisdiction in relation to the administration of justice and the constitution of courts. The judgment is also put on the ground indi\u00adcated in the passage quoted above from the Judicial Committee in Martineau's case[17] that the Mining Court was a court within the purview of section 96. Mr. Justice Drake did, I am convinced, intend to say that, under its powers in relation to the administration of justice and of consti\u00adtution of courts of the province, a province has no power to appoint any officer of any such court other than officers charged with strictly ministerial functions. The view he then held touching the prerogative necessarily excluded from the authority of the provinces power to appoint judges of provincial courts, including judicial officers such as magistrates and justices of the peace, which he con\u00adsidered was vested exclusively in the Governor General; and he intended to say that this exclusive authority was in no way restricted by section 96. He would not have taken this view had his attention been called to Regina v. Coote[18]; but, as mentioned above, he had not the benefit of any argument in support of the legislation.\nAs I have already observed, his views had changed in 1896 and his judgment of that year gives the simple explanation, viz., that he loyally accepted, as, of course, it was his duty to do, the judgment of the Judicial Com\u00admittee in the Maritime Bank's case[19] as negativing the views he had formerly held with regard to the prerogative. He points out in the later judgment that the views of the Chief Justice and of Duff J., in the New Brunswick case[20], touching the prerogative had necessarily been displaced by the Maritime Bank's case19. Therefore, he definitely recognized, as appears from the passage I have quoted, the authority of the Province to constitute courts to which section 96 has no application and to appoint the judges or judicial officers to preside over them.\nAfter the decision in the Maritime Bank's case19 down to the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Martineau's case in 1932[21], the view, to which effect was given in Regina v. Bush in 1888[22], and in the British Columbia case, In re Small Debts Act, in 1896[23], was generally accepted in Canada; the view, that is to say, that it is com\u00adpetent to the provinces to legislate for the appointment of justices of the peace and invest them as well as other courts of summary jurisdiction with civil and criminal jurisdic\u00adtion. Even the Department of Justice accepted this view, as appears from the report of Mr. Fitzpatrick, as Minister of Justice, of December 31st, 1901, where, in referring to the district courts of the Province of New Brunswick invested with a jurisdiction to deal with claims on contract up to $80 and in tort up to $40, he says :\nThese courts appear, however, to be intended to take the place of the parish courts and magistrates' courts, having limited civil jurisdiction, heretofore established, and they are not courts in the opinion of the undersigned having the dignity of the district courts intended by the British North America Act.\nIn 1917 there was a reference by the Lieutenant-Gover\u00adnor in Council of Alberta touching the validity of the Small Debts Recovery Act of that province[24]. The question was fully discussed in the judgments of Harvey C.J. and Beck J. and determined in the sense of the British Colum\u00adbia decision of 1896.\nThe attack on the validity of such provincial legislation based upon the argument drawn from the Justice Depart\u00adment's theory as to prerogative powers having received its quietus from the decision in the Maritime Bank's case[25], justices of the peace of almost every province of Canada, along with other courts of summary jurisdiction, exercised without question civil jurisdiction in the character of small debts courts and otherwise until the judg\u00adment of the Privy Council in Martineau's case26 which seemed to start a fresh series of attacks upon the provin\u00adcial jurisdiction in relation to the administration of justice.\nNow, I think the observations of the Judicial Committee in Martineau's case[26] were not directed to magistrates' courts and courts of justices of the peace or, indeed, to courts of summary jurisdiction of any kind; and, when the whole of the passage in Lord Blanesburgh's judgment on pages 121 and 122 is read, this seems to be clear. It is quite true it is observed that the respondent was not represented in Regina v. Coote[27], but it must be noticed that in that case the Court of Queen's Bench in Quebec had unanimously held the legislation in question there, which provided for the appointment of fire marshals, with the powers of justices of the peace, and with authority to investigate and report on the origin of fires and to commit persons for trial if the facts should warrant that course, to be within the competence of the provincial legislature and this their Lordships appear to have considered, as did the Court of Queen's Bench, a question upon which it was necessary to pass; and they did so by expressly approving the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench.\nBut their Lordships' judgment in Martineau's case[28] does not profess to overrule the previous decision in Regina v. Coote[29] which, it may be observed, was decided by a board that included Sir Montague Smith.\nI have already said that, in my view, Drake J. in the earlier case did mean to say that section 96 applies to all provincial courts of every description because his view as touching the prerogative necessarily excluded the authority of the province; but it is equally clear to me that their Lordships in the Privy Council, had not their attention called to this aspect of the subject and are not giving their sanction to the words of Drake J. in the extended sense in which I think he intended to employ them. Indeed, it is quite plain that they could not do so consistently with the previous decision in Regina v. Coote29 which explicitly recognized the authority of the provinces to legislate for the appointment of judicial officers with the powers of justices of the peace; and, as I humbly think, it cannot be supposed that their Lordships could have given their adher\u00adence to pronouncement at variance with all Canadian decisions and all Canadian practice since 1892 without some reference to such decisions and practice.\nIt cannot, therefore, be seriously disputed that, on enactment of the British North America Act, and on the subse\u00adquent extension of the Act to the provinces of British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, magistrates and jus\u00adtices of the peace remained outside the scope of section 96. Some more or less obvious consequences follow from that.\nAt the date of the Union, in Upper Canada, justices of the peace exercised jurisdiction in civil matters; in respect notably of claims for wages and of orders for the protection of the earnings of married women. In Nova Scotia they possessed a small debts jurisdiction up to $80 in contract and to a lower limit in tort. In British Colum\u00adbia, they possessed jurisdiction in respect of protection orders, in respect of claims for ferry tolls, in respect of line fences; and in disputes respecting the ownership of stolen cattle. At least in the Maritime provinces, in Quebec and British Columbia there was, under the Seamen's Acts and under the Merchants Shipping Act, jurisdiction to entertain claims for seamen's wages.\nBy section 129 (B.N.A. Act) it was enacted as follows:\nExcept as otherwise provided by this Act, all laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick at the Union, and all Courts of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal Commissions, Powers, and Authori\u00adties, and all Officers, Judicial, Administrative, and Ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had net been made; subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,) to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the respective Province, according to the Authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act,\nThe effect of this section, of course, was that the authority of magistrates and justices of the peace in these civil mat\u00adters, as well as of all judicial officers not within section 96 continued after 'Confederation in the provinces mentioned, subject to alteration by the legislature.\nAs regards seamen's wages, the Dominion, no doubt, possessed some authority to deal with that subject under section 91 and the jurisdiction of magistrates under the Merchants Shipping Act[30] continued unaltered; and, in the case of Inland Waters, jurisdiction was given to justices of the peace in respect of such claims by a statute of 1873.\nAs regards jurisdiction in all the other matters men\u00adtioned, there can be no doubt that the Dominion possesses no authority under the B.N.A. Act to abate it by one jot. The B.N.A. Act, therefore, by its express terms pro\u00advided for the continuance of courts possessing civil jurisdic\u00adtion which were not within the scope of section 96 and concerning the powers of which the provinces had exclusive authority in virtue of section 92 (14).\nThe provinces acquired plenary authority, not only to diminish the jurisdiction of such courts, but also to increase it, subject only to any qualification arising in virtue of s. 96. My view of the effect of s. 96 as regards such courts existing at the date of Confederation (that is to say, outside the scope of that section) is this: the provinces became endowed with plenary authority under s. 92 (14), but, a province is not empowered to usurp the authority vested exclusively in the Dominion in respect of the appointment of judges who, by the true intendment of the section, fall within the ambit of s. 96, or to enact legislation repugnant to that section; and it is too plain for discussion that a province is not competent to do that indirectly by altering the character of existing courts outside that section in such a manner as to bring them within the intendment of it while retaining control of the appointment of the judges presiding over such courts. That, in effect, would not be distinguishable from constituting a new court as, for exam\u00adple, a Superior Court, within the scope of section 96 and assuming power to appoint the judge of it. In principle, I do not think it is possible to support any stricter limita\u00adtion upon the authority of the provinces, and I do not think what I am saying is in substance inconsistent with what was laid down by Lord Atkin speaking on behalf of the Judicial Committee in Toronto v. York[31].\nOne of the contentions of the appellants in that case was that the Ontario Municipal Board was invalidly consti\u00adtuted as being a Superior Court constituted in violation of sections 96, 99 and 100 of the British North America Act. The conclusion of their Lordships in the Privy Council on this contention was that the Municipal Board is primarily in \"pith and substance,\" an administrative body. As to Part III of the Act (22 Geo. V, 1932, cap. 27), especially sections 41-46, 54 and 59, in which the Board\nshall for all purposes of this Act have ,all the .powers of a court of record (sec. 41),\nand\nshall as to all matters within its jurisdiction under this Act have authority to hear and determine all questions of law or of fact (sec. 42),\nand\nfor the due exercise of its jurisdiction and powers and otherwise for carrying into effect the provisions of this or any other general or special Ant, shall have all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the Supreme Court with respect to the amendment of proceedings, addition or substitution of parties, attendance and examination of witnesses, pro\u00adduction and inspection of documents, entry on and inspection of property; enforcement of its orders and all other matters necessary or proper therefor (sec. 45),\ntheir Lordships said it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that the sections in question purport to clothe the Board with the functions of a Court, and to vest in it judicial powers, and held that\nso far, therefore, as the Act purports to constitute the Board a Court of Justice analogous to a Superior, District, or County Court it is pro tanto invalid.\nBut it is obvious that their Lordships were not considering, , because there was no occasion to do so, the distinction be\u00adtween the courts that come within the intendment of sec\u00adtion 96 of the British North America Act and other courts or tribunals.\nIn effect, it was argued before us that provincial legis\u00adlation is repugnant to section 96 if in any particular the jurisdiction of one of these courts of summary jurisdiction existing at the date of Confederation is increased. That, in my view, is quite inadmissible in principle as it is incom\u00adpatible with practice and authority since Confederation with the exception of one or two decisions in very recent years which are put upon the authority of Martineau's case[32].\nBefore proceeding further, it will be convenient to advert to some general considerations. In the argument addressed to us there is an underlying assumption that the interest of the people of this country in the inde\u00adpendent and impartial administration of justice has its main security in sections 96, 97 and 99. Now, there were weighty reasons, no doubt, for those sections, and a strict observance of them as regards the judges of courts within their purview is essential to the due administration of jus\u00adtice. But throughout the whole of this country magistrates daily exercise, especially in the towns and cities, judicial powers of the highest importance in relation more par\u00adticularly to the criminal law, but in relation also to a vast body of law which is contained in provincial statutes and municipal by-laws. The jurisdiction exercised by these functionaries, speaking generally, touches the great mass of the people more intimately and more extensively than do the judgments of the Superior Courts; and it would be an extraordinary supposition that a great community like the province of Ontario is wanting, either in the will or in the capacity, to protect itself against misconduct by these officers whom it appoints for these duties; and any such suggestion would be baseless in fact and altogether fallacious as the foundation of a theory controlling the construction of the B.N.A. Act.\nMoreover, except in the case of the Superior Court judges of the provinces, who, by force of section 99, hold office during good conduct and are removable only by the Governor General on address by the Senate and the House of Commons, the British North America Act provides no security of tenure for judges coming within s. 96.\nIt is very clear to me, therefore, that, if you were justified in holding that by force of s. 96 the provinces have been disabled since Confederation from adding to the jurisdic\u00adtion of judges not within that section, there would be equally good ground for holding that by force of s. 99 the provinces are disabled from extending the jurisdiction of the County Courts and the District Courts in such a way as to embrace matters which were then exclusively within the jurisdiction of Superior Courts.\nNow, the pecuniary limit of claims cognizable 'by County Court judges has been frequently enlarged since Confederation and nobody has ever suggested so far as I know that the result has been to transform the County Court into a Superior Court and to bring the County Court judges within s. 99. Perhaps the most striking example of these enlargements of jurisdiction was that which occurred in British Columbia when the jurisdiction of the Mining Court, after the judgment of Mr. Justice Drake referred to above, was transferred to the County Court; and the County Court in respect of mines, mining lands and so on was given a jurisdiction unrestricted as to amount or value with all the powers of a court of law or equity.\nIt has never been suggested, so far as I know, that the effect even of that particular enlargement of the jurisdiction of the County Courts of British Columbia was to deprive the County Court and the County Court judges of their characters as such and to transform them into Superior Courts and Superior Court judges; or that s. 99 has, since these increases took place, been applicable to County Court judges. In point of fact, as everybody knows, the practice has been opposed to this.\nIf the provinces have no authority to increase the jurisdiction of the County Courts without depriving them of their character as such, then no such jurisdiction exists anywhere. As Mr. Justice Strong, speaking for this Court, said in Re County Courts of British Columbia[33] :\n* * * The jurisdiction of parliament to legislate as regards the jurisdiction of provincial courts is, I consider, excluded by subsection 14 of s. 92, before referred to, inasmuch as the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts plainly includes the power to define the jurisdiction of such courts territorially as well as in other respects. This seems to me too plain to require demonstration.\nIn answer to the suggestion that a territorial increase of jurisdiction ought to be followed by a fresh commission to the judge of the County Court, he observed that the suggestion was a \" preposterous \" one.\nThere is a strong current of authority against the prop\u00adosition I am discussing. Small debts courts presided over by judges appointed by the provinces were established in New Brunswick in 1877, in British Columbia in 1895, in Alberta in 1917, and, no doubt, elsewhere, and the validity of this legislation has been uniformly sustained. The jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia magistrates in such matters (vested in them before Confederation) is still exercised without challenge.\nIn French v. McKendrick[34], the Court of Appeal in Ontario unanimously held the Division Courts, courts established before Confederation, exercising jurisdiction in contract and in tort within defined limits as to amount and value, presided over, by the statute constituting them, by a County Court judge or by a member of the bar named as deputy by one of the judges, not to be courts within the scope of s. 96. The Court of Appeal unanimously took the view that the enactment authorizing the appointment of a deputy judge from the bar by a County Judge was competent and also that legislation enlarging the pecuniary limits of jurisdiction was competent.\nI agree with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Drake, in his judgment in Re Small Debts Act[35], that it is inadvisable to attempt to draw an abstract line for the purpose of classifying courts as falling within section 96 or otherwise. I think, with respect, that this is not in the least inconsistent with Lord Atkin's observations in Toronto v. York[36].\nThen, it should be observed that, if you have a provin\u00adcial court outside the scope of s. 96 and the province enlarges its jurisdiction or its powers, but not in such a manner as to constitute a court of a class within the intendment of s. 96, I, as a judge, charged solely with the application of the law, have no further concern with what the legislature has done. It is no part of my function as a judge to consider whether, if the province should go on enlarging the jurisdiction and powers of the court, it might arrive at a point when the tribunal would cease to be one outside the ambit of s. 96. I have nothing to do with that. It may be a very excellent ground for disallowance of the legislation by the Governor General. Even if I am satisfied that there is something in the nature of an abuse of power, that in itself is no concern of mine. If, in its true character, the legislation is legislation concerning the administration of justice and the constitution of provincial courts and is not repugnant to the B.N.A. Act as a whole, that is the end of the matter. As Lord Herschell said in the first Fisheries case[37], the supreme legislative power is always capable of abuse, but the remedy lies with those who elect the legislature. In the case of provincial legis\u00adlatures there is the additional remedy which the Imperial Parliament has committed to the Governor General and not to the courts.\nI am unable to accept the view that the jurisdiction of inferior courts, whether within or without the ambit of s. 96, was by the B.N.A. Act fixed forever as it stood at the date of Confederation.\nComing now to the legislation before us. I do not intend to examine it in detail. Let me first observe that the jurisdiction of the Legislature to pass the Adoption Act appears to me too clear for discussion and I add nothing to that.\nThe remaining three statutes fall into two classes. As regards the Children of Unmarried Parents Act and the Deserted Wives' and Children's Maintenance Act, these statutes, broadly speaking, aim at declaring and enforcing the obligations of husbands and parents to maintain their wives and children and these, self-evidently, are peculiarly matters for provincial authority. As regards the main\u00adtenance of illegitimate children and deserted wives and children, the public responsibility, as already mentioned, rests exclusively with the provinces and it is for the provincial legislatures, and for them alone, to say how the incidence of that responsibility shall be borne. The enact\u00adments are closely analogous to certain of the enactments forming part of the Poor Law system as it has developed in England since the time of Elizabeth; and the jurisdic\u00adtion vested by these statutes in magistrates and judges of the Juvenile Court is not in substance dissimilar to the jurisdiction of magistrates under that system. I agree with the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Dixon v. Dixon[38] that there is no little analogy between the pre-Con\u00adfederation legislation in British Columbia and in Ontario by which the earnings of the wife, which are the property of the husband, can be taken from the husband by a protection order and placed under the control of the wife. I agree with that, on the assumption upon which the argu\u00adment against this legislation proceeded, that a maintenance order against a delinquent husband at the instance of a deserted wife is to be treated as on the same footing as alimony.\nI think, with great respect, however, that the matter is of little importance. The subject is envisaged by these statutes from a different point of view. It is dealt with from the point of view of the obligation of the community and of the husband to the community. That is to say, it recognizes, first, the obligation of the community to pro\u00adtect women and children afflicted by misfortune through the default of their natural protector in the discharge of his natural obligations and, as one means of securing that end, it imposes upon the defaulting father and husband the legal duty enforceable by summary proceedings to support his children and his wife. The statute places the obligation to care for the deserted wife and children on the shoulders of that member of the community whose duty it is to the community as well as to his family to bear the burden. The distinction is well brought out in a passage in a judgment of Lord Atkin in Hyman v. Hyman[39], cited in Mr. Scott's factum:\nWhile the marriage tie exists the husband is under a legal obligation to maintain his wife. The duty can be enforced by the wife, who can pledge his credit for necessaries as an agent of necessity, if, while she lives apart from him with his consent, he either fails to pay her an agreed allowance or fails to make her any allowance at all; or, if she lives apart from him under a decree for separation, he fails to pay the alimony ordered by the Court. But the duty of the husband is also a public obligation, and can be enforced against him by the State under the Vagrancy Acts and under the Poor Relief Acts.\nOne further point made against this feature of the statute is that there is no pecuniary limit. This again I regard as of small importance. The jurisdiction is not without limit; it is necessarily limited by the purpose for which the order is made.\nIn Clubine v. Clubine[40] the Court of Appeal for Ontario, following the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Alberta in Kazakewich v. Kazakewich[41], held that section 1 (1) of the Deserted Wives' and Children's Main\u00adtenance Act is ultra vires on the ground that it is beyond the powers of a provincial legislature to invest a court of summary jurisdiction, such as a magistrate's court, with a jurisdiction theretofore exclusively exercised by a Superior Court of the province. I have given my reasons for think\u00ading that the proposition in that sweeping form cannot be sustained and, with the greatest possible respect, I think, moreover, that the Court of Appeal for Ontario have not given due weight to the special character of the jurisdic\u00adtion vested in the courts of summary jurisdiction under the Deserted Wives' and Children's Maintenance Act, or to the close analogy between that jurisdiction and the jurisdiction exercised for centuries by courts of summary jurisdiction in England and in Canada. With the greatest possible respect, I am unable to concur in the decisions in Clubine v. Clubine40 and Kazakewich v. Kazakewich41.\nIn Rex v. Vesey[42] the Supreme Court of New Brunswick pronounced a decision based upon the view that such legislation was not beyond the competence of a provincial legislature. Looking at the question in controversy from the point of view most favourable to the attack, the question one must ask oneself is this: does the jurisdiction conferred upon magistrates under these statutes broadly conform to a type of jurisdiction generally exercisable by courts of summary jurisdiction rather than the jurisdiction exer\u00adcised by courts within the purview of s. 96? There can be only one answer to that question. It is proper beyond doubt to look at the practice in England for this purpose (Croft v. Dunphy)[43]. The summary of statutes in the factum for British Columbia is conclusive. Moreover, the statute referred to by Mr. Scott, and printed in full also in the factum for the Dominion, of the year 1718 (5 Geo. I, ch. 8), entitled \"An Act for the more effectual relief of such wives and children, as are left by their hus\u00adbands and parents, upon the charge of the parish,\" bears a close analogy to this feature of the legislation which is that upon which the attack is mainly based. This statute was certainly in force in British Columbia at the date of Confederation and, probably, was in force in Ontario.\nComing to the Children's Protection Act. Having regard to the purpose of the Act and its machinery, it appears to me to be precisely the kind of legislation which might be described as the modern counterpart of the Poor Law legislation in those features of it which are concerned with the care of neglected children. With great respect, I am unable to perceive any ground upon which it can be validly affirmed that magistrates exercising jurisdiction under this statute are entering upon a sphere which, having regard to legal history, belongs to the Superior Courts rather than to courts of summary jurisdiction; or that in exercising the functions attributed to them by this legislation they come within any fair intendment of sec\u00adtion 96.\nIt is proper, perhaps, to advert particularly to the cir\u00adcumstance that, by section 26 of the statute, a Supreme Court judge has authority at any time to put an end to the guardianship of a Children's Aid Society and to return the child to the parents (Re Maher)[44].\nHaving given my reasons for thinking that these statutes are validly enacted in respect of the jurisdiction vested in the magistrates and justices of the peace as such, I come now to the Juvenile Court.\nThere is one general observation which must first be made. If you have a jurisdiction which can be exercised by a tribunal not within section 96, that is to say, by a tribunal presided over by a judge or officer appointed by the province, it is entirely for the province to say how the tribunal shall be constituted and by what name judicial officers presiding over it shall be called. Regina v. Coote[45] is, on this point conclusive.\nNow, the Juvenile Court is recognized and, to my mind, properly beyond all doubt recognized as a properly consti\u00adtuted court for the purpose of dealing with offences under the Dominion Juvenile Delinquents' Act, 1929 (19-20 Geo. V, ch. 46) and the amendments of 1935 and 1936 (25-26 Geo. V, ch. 41, and 1 Edw. VIII, ch. 40).\nJurisdiction under the old law of the Province of Canada in respect of offences by juvenile delinquents was exer\u00adcisable by two justices of the peace, by a recorder, or by a stipendiary magistrate. A Juvenile Court constituted for exercising this jurisdiction in respect of juvenile offenders is plainly to my mind a court not within s. 96 and it does not become so by virtue of the fact that the officers presiding over it are invested with further jurisdiction of the same character as is validly given to magistrates and justices of the peace.\nAll the Interrogatories will, therefore, be answered in the affirmative.\nThe questions referred, answered in the affirmative.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W.

Code, s. 854\u2014Charge under s. 193 (3) of Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and amendments\u2014Form of verdict.\nAppellants were charged and convicted on an indictment that they \u201cdid * * * assist or were otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transporting or in the harbouring of goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act, to wit: spirituous liquors of a value for duty of over\u201d $200, contrary to s. 193 (3) of said Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and amendments. The indictment was attacked on the ground that it was bad for multiplicity, in that appellants were charged with several offences in the alternative in the one count.\nHeld: The attack on the indictment failed. Appellants were not charged with any one of the offences of \u201cimporting,\u201d \u201cunshipping.\u201d etc. They were charged with an offence created by s. 193 of the Customs Act, which creates a substantive offence, and the guilt of a person charged thereunder depends in no degree whatever upon the fact or otherwise that the acts in which such person is concerned are themselves offences. S. 854 of the Cr. Code applies.\nHeld, also, that the form of the jury\u2019s verdict, finding accused \u201cguilty of harbouring only,\u201d was unobjectionable when read in connection with the indictment and the trial Judge\u2019s charge.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, 12 M.P.R. 483, sustaining, on equal division, the conviction of accused, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], which, on equal division, dismissed their appeal from their conviction, at trial before Graham J. and a jury, on an indictment that they\ndid * * * assist or were otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transporting or in the harbouring of goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act, to wit: spirituous liquors of a value for duty of over Two Hundred Dollars,\ncontrary to s. 193 (3) of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, and amendments thereto.\nAt trial, before plea by the accused, their counsel objected to the indictment, claiming that it was bad for a multiplicity of charges. The trial Judge over-ruled the objection.\nAfter the jury had been charged and had retired, they returned and asked for instruction with regard to the form of verdict. The trial Judge instructed them as follows:\u2014\nI understand you want to know whether or not you can specify on which of the matters you find the accused guilty. There are a number in the indictment\u2014did: assist or were otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing, removing, subsequent transportation of or in the harbouring\u2014and I say to you that if you find them guilty of any of these things you may find them \u201cguilty\u201d and leave it at that. It is not necessary for you to pick out one of them. If you find they assisted or were otherwise concerned in the importing you may find them \u201cguilty.\u201d If you find they assisted or were otherwise concerned in the unshipping or the landing or the removing or the, subsequent transportation of the liquor, a verdict of, \u201cguilty\u201d will cover it. I don\u2019t think it would be an error if you designated the particular thing of which you found them guilty, but it seems to me there is less likelihood of an error if you enter the general verdict of guilty.\nBring in whatever verdict you think proper, and if for any reason I think it is incomplete or not satisfactory I will tell you or send you back.\nThe jury found the accused \u201cguilty of harbouring only.\u201d\nThe grounds of appeal specified by the accused in their notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco were:\u2014\n1. Because the indictment charged six offences and thereby prejudiced us in our defence;\n2. Because the indictment is bad for multiplicity and should have been quashed when the motion was made to quash same before we pleaded;\n3. Because the special verdict found by the jury does not constitute an indictable offence;\n4. Because the learned trial Judge erred in instructing the jury that they could bring in a verdict of guilty of any one of the particular offences mentioned in the indictment.\nThe appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco was dismissed on equal division; the judgment for dismissal of the appeal being written by Doull J., concurred in by Hall J.; and the judgment contra (in favour of directing a new trial) was written by Carroll J., concurred in by Archibald J.[2]\nThe accused appealed to this Court. By the judgment now reported, the appeal was dismissed.\nJ. W. Maddin K.C. for the appellants.\nD. D. Finlayson for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia dismissing by an equal division an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Graham who, at the trial, had rejected a motion to quash the indictment. The indictment is as follows:\u2014\nLouis Gatto and Alphonse Tonellatto, of the Town of New Water-ford, in the. County of Cape Breton, Province of Nova Scotia, did on or about the twenty-fourth day of December, in the year of Our Lord, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Thirty-six, at or near Gabarus, in the said county and province, assist or were otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transporting or in the harbouring of goods liable to forfeiture under the Customs Act, to wit:\nspirituous liquors of a value for duty of over Two Hundred Dollars, contrary to subsection 3 of section 193 of the Customs Act, being chapter 42 of the Revised States of Canada, 1927, and amendments thereto, being the form of Statute in that behalf made and provided.\nThe application to quash proceeded on the ground that the indictment is bad for multiplicity, that is to say, that several offences are charged in one count.\nWe have carefully considered the able judgment of Mr. Justice Carroll (with whom Mr. Justice Archibald concurred) who thought the appeal should be allowed and the indictment quashed; but have come to the conclusion that the weight of argument is definitely in favour of the view expressed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Doull, who agreed with the view of the learned trial judge.\nThe charge is laid under subsection 3 of section 193 of the Customs Act. Section 193 is in these words:\u2014\n193. (1) All vessels, with the guns, tackle, apparel and furniture thereof, and all vehicles, harness, tackle, horses and cattle made use of in the importation or unshipping or landing or removal or subsequent transportation of any goods liable to forfeiture under this Act, shall be seized and forfeited.\n(2) Every person who assists or is otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transporting, or in the harbouring of such goods, or into whose control or possession the same come without lawful excuse, the proof of which shall be on the person accused, shall, in addition to any other penalty, forfeit a sum equal to the value of such goods, which may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction, and, where the value for duty of such goods is under two hundred dollars, shall further be liable on summary conviction before two justices of the peace to a penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month, or to both fine and imprisonment.\n(3) Where the value for duty of the goods so imported, unshipped, landed, removed, subsequently transported, or harboured or found, is two hundred dollars or over, such person shall be guilty of an indictable offence and liable on conviction, in addition to other penalties to which he is subject for any such offence, to a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars and not less than two hundred dollars, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years and not less than one year, or to both fine and imprisonment.\nThe argument on behalf of the appellant is that under this section \u201cimporting\u201d goods of the character to which it relates is one offence, \u201cunshipping\u201d another offence, \u201clanding\u201d another offence, \u201cremoving\u201d another offence, \u201ctransporting\u201d another and \u201charbouring\u201d still another, and, accordingly, that the appellants were charged with six offences in the alternative in the one count.\nMr. Justice Doull, with whom Mr. Justice Hall concurred, says:\u2014\nThe fallacy in this argument is that the appellants were not charged with any one of the offences mentioned. They were charged with an offence created by section 193 of the Customs Act, which, leaving out irrelevant matter for the moment, provides that \u201cEvery person who assists or is otherwise concerned in the importing, unshipping, landing or removing or subsequent transportation or in the harbouring of such goods (i.e., goods liable to forfeiture under this Act), where the value of the goods so imported, &c., is Two Hundred Dollars or over, shall be guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a penalty not exceeding One Thousand Dollars and not less than Two Hundred Dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years and not less than one year or to both fine and imprisonment.\nSection 193 creates a substantive offence, and the guilt of a person charged thereunder depends in no degree whatever upon the fact or otherwise that the acts in which such person is concerned are themselves offences.\nWe agree with this view and we think it is conclusive of the controversy. Section 854 of the Code applies. We agree also with Mr. Justice Doull and Mr. Justice Hall that the form of the verdict is unobjectionable when it is read in connection with the indictment and the charge of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J. W. Maddin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: M. A. Patterson.\n[1] 12 M.P.R. 483; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 228.\n[2] 12 M.P.R. 483; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 228.\n"}

Code, ss. 985, 986 (2)\u2014Nature of article\u2014Prizes for punching in a board holes containing \u201cwinning letters\u201d contained in correct answers to printed questions\u2014Possibility of use of knowledge to punch with certainty correct holes\u2014Difficult nature of questions\u2014Probable and contemplated manner of using the board\u2014Sufficiency of evidence to support magistrate\u2019s finding against accused.\nAppellant was convicted of keeping a common gaming house contrary to s. 229 of the Cr. Code. Under a search warrant there was seized in appellant\u2019s drug store what was described as a \u201cskill puzzle board\u201d containing (inter alia) a list of prizes, lists of numbered questions, and rows (numbered correspondingly to the questions) of holes, the operator to win a prize if he punched a hole containing a \u201cwinning letter\u201d (which letter would be in its proper place in the spelling of the answer, concealed under the row of holes, to the correspondingly numbered question). It was stated that if the operator knew the answer to a question he could make with certainty a winning punch. It was apparent (as found by the court) that very few persons who had not previously examined the questions and undertaken to search in books of reference, etc., would know the answers. Appellant contended that, there being only one correct answer to each question, there was no gaming or chance connected with the operation of the board. The question on this appeal was whether or not there was before the magistrate evidence sufficient in point of law to support a finding that the article was a \u201cmeans or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting\u201d within s. 986 (2) of the Cr. Code.\nHeld: The conviction should be sustained. As applicable to this appeal, the effect of ss. 985 and 986 (2), Cr. Code, was to render it unnecessary for the prosecution to adduce evidence that persons had resorted to appellant\u2019s drug store for the purpose of using the board. As to its manner of use: The court must apply its knowledge of the usual everyday custom of mankind and hold that the ordinary person entering the store would pay the sum required (10 cents) for the chance of winning a prize, without critically examining the questions and returning later with a correct answer or answers. It was quite apparent that it was never intended that the board would be so used, but, on the contrary, it was expected that some persons entering the store would be inveigled to pay for punching a hole and the chance of winning a prize. This consideration sufficed to demonstrate that the board was a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance or, at any rate, a mixed game of chance and skill.\nPer Duff C.J.: The magistrate was entitled to look at the character of the questions and to consider the probability that people participating in the game would seriously undergo the labour of ascertaining the correct answers, as well as the probability that anybody offering the game to people entering a public shop would expect that any such thing would be done. The magistrate evidently concluded that, while the game could be played as one involving research and with certain results, it would in actual practice be operated in such a manner that the result, favourable or unfavourable, would depend entirely upon luck, and that such was the shopkeeper\u2019s expectation. It could not be said that there was no evidence upon which the magistrate, employing his knowledge as a man of the world, as it was his duty to do, could take this view. It was an admissible conclusion, if the magistrate was so satisfied, that there was no other reasonable explanation of the proved facts. There was, therefore, evidence to support his finding that the article was a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance and was operated for gain by appellant.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which (Masten J.A. dissenting) dismissed his appeal from his conviction by a magistrate of keeping a common gaming house, contrary to s. 229 of the Criminal Code. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed.\nL.M. Singer K.C. for the appellant.\nC.L. Snyder K.C. and C.P. Hope K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of Mr. Justice Kerwin in which I agree. I merely add that the controversy turns upon the application of sections 985 and 986, Cr. C. Subsection 2 of section 986 is in the following terms:\u2014\nIf any house, room or place is found fitted or provided with any means or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting, or with any device for concealing, removing or destroying such means or contrivance it shall be prima facie evidence that such house, room or place is a common gaming house or common betting house as the means or contrivance may indicate;\nand the question we have to determine is whether or not there was before the magistrate evidence sufficient in point of law to support a finding that the article produced is a \u201cmeans or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting.\u201d\nIt is not disputed that the article was not in the shop for sale. It is equally clear that it is a \u201cmeans or contrivance for playing a game.\u201d On the payment of ten cents, the person desiring to participate in the game is entitled, if he succeeds in punching a hole containing one of the winning letters, to receive a prize specified as appertaining to that letter.\nMr. Singer argues that the game is not a \u201cgame of chance or a mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting\u201d because each of the questions in the six columns has one and only one correct answer\u2014which can be ascertained; and if such correct answers are ascertained each one of the winning letters will appear in one or more of them.\nThe magistrate was entitled to look at the character of the questions and to consider the probability that people participating in this game would seriously undergo the labour of ascertaining the correct answers to these questions, as well as the probability that anybody offering this game to people entering a public shop would expect that any such thing would be done. The magistrate evidently came to the conclusion that, while the game could be played as a game involving research and with certain results, it would, nevertheless, in actual practice, be operated in such a manner that the result, favourable or unfavourable, would depend entirely upon luck, and that such was the expectation of the shopkeeper.\nI find myself unable to hold that there was no evidence upon which the magistrate, employing his knowledge as a man of the world, as it was his duty to do, could take this view. It was an admissible conclusion, if the magistrate was so satisfied, that there was no other reasonable explanation of the proved facts. There was, therefore, evidence to support his finding that the article produced was a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance and was operated for gain by the appellant.\nThe judgment of Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN, J.\u2014The appellant was convicted of keeping a common gaming house contrary to section 229 of the Criminal Code, and his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Masten dissenting in the following words:\u2014\nMy opinion in this case rests on the simple ground that there is no evidence that this game has ever been played as a game of chance. The accused is presumed innocent until proved guilty. So far as appeared on the presentation of this case to this Court the evidence is, that the device can be used and a successful result obtained with certainty as a result of research and skill, but no evidence is afforded that it was ever operated by any person as a game of chance.\nFor that reason I am of opinion that the prosecution fails. I think the appeal should be allowed and the conviction quashed.\nBy section 226 of the Code, a common gaming house is defined as\n(a) a house, room or place kept by any person for gain, to which persons resort for the purpose of playing at any game of chance, or at any mixed game of chance and skill.\nSection 985 provides as follows:\u2014\nWhen any cards, dice, balls, counters, tables or other instruments of gaming used in playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill are found in any house, room or place suspected to be used as a common gaming house, and entered under a warrant or order issued under this Act, or about the person of any of those who are found therein, it shall be prima facie evidence, on the trial of a prosecution under section two hundred and twenty-eight or section two hundred and twenty-nine, that such house, room or place is used as a common gaming house, and that the persons found in the room or place where such instruments of gaming are found were playing therein, although no play was actually going on in the presence of the officer entering the same under such warrant or order, or in the presence of the persons by whom he is accompanied.\nSubsection 2 of section 986 is important but in order to understand the reference therein of the words \u201cany house, room or place,\u201d it is necessary to quote also what is really subsection 1 although not so numbered. These two subsections are as follows:\u2014\nIn any prosecution under section two hundred and twenty-eight or under section two hundred and twenty-nine it shall be prima facie evidence that a house, room or place is a disorderly house if any constable or officer authorized to enter any house, room or place is wilfully prevented from or obstructed or delayed in entering the same, or any part thereof.\n2. If any house, room or place is found fitted or provided with any means or contrivance for playing any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill, gaming or betting, or with any device for concealing, removing or destroying such means or contrivance, it shall be prima facie evidence that such house, room or place is a common gaming house or common betting house as the means or contrivance may indicate.\nIn this case a search warrant was obtained under section 641 of the Code and in pursuance thereof a constable seized in the drug store occupied by the accused what is described as a skill puzzle board. A list of the prizes that might be won is given in large type on a piece of cardboard attached at the top of the board itself, and on the latter appears the following:\u2014\nRead explanation on other side before punching.\nWINNING LETTERS\nThe letter \u201cJ\u201d wins a \u201cMiracle Dry Shaver.\u201d\nThe letters W, Z and F win a Genuine Ronson Lighter.\nThe following letters: QKMV win a Package (5\u2019s) of Eastman Thin Blades.\nLast punch on board receives a \u201cMiracle Dry Shaver.\u201d\nThe words \u201cRead explanation on other side before punching\u201d are in smaller type than any of the other printing. It is true that immediately above what has been extracted the same words appear in heavy blue type on the representation of the face of the board appearing in the case submitted to us, but an examination of the board itself, filed as an exhibit, shows that the list of prizes on the cardboard sheet is attached so as to cover this heavy blue type. This is really of no importance in the view I take of the matter but I think should be mentioned.\nFrom a perusal of the explanation referred to, it appears that the operator of the board would first be required to know the answer to one of the questions contained in six columns. The answer consists of either a seven or nine letter word, according to the column in which the question appears. Below the lists of questions numbered from 1 to 12 is a series of holes similarly numbered and the object of the operator would be to punch, with the instrument attached to the board by a string, the particular hole which contains a strip of paper upon which is printed one of the letters of the alphabet described as \u201cWinning Letters.\u201d It is stated that the answer to each question is the only correct, complete and precise answer to the correspondingly numbered and situated question in the question portion of the board. I do not attach any importance to the fact that the questions are printed on either a yellow or red background and are somewhat difficult to read, but it is apparent, upon reading the questions, that very few persons who had not previously examined them and undertaken to search for the answers in books of reference, etc., would know the correct response except perhaps in an isolated instance. Taking three questions at random as examples, we find the following:\u2014\n7. Column 1. Wife of King Valentinian in Fletcher\u2019s tragedy of 1612.\n8. Column 5. Speaker of the House of Commons who promoted death of Mary, Queen of Scots. 11. Column 5. Professor of comparative philology, 1868-1875, at Oxford (Full name).\nAs applicable to this appeal, the effect of section 985 and subsection 2 of 986 was to render it unnecessary for the prosecution to adduce evidence that persons had resorted to the appellant\u2019s drug store for the purpose of using the board. The contention of the appellant is that, there being only one correct answer to each question, there is no gaming or no chance connected with the operation of the board. I think, however, we must apply our knowledge of the usual everyday custom of mankind and hold that the ordinary person entering the drug store would pay ten cents for the chance of winning a prize, without critically examining the questions and returning later with the correct answers to one or more of them. It is quite apparent that it was never intended that the board would be so used but, on the contrary, it was expected that some members of the public entering the drug store would be inveigled to pay ten cents for the opportunity of punching a hole, and the chance of winning a prize. This consideration is sufficient, in my opinion, to demonstrate that the board is a means or contrivance for playing a game of chance or, at any rate, a mixed game of chance and skill.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.M. Singer.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.O. Klein.\n[1] [1938] Ont. W.N. 81; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 762.\n"}

In the early part of June, the respondent noticed while driving that the small side windows in the back of the car permitted rain to leak through into the car. The respondent advised at once the appellant of that defect and the latter undertook to put the car into good order immediately. From June to October, 1934, frequent interviews occurred and correspondence was exchanged between the parties, in consequence of which the car was, on several occasions, handed over to the appellant who attempted to remedy the condition by sealing those windows with a rubber compound, but with no satisfactory result. On the 10th of October, 1934, the respondent tendered the car back to the appellant and on the 15th of October brought the present action asking for the annulment of the contract and for the reimbursement of the purchase price. The contract between the appellant and the respondent contained the following clause: \u201cthe motor vehicle * * * is purchased * * * subject to the clause of the manufacturer\u2019s warranty endorsed in this contract * * * and this is the sole warranty, expressed or implied * * *\u201d; and the manufacturer\u2019s guarantee was in these words: \u201cThe manufacturer warrants each new motor vehicle manufactured by it, to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service, its obligation under the warranty being limited to making good * * * any part or parts thereof * * * which have been defective; this warranty being expressly in lieu of all other warranties expressed or implied and of all other obligations or liabilities on its part * * *\u201d\nHeld, Davis J. dissenting, that the respondent\u2019s action, asking for the annullment of the contract and the reimbursement of the purchase price, was well founded. Per The Chief Justice.\u2014In view of the special \u201ccircumstances and facts of this case, and especially of the correspondence (recited in the judgment) exchanged between the parties, the defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court should be dismissed.\u2014As to the appellant\u2019s claim made in his plea for compensation in respect of deterioration or in respect of the use of the automobile for a certain period, such claim should not be allowed in view of the above circumstances, and more particularly of those contained in the consid\u00e9rant (recited in the judgment) forming part of the decision of the appellate court, which disallowed such claim.\nPer Cannon and Kerwin JJ.\u2014The respondent was entitled to claim the cancellation of the sale and the reimbursement of the purchase price, as the appellant had failed to perform his own obligation to repair the defect found in the car sold. In a bilateral contract, each party must fulfill his own obligation in order to be able to demand the integral execution of the contract by the other party (art. 1065 C.C.).\nPer Cannon and Kerwin JJ.\u2014The appellant must be presumed to have known the latent defect of the thing sold and is therefore guilty of fault from the date of the delivery of the car. It is during the time that the appellant has tried to put the car in good order that it has been used by the respondent and the appellant must suffer any loss that may have resulted from such use.\nPer Davis J. dissenting.\u2014The special warranty as stipulated in the contract was valid by force of article 1507 C.C. and it excludes the application of article 1526 C.C. which gives the buyer the option of returning the thing and recovering the price of it.\u2014Moreover, upon the facts in this case, the respondent was not entitled to cancellation or rescission of the contract, not only because the defect in the two small rear windows is not in itself sufficient to invalidate the entire contract, but because the parties cannot now be put back into the same position in which they were before the contract was entered into. Restitutio in integrum can only be had where the party seeking it is able to put those against whom it is asked in the same situation in which they stood before the contract was entered into. The new motor car had been used by the purchaser (respondent) from June to September inclusive and had travelled over 7,300 miles. It was not in October the same car that had been delivered. But the appellant, in view of the concurrent findings of fact by the trial and appellate courts as to the defect complained of by the respondent, became liable to the respondent for damages, as there was a breach of the warranty to make good the defective parts of the car; and the respondent\u2019s right to make any claim for such damages should be reserved.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, MacKinnon J. and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action asking for the annulment of a contract of sale of a motor car and for the reimbursement of its purchase price.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. A. Campbell K.C. and G. C. P. Couture K.C. for the appellant.\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. and Andr\u00e9 Demers for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The facts, in so far as they are pertinent to the issues before the Quebec courts, are hardly, if at all, in dispute. The respondent purchased an automobile from the appellant which was delivered on the 30th of May, 1934. The car was found to have a serious defect. In the early part of June the respondent noticed while driving in the rain that water was penetrating through the rear window. At first he thought that the leak was due to the fact that he had failed to close the window properly but shortly afterwards he found this was not the case and that the invasion of rain water was such as to make it impossible to use the rear seat.\nAbout the 18th of June, he advised the appellant who expressed his surprise and assured him the car would be put into good order immediately. Accordingly, the respondent handed the car over to the appellant and work of a temporary nature was done to stop the leak. This work consisted of applying what the appellant calls a sealing compound and the car was then returned to the respondent.\nOn the 25th of June the respondent addressed this letter to the appellant:\nVeuillez prendre avis que le char ci-dessus que j\u2019ai retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 votre \u00e9tablissement la semaine derni\u00e8re \u00e0 cause du fait que la pluie s\u2019introduisait \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur par les vitres arri\u00e8re des c\u00f4t\u00e9s n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 efficacement r\u00e9par\u00e9.\nJe vous donne donc avis de voir \u00e0 mettre ce char en parfait ordre.

On the 26th of June the appellant replied:\nEn r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 votre lettre du 25 courant, en rapport des d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s sur votre char, nous avons communiqu\u00e9 avec Just Motors qui nous a r\u00e9pondu que l\u2019ouvrage a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait temporairement en attendant d\u2019avoir le mat\u00e9riel n\u00e9cessaire pour faire l\u2019ouvrage tel qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre fait. Nous avons pris appointement pour que votre char soit r\u00e9par\u00e9 jeudi le 28 courant. Nous vous demandons de bien vouloir le conduire \u00e0 Just Motors no. 3421 Park Avenue aussi \u00e0 bonne heure que possible.\nNous sommes convaincus \u00e0 l\u2019avance qu\u2019ils feront ces r\u00e9parations \u00e0 votre enti\u00e8re satisfaction.\nOn the 28th of June the sealing compound was again applied and on the 11th of July the respondent addressed this letter to the appellant:\nSuivant vos instructions \u00e9crites du 26 juin courant, j\u2019ai conduit le char ci-dessus \u00e0 la Cie Just Motors le 28 et il ne m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis que dimanche le 1er juillet.\nQuoique votre lettre mentionnait qu\u2019en rapport avec les d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans ma communication du 25 juin, que l\u2019ouvrage de r\u00e9paration fait temporairement auparavant, serait compl\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 mon enti\u00e8re satisfaction cette fois; je dois vous dire que tel n\u2019est pas le cas et que la r\u00e9paration faite aux fen\u00eatres des arri\u00e8re c\u00f4t\u00e9s est absolument inacceptable.\nQuant au si\u00e8ge d\u2019en arri\u00e8re, les ressorts sont rouill\u00e9s par l\u2019eau qui s\u2019est introduite par les fen\u00eatres mentionn\u00e9es plus haut et je r\u00e9clame que ce si\u00e8ge soit remplac\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement.\nIl est probable que les ressorts du dos et des c\u00f4t\u00e9s de ce si\u00e8ge sont \u00e9galement rouill\u00e9s, et je demande aussi satisfaction pour ces items.\nJe vous donne avis de mettre ce char en parfait ordre dans le plus court d\u00e9lai possible, sans quoi je devrai r\u00e9f\u00e9rer cette affaire \u00e0 mes aviseurs l\u00e9gaux.\nOn the 8th of August, as the car was still leaking, the respondent again delivered it to the appellant and the two rear windows and the cushions in the rear seat were replaced. On the 13th of August further repairs were made. These having proved inefficacious, the respondent, on the 29th of August, again wrote to the appellant, by his solicitors, in these words:\nNous sommes autoris\u00e9s par notre client M. Th\u00e9odore Pizzagalli, qui a achet\u00e9 de vous, le ler mars 1933, un automobile Imperial Air Flow Chrysler, huit cylindres, pour lequel il a pay\u00e9 $2,595, d\u2019avoir \u00e0 vous aviser qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas du tout satisfaction de cet automobile parce qu\u2019\u00e0 chaque orage l\u2019eau p\u00e9n\u00e8tre et aussi parce que le syst\u00e8me de freins ne fonctionne pas bien.\nComme vous le savez, cet automobile vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 deux ou trois reprises afin de r\u00e9parer ces d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s et, malgr\u00e9 cela, aucun bon r\u00e9sultat n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu. Pour ces raisons nous sommes autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 vous demander imm\u00e9diatement le remboursement de la dite somme de $2,595 ou la remise \u00e0 notre client d\u2019un nouvel automobile en bon \u00e9tat.\nPrenez avis que si cette somme n\u2019est pas rembours\u00e9e \u00e0 notre client ou si un nouvel automobile en parfait ordre ne lui est pas remis d\u2019ici \u00e0 quatre jours, des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires seront prises contre vous, sans aucun autre avis. In the middle of September, one Drennan, inspector for the Chrysler Corporation of Canada, saw the car and requested the respondent to leave it once more with the appellant for repair. At first, the respondent refused, but some days later he did as requested and again about the 19th or 20th of September, two new sets of rear windows were installed. Still the leakage continued and still again one of the windows was replaced. The respondent himself says that, on the occasion of the first rain after this, the leakage proved to be more copious than before.\nAgain, on the 2nd of October there were further repairs, which consisted in putting a string around the pivot and applying once more the sealing compound. On that day, the car having been returned to him, the respondent on discovering after examination the nature of the repairs, refused to accept it; and finally, on the 4th of October, the respondent wrote to the appellant requesting repayment of the purchase price, and on the 10th of October went to the appellant\u2019s place of business, tendered the car and again requested payment. On the 15th of October the action was instituted.\nThe learned trial judge finds that the defect of which the respondent complained was a latent defect (within the meaning of Art. 1522 C.C. et seq.) and rendered the car unfit for the use for which, as the appellant knew, it was intended; and in this finding the Court of King\u2019s Bench concurs. The contract between the appellant and the respondent contains this clause:\nIl est convenu que l\u2019automobile sus-d\u00e9crite est achet\u00e9e par moi comme sujette aux pr\u00e9visions de la garantie du fabricant qui est imprim\u00e9e au verso de ce contrat et qui fait partie de cette commande, et que c\u2019est la seule garantie explicite ou implicite en rapport avec la dite automobile.\nThe manufacturer\u2019s guarantee to which reference is here made, in so far as material, is in these words:\nCeci est \u00e0 l\u2019effet de certifier que * * *\ngarantissons chacune de nos machines de plaisir ou de commerce contre tout d\u00e9faut de mat\u00e9riel ou de main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, apparaissant sous les conditions d\u2019un usage normal dans lesdites machines.\nNotre responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente garantie se bornant \u00e0 remplacer de chaque machine \u00e0 notre manufacture, toute pi\u00e8ce qui, nous \u00e9tant envoy\u00e9e franc de port, dans la p\u00e9riode de 90 jours apr\u00e8s livraison au premier acqu\u00e9reur, aura, apr\u00e8s examen par nous, \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e d\u00e9fectueuse. Cette garantie devant tenir lieu de toute autre garantie expresse ou tacite, de toute autre obligation et responsabilit\u00e9, et nous n\u2019assumons et n\u2019autorisons personne \u00e0 assumer pour nous aucune responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de la vente de nos machines.\n* * * Nous ne garantissons pas les pneus, jantes, l\u2019allumage, cornes ou autres signaux, le d\u00e9marreur automatique, le g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur, les batteries ou autres accessoires ordinairement garantis par les manufacturiers respectifs de ces effets.\nThe learned trial judge took the view that the respondent\u2019s remedies for a latent defect are limited to that defined by the express terms of this guarantee and that, consequently, his sole right in the circumstances is to have repairs effected as therein agreed. The Court of King\u2019s Bench has rejected this view and held that he is entitled to annul the contract on the grounds, inter alia, stated in the following consid\u00e9rant:\nConsid\u00e9rant que de fait le demandeur-appelant est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre que le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas rem\u00e9di\u00e9 aux d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s de l\u2019automobile achet\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019apr\u00e8s des tentatives r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, ce dernier ne lui offrait encore comme r\u00e9paration que l\u2019emploi qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait d\u2019un mastic ou \u201csealing compound\u201d lequel, au d\u00e9but, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 r\u00e9paration purement provisoire par le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, et qui d\u2019ailleurs n\u2019\u00e9tait ni satisfaisant ni acceptable, ces pr\u00e9tendues r\u00e9parations comportant, en outre et sous ce mastic, une petite corde enroul\u00e9e au pivot des fen\u00eatres et qui ne devait tenir l\u00e0 que six, huit ou tout au plus douze mois, d\u2019apr\u00e8s un t\u00e9moin du d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9.\nBy article 1507 C.C.:\nLegal warranty is implied by law in the contract of sale, without stipulation. Nevertheless the parties may, by special agreement, add to the obligations of legal warranty, or diminish its effects, or exclude it altogether.\nThe special warranty with which we are concerned on this appeal belongs to a class of stipulation commonly found in agreements between sellers and purchasers of automobiles. The validity of such stipulations has been considered by the tribunals in France and, speaking generally, the conclusion has there been reached that they are valid in virtue of the article of the Code Napol\u00e9on which corresponds to article 1507 C.C.; subject to this reservation, that they do not operate to exonerate the seller or the constructor from the consequences of his \u201cdol\u201d or his \u201cfaute lourde\u201d (Gaz. Trib. 1929, pp. 219, 220; Lalou, La Responsabilit\u00e9, no. 209).\nGenerally speaking, where the \u201cvice\u201d of construction is to be attributed to \u201cfaute professionnelle,\u201d there is \u201cfaute lourde\u201d within the meaning of this rule. It is material to observe the terms of article 1527 C.C. They are as follows:\nIf the seller knew the defect of the thing, he is obliged not only to restore the price of it, but to pay all damages suffered by the buyer. He is obliged in like manner in all cases, in which he is legally presumed to know the defects.\nThe Civil Code of Quebec contains no provision defining the conditions under which the presumption referred to in the second sentence is constituted. The subject is discussed in 7 Mignault, at pp. 111, 112, 113. It is now settled that the seller is responsible in respect of all damages sustained by the purchaser by reason of latent defect where the seller is either a manufacturer or a person who deals in, as merchant, articles of the same kind as that which was the subject of the sale. Unless he can establish that the defect was such that it could not have been discovered by the most competent and diligent person in his position, his ignorance is no excuse, because it is conclusively presumed (in the absence of such proof) to be the result of negligence or of incompetence in the calling which he publicly practises and in respect of which he thereby professes himself to be competent. The principle is spondet peritiam artis.\nThe general principle is stated by Pothier and has been often applied by the French tribunals. For example, Sirey 1925, 1, 198. It should be observed, however, that the recourse of the purchaser in respect of damages under article 1527 C.C. is not subject to the restrictions which govern the French tribunals. The Code Napol\u00e9on contains no express provision corresponding to that embodied in the second paragraph of article 1527 C.C.\nThe Quebec judges have unanimously agreed that there was here latent defect within the meaning of the articles of the Code: therefore, it would appear that, applying the principles accepted in France by la jurisprudence, this special stipulation would afford no protection to the appellant.\nBut this conclusion may be based upon another ground. Manifestly this stipulation ought not to be read as contemplating such conduct as that described in the consid\u00e9rant quoted above. In other words, the appellant ought not to be permitted, under cover of the stipulation, to repudiate all responsibility in warranty, even the obligation to perform the stipulation itself: and I agree with the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that by reason of this repudiation the respondent is entitled, by force of article 1065 C.C., to be relieved of his agreement to substitute the obligations under this stipulation for the legal warranty which, in the absence of such an agreement, would bind the appellant. It follows that the respondent is entitled to invoke the provisions of articles 1522-1529 C.C. in which the reciprocal rights of seller and purchaser are stated in respect of warranty against latent defects.\nIn the courts below, the appellant contended that the condition of the automobile did not constitute a latent defect within the meaning of these articles, a point upon which sufficient has been said. He also contended that the action was not brought with reasonable diligence as required by article 1530 C.C. As to that, here again I agree with the unanimous opinion of the Quebec judges that, in the circumstances outlined above and summed up in the consid\u00e9rant quoted, the appelant had no ground for complaint.\nThere remains a question raised for the first time in this court. The respondent, it is argued, having used the automobile for several months during which it travelled some thousands of miles, was, when he commenced the proceedings, incapable of fulfilling the essential condition of the redhibitory action (viz., that he should be in a position to return the thing purchased), because of the deterioration in the vehicle consequent upon its use by reason of which its commercial character had been fundamentally altered.\nThere is, I think, no authority for the proposition that it is any answer to the redhibitory action under these articles to say that the thing sold has been used by the purchaser in the normal manner in which it was intended to be used and that, in consequence of such usage, it has suffered such deterioration as would normally be the result thereof. The better opinion appears to be that \u201cla r\u00e9dhibition\u201d is not \u201cune r\u00e9solution r\u00e9troactive\u201d (10 Planiol & Ripert, pp. 139 and 141).\nLa r\u00e9dhibition n\u2019an\u00e9antit pas la vente de plein droit; elle a seulement pour effet d\u2019imposer certaines obligations au vendeur et \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur; elle doit \u00eatre sans effet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des tiers (10 Planiol & Ripert, p. 138).\nThe essential obligation of the purchaser is the restoration of the thing with its legal status unimpaired. He must consequently procure the extinguishment of any droits r\u00e9els to which he may have consented since the purchase; and if he has parted with the custody of it by hire or lease, he must procure the release of such rights of detention. If the thing has perished as the result of the latent defect, the obligation becomes inoperative, the right to recover the price and damages subsists; if it perishes from some other cause, cas fortuit or the fault of the purchaser himself, he is entitled (article 1526 C.C.) to recover the price and damages subject to a deduction determined by the value of the thing at the date of the loss.\nThe purchaser is obliged to account for the fruits but, generally speaking, not for the deterioration of the thing between the sale and resiliation. The old French law is thus stated by Domat (1 Domat (Remy), liv. 1, tit. 2, sec. 11, no. 9):\nTous les changements qui arrivent \u00e0 la chose vendue apr\u00e8s la vente, et avant la r\u00e9dhibition, soit que la chose p\u00e9risse\u2019 ou se diminue, sans la faute de l\u2019acheteur et des personnes dont il doit r\u00e9pondre, regardent le vendeur qui doit la reprendre, et aussi il profite des changements qui la rendent meilleure;\nand the present law by Guillouard:\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019acheteur doit restituer au vendeur la chose, ou ce qui en reste, en supposant qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9grad\u00e9e ou amoindrie dans l\u2019intervalle de la vente \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation. (1 Guillouard, no. 461).\nDifferent considerations apply where the deterioration arises from the fault of the vendor. Thus, Troplong (Droit Civil Expliqu\u00e9, De la Vente, 2, page 37) says:\nL\u2019acheteur est tenu de toutes les d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations survenues par son fait depuis la vente (Ulp., 1.23, Dig. De cedit, edict., et 25, m\u00eame titre), et il doit offrir au vendeur de lui faire raison de la somme jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de laquelle la chose se trouve d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9e par son dol ou sa faute (L. 25, \/5, idem, Pothier, Vente, no. 222.)\nAnd Duvergier (Toullier, 1, Tit. VI. De la Vente, p. 511):\nL\u2019acheteur est oblig\u00e9 de tenir compte des d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations qui sont survenues par sa faute et de rendre tous les accessoires qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9s avec la chose, ou dont elle s\u2019est augment\u00e9e. (Voy. Pothier, nos. 220 et 222.)\nPothier (Vol. 3, Ed. Bugnet, Vente, pp. 90, 91) says:\n* * * lorsque par sa faute il a d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9 la chose, il n\u2019est pas pour cela exclu de l\u2019action r\u00e9dhibitoire; mais il est seulement tenu de faire raison au vendeur \u00e0 qui il la rend, de ce dont elle se trouve d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9e par sa faute. L. 24, ff. eod. tit.\nCes d\u00e9cisions sont toutes conformes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9; car il suffit que le vendeur soit indemnis\u00e9 de la faute que l\u2019acheteur a commise par rapport \u00e0 la chose vendue: il ne doit pas en profiter et s\u2019en enrichir, comme cela arriverait s\u2019il \u00e9tait par l\u00e0 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de l\u2019action r\u00e9dhibitoire dont il est tenu.\nThe law is summed up in Fuzier-Herman (R\u00e9pertoire du droit fran\u00e7ais, vol. 36, p. 897) thus:\n1728. L\u2019acheteur doit, en outre, restituer tous: les accessoires qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9s avec la chose, ou dont elle s\u2019est augment\u00e9e, ainsi que tenir compte des d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations qui sont survenues par sa faute. Pothier n. 220 et 222; Duvergier, t. 1, no. 410; Gouillard, t. 1, no. 460 et 461; Baudry-Lacantinerie et L. Saignat, n. 435. And in Dalloz (R\u00e9pertoire pratique, Vol. XII, p. 796):\n166. L\u2019acheteur, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, doit rendre au vendeur la chose vendue ou, au moins, ce qui en reste, en supposant que cette chose ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e ou amoindrie dans l\u2019intervalle de la vente \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation.\n167. L\u2019acheteur doit rendre \u00e9galement, avec la chose, son augment, par exemple, le port de l\u2019animal achet\u00e9. Toutefois, cela n\u2019est vrai que des accroissements naturels, qui auraient pu se produire chez le vendeur comme chez l\u2019acheteur (Troplong, t. 2, no. 571; Duvergier, t. 1, no. 410; Guillard, t. 1. no. 461); Baudry-Lacantinerie et Saignat, no. 435).\n168. L\u2019acheteur doit aussi, lorsqu\u2019il re\u00e7oit les int\u00e9r\u00eats de son prix, rendre les fruits per\u00e7us, les loyers que la chose a produits. Si la chose n\u2019est pas productive de fruits, mais que l\u2019acheteur s\u2019en soit servi suivant ses besoins, il doit un loyer, qui variera suivant les circonstances. S\u2019il s\u2019agit, par exemple, d\u2019une machine s\u2019usant promptement, le vendeur aura droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 proportionn\u00e9e au temps pendant lequel l\u2019acheteur aura profit\u00e9 de cette machine (Lev\u00e9, no. 344).\nIn the courts of Quebec, deterioration was not relied upon as an answer to the action; nor was any claim made for compensation in respect of deterioration or in respect of the use of the automobile. It is true that in the pleadings the fact that the respondent had used the automobile to the extent of seven thousand miles of travel is stated; but, reading the pleading as a whole, it seems that this is set up as constituting an acceptance of the car by the respondent; and to that I shall return. Any such defence or claim ought to have been set up at the trial where the facts could have been investigated in their bearing upon it; and it is indisputable that no such claim or defence was advanced before the learned trial Judge or in the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nArticle 1530 C.C. requires that the redhibitory action must be brought with reasonable diligence and the practice of the courts in the application of this rule throws some light upon the question of the legal effect of use by the purchaser. Laurent (t. 24, no. 302) cites a case of a redhibitory action in 1865 concerning a house in Paris sold in 1839. The house had been let by the purchaser and occupied by the lessees during this period when, in course of executing repairs, the purchaser discovered that the beams of the substructure had been in a state of decay. The sale was set aside and the tenants recovered damages from the vendor. (See also Dalloz, 1853, 1, 322).\nAfter the discovery of the defect, no doubt, different considerations apply. In the first place, as already mentioned, the action must, by the terms of article 1530 C.C., be brought with reasonable diligence and, in practice, the point of departure is recognized by the tribunals as the date of the discovery of the defect by the purchaser; and reasonable diligence is a question of fact (Planiol & Ripert, no. 136, p. 143; Laurent, loc. cit.)\nThen, after the discovery of the defect, the conduct of the purchaser may be such as to evidence conclusively the acceptance of the thing purchased in such a manner as to amount to a renunciation of his redhibitory right. This is a question of fact. It would appear that this defence, although open on the pleadings, was not raised in this form in the court below; in fact, it is quite clear from the judgment of the learned trial judge that it was not raised. The appellant\u2019s contention was that the action was not brought with due diligence. I agree with the unanimous conclusion of the judges in Quebec that, in view of the special circumstances as explained above, and particularly in the consid\u00e9rant quoted from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, that this last mentioned defence was not well founded. It is also evident that the learned judges did not consider that the use of the car by the respondent in these circumstances was sufficient evidence of renunciation; and, indeed, the respondent, as we have seen, made it clear to the appellant that if the defects in the car were not remedied pursuant to the contract, he would return it and demand repayment of the price. On the facts it is not open, I think, to the appellant to resist the action on the ground that the respondent renounced his rights. The conduct of the appellant, in my opinion, is sufficient in respect of this defence to establish against him a fin de non-recevoir.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cannon and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014Le 2 mars 1934, le demandeur-intim\u00e9 s\u2019engagea par \u00e9crit \u00e0 acheter du d\u00e9fendeur-appelant une voiture automobile \u201cChrysler Imperial air flow\u201d pour laquelle, sur livraison, il a pay\u00e9 $1,400.00 en argent et $1,160.00, valeur convenue de deux automobiles usag\u00e9es, formant un total de $2,560.00. S\u2019\u00e9tant aper\u00e7u que l\u2019eau s\u2019introduisait \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de sa machine par les deux fen\u00eatres d\u2019arri\u00e8re des c\u00f4t\u00e9s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avisa de suite l\u2019appelant de cette defectuosit\u00e9 dans la construction de l\u2019automobile; et ce dernier s\u2019engagea \u00e0 la faire dispara\u00eetre. Depuis juin jusqu\u2019\u00e0 octobre 1934, la machine, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, fut remise \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour trouver rem\u00e8de \u00e0 ce d\u00e9faut, mais sans succ\u00e8s. Le 10 octobre 1934, l\u2019intim\u00e9 remit \u00e0 l\u2019appelant l\u2019automobile et r\u00e9clama le remboursement du prix pay\u00e9, parce que l\u2019automobile \u00e9tait mal construit et que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais pu remplacer ou r\u00e9parer convenablement les d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s.\nL\u2019appelant, sur la question de fait, \u00e9tait devant nous dans une situation difficile, car le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, apr\u00e8s avoir admis les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de la demande, a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019action sur une seule question de droit que nous discuterons plus loin; et la Cour du Banc du Roi, \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, a dit que cette automobile \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueuse, impropre \u00e0 l\u2019usage auquel elle \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e et n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en bon ordre par l\u2019appelant. Les procureurs de ce dernier devant nous, fort habilement, ont fait valoir les raisons qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s eux, militent contre ces conclusions du jugement a quo; mais un examen attentif du dossier ne nous fait pas d\u00e9couvrir d\u2019erreur sur ce point. Il suffit des dires des t\u00e9moins de la d\u00e9fense Drennan et Godin pour s\u2019en convaincre. Drennan, vers le 19 ou le 20 septembre, pr\u00e9tend avoir remplac\u00e9 les deux ch\u00e2ssis et que, en les \u00e9prouvant avec un jet d\u2019eau, il ne se manifesta aucun signe de coulage. Il admet, de plus, que le \u201ccompound\u201d ou compos\u00e9 dont le demandeur se plaignait ant\u00e9rieurrement est employ\u00e9 \u201cto make up any deficiency * * * that might conduce leakage.\u201d Il appert clairement \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage que l\u2019on ne se sert du \u201ccompound\u201d qu\u2019au cas seulement o\u00f9 la fermeture n\u2019est pas \u00e9tanche et que l\u2019on ne se sert jamais de ficelle pour assurer l\u2019\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9 de la fen\u00eatre. Bien que Drennan ait pr\u00e9tendu que les fen\u00eatres ne faisaient pas eau apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9paration de septembre, nous voyons par le t\u00e9moignage de Paul Godin que, le ler octobre, le demandeur se plaignit de nouveau que ces fen\u00eatres \u00e9taient d\u00e9fectueuses; et il admet que quelques gouttes d\u2019eau p\u00e9n\u00e9traient \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur. Il rempla\u00e7a la fen\u00eatre et l\u2019\u00e9prouva de nouveau \u00e0 forte pression d\u2019eau en pr\u00e9sence du d\u00e9fendeur. Il vit alors quelques gouttes d\u2019eau s\u2019introduire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur pr\u00e8s du pivot et il crut n\u00e9cessaire de se servir du \u201csealing compound.\u201d Or, il ajouta de plus une ficelle enroul\u00e9e autour du pivot, qu\u2019il dissimula le mieux qu\u2019il put en l\u2019imbibant ou la recouvrant de ce compos\u00e9 ressemblant au mastic; ce qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lui, devait durer six ou huit mois, ou peut-\u00eatre un an. C\u2019est alors que l\u2019intim\u00e9, voyant que l\u2019on avait encore utilis\u00e9 cet exp\u00e9dient qu\u2019on lui avait d\u2019abord d\u00e9crit comme une r\u00e9paration temporaire, refusa de continuer \u00e0 se servir du char dans ces conditions et la remit \u00e0 son vendeur et r\u00e9clama \u00e0 ce dernier, par une action r\u00e9solutoire, l\u2019annulation de la vente et le remboursement du prix avec int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis la date de son action.\nLe contrat de vente contenait la stipulation suivante:\nIl est convenu que l\u2019automobile sus-d\u00e9crite est achet\u00e9e par moi comme sujette aux pr\u00e9visions de la garantie du fabricant qui est imprim\u00e9e au verso de ce contrat et qui fait partie de cette commande, et que c\u2019est la seule garantie explicite ou implicite en rapport avec ladite automobile.\nCette garantie du fabricant, pour ce qui nous int\u00e9resse, se lit comme suit:\nCeci est \u00e0 l\u2019effet de certifier que * * *\ngarantissons chacune de nos machines de plaisir ou de commerce contre tout d\u00e9faut de mat\u00e9riel ou de main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, apparaissant sous les conditions d\u2019un usage normal dans les dites machines.\nNotre responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente garantie se bornant \u00e0 remplacer de chaque machine \u00e0 notre manufacture, boute pi\u00e8ce qui, nous \u00e9tant envoy\u00e9e franc de port, dans la p\u00e9riode de 90 jours apr\u00e8s livraison au premier acqu\u00e9reur, aura, apr\u00e8s examen par nous \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e d\u00e9fectueuse. Cette garantie devant tenir lieu de toute autre garantie expresse ou tacite, de toute autre obligation et responsabilit\u00e9, et nous n\u2019assumons et n\u2019autorisons personne \u00e0 assumer pour nous aucune responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de la vente de nos machines.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a trouv\u00e9 que le demandeur avait raison de se plaindre d\u2019un d\u00e9faut qui ne pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9couvert que par l\u2019usage du char, qu\u2019il a agi avec toute la diligence voulue et que, pendant les changements ou r\u00e9parations, il se servit du char \u00e0 la demande et avec le consentement du vendeur; que la pluie p\u00e9n\u00e9trait dans le char pendant toute cette p\u00e9riode et que l\u2019intim\u00e9, ayant achet\u00e9 un char dispendieux pour les besoins de ses affaires pour transporter ses clients \u00e0 divers endroits pour leur d\u00e9montrer la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019ouvrage qu\u2019il faisait comme marbrier, avait le droit d\u2019exiger une machine parfaitement \u00e9tanche. Mais le premier juge arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que la seule obligation du vendeur \u00e9tait de remplacer les parties d\u00e9fectueuses; et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de fabriquer des fen\u00eatres de ce genre parfaitement \u00e9tanches et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence le seul recours du demandeur-intim\u00e9, vu les termes particuliers de la seule et unique garantie, \u00e9tait de ramener le char, en octobre, pour obtenir de nouveaux ch\u00e2ssis; la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure refusa d\u2019annuler la vente et d\u2019ordonner le remboursement du prix.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi unanimement, le 29 d\u00e9cembre 1936, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 non-fond\u00e9e cette conclusion quant \u00e0 la garantie, pour les consid\u00e9rants suivants:\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il r\u00e9sulte de la preuve que, bien que mis en demeure \u00e0 ce sujet, le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas dans le d\u00e9lai qui lui \u00e9tait imparti satisfait aux obligations de cette garantie particuli\u00e8re qu\u2019il invoque comme exclusive de toute autre garantie;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu\u2019au point de vue de cette garantie particuli\u00e8re, comme \u00e0 celui de ses obligations de vendeur, le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 a fait d\u00e9faut d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter le contrat et de fournir \u00e0 son acheteur la chose vendue, \u00e0 savoir une automobile propre \u00e0 l\u2019usage qu\u2019en voulait faire celui-ci, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019entente;\nConsid\u00e9rant que dans ces circonstances le demandeur-appelant a droit \u00e0 la sanction que donne la loi pour le cas d\u2019inex\u00e9cution, soit \u00e0 un recours en annulation;\nConsid\u00e9rant que de fait le demandeur-appelant est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre que le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas rem\u00e9di\u00e9 aux d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s de l\u2019automobile achet\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019apr\u00e8s des tentatives r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, ce dernier ne lui offrait encore comme r\u00e9paration que l\u2019emploi qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait d\u2019un mastic ou \u201csealing compound\u201d lequel, au d\u00e9but, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 r\u00e9paration purement provisoire par le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame, et qui d\u2019ailleurs n\u2019\u00e9tait ni satisfaisant ni acceptable, ces pr\u00e9tendues r\u00e9parations comportant, en outre et sous ce mastic, une petite corde enroul\u00e9e au pivot des fen\u00eatres et qui ne devait tenir l\u00e0 que six, huit, ou tout au plus douze mois, d\u2019apr\u00e8s un t\u00e9moin du d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9;\nL\u2019action fut maintenue, le contrat annul\u00e9 et le d\u00e9fen-deur-appelant condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la somme de $2,595.00, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de la date de l\u2019assignation, et les d\u00e9pens.\nL\u2019appelant se plaint que le montant du jugement devrait \u00eatre $2,560.00, \u00e9tant le total pay\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux termes du contrat. Il a raison sur ce point et $35.00 doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9duits du montant accord\u00e9 en appel.\nL\u2019honorable juge Dorion explique clairement pourquoi la Cour du Banc du Roi n\u2019a pas tenu compte de la clause excluant toute garantie expresse ou tacite, \u00e0 part celle de remplacer les pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9fectueuses:\nLes termes de cette clause, en effet, obligent l\u2019acheteur \u00e0 exercer le recours pr\u00e9vu par le contrat, et nul autre. Mais, dans ce contrat, comme dans tout contrat, les obligations de l\u2019une des parties sont la condition des obligations de l\u2019autre partie. Ici, l\u2019acheteur renonce \u00e0 l\u2019action r\u00e9dhibitoire sous la condition tacite que le vendeur remplira une obligation de r\u00e9parer l\u2019automobile. Ce dernier ne peut pas \u00e9chapper \u00e0 toute responsabilit\u00e9 par le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas rempli son obligation.\nLe savant juge conclut que l\u2019appelant, en pr\u00e9tendant que le d\u00e9faut a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9 avant l\u2019action, comme il l\u2019a fait devant nous, refuse, en fait, de faire les r\u00e9parations, ne laissant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 que le recours de l\u2019action r\u00e9dhibitoire; le vendeur, en effet, n\u2019a pas rempli la condition \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9tait soumise la renonciation de l\u2019acheteur \u00e0 cette action, i.e., la condition que le vendeur remplirait son obligation de r\u00e9parer ou remplacer toute pi\u00e8ce d\u00e9fectueuse.\nNous croyons que cette raison dispose du premier grief d\u2019appel, savoir que la Cour du Banc du Roi aurait refus\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer, suivant ses termes, la garantie du contrat. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 1065 du Code civil, dans un contrat bilat\u00e9ral, chaque partie doit remplir sa propre obligation pour pouvoir exiger de l\u2019autre l\u2019ex\u00e9cution int\u00e9grale du contrat. Ceci se trouve en toutes lettres dans l\u2019article 1184 du Code Napol\u00e9on:\nLa condition r\u00e9solutoire est toujours sous-entendue dans les contrats synallagmatiques, pour le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019une des deux parties ne satisfera pas \u00e0 son engagement.\nL\u2019ancien juge-en-chef de la Cour du Banc du Roi, Sir Henri Taschereau, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait juge \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, nous dit (Valiquette v. Archambault[1]) que, bien que cet article du Code Napol\u00e9on n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduit en termes expr\u00e8s dans notre Code civil,\nnos codificateurs ont pourvu au m\u00eame cas et exprim\u00e9 le m\u00eame principe dans l\u2019article 1065 de notre code qui permet, m\u00eame en l\u2019absence d\u2019une condition r\u00e9solutoire expresse, de demander la r\u00e9solution du contrat d\u2019o\u00f9 na\u00eet l\u2019obligation qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplie (Voir Rapport des Codificateurs, 7 DeLorimier, Biblioth\u00e8que du Code civil, pp. 626-627).\nLe second grief d\u2019appel est que nonobstant les termes de la garantie, la Cour du Banc du Roi a rendu l\u2019appelant responsable, comme le fabricant qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019appelant, serait le seul garant de l\u2019acheteur. Il appert aux termes du contrat que le vendeur a fait sienne cette garantie du fabricant de remplacer les pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9fectueuses.\nComme troisi\u00e8me grief, on dit que le contrat ne stipulait aucun d\u00e9lai pendant lequel le fabricant devait faire les r\u00e9parations. Ce point a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9. Le plaidoyer et certains t\u00e9moins de l\u2019appelant ont pr\u00e9tendu que les r\u00e9parations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9es et qu\u2019il ne pouvait rien faire de plus pour se conformer au contrat. L\u2019on n\u2019a jamais remplac\u00e9 le ch\u00e2ssis par une pi\u00e8ce parfaitement \u00e9tanche et qui n\u2019aurait pas n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 l\u2019application du \u201ccompound\u201d. Il serait exorbitant de dire que l\u2019intim\u00e9 devait garder le char et, pour un temps ind\u00e9fini, attendre qu\u2019on r\u00e9ussisse \u00e0 la rendre convenable.\nAutre grief de l\u2019appelant; dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la restitutio in integrum est impossible, et d\u2019abord, parce qu\u2019on ordonne le remboursement complet du prix de vente dont partie seulement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e argent comptant. Il suffit de lire le contrat pour conclure que le prix convenu est un prix en argent payable suivant un mode accept\u00e9 par les deux parties et donnant aux automobiles usag\u00e9es la valeur en argent mentionn\u00e9e au contrat. Mais, ajoute l\u2019appelant, par la r\u00e9solution du contrat l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est servi de cette automobile pendant toute une saison et aura forc\u00e9 l\u2019appelant \u00e0 acheter de lui deux chars usag\u00e9s. Cet usage, croyons-nous, \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour constater si le vendeur avait rempli son obligation de r\u00e9parer; et ce dernier ne s\u2019en est jamais plaint. Nous constatons, par ailleurs, que si, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019acheteur a eu l\u2019usage de l\u2019automobile, de l\u2019autre, le vendeur a eu l\u2019usage du prix en argent depuis la date de la vente jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de l\u2019action. Or, on ne lui r\u00e9clame pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat pour cette p\u00e9riode, lui laissant ainsi, en compensation de l\u2019usage de sa machine, le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il a pu retirer de ces argents.\nCeci est conforme \u00e0 la doctrine. Voir 3 Pothier, \u201cDe la vente\u201d, nos 217 et 219:\n217. L\u2019acheteur est en droit de demander par l\u2019action r\u00e9dhibitoire, la r\u00e9solution et nullit\u00e9 du march\u00e9, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence les choses soient remises au m\u00eame \u00e9tat que s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas intervenu: Judicium redhibitori\u0153 actionis utrumque, id est venditorem et emptorem, quodammodo in integrum restituere debere: L. 23, par. 7, FF. de AEdil. ed. Fact\u00e2 redhibitione, omnia in integrum restituuntur, perinde as si neque emptio neque venditio interesserit; L. 60, ff. cod. tit.\nEn cons\u00e9quence l\u2019acheteur a droit de demander que le vendeur soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui rendre le prix qu\u2019il lui a pay\u00e9, m\u00eame les int\u00e9r\u00eats depuis le jour du paiement qu\u2019il en a fait, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu (L. 29, par. 2, ff. eod. tit.), \u00e0 moins que le juge ne juge\u00e2t \u00e0 propos de les compenser avec les fruits que l\u2019acheteur doit rendre.\n* * *\n219. L\u2019acheteur, pour \u00eatre re\u00e7u \u00e0 cette action, doit de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 offrir de rendre la chose, si elle existe, avec les fruits, s\u2019il en a per\u00e7u quelques-uns; \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019en consente la compensation avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du prix. Il doit pareillement offrir de rendre tous les accessoires de la chose qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9s avec la chose.\nVoir aussi: 10 Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 de droit civil, no. 134 in fine, p. 142.\nL\u2019action consent \u00e0 la compensation de la jouissance de la voiture avec les int\u00e9r\u00eats du prix.\nL\u2019appelant se plaint aussi d\u2019avoir \u00e0 recevoir, au lieu de la machine neuve livr\u00e9e, une machine usag\u00e9e ayant parcouru sept mille milles, qui d\u00e9sormais doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e comme de seconde main. Est-il oblig\u00e9 de souffrir cet appauvrissement? N\u2019est-ce pas permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de s\u2019enrichir \u00e0 ses d\u00e9pens, en for\u00e7ant l\u2019appelant \u00e0 reprendre l\u2019automobile avec la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration soufferte durant une saison?\nC\u2019est, nous l\u2019avons vu, par une clause r\u00e9solutoire tacite que l\u2019annulation de la vente est accord\u00e9e dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cette r\u00e9solution, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 1088 C.C., oblige chacune des parties \u00e0 rendre ce qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u et remet les choses au m\u00eame point que si le contrat n\u2019avait pas exist\u00e9; en observant n\u00e9anmoins les r\u00e8gles de 1087 C.C. relatives aux choses qui ont p\u00e9ri ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9es; \u201csi la chose s\u2019est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e sans la faute du d\u00e9biteur, le cr\u00e9ancier doit la recevoir dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle se trouve, sans diminution de prix.\u201d\nAppliquons ce principe \u00e0 cette cause. Par la r\u00e9solution du contrat, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit rendre la machine dont, par une fiction l\u00e9gale, le vendeur est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 toujours propri\u00e9taire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 en est de d\u00e9biteur envers son vendeur, qui, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, doit remettre le prix. Peut-on dire que la machine a subi d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration par l\u2019usage? Cela n\u2019est pas prouv\u00e9; mais on peut admettre qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir fait 7,000 milles elle a perdu de sa valeur. Est-ce de la faute de l\u2019intim\u00e9? Evidemment non. L\u2019appelant-vendeur, commer\u00e7ant d\u2019automobiles est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir connu les d\u00e9fauts de la chose vendue, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence. V. 10 Planiol & Ripert, p. 141; Dalloz, 1926-I-9. V. Note de Louis Josserand. Il doit donc \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 coupable de faute d\u00e8s la livraison d\u2019une machine d\u00e9fectueuse; il a admis cette d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 en reprenant la machine pour r\u00e9paration \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et en la remettant en circulation entre les mains de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour l\u2019essayer de nouveau. C\u2019est donc en cherchant \u00e0 corriger les cons\u00e9quences de cette faute et \u00e0 faire les r\u00e9parations suivant la garantie sp\u00e9ciale du vendeur que la machine a \u00e9t\u00e9 usag\u00e9e et aurait perdu de sa valeur. L\u2019appelant doit donc souffrir cette perte, si elle existe. Elle compensera jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point les ennuis et inconv\u00e9nients caus\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 par cette machine d\u00e9fectueuse pour lesquels il aurait pu r\u00e9clamer des dommages.\nA l\u2019appui de cette solution, je citerai: 4 Mass\u00e9, Droit commercial, pp. 406 et suiv.:\n360. Il y a deux sortes de conditions r\u00e9solutoires. La condition r\u00e9solutoire proprement dite qui, comme toute autre condition consiste dans la stipulation expresse ou tacite par laquelle on fait d\u00e9pendre l\u2019obligation d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement futur et incertain qui la r\u00e9sout en se r\u00e9alisant; et la condition r\u00e9solutoire connue sous le nom de pacte commissoire, qui consiste dans la clause expresse ou tacite par laquelle les parties qui forment un contrat synallagmatique conviennent que ce contrat sera r\u00e9solu, si Tune ou l\u2019autre d\u2019entre elles ne satisfait point \u00e0 son engagement (C. civ., art. 1184). Ces conditions produisent l\u2019une et l\u2019autre des effets analogues; lorsqu\u2019il y aura des diff\u00e9rences, j\u2019aurai soin de les faire remarquer.\n361. De ce que la r\u00e9solution de l\u2019obligation remet les choses au m\u00eame \u00e9tat que si l\u2019obligation n\u2019avait pas exist\u00e9e, il r\u00e9sulte que la condition resolutoire accomplie a un effet r\u00e9troactif, non seulement au jour du contrat, mais encore \u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le contrat, puisque le contrat se trouve effac\u00e9. Les parties sont donc r\u00e9ciproquement tenues de restituer ce qu\u2019elles ont re\u00e7u, par exemple, en cas de vente, l\u2019une la chose, si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e, l\u2019autre le prix, s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9.\n365. Mais doit-il restituer les fruits qu\u2019elle a produits et qu\u2019il a per\u00e7us pendant la condition?\nLa question a \u00e9t\u00e9 diversement r\u00e9solue par les auteurs. M. Toullier (T. VI, n. 563) et M. Duvergier (De la vente, t. 1, n. 452) se prononcent pour la restitution, comme cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019effet r\u00e9troactif de la condition accomplie. Selon M. Troplong, au contraire, il faut distinguer entre l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 la r\u00e9solution est l\u2019effet du pacte commissoire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de la condition r\u00e9solutoire qui est toujours sous-entendue dans les contrats synallagmatiques pour le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019une des deux parties ne satisferait pas \u00e0 son engagement (C. civ., .1184), et l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit d\u2019une condition r\u00e9solutoire proprement dite (Voy. sup. n. 360). Dans la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8se, il d\u00e9cide que l\u2019acheteur qui, faute de payer le prix de son acquisition, voit r\u00e9soudre le contrat, doit restituer les fruits, parce que, ne remplissant pas ses obligations, il ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme possesseur de bonne foi, ni par cons\u00e9quent faire les fruits siens (C. civ., 549\u2014De la vente, t. II, n. 652); dans la seconde, au contraire, il d\u00e9cide que l\u2019acheteur fait les fruits siens par sa bonne foi jointe \u00e0 son industrie (Ibid., t. 1, n. 60). MM. Delamarre et Lepoitvin font une distinction analogue, mais moins absolue. Ils pensent, avec M. Troplong, que, dans la derni\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8se, l\u2019acheteur fait les fruits siens, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une circonstance particuli\u00e8re ne le constitue en \u00e9tat de mauvaise foi. Mais dans la premi\u00e8re, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire quand la r\u00e9solution proc\u00e8de du pacte commissoire, ils pensent que l\u2019acheteur ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en \u00e9tat de mauvaise foi, par cela seul qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 le prix; que c\u2019est d\u00e8s lors aux juges \u00e0 examiner s\u2019il est de bonne foi ou de mauvaise foi pour lui attribuer les fruits dans le premier cas, et le condamner \u00e0 les restituer dans le second. (Du contrat de commission, t. III, n. 644 et suiv.).\nJ\u2019adopte pleinement cette derni\u00e8re opinion.\nObservons d\u2019abord que l\u2019effet r\u00e9troactif de la condition accomplie n\u2019est d\u2019aucune influence sur la restitution des fruits. L\u2019effet r\u00e9troactif n\u2019a lieu qu\u2019en ce qui touche l\u2019obligation de restituer la chose avec tous ses accessoires essentiels, mais il ne peut aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 effacer des jaits accomplis et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre le droit que l\u2019acheteur a eu sur la chose dans le temps interm\u00e9diaire au contrat et \u00e0 l\u2019accomplissement de la condition (M. Toullier, t. VI, n. 548.\u2014Voy. sup. n. 458).\n* * *\n373. Quant \u00e0 la simple d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration, si elle a lieu sans la faute du d\u00e9biteur ou de l\u2019acheteur, elle est au compte du vendeur, quand la condition vient \u00e0 se r\u00e9aliser, parce que cette d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration n\u2019emp\u00eache pas l\u2019obligation de subsister de part et d\u2019autre; que l\u2019acheteur, en restituant la chose dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle se trouve, ex\u00e9cute l\u2019obligation autant qu\u2019il est en lui; et que le vendeur doit d\u00e8s-lors l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 en restituant le prix entier qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u. C\u2019est l\u00e0 d\u2019ailleurs une cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019effet r\u00e9troactif de la condition accomplie qui, en faisant remonter le droit du vendeur au jour du contrat, met \u00e0 sa charge les d\u00e9t\u00e9riorations interm\u00e9diaires (M. Toullier, t. VI, n, 563; M. Duranton, t. XI, n. 91).\n* * *\nPar analogie, bien qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agisse pas dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019un cas fortuit, nous pouvons citer la cause de Hageraats C. de Beaumont[2], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration survenue sans le fait de l\u2019acheteur \u00e0 la chose vendue sous une condition r\u00e9solutoire est \u00e0 la charge du vendeur qui ne peut se refuser \u00e0 reprendre les marchandises endommag\u00e9es et \u00e0 en restituer le prix \u201cattendu que le sens clair de cette disposition (1183 C. N. correspondant \u00e0 notre article 1088 C.C.) est que les parties, apr\u00e8s l\u2019accomplissement de la condition r\u00e9solutoire, sont remises au m\u00eame \u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient l\u2019une vis-\u00e0-vis de l\u2019autre avant la formation du contrat; d\u2019o\u00f9 il suit qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re de vente et d\u2019achat sous condition r\u00e9solutoire, si la condition s\u2019accomplit, la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la chose vendue et livr\u00e9e sans la faute de l\u2019acheteur, tombe \u00e0 la charge du vendeur, qui, par la fiction de la loi, est cens\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais ali\u00e9n\u00e9 la chose et en \u00eatre toujours demeur\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire.\u201d\nVoir aussi C. Dufnoire, Th\u00e9orie de la condition, p. 455.\nJe me r\u00e9f\u00e8re aussi \u00e0 3 Larombi\u00e8re, Des Obligations, p. 60, no. 61:\n61. A plus forte raison doit-il r\u00e9parer le dommage caus\u00e9 directement par son fait ou par sa faute. Il doit m\u00eame une indemnit\u00e9 pour la diminution de valeur produite par l\u2019usage qu\u2019il a fait de la chose, quand bien m\u00eame il n\u2019aurait fait que s\u2019en servir suivant sa destination habituelie. Telle serait l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se d\u2019une vente sous condition r\u00e9solutoire d\u2019une voiture, d\u2019une machine, d\u2019un objet mobilier quelconque qui s\u2019use et se d\u00e9t\u00e9riore par le service. Si l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur, la r\u00e9solution arriv\u00e9e, \u00e9tait quitte en rendant la chose dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle se trouve, il en retirerait un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice net, puisque sa possession lui aurait procur\u00e9, sans charges qui viennent en compensation, les avantages du service et les profits de l\u2019usage.\nMais nous devons poser plusieurs exceptions, Aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne sera due pour la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la chose par son usage naturel, si cet usage a eu lieu en vertu d\u2019une convention d\u2019essai, ou de toute autre clause sp\u00e9ciale.\nIl n\u2019y a pas de doute qu\u2019il y a eu entre les parties en cette affaire une convention d\u2019essai plusieurs fois renouvel\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019au refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de continuer ces essais ind\u00e9finiment.\nL\u2019appelant a aussi demand\u00e9 l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1530 du Code civil qui dit que L\u2019action r\u00e9dhibitoire, r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019obligation de garantie \u00e0 raison de vices cach\u00e9s, doit \u00eatre intent\u00e9e avec diligence raisonnable, suivant la nature du vice et suivant l\u2019usage du lieu ou la vente s\u2019est faite.\nSur ce point, nous croyons devoir nous r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 la cause de Bernier v. Grenier Motor Co. Ltd.[3] confirmant le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi[4], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que\nL\u2019art. 1530 C.C., applicable au cas de demande en nullit\u00e9 de vente pour vices r\u00e9dhibitoires, ne l\u2019est pas au cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit de garantie conventionnelle et formelle,\u2014et l\u2019action en r\u00e9solution peut alors \u00eatre intent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par cet article surtout lorsque le demandeur all\u00e8gue et prouve erreur, dol, fraude et fausses repr\u00e9sentations.\nOn pourrait souligner le passage suivant des notes de l\u2019honorable juge Greenshields, \u00e0 la page 495:\nAppellant desired to keep his car if it could be made perfect or as perfect as the standard of the Pierce-Arrow was considered to be, and as a matter of fact had been. For that purpose, during a period of nearly thirteen months, he returned it to respondent and repairs and changes were made. Thirty-nine parts were supplied by the manufacturer for the purpose of remedying the evils which existed. Finally, appellant, wearied of his attempt, raised the present action, tendering back the car.\nI am of opinion and hold:\nFirst: That the appellant\u2019s action was not barred or stopped by the delay, inasmuch as the delay was caused by the desire on the part of appellant to have the defects remedied and the willingness on the part of the respondent to remedy the same, if remedy was possible;\nSecondly: That the respondent never delivered to appellant and never put appellant in possession of the thing which the contract of sale or exchange called for;\nJe crois que ces remarques s\u2019appliquent parfaitement \u00e0 notre esp\u00e8ce.\nDans The Studebaker Corporation of Canada v. Glackmeyer[5], le juge Greenshields dit de nouveau:\nAs was held by this Court in the case of Grenier & Bernier[6], subsequently confirmed by the Supreme Court, where a vendor and a vendee mutually agree in an effort to repair defects, and efforts are made extending over a long time by the vendor, the vendee\u2019s rights are not thereby prejudiced, and if the efforts so made are unsuccessful, the vendee\u2019s action for relief is not thereby barred.\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019offre contenue au plaidoyer d\u2019un autre char, nous ne croyons pas que, apr\u00e8s l\u2019institution de l\u2019action, cet acte unilat\u00e9ral du vendeur p\u00fbt changer la position juridique des parties telle qu\u2019elle existait \u00e0 cette date. L\u2019intim\u00e9, par son action, avait exerc\u00e9 le choix que lui donne l\u2019article 1035 C.C.; il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation aux frais du d\u00e9biteur, mais bien la r\u00e9solution du contrat, d\u2019o\u00f9 naissait l\u2019obligation de livrer une machine convenable.\nPour toutes ces raisons, nous concluons au renvoi de l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens, mais le montant du jugement devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $2,560.00 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis la date de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action.\nDavis J. (dissenting): In this appeal we have to deal with what has become an ordinary form of commercial contract in connection with the sale of motor cars. The difficulty in the case arises in the application to the terms of the contract of the provisions of the Civil Code, the contract having been made and carried out in the province of Quebec. The decision will be of importance in that province as determining the rights and liabilities of vendors and purchasers in Quebec when a latent defect makes its appearance in a car sold under this common form of contract. I regret that I find myself unable to agree with the opinion of the other members of the Court.\nThe agreement for the purchase of the new motor car was in writing and expressly stipulated that\nIt is agreed that the motor vehicle above described is purchased by me subject to the clause of the manufacturer\u2019s warranty endorsed on this contract and which forms part of the present order and that this is the sole warranty, expressed or implied, in connection with the said motor vehicle.\nThe manufacturer\u2019s warranty endorsed on the agreement and which was made a part of the contract, reads as follows:\nThe manufacturer warrants each new motor vehicle manufactured by it to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service, its obligation under the warranty being limited to making good * * * any part or parte thereof * * * which have been * * * defective; this warranty being expressly in lieu of all other warranties expressed or implied and of all other obligations or liabilities on its part * * *\nNow the Civil Code sets up certain legal warranties implied by law in contracts of sale, without stipulation. The general provisions of warranty are contained in articles 1506 to 1531 inclusive.\nThe purchaser (respondent) relies upon article 1522, which is as follows:\n1522. The seller is obliged by law to warrant the buyer against such latent defects in the thing sold, and its accessories, as render it unfit for the use for which it was intended, or so diminish its usefulness that the buyer would not have bought it, or would not have given so large a price, if he had known them. and on article 1526, which provides that\n1526. The buyer has the option of returning the thing and recovering the price of it, or of keeping the thing and recovering a part of the price according to an estimation of its value.\nBut article 1506 provides that\n1506. The warranty to which the seller is obliged in favour of the buyer is either legal or conventional.\nAnd by article 1507 it is provided that while \u201clegal warranty is implied by law in the contract of sale, without stipulation\u201d\nNevertheless the parties may, by special agreement, add to the obligations of legal warranty, or diminish its effects, or exclude it altogether.\nIn the contract that is before us in this case the parties stipulated, by the special agreement, that the vendor (appellant) should warrant the new car to be \u201cfree from defects in material and workmanship\u201d. That warranty, stipulated by the special agreement between the parties, added to the obligations of legal warranty in that it extended to defects of all kinds in the thing sold whether those defects were latent or apparent and was not limited (as the legal warranty of article 1522 C.C. is limited) to \u201csuch latent defects\u201d as render the thing\nunfit for the use for which it was intended, or so diminish its usefulness that the buyer would not have bought it, or would not have given so large a price, if he had known them.\nBut, on the other hand, the contractual warranty diminished the effects of the obligations of legal warranty in that, by the special agreement between the parties, the obligation of the vendor under the warranty was restricted to making good any defective part or parts of the car. This warranty was expressly stated, by the terms of the agreement between the parties, \u201cto be in lieu of all other warranties, expressed or implied, and of all other obligations or liabilities\u201d on the part of the vendor.\nThe warranty of the contract was valid by force of said article 1507 C.C. and in my view it excludes the application of article 1526 C.C. (which gives the buyer the option of returning the thing and recovering the price of it) which is a remedy for a breach of the legal warranty against latent defects provided by article 1522.\nThe defect complained of by the purchaser (respondent), and the defect is really not in dispute, was that the small side windows in the back of the car permitted rain, to some extent, to leak through into the car. The rear window sections were something new at the time in motor car manufacture, the frames being made of a rubber composition and moving on a pivot through a mechanism built into the body of the car, for the purpose of better interior ventilation. The vendor (appellant) attempted on several occasions to remedy the condition by caulking or sealing these windows with a rubber compound. The purchaser (respondent) seems to have become indifferent whether these repairs kept the water out or not; he disliked the use of the rubber compound and rejected the car. I cannot bring myself on the evidence to regard the defect as anything of a serious nature but both courts below have found that the windows were in fact defective and remained defective and with that finding we cannot interfere. Counsel for the appellant argued that in any event the appellant\u2019s only responsibility under the terms of the contract was to make good the defect. But that position cannot be maintained when after three attempts over a period of some months to remedy the defect, the appellant has been found to have failed to do so.\nThat the appellant became liable to the respondent for damages cannot be disputed on the concurrent findings of fact. There was a breach of the warranty to make good the defective parts and for the breach of that obligation article 1065 C.C. makes the appellant liable in damages. But the respondent did not sue, even alternatively, for damages and no evidence as to damages was given. The respondent maintains that he was entitled as a matter of law to force the appellant to take back the new car, to keep the two old cars that he had turned in, and to pay him with interest not only the amount of the cash payment that he had made ($1,400) but also the amount of the credit allowance he had been given on the two old cars ($1,160). No evidence was given at the trial as to what had happened in the meantime to the two old cars. The courts below have given judgment against the appellant entitling the respondent to recover the amount of the entire purchase money in cash, with interest and costs.\nIf article 1526 C.C. is not available to the respondent for the reason above given, then the respondent is driven to article 1065 C.C., which not only gives the right of damages in case of the breach of any obligation but provides further that. 1065. * * * The creditor may, in cases which admit of it, demand also a specific performance of the obligation, and that he be authorized to execute it at the debtor\u2019s expense, or that the contract from which the obligation arises be set aside; subject to the special provisions contained in this code and without prejudice, in either case, to his claim for damages.\nIn my view, the facts of this case do not admit of cancellation or rescission of the contract. Not only because the defect in the two small rear windows is not in itself sufficient to invalidate the entire contract, but because the parties cannot now be put back into the same position in which they were before the contract was entered into. Restitutio in integrum can only be had where the party seeking it is able to put those against whom it is asked in the same situation in which they stood before the contract was entered into. The new motor car had been used by the purchaser (respondent) during June, July, August and September and had travelled over 7,300 miles. It was not in October the same car that had been delivered.\nThis is not a case of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the vendor of the thing sold where different considerations might prevail. Grenier Motor Co. v. Bernier,[7] was an action based upon misrepresentation. Mr. Justice Allard in that case said in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec,[8]:\nSi elle (la d\u00e9fenderesse) ne lui avait pas fait les repr\u00e9sentations qu\u2019elle lui a faites, ou cach\u00e9 un fait tr\u00e8s important, le demandeur n\u2019aurait pas achet\u00e9. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9clare sous serment.\nThe appeal should in my opinion be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout, without prejudice to any claim the respondent may be advised to make for damages.\nHudson J.:\u2014I concur in the result.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Campbell, McMaster, Couture, Kerry and Bruneau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gouin and Demers.\n[1] (1895) Q.R. 7 S.C. 51, at. 54.\n[2] (1879) S. 81-4-23\n[3] [1928] S.C.R. 86.\n[4] (1926) Q.R. 41 K.B. 488.\n[5] (1927) Q.R. 44 K.B. 216, at 227.\n[6] (1926) Q.R. 41 K.B. 488.\n[7] [1928] S.C.R. 86.\n[8] [1926] Q.R. 41 K.B. 488, at 494.\n"}

It was also irregular to permit the production before the jury of articles found in the home of the accused by the police acting under a search warrant, when these articles had no real pertinency to any issue between the Crown and the accused, and two of them specially (medical text books) were by their nature calculated to create prejudice against the accused in the eyes of the jury.

As to the first, it was not seriously disputed that it was essential for the Crown to establish that the uterus itself of the deceased Helen McDowell was packed with cotton batting and that this was done by the accused. It was, therefore, of vital importance that, upon this point, the direction to the jury should be so clear and unequivocal as to leave no room for misapprehension. We think, with great respect, that the references to this issue by the learned trial judge, and the manner in which he presented the evidence to them, was likely to mislead.\nWe agree, moreover, with the learned Chief Justice that the production before the jury of the articles found in the residence of the accused by the police acting under a search warrant (with the exception of the \"knitting needle and the bicycle spoke\") ought not to have been permitted. These articles had no real pertinency to any issue between the Crown and the accused and two of them, the books, were by their nature calculated to create prejudice against her in the eyes of the jury.\nOn these grounds the appeal should be allowed. The majority of the Court are of the opinion that there should be a new trial and a new trial is accordingly ordered.

On March 30, \u201c1938, accused and H. were seen together and later on that day H. was found suffering from injuries from which she died. Evidence was given of statements by accused, after the alleged attack that he had killed H. with a hammer that he was \u201cawful jealous of her,\u201d that he took her home the night previous and \u201cafterwards she ran out with another fellow.\u201d Evidence was given, against objection, of previous quarrels between accused and H. and accompanying assaults upon H. by accused, one such incident occurring shortly before Christmas, 1937, one in January, 1938, and one about a week before said March 30, 1938. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick (Harrison J. dissenting) directed a new trial, on the ground that evidence of previous assaults by accused upon H. was improperly admitted (13 M.P.R. 203). The Crown appealed.\nHeld (Kerwin and Hudson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Duff C.J., Rinfret and Davis JJ.: The Crown\u2019s case was that accused had killed H. in a fit of jealous passion aroused by her conduct with another man. The evidence definitely negatived any connection between this other man and the earlier incidents now in question; and wholly failed to present any facts from which the jury could properly infer that there was any connection of such earlier incidents with accused\u2019s objection to H.\u2019s associating with other men; or that such incidents were the result of enmity or ill-will on accused\u2019s part; they were transient ebullitions of annoyance and anger which immediately passed away and led to nothing; in their physical characteristics they had no real similarity to the attack of March 30. Where there are acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed, to establish motive for a crime, evidence of such acts is admissible, not merely to prove intent, but to prove the fact as well; but it is important that courts should not slip into a habit of admitting evidence which, reasonably viewed, cannot tend to prove motive or to explain the acts charged, merely because it discloses some incident in the history of the relations of the parties. The incidents in question did not appear to be such that they could reasonably be regarded as evidencing feelings of enmity or ill-will which could have been the motive actuating the homicide charged. A quarrel might, in its incidents or circumstances or in its relation to other facts in evidence, have such a character as to entitle the jury to infer motive and intention and state of mind, even in the absence of verbal declaration; while, on the other hand, such an occurrence or series of occurrences might be so insignificant as to leave nothing for the jury to interpret and to afford no reasonable basis for a relevant inference adverse to the accused. The facts in each case must be looked at, and if, reasonably viewed, they have no probative tendency favourable to the Crown or adverse to the accused in respect of the issue joined between them, the evidence should be excluded.\nRex v. Bond, [1906] 2 K.B. 389, at 397, 401, Rex v. Ball, [1911] A.C. 47, at 68, and other oases, referred to. Theal v. The Queen, 7 Can. S.C.R. 397, on its facts has no resemblance to the present case.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting): The intent of accused was directly in issue (Cr. Code, s. 259 (b) referred to), and it was for the Crown to adduce evidence thereon. There was a definite connection between the accused\u2019s acts accompanying said quarrels and the issue as to accused\u2019s intent in inflicting the injuries on March 30; the evidence of those acts was relevant to that issue as indicating a jealous disposition on accused\u2019s part and as evidence of his motive. The jury was entitled to take those matters into consideration in conjunction with the other evidence, and the probative value was not so slight that the evidence as to any of the quarrels was inadmissible.\nRex v. Bond, [1906] 2 K.B. 389, at 397, 400, 401, Rex v. Ball, [1911] A.C. 47, at 68, Rex v. Shellaker, [1914] 1 K.B. 414, Rex v. Chomatsu Yabu, 5 West. Australian L.R. 35, and other cases, referred to.\nPer Hudson J. (dissenting): The onus was on the Crown to establish that accused killed H. and that he did it with malice. To satisfy that onus, recourse to circumstantial evidence was necessary. Evidence of the previous relations of the parties, including evidence of their quarrels and how they then behaved towards each other, was relevant on the issue of malice as that issue is explained in Woolmington v. The Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462, at 482. The evidence being relevant to an issue, it should not be excluded merely on the ground that it disclosed some other crime or offence of a similar nature committed by accused (Makin v. Attorney-General of New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57; Rex v. Bond, [1906] 2 K.B. 389).\nAPPEAL by the Attorney-General of New Brunswick from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], allowing (Harrison J. dissenting) the accused\u2019s appeal against his conviction for murder and ordering a new trial, on the ground that evidence given at the trial of previous assaults by the accused upon the deceased was improperly admitted. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported; the evidence is dealt with in some considerable detail in the judgment of Kerwin J. (dissenting). The appeal to this Court was dismissed, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. dissenting. E. B. MacLatchy for the appellant.\nP. J. Hughes K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court (The Chief Justice and Rinfret and Davis JJ.) was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal, in my view of it, does not raise any question of general principle. As Lord Dunedin said in Thompson v. The King[2]:\u2014\nthe law of evidence in criminal cases is really nothing more than a set of practical rules which experience has shown to be best fitted to elicit the truth as to guilt without causing undue prejudice to the prisoner.\nIt must not be forgotten that the jury are not engaged in a scientific investigation. They are trying an issue of fact between the Crown and the prisoner; and the court must see that the practical rules, the purpose of which is thus explained by Lord Dunedin, are duly observed.\nNobody disputes that it is of the utmost importance to\na prisoner charged with an offence * * * that the facts laid before the jury should consist exclusively of the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment which alone he can be expected to come prepared to answer. It is, therefore, a general rule that the facts proved must be strictly relevant to the particular charge and have no reference to any conduct of the prisoner unconnected with such charge.\nI am quoting from the judgment of Mr. Justice Kennedy in Rex v. Bond[3].\nWhile, as already observed, I do not consider any question of general principle is really involved in this case, I do not suggest for a moment that assistance in applying well known principles to the facts may not be gained by consulting the authorities.\nIn Rex v. Ball[4] two people were indicted upon a charge of incest. At the trial, evidence was admitted of previous acts of intercourse and of the fact that they had been living in relations akin to those of husband and wife. The House of Lords held these acts were admissible as tending to establish the existence of a guilty passion at the very time the acts charged were alleged to have been committed on the ground that\ntheir passion for each other was as much evidence as was their presence together in bed of the fact that when there they had guilty relations with each other. In this Court, counsel for the Crown, who had conducted the Crown\u2019s case at the trial and who presented his argument with conspicuous fairness, sustained the admissibility of the evidence objected to on the strictly narrow ground that it was relevant to the issue of intent and upon that alone. He expressly disclaimed the suggestion that the quarrels of which evidence was given proceeded from hostility or enmity, or tended to show the existence of such feelings. In his factum he contends that evidence of the relations of the parties, friendly or unfriendly, is admissible without qualification; but on the oral argument his contention was explicitly limited as above explained and, it should be noticed, that this limitation is logically inconsistent with any contention that the evidence tended to establish feelings of hostility or malignity; a contention which, as observed, he explicitly refused to adopt. The existence of such feelings would, as we shall see, be relevant not merely in respect of intent, but in respect of the fact as well. The evidence adduced by the Crown was inconsistent with the notion that anything like a feeling of ill-will or malignity actuated these quarrels; and, indeed, as the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick intimates, they were transient ebullitions of annoyance and anger on the part of the accused which immediately passed away and led to nothing.\nThe Crown\u2019s case was in truth that the accused had killed the deceased in a fit of jealous passion aroused by her conduct with another man. There is nothing in the evidence to show that the accused was aware even of the existence of this man before the last of the incidents in question, although he had first become acquainted with the deceased, according to his own evidence, about two weeks before that. The evidence definitely negatives any connection between him and the earlier incidents. It seems reasonable to infer from counsel\u2019s opening that he expected to connect all the incidents now in question with the accused\u2019s objection to the victim\u2019s associating with other men; but the evidence wholly fails to present any facts from which the jury could properly infer that there was any such connection. It is true there is a general statement, elicited in re-examination from one of the witnesses by leading questions, to the effect that the accused objected to her going with other men and that he was a little \u201cjealous\u201d of her. But there is no evidence which would have entitled the trial judge to instruct the jury that they might ascribe these quarrels to any such feeling. Indeed, as regards the first of the quarrels, the evidence of the witness for the Crown who related the facts is explicit that the quarrel had a totally different origin. There is no suggestion in the record, it should be added, from the beginning to the end of the trial that these incidents were the result of enmity or ill-will on the part of the accused.\nIf you have acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed, to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then there can be no doubt that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove intent, but to prove the fact as well. But I think, with the greatest possible respect, it is rather important that the courts should not slip into a habit of admitting evidence which, reasonably viewed, cannot tend to prove motive or to explain the acts charged merely because it discloses some incident in the history of the relations of the parties.\nIn the course of the argument in Rex v. Ball (1), Lord Atkinson said:\u2014\nSurely in an ordinary prosecution for murder you can prove previous acts or words of the accused to shew he entertained feelings of enmity towards the deceased, and that is evidence not merely of the malicious mind with which he killed the deceased, but of the fact that he killed him. You can give in evidence the enmity of the accused towards the deceased to prove that the accused took the deceased\u2019s life. Evidence of motive necessarily goes to prove the fact of the homicide by the accused, as well as his \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d * * *\nOf course, a much wider latitude is allowed the accused, who may adduce any evidence, of good character for example, tending to show, not only that it was not likely that he committed the crime charged but that he was not the kind of person likely to do so.\nIn Rex v. Ball[5], Lord Loreburn quoted the following passage from the judgment of Kennedy J. in Rex v. Bond[6]:\u2014\nThe relations of the murdered or injured man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for which the accused is on his trial.\nIt is most important to attend to the qualification \u201cso far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment.\u201d It explains, I think, why Cresswell J. and Williams J. in Mobbs\u2019 case[7] were not satisfied of the admissibility of evidence of conduct of the accused directed towards the deceased eleven days before the date of the alleged murder in the absence of some accompanying declaration, even as tending to prove malice.\nIn Theal v. The Queen[8], counsel for the Crown in opening (p. 399) stated he would prove systematic ill-treatment culminating in the final assault which was the immediate cause of the victim\u2019s death. The previous acts of violence were held admissible as tending to establish intent and as in the same category as deliberate menaces or threats tending to prove malice and intent (per Ritchie C.J. at p. 406). The judgment must be interpreted in light of the facts and especially of the character of the previous assaults proved and the threats accompanying them. The case has no sort of resemblance to that before us.\nBy way of summary, it may perhaps be added that, first of all, the incidents in question do not appear to be such that they could reasonably be regarded as evidencing feelings of enmity or ill-will which could have been the motive actuating the homicide charged. I do not doubt that a quarrel might in its incidents or circumstances, or in its relation to other facts in evidence, have such a character as to entitle the jury to infer motive and intention and state of mind, even in the absence of verbal declaration; while, on the other hand, such an occurrence or series of occurrences might be so insignificant as to leave nothing for the jury to interpret and to afford no reasonable basis for a relevant inference adverse to the accused. The facts in each case must be looked at, and if, reasonably viewed, they have no probative tendency favourable to the Crown or adverse to the prisoner in respect of the issue joined between them, it is the duty of the court to exclude the evidence. The responsibility of the judge in such cases is a grave one if there is any risk that the evidence tendered may prejudice the prisoner.\nHaving regard to the character of the case made at the trial, the course of the trial, and the position taken by counsel for the Crown in this court, it would be unsafe to set aside the order for a new trial pronounced by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on any such hypothesis as to the origin and nature of these incidents.\nFor the same reason it would be equally unsafe to proceed upon the proposition that evidence of these incidents was admissible as relevant to the issue of intent as evidence of similar acts calculated to negative accident or mistake or tending directly to prove that the acts of the 30th of March were committed with the intent to kill. In view of the relations of the parties it is questionable if what occurred on any one of the occasions dealt with by Mr. Justice Harrison amounted even technically to an assault; in any event, the Crown, as already observed, refused to impute to the accused ill-will and there is no suggestion that there was any intention to harm; in their physical characteristics there is no real similarity between these quarrels and the murderous attack of March 30th.\nNor is there any evidence from which the jury could reasonably ascribe the conduct of the accused on these isolated occasions to the motive alleged to have prompted the acts of March 30th\u2014resentment against the association of the deceased with other men.\nThe appear should be dismissed.\nKerwin J. (dissenting)\u2014Robert Barbour was convicted of having murdered Margaret Harris on March 30th, 1938. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[9] directed a new trial on the ground that evidence given that the accused had previously assaulted the deceased was improperly admitted. Mr. Justice Harrison dissented and the Attorney-General now appeals to this Court upon the question of law upon which such dissent was based.\nUpon an examination of the residuum of the evidence there would appear to be no dispute as to the following facts. The accused and Margaret Harris had been \u201ckeeping company\u201d for some time. (I refer immediately to what transpired on the evening of March 29th, 1938, because while there was a suggestion that the evidence on the point is of a \u201cprevious assault,\u201d it was not so urged before us by counsel for the accused and in fact I do not understand how that proposition could be seriously advanced). On the evening, then, of March 29th the accused brought Margaret to her home and shoved her through the doorway, saying to her mother, \u201ckeep her home, she is running around too much.\u201d On March 30th, the accused and Margaret were seen together,\u2014the latter sitting on the former\u2019s knee and the accused crying. Shortly thereafter the girl was discovered in the same house bleeding and suffering from injuries inflicted by a hammer. The same day the accused went to the shire gaol and gave himself into custody. Upon arrival at the buildings he met Napoleon Leger and said to him: \u201cMy name is Robert Barbour, son of John Barbour. * * * I have just killed my lady friend.\u201d After being incarcerated, he made a certain statement in the presence of two prisoners. One of them, Wilmot, gives the statement as follows: \u201cI just committed murder about ten minutes ago. * * * Yes, that is right\u2014I just killed my girl with a hammer.\u201d Upon Wilmot remarking: \u201cHow in the name of God did that happen?\u201d the accused continued, according to Wilmot: \u201cI was awful jealous of her\u2014 I took her out last night\u2014 I took her home\u2014 Afterwards she ran out with another fellow\u2014 She came over to the house to-day and I killed her.\u201d The other prisoner, Darbison, testified: \u201cHe (meaning the accused) said he had killed a girl\u2014had hit her on the head with a hammer. * * * He said he took her home the night previous and he was terribly jealous of her.\u201d As a result of the injuries sustained on March 30th, Margaret died on April 15th.\nThe issues to be determined by the jury were whether the accused had inflicted the injuries from which the girl died, and under clause (b) of section 259 of the Code, whether he had meant to cause her any bodily injury which was known to him to be likely to cause death and was careless whether death ensued or not. That is, the intent of the accused was directly in issue and the responsibility devolved upon the Crown to adduce evidence on that point. Evidence as to any motive the accused might have had in inflicting the injuries spoken of in the Code was directly relevant to that issue of intent. While the Crown is not obliged to adduce evidence of motive, the presence or absence of motive may be of very considerable importance. If the evidence before the jury disclosed merely that the girl had received injuries and that the accused had caused those injuries, the case would have been left in a very unsatisfactory position, and hence it was that evidence of what the accused said to Leger and to the two prisoners was tendered, not merely to indicate that the accused had inflicted the injuries but as to his motive in so doing.\nHow, then, does the matter stand with reference to the evidence of previous assaults which the Court of Appeal has determined was improperly admitted? In his opening address to the jury, after stating that the accused had been keeping company with Margaret Harris and after referring to one Robert MacPherson, who \u201ccomes into the scene on March 29th,\u201d and after referring to the evidence to be adduced that on the evening of that day the accused had pushed Margaret through the doorway saying something to this effect: \u201cKeep her home. She is running around too much,\u201d Crown counsel continued, according to the transcript on page 40 of the Appeal Case, as follows:\u2014\nNow there is evidence also to be submitted here that the accused and his girl friend, sweetheart if you like, have not been getting along very well lately. Evidence to show that there had been some quarrelling. Now what the reasons for the quarrels are you will have to have some evidence before you what was bring that about. What was the trouble. What he was crying about that day. Why his mysterious movements on the day before and why his mysterious actions in the house that afternoon of the fatal day, March 30th.\nDuring the course of the trial this evidence as to quarrelling was adduced:\u2014\n(1) The evidence of Frances Barbour, a sister of the accused. After the objection of counsel for the accused had been over-ruled, the questions and answers proceeded:\nQ. I would ask you the question, prior to March 30th shortly prior to March 30th, did you ever see Robert Barbour, your brother, and Margaret Harris quarrelling?\nA. Yes.\nQ. About how long before March 30th?\nA. About a week.\nQ. Where was this quarrel you saw? Where did it take place?\nA. In the Barbour house.\nQ. In your own house?\nA. Yes.\nQ. In what room in your own house?\nA. In the living room. Q. Tell us what you saw on that occasion?\nA. Margaret and Robert were sitting down, they were quarrelling. They were talking about something. I didn\u2019t hear. Robert jumped up and started hitting Margaret.\nCourt: He jumped up?\nA. Yes.\nCourt: And did what?\nA. Hit Margaret.\nCourt: He hit Margaret?\nA. Yes, Margaret went into the bed room and Robert went out.\nQ. Margaret went into the bed room?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And Robert went out doors?\nA. Yes.\nQ. How many times did he hit her and how did he hit her?\nA. He hit her with his hand.\nQ. Do you know whether it was his clenched hand or open hand?\nA. I didn\u2019t take notice.\nQ. What stopped the quarrel?\nA. My sister-in-law stopped it.\nQ. Your sister-in-law?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That is Mrs. Richard Barbour?\nA. Yes.\nQ. How did she stop them?\nA. Came and parted them.\nQ. What did you do yourself in that case?\nA. I called for Mrs. Galley.\nQ. Where is Mrs. Galley?\nA. In the same building we are in.\nQ. In the rear part of your house, is that right?\nA. Yes.\nIn cross-examination the witness was asked and answered as follows:\u2014\nQ. You say your brother Robert, the accused, and Margaret Harris went out together a great deal?\nA. Yes.\nQ. As a matter of fact, he was very fond of her?\nA. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. Isn\u2019t it true that Margaret Harris was inclined to tease Robert?\nA. Yes.\nQ. You said yes?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you know whether or not she was teasing him on the occasion you spoke of, that you were telling Mr. McLatchey of?\nA. No, she was not.\n(2) The evidence of Mrs. Richard Barbour, a sister of Margaret Harris, which on this point appears at pages 160 to 165 of the Case. After an objection had been overruled, this witness testified that she had seen the accused and Margaret quarreling on three occasions. The first was shortly prior to the preceding Christmas; the accused wanted Margaret to go to her own home and kicked her; the witness stopped this quarrel. The next occasion was about January of 1938 and while the witness could not state the reason for the quarrel, she saw the accused strike Margaret once or twice over the shoulder with his open hand; the parties to the quarrel stopped of their own accord. The third occasion was a week before March 30th and is the same one already spoken of by Frances Barbour. On cross-examination the witness admitted that the accused and Margaret had been keeping company for a long time; that they seemed to be fond of each other; that Margaret was inclined to tease the accused from time to time \u201cfor fun,\u201d and that they would have \u201cspats\u201d; that when they were quarrelling on the two latter occasions spoken of by this witness \u201cit would be one of those spats\u201d; that they would generally \u201cmake up right after and go on as they had before\u201d; and that on the first occasion spoken of by the witness, the accused wanted Margaret to go to her own home so that he might go to bed to be rested for his work in the morning. On re-examination the following occurred, as reported on page 184 of the Case:\u2014\nQ. Was Robert jealous about Margaret?\nA. He appeared to be a little.\nQ. Did he object to her going around with other men?\nMr. Hughes: Just a moment\u2014I object.\nQuestion allowed.\nA. Yes, he did.\nCross-examination on these questions\u2014Mr. Hughes.\nQ. Mrs. Barbour, you said Robert appeared to be a little jealous of Margaret?\nA. Yes.\nQ. He seemed, as you have already said, to be very fond of her?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And you thought he wanted to marry her, I take it? Mr. McLatchey: She didn\u2019t say that.\nQ. That would be correct, would it not?\nA. Well, I don\u2019t know.\nQ. Well, that was the impression you gathered from their relationship, was it not?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And that if he thought he was likely to lose her he appeared to be jealous, that is what you thought?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. Did he not appear to be trying to protect her?\nA. I don\u2019t know.\nQ. Have you not seen indications of that?\nA. No, I have not. Q. Did he not try to keep her from going to places that he thought she should not go to?\nA. Well, I don\u2019t know anything about that.\n(3) The evidence of John Harris, Margaret\u2019s father, who testified that in January of 1938 he had had a conversation with the accused and had told the accused \u201cMargaret had two black eyes and I asked him what was the meaning of it and he did not give me any answer.\u201d The witness testified further that on March 29th \u201che (the accused) told me, he said \u2018I will never lay hands on Margaret again\u2019 and he made a promise and I took him up on it and we shook hands on it.\u201d On cross-examination the witness testified that the accused had not admitted that he (the accused) was responsible for the blackening of Margaret\u2019s eyes.\nThe only reference in the judge\u2019s charge to the jury as to the accused having struck or kicked Margaret is at page 450 of the Case, and it was introduced in connection with the judge\u2019s instructions on the question of the accused\u2019s insanity, which had also been raised. The learned judge had discussed this question at some length and then said:\u2014\nLet us see what turns here:\nWe have been told that the accused and this girl were very friendly. I do not know whether they were lovers or not, but they had been going around together for three or four years. There is evidence also that he had kicked her. There is evidence that he hit her. There is evidence that on the 29th of March he had, that before Margaret Harris was found wounded or injured in the Barbour house, that he had told Margaret\u2019s father that he wouldn\u2019t ever lay a hand on her again. So that you compare that with the situation I have given you, of a father coming in and telling you that he had killed his child.\nThe judge immediately continued with his instruction upon the question of insanity. At page 444 he is reported to have spoken \u201cof the reference to the fact that Margaret was teasing the accused\u201d and to have pointed out that it appeared to him that it was introduced for no reason except to suggest provocation, as to which the judge intimated there was no evidence.\nI have mentioned in detail the only evidence of previous assaults and have shown how that evidence was introduced and led at the trial. The manner in which it was dealt with by the trial judge and Crown counsel cannot, of course, cure the defect, if in truth it was not proper to place it before the jury, as the objection is to its admissibility and not to the weight to be attached to it. However, it is apparent that it was never suggested that such evidence was submitted for the purpose of showing the accused had committed another offence, or that he was a person who was likely to mean to cause to the deceased an injury known to the accused to be likely to cause death, or as evidence of similar acts; but on the ground that it was some evidence of a motive,\u2014particularly when considered in conjunction with the evidence as to what transpired on the evening of March 29th and the evidence as to the statements made by the accused on March 30th to Leger and the two prisoners.\nOn the argument the case of Rex v. Bond[10] was relied upon by counsel for the respondent and we were particularly pressed with the applicability of the judgment of Lord Justice Kennedy. In Rex v. Ball[11], counsel for the accused, during the course of his argument before the House of Lords, referred to that part of the judgment of Lord Justice Kennedy at page 397 in the Bond case10, but later the Lord Chancellor quoted another part of the same judgment at page 401:\u2014\nThe relations of the murdered or injured man to his assailant, so far as they may reasonably be treated as explanatory of the conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment, are properly admitted to proof as integral parts of the history of the alleged crime for which the accused is on his trial.\nUpon counsel remarking:\u2014\nThat is because, in murder, you have the act, and then the question of what was in the mind of the assailant.\nLord Atkinson then interposed:\u2014\nSurely in an ordinary prosecution for murder you can prove previous acts or words of the accused to shew he entertained feelings of enmity towards the deceased, and that is evidence not merely of the malicious mind with which he killed the deceased, but of the fact that he killed him. You can give in evidence the enmity of the accused towards the deceased to prove that the accused took the deceased\u2019s life. Evidence of motive necessarily goes to prove the fact of the homicide by the accused, as well as his \u201cmalice aforethought,\u201d inasmuch as it is more probable that men are killed by those who have some motive for killing them than by those who have not.\nIt is true that the circumstances in the Ball case[12] were peculiar but in The King v. Shellaker[13] Sir Rufus Isaacs, Lord Chief Justice of England, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, which included Channell, Bray, Avory and Lush, JJ., pointed out that the Ball case[14] followed a long line of authorities of which Reg. v. Ollis[15] was one. The rule propounded by Channell J. in the latter was adopted wherein he stated that in such cases evidence of other transactions is admitted not for the purpose of showing that the prisoner committed other offences but for the purpose of showing that the transaction in question was done with the intent to defraud or with guilty knowledge, as the case may be. The Ollis case[16] is again referred to, as well as the Shellaker case[17], in Rex v. Love-grove[18], another judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal (the Earl of Reading, L.C.J., Salter and Acton JJ.) delivered by the Lord Chief Justice.\nThese decisions show, if any authority be needed, that the Bond case[19], and particularly the judgment relied upon, cannot be taken as setting forth the only circumstances under which prior offences of an accused may be disclosed on his trial. In fact, Lord Justice Kennedy enunciated several general rules, i.e., (1) \u201cevidence must be confined to the point in issue\u201d and (2) \u201cthe facts proved must be strictly relevant to the particular charge and have no reference to any conduct of the prisoner unconnected with such charge\u201d (page 397). As to these rules, it will be noticed that the Lord Justice refers to the \u201cpoint in issue\u201d and to \u201cconduct of the prisoner unconnected with such charge,\u201d and later at page 400 points out that it is not easy to say whether a particular case falls within the (second) rule or within the apparent exceptions.\nIn Reg. v. Mobbs[20], it is reported in (1853) 6 Cox C.C. 223 and in 17 J.P. 713, that Baron Cresswell and Williams J., in a case where evidence was offered of a prior assault, felt so uncertain about the matter that they decided not to admit the evidence. These reports are very meagre but in 38 Central Criminal Court Reports, 651, which purports to give the proceedings as they occurred, no reference is made to a ruling by the judges. From this report it appears that upon counsel for the accused objecting to the question, \u201cWhat did you then see the prisoner do to his wife?\u201d and stating that such evidence did not explain the difference between murder and manslaughter, which was the only argument open to him, Mr. Bodkin for the Crown indicated \u201cthat he did not purpose to prove any expressions accompanying the acts but only the acts themselves; that it was not consistent with his duty to omit all mention of the matter, but having done so, he would now withdraw the question.\u201d\nWhichever report of Reg. v. Mobbs[21] is correct, it is apparent that the case cannot be considered a precedent to apply to other cases where, either a prior act of the accused is accompanied by a statement of his, or where there are other acts of his that a jury might consider in conjunction with such prior act. And this view was taken in Rex v. Chomatsu Yabu[22]. It was there held, on an appeal from a conviction of a man for having murdered a Japanese woman, that evidence was rightly admitted that at a date some time earlier than the date of the alleged offence the accused was in a yard behind the house of the woman and in answer to her accusation admitted that he had broken up her furniture. McMillan J. stated:\u2014\nI think if facts can be found from which the jury can properly infer what the motive and intention and state of mind of prisoner was, that those facts are as properly brought before them as any declaration on the part of the prisoner would have been.\nAt the famous trial of William Palmer, 1856[23], one question was as to whether the accused administered the poison. After referring to the practice in some countries of allowing a probability to be raised that an accused has committed an offence by showing that he has committed other offences, Lord Campbell instructed the jury that by the law of England every man is presumed to be innocent and that it allowed his guilt to be established only by evidence directly connected with the charge. He then referred to circumstantial evidence leading to the conclusion of guilt, stating that with respect to the alleged motive \u201cit is of great importance to see whether there was a motive for committing such a crime\u201d and concluded that the adequacy of the motive was of little importance. In the case at bar, it is doubtful, in my opinion, in view of the relations between the accused and Margaret Harris, if the striking and kicking may be termed offences in any sense of the word. In any event, for the reasons already indicated, I believe there was a definite connection between those acts, accompanying, as they did, the quarrels mentioned, and the issue as to the accused\u2019s intent in inflicting the injuries on Margaret Harris on March 30th, 1938. The evidence of these acts was relevant to that issue as indicating a jealous disposition on the part of the accused and as evidence of the accused\u2019s motive.\nIn connection with the four episodes, it is well to bear in mind the relationship between the Harris and Barbour families and just who the witnesses were who testified. Mrs. Richard Barbour was not only the sister of Margaret Harris but was also married to a brother of the accused. Frances Barbour was a sister of the accused; and John Harris, besides being the father of Margaret Harris, was, of course, the father-in-law of his other daughter\u2019s husband. As to the first occasion, Mrs. Richard Barbour did testify on cross-examination, as has been noted, that the accused wanted Margaret to go to her home so that he might go to bed to be rested for his work. In view of the fact that this testimony was given by answering \u201cYes\u201d to a series of suggestions by counsel for the accused (put by him with perfect propriety), the jury would be entitled to weigh such answers and give such effect to them, if any, as they saw fit. The jury was entitled to take all these matters into consideration in conjunction with the other evidence and I cannot agree that the probative value is so slight that the evidence as to any of the quarrels was inadmissible. The trial judge admitted the evidence and, in my opinion, should not have ruled otherwise.\nNotwithstanding that the appellant is restricted upon his appeal to the question of law upon which there has been dissent in the court below, it was submitted on behalf of the accused that the latter is not to be deprived of the new trial granted him unless this Court is satisfied, in making such order \u201cas the justice of the case requires\u201d (section 1024, subsection 1), that no error exists in connection with any of the other grounds taken by the accused before the Court of Appeal. We accordingly heard argument on all questions that counsel for the accused desired to raise. It is unnecessary for me to express an opinion on any of these questions or on the point of jurisdiction, since the majority of the Court have come to the conclusion that the appeal of the Attorney-General fails.\nHudson J. (dissenting)\u2014The only point: on which there was dissent in the court below is that \u201cthere was error in admitting the evidence of previous assaults by the accused upon Margaret Harris.\u201d\nThe prisoner was charged with murder and pleaded not guilty. The duty of the Crown in such a case is stated by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Sankey, in the case of Woolmington v. The Director of Public Prosecutions[24], as follows:\u2014\nWhen dealing with a murder case the Crown must prove (a) death as the result of a voluntary act of the accused and (b) malice of the accused. It may prove malice either expressly or by implication. For malice may be implied where death occurs as the result of a voluntary act of the accused which is (i) intentional and (ii) unprovoked. When evidence of death and malice has been given (this is a question for the jury) the accused is entitled to show, by evidence or by examination of the circumstances adduced by the Crown that the act on his part which caused death was either unintentional or provoked.\nThe onus then was on the Crown to establish that the prisoner killed the deceased and that he did it with malice. To satisfy this onus, recourse to circumstantial evidence was necessary. The questions immediately arose: What were the previous relations between the parties? Were they friends or otherwise? If friends, how friendly? How did they normally behave towards each other? What were their normal acts and ordinary doings?\nI am of opinion that evidence in this case of the previous relations of the parties, including evidence of their quarrels and how they then behaved towards each other, was relevant on the issue of malice as above defined by the House of Lords.\nIf the evidence was relevant to any issue, then I can find no authority to justify the exclusion of such evidence merely on the ground that it disclosed some other crime or offence of a similar nature committed by the accused. The decision of the Privy Council in Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[25], and of the Court of Appeal in The King v. Bond[26], sufficiently establish this. For these reasons, I agree on this point with the conclusion of Mr. Justice Harrison who dissented in the court below.\nAs the majority of this Court has come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed, it is unnecessary for me to express an opinion on the question of jurisdiction or on the other points raised on behalf of the prisoner.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

The respondent having violated a term or condition of the contract, then, by force of what is now s. 191 of The Insurance Act (R.S.O., 1937, c. 256), his claim was rendered invalid and his right to recover indemnity became forfeited. Relief under s. 192 of the Act was refused, the Court holding that, under all the circumstances of the case, the trial judge was amply justified, in the exercise of his discretion, in declining to relieve against the forfeiture, even if. respondent\u2019s conduct could fairly be said to be merely \u201cimperfect compliance\u201d with the statutory conditions, which, under s. 192, is the only ground upon which the court is given power to relieve.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario ([1937] O.R. 872) reversed; and judgment of McTague J. ([1936] O.R. 394), dismissing respondent\u2019s claim against appellant, restored.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing (Henderson J.A. dissenting) the present respondent\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the trial judge, McTague J.[2], dismissing his claim against the appellant insurance company, under a motor vehicle liability policy issued by the company, for indemnity in respect of a judgment recovered in an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario by one Marshall (plaintiff) against the respondent (defendant) for damages for injuries suffered by Marshall (plaintiff) when a milk wagon driven by him was struck by an automobile driven by the respondent (defendant). The said insurance company was (on its application) added as a third party in the action, under subs. 7 (enacted by 25 Geo. V, c. 29, s. 36 (2)) of s. 183h of The Insurance Act, Ont. (R.S.O., 1927, c. 222) (said subs. 7 being now subs. 7 of s. 205 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 256). The company denied liability to indemnify the present respondent in respect of the claim in question. The material facts and circumstances of the case are set out in the judgment of Davis J. now reported. The appeal of the company to this Court was allowed and the judgment at the trial was restored with costs throughout.\nG.A. Drew K.C. for the appellant.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and J.R. Cartwright K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 in an automobile insurance case. The re- spondent at the time of the accident in question held an owner\u2019s motor vehicle liability policy with the appellant insurance company. The company denied liability for indemnity in respect of the particular accident and that issue falls to be determined in these somewhat novel proceedings which form part of the action in which the injured party sued the respondent for damages for the injuries received in the accident and in which action the injured party as plaintiff recovered judgment against the respondent as defendant for $6,500 and costs. The procedure for setting up and determining the issue of liability as between the defendant and the insurance company was introduced in Ontario in 1935 (25 Geo. V, ch. 29, sec. 36(2)) when the following subsection (7) was added to sec. 183h of The Insurance Act:\n(7) Where an insurer denies liability under a motor vehicle liability policy it shall have the right upon application to the court to be made a third party in any action to which the insured is a party and in which a claim is made by any party to the action for which it is or might be asserted indemnity is provided by the said policy.\nThat subsection is now sec. 205 (7) of The Insurance Act, being ch. 256 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937. The insurance policy in question was issued May 15th, 1934, and was by renewal in full force and effect at the date of the accident, October 3rd, 1935.\nThe facts now known are not really in dispute. The respondent Adamson, a married man, 51 years of age, was a fruit broker residing and carrying on business in Toronto. On the evening of October 2nd, 1935, he and two other men remained in Adamson\u2019s downtown office from about eleven o\u2019clock in the evening until around two o\u2019clock in the morning. Two young women, about 28 or 30 years of age, neither employees nor relatives, came to the office about eleven or eleven-thirty that evening and remained till around two o\u2019clock in the morning. Adamson admitted that there were two cases of beer, though he said only half a dozen pints were consumed and that he had about two glasses\u2014a bottle and a half\u2014perhaps one hour apart. Adamson, some time after two o\u2019clock, was driving his motor car up town with the two girls in the front seat with him when he struck a milk wagon crossing in his path. He heard the man on the milk wagon yell and he felt the impact but he did not stop his car. At the next corner he let the girls out of the car and proceeded by a somewhat circuitous route to his home in the northern part of the city. The police were at his home shortly thereafter; he denied that he was in any accident but the police told him that they had witnesses of the accident. It is not necessary to follow the police court proceedings. The man on the milk wagon was very seriously injured and was removed to the hospital and in his subsequent action against Adamson recovered, as stated above, $6,500 and costs.\nIn what is called the third party proceedings (in the action between the injured man and Adamson) the appellant company denied liability under its policy upon the ground, speaking broadly for the moment, that Adamson did not give the insurance company \u201call available particulars\u201d of the accident, as it is alleged he was by his contract bound to do, and failed to \u201cco-operate\u201d with the insurance company in the defence of the action, as it is further alleged he was bound by his contract to do.\nWhat happened was this: The day of the accident, October 3rd, 1935, Adamson telephoned the insurance company that he had had an accident in the early hours of the morning. The insurance company instructed its adjuster, Bethune, to deal with the matter. Bethune tried to communicate with Adamson on October 3rd but was unable to reach him until the next day when Adamson answered Bethune\u2019s telephone message to him. Bethune asked Adamson on the telephone certain specific questions. Adamson stated that there were no witnesses to the accident and also that he had consumed no intoxicating drinks before the accident. Bethune then gave instructions to West, in his office, to investigate the claim. West had considerable difficulty in arranging an appointment with Adamson and it was not until nearly two months after the accident, in spite of numerous calls at Adamson\u2019s office and of telephone messages to communicate with him, that West procured an interview with and obtained a signed statement from Adamson in regard to the accident. In this written statement Adamson repeated that he had consumed no intoxicating drinks before the accident, but he left blank the space for the answers to the questions as to the names and addresses of the witnesses in his own car and of the witnesses in the other car, and of the other witnesses. Prior to signing this statement Adamson told West positively that there were no passengers in the car with him at the time of the accident. Then, in a general discussion after signing the form, Adamson told West that he had a gentleman in the automobile with him. When West questioned Adamson about not giving this information before, Adamson explained that the gentleman was a rather prominent individual and that he did not wish his name to become involved on account of the accident. West then pointed out that it was necessary that he give the name of this passenger and insisted that he do so. Adamson then said that he was in error, that he had made a mistake in regard to this gentleman, and that there were in fact no passengers in the automobile with him.\nOn November 27th, 1935, Marshall, the injured man, had issued a writ against Adamson. On December 5th, 1935, the solicitor for the insurance company under instructions from the company entered an appearance on behalf of Adamson. On December 11th a formal statement of defence was delivered, though the company\u2019s solicitor had never had an opportunity to see Adamson. On December 14th, 1935, the solicitor for the company wrote to Adamson, advising him of the steps which had been taken and pointing out that \u201cwe are defending this action under the provisions set forth in the policy between you and the Provident Assurance Company.\u201d On December 21st, 1935, the solicitor again wrote to Adamson, stating that he had had no communication from him. The letter proceeded:\nWe would like your immediate attention to this matter and request that you get in touch with this office as soon as possible, as we require complete co-operation from you in the matter. It is our duty to point out to you now that if for lack of co-operation or any other reason that we have not yet learned, the liability as between the company and you is called into question, that anything we are now doing in defence of the action will not estop us from claiming over against you for anything we may have to pay, by reason of statutory obligation, or because of anything else affecting the contract of insurance, as between yourself and the company.\nPlease telephone this office without delay for an appointment to go into this matter.\nNotwithstanding the letter of December 21st, it was not until January 8th, 1936, that the company\u2019s solicitor saw Adamson for the first time. Adamson went into the solicitor\u2019s office that day at the exact hour fixed for Adamson\u2019s examination for discovery as defendant in the action, although he had been asked to go half an hour earlier than the time fixed for the examination. The solicitor asked Adamson if there were any passengers in the car with him and he stated that he was alone in his car. The solicitor says that from Adamson\u2019s\ndemeanour at the time, and also because I had reason to suspect that he had a man with him\u2014that being the report I got\u2014I warned him that it was a serious matter to go into the evidence on the examination for discovery, as he would be under oath.\nThere was a silence followed during which he looked at me blankly. The next remark was that he would like to see his own solicitor and have him present at the examination for discovery if possible. I told him he could do that by all means and suggested that he telephone his solicitor from my office.\nAdamson, after telephoning his own solicitor\u2019s office and finding his solicitor was out, then said he did not intend to go on with the examination for discovery until he had seen his own solicitor and asked him what would happen to him if he did not attend the examination after being served and paid the conduct money. Adamson refused to go on with the examination fixed for that day. Subsequently a motion to commit was launched by the solicitors for the plaintiff but this motion appears to have been adjourned from time to time, no doubt by consent of the solicitors for the parties, and the examination for discovery took place some weeks later, Adamson\u2019s own solicitor appearing with him.\nOn January 11th Adamson\u2019s personal solicitor called on the company\u2019s solicitor and gave the information that Adamson had had a couple of girls in the car. On January 13th Adamson, accompanied by his own solicitor, went to the office of the company\u2019s solicitor and gave a full statement. The company\u2019s solicitor immediately notified his client of these facts and, following the receipt of instructions from the company, wrote to Adamson on January 16th, 1936, denying liability under the policy of insurance and notifying Adamson that his firm would not continue the conduct of the defence.\nWhen we originally undertook your defence, we were unaware of the circumstances which we now propose to set up in denying our responsibility for indemnity.\nThe company\u2019s solicitor made inquiries regarding the two girls whose names had been given to him and found no one with the names given to him at the given addresses. On May 12th, 1936, Adamson\u2019s personal solicitor wrote the company\u2019s solicitor (following a telephone conversation between them) that the earlier addresses were incorrect and that the correct addresses were now being given. It was said that there was no intention on Adamson\u2019s part to mislead the company\u2019s solicitor in any way and that the wrong addresses were merely an error.\nFollowing upon the letter of the company\u2019s solicitor to Adamson of January 16th, 1936, above referred to, the appellant company made application to the Master in Chambers to be added as a third party in the action by virtue of subsection (7) added to sec. 183h of The Insurance Act above set out; the order was refused on January 31st but that order was reversed by Middleton, J.A., on February 13th, 1936, and the appellant was added as a third party in the action. The settlement of the formal order of Mr. Justice Middleton did not take place until April 15th. Up until that time the name of the company\u2019s solicitor remained formally on the record as solicitor for Adamson.\nThe trial of the third party issue was a separate trial from that of the original issue in the action between the injured man, Marshall, and Adamson, though both issues were tried by the same judge, Mr. Justice McTague. The learned trial judge dismissed with costs the respondent\u2019s claim for indemnity[3]. The judgment was reversed by a majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[4], which held that the appellant was bound to fully indemnify the respondent against the original judgment and costs.\nIn the meantime, as now appears to us from a reading of the appellant\u2019s factum though the matter was never mentioned to us during the argument, the appellant has paid $5,000 and costs to the plaintiff and the respondent has paid $1,500, the balance of the judgment.\nThe insurance company is now obviously in the position of having to claim the return of its money from the insured, Adamson, though no amendments have been made; in fact, nothing was said about this aspect of the case. The statement is only now noticed in the appellant\u2019s factum (to which no objection was taken by counsel for the respondent) that the insurance company has paid to the plaintiff in the action $5,000 and costs \u201cunder the provisions of sec. 205 of The Insurance Act\u201d. The question whether or not sec. 205 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, chap. 256, really means that an insurance company has to pay, notwithstanding that there may be no liability to its insured, was not even mentioned by any of the counsel on the hearing of the appeal before us. That being so, for the purposes of this appeal we ought not to enter upon the rather difficult question that may be raised in some other case as to what is the proper interpretation of the section. Section 205 was the provision under which the appellant must have felt bound to pay the claimant. That section reads as follows:\n205. (1) Any person having a claim against an insured, for which indemnity is provided by a motor vehicle liability policy, shall, notwithstanding that such person is not a party to the contract, be entitled, upon recovering a judgment therefor against the insured, to have the insurance money payable under the policy applied in or towards satisfaction of his judgment and of any other judgments or claims against the insured covered by the indemnity and may, on behalf of himself and all persons having such judgments or claims, maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money so applied.\n(2) No creditor of the insured shall be entitled to share in the insurance money payable under any such policy in respect of any claim for which indemnity is not provided by the policy.\n(3) (i) No assignment, waiver, surrender, cancellation or discharge of the policy, or of any interest therein or of the proceeds thereof, made by the insured after the happening of the event giving rise to a claim under the policy, and\n(ii) no act or default of the insured before or after such event in violation of the provisions of this Part or of the terms of the contract, and\n(iii) no violation of the Criminal Code or of any law or statute of any province, state or country, by the owner or driver of the automobile, shall prejudice the right of any person, entitled under subsection 1, to have the insurance money applied upon his judgment or claim, or be available to the insurer as a defence to such action.\n(4) The insurer may require any other insurers liable to indemnify the insured in respect of judgments or claims referred to in subsection 1 to be made parties to the action and to contribute rateably according to their respective liabilities, and the insured shall, on demand, furnish the insurer with particulars of all other insurance covering the subject\u2011matter of the contract.\n(5) Where a policy provides for coverage in excess of the limits mentioned in section 202 or for extended coverage in pursuance of section 203, nothing in this section shall, with respect to such excess coverage or extended coverage, prevent the insurer from availing itself, as against any claimant, of any defence which the insurer is entitled to set up against the insured. (6) The insured shall be liable to pay or reimburse the insurer, upon demand, any amount which the insurer has paid by reason of the provisions of this section which it would not otherwise be liable to pay.\n(7) Where an insurer denies liability under a motor vehicle liability policy it shall have the right upon application to the court to be made a third party in any action to which the insured is a party and in which a claim is made by any party to the action for which it is or might be asserted indemnity is provided by the said policy.\nThe minimum coverage provided for by sec. 202 is $5,000 for any one person but the policy in question was for an extended coverage, i.e., up to $10,000 for any one person.\nFor the purposes of this appeal, in view of the attitude taken by counsel for both parties, we shall assume that the real issue before us, as it was argued, is whether or not there was any liability upon the insurance company to indemnify Adamson in respect of the claim arising out of the accident, and, if there was not such liability, then order the respondent Adamson to repay to the appellant company the amount that the company paid to the plaintiff in satisfaction pro tanto of his judgment against Adamson.\nThe Court of Appeal attached considerable significance to the fact that statutory condition 11, found in R.S.O., 1927, chap. 222, sec. 175, was omitted from the statutory conditions as revised in 1932 and now appearing in R.S.O., 1937, chap. 256, sec. 188.\nStatutory condition 11, which was omitted, read as follows:\nAny fraud or wilfully false statement made under oath or in a declaration in relation to any of the above particulars shall vitiate the claim of the person making the declaration in any matter affected by such fraud or false statement.\nBut the effect of statutory condition 11 did not entirely disappear from the Insurance Act. A new and separate section of the Act was added in the revision of 1932 (22 Geo. V, chap. 25) and appears now in Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1937, as sec. 191. This provides:\n191. (1) Where an applicant for a contract falsely describes the automobile to be insured, to the prejudice of the insurer, or knowingly misrepresents or fails to disclose in the application any fact required to be stated therein or where the insured violates any term or condition of the policy or commits any fraud, or makes any wilfully false statement with respect to a claim under the policy, any claim by the insured shall be rendered invalid and the right of the insured to recover indemnity shall be forfeited. Two statutory conditions (sec. 188) relied upon by the appellant appear in and form part of the policy.\n4. (1) The insured shall promptly give to the insurer written notice, with all available particulars, of any accident involving loss or damage to persons or property, and of any claim made on account of accident; shall verify by affidavit or statutory declaration, if required by the insurer, that the claim arises out of the operation or use of an automobile described in the policy and that the person operating or responsible for the operation of the automobile at the time of the accident is a person insured by the policy; and shall forward immediately to the insurer every writ, letter, document or advice received by him from or on behalf of the claimant.\n(2) The insured shall not voluntarily assume any liability or settle any claim except at his own cost. The insured shall not interfere in any negotiations for settlement or in any legal proceeding but, whenever requested by the insurer, shall aid in securing information and evidence and the attendance of any witness, and shall co-operate with the insurer, except in a pecuniary way, in the defence of any action or proceeding or in the prosecution of any appeal.\nThe respondent\u2019s obligation under statutory condition 4 (1) was to give promptly to the insurance company \u201call available particulars\u201d of the accident. That he did not do so is beyond question. He deliberately withheld particulars from the company for several months. I cannot imagine that any competent solicitor engaged in the practice of defending motor accident cases, given the full story and the surrounding facts and circumstances of this case as we now know them, would not at once have made every reasonable and proper effort to effect a settlement of the injured man\u2019s claim to avoid the submission of the story to a jury. It is admitted that the injured man did not know the facts until the examination of the respondent for discovery, which did not take place until several months after the accident. When the full story was known to the injured man, a settlement to the advantage of the respondent and his insurer would obviously become almost impossible in an action in which the injured man would be entitled to a jury. It is highly probable that a settlement of the claim could have been arrived at, at a moderate amount, had the claim been adjusted and settled at once, as it, no doubt, would have been had the insurance company been given promptly all available particulars.\nThe respondent\u2019s further obligation, under statutory condition 4 (2), was to co-operate with the insurer, except in a pecuniary way, in the defence of the action. The con- tention of the respondent, which was accepted by the majority of the Court of Appeal, was that there had been no failure to co-operate with the insurer in the defence of the action within the meaning of the policy. Counsel for the respondent put their submission in their factum this way:\nAn admittedly false statement in a collateral matter made after the accident is retracted and corrected before the insurer had acted in any way upon it. Sufficient information had been supplied to enable the pleadings to be drawn without reference to the insured. Before the examination for discovery is held, the company is in possession of all the facts in ample time to prepare for the trial of the action. It is submitted that on any reasonable test this conduct does not constitute a \u201cfailure to co-operate in the defence of the action.\u201d\nBut \u201cthe defence of the action\u201d necessarily involves in any practical construction or interpretation of the term the opportunity for an early and favourable settlement of the action. It is, in my view, far too narrow a construction to put upon this term of the policy that so long as the insured turns up at the trial, a year or so after the accident, and assists in the defence that he has fulfilled his obligation, notwithstanding such a course of conduct as the respondent adopted in this case during the first two or three months following upon the accident.\nThe respondent clearly violated a term or condition of the contract and by force of sec. 191 his claim was rendered invalid and his right to recover indemnity became forfeited.\nThe respondent, however, invokes the relieving provision, sec. 192 of The Insurance Act, R.S.O., 1937, ch. 256 (formerly sec. 178 as enacted 1932, ch. 25, sec. 2), which is as follows:\nWhere there has been imperfect compliance with a statutory condition as to the proof of loss to be given by the insured or other matter or thing required to be done or omitted by the insured with respect to the loss, and a consequent forfeiture or avoidance of the insurance in whole or in part, and the Court deems it inequitable that the insurance should be forfeited or avoided on that ground, the Court may relieve against the forfeiture or avoidance on such terms as it may deem just.\nHere there was a deliberate failure on the part of the respondent to comply with the statutory conditions requiring him to give promptly all available particulars of the accident and to co\u2011operate in the defence of the action. The learned trial judge exercised his discretion in declining to relieve against the forfeiture, and under all the circumstances of the case he was amply justified, in my view, in so doing, even if the conduct of the respondent in this case could fairly be said to be merely \u201cimperfect compliance\u201d with the statutory conditions, which, under sec. 192, is the only ground upon which the court is given power to relieve.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs throughout.\nCANNON J.\u2014I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Balfour, Drew & Taylor.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smith, Rae, Greer & Cartwright.\n[1] [1937] O.R. 872; [1937] 4 D.L.R. 292.\n[2] [1936] O.R. 394; [1936] 4 D.L.R. 383.\n[3] [1936] O.R. 394; [1936] 4 D.L.R. 383.\n[4] [1937] O.R. 872; [1937] 4 D.L.R. 292.\n"}

Its exercise is not subject to any limitations or restrictions, save (that the power shall be exercised within the prescribed period of one year after the receipt of an authentic copy of the Act by the Governor General.\nThe fact that, as is the practice in some provinces, the Lieutenant-Governor assents to a Bill in the name, not of the Governor General but of His Majesty, does not impair the legal validity of his assent, nor does it affect the said power of disallowance vested in the Governor General in Council.\nPer Duff C.J. and Davis J.: The circumstance that the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor acting under the authority and on behalf of the Crown has been given in a form more august than that prescribed by s. 90 of the B.N.A. Act cannot impair in any way the legal validity of his assent that is expressed as the assent of the Sovereign, which in truth, in point of law, it is and is intended to be; and this practice is of no relevancy touching the law governing the matters now in question, which is to be ascertained from the enactments of the B.N.A. Act.\nAs to that practice (assenting in the name of the King), Kerwin J. was of opinion that it is the correct practice. Crocket J. was inclined to the same opinion. Hudson J. was of opinion that the practice is justified. (All three were of opinion that assent in the Governor General\u2019s name would have the same effect).\nThe power to reserve, for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor General, Bills passed by the legislative assembly or legislative authority of a province, vested in the Lieutenant-Governor by s. 90 of The British North America Act, 1867, is still a subsisting power. Its exercise is not subject to any limitations or restrictions, save that the discretion of the Lieutenant-Governor shall be exercised subject to any relevant provision in his Instructions from the Governor General.\nLiquidators of the Maritime Bank v.

If the answer to question 3 be in the affirmative, is the exercise of the said power of reservation by the Lieutenant-Governor subject to any limitations or restrictions, and if so, what are the nature and effect of such limitations or restrictions?\nThe (unanimous) answers of the Court to the said questions, as certified to His Excellency the Governor General in Council, were as follows:\u2014\n1. The first question referred is answered in the affirmative;\n2. The second question referred is answered in the negative, save that the power of disallowance shall be exercised within the prescribed period of one year after the receipt of an authentic copy of the Act by the Governor General;\n3.

The Government of the Province of Alberta challenged the constitutional right and competency of the Governor General in Council to disallow the legislation, on the ground that the power of disallowance, which the Governor General in Council had professed to exercise, no longer exists. Therefore the above questions 1 and 2 were (by Order in Council, P.C. 2715) referred as aforesaid. The above questions 3 and 4 were added (by Order in Council, P.C. 2802) at the request of the Government of the Province of Alberta.\nDue notice of the hearing of the Reference (in accordance with an order of this Court) was given to the Attorneys-General of the several Provinces of Canada.\nA. Geoffrion K.C., J. Boyd McBride K.C., and C. P. Plaxton K.C. for the Attorney-General for Canada.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. and J. J. Frawley K.C. for the Attorney-General for Alberta.\n(H. A. MacLean attended on behalf of the Attorney-General for British Columbia, but did not take part in the argument).\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The answers to the questions referred to us depend in substance upon the construction of sections 55, 56, 57 and 90 of the British North America Act. We think there is nothing to be gained by a verbal analysis of those sections. The plain effect of section 90 is that\nwhat has been laid down as to the Dominion Parliament in regard to . . . the assent to Bills, the disallowance of Acts, and the signification of pleasure on Bills reserved, is to extend and apply to the Legislatures of the several Provinces as if these provisions were re-enacted and made applicable in terms to the respective Provinces and their Legislatures, with the substitution of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province for the Governor General, of the Governor General for the Sovereign and for a Secretary of State (In re The Initiative and Referendum Act[1]).\nThe alternative construction, in support of which everything that could be said for it with any degree of plausibility was lucidly put before us by Mr. Biggar, involves the conclusion that the Governor General has never possessed authority to disallow provincial legislation; and that the authority of a Lieutenant-Governor to reserve bills presented to him for assent is a power to reserve such bills for the signification of the pleasure of the Sovereign himself and not that of the Governor General.\nThis is a novel view put forward now for the first time since the British North America Act came into force. Many provincial statutes have been disallowed in the period which has elapsed since July 1st, 1867, and bills have been reserved to be dealt with by the Governor General which have been dealt with accordingly; and the regularity of these proceedings has never before been challenged. The power of disallowance by the Governor General has been recognized in at least two judgments of the Privy Council (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[2], and Wilson v. E. & N. Railway Co.[3].)\nOne argument advanced is that the literal construction of section 90 is inconsistent with the reasons for judgment given on behalf of the Judicial Committee by Lord Watson in The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. The Receiver-General of New Brunswick[4] and by Lord Haldane in In re The Initiative and Referendum Act[5]. The question before the Board in the first of those appeals was whether the debt of a bank, in respect of public moneys of a province deposited in the name of the Receiver-General of a province, was entitled to payment in full, over other depositors who were simple contract creditors of the bank, as a Crown debt to which priority attaches by virtue of the prerogative. It was pointed out that previous decisions of the Board had already settled that the territorial rights assigned by section 109 to the provinces became, after the enactment of the B.N.A. Act, vested in Her Majesty as the Sovereign head of the province for the benefit of the province and subject to the control of its legislature. As those decisions rested upon the general recognition of \u201cHer Majesty\u2019s continued sovereignty under the Act of 1867,\u201d it appeared to their Lordships that the revenues of Her Majesty other than territorial revenues, assigned to the provinces by section 126, were vested in the Crown in the same sense. That was the precise point decided, but the judgment of Lord Watson contains an exposition of the relation between the Sovereign and the Provinces which is relied upon by Alberta on this reference. The argument, which appears to have been addressed on behalf of the appellants to their Lordships in that appeal, that the Lieutenant-Governor, neither in legislative nor in executive acts, represented the Crown was rejected on grounds which are summed up in this paragraph (p. 442):\nIt is dear, therefore, that the provincial legislature of New Brunswick does not occupy the subordinate position which was ascribed to it in the argument of the appellants. It derives no authority from the Government of Canada, and its status is in no way analogous to that of a municipal institution, which is an authority constituted for purposes of local administration. It possesses powers, not of administration merely, but of legislation, in the strictest sense of that word; and, within the limits assigned by section 92 of the Act of 1867, these powers are exclusive and supreme. It would require very express language, such as is not to be found in the Act of 1867, to warrant the inference that the Imperial Legislature meant to vest in the provinces of Canada the right of exercising supreme legislative powers in which the British Sovereign was to have no share.\nIn In re The Initiative and Referendum Act[6], the Board had to consider whether legislation which, as it was held, would compel the Lieutenant-Governor to submit a proposed law to a body of voters distinct from the Legislature, and would render him powerless to prevent it becoming an actual law if approved by those voters, was invalid. In the course of the judgment delivered by Lord Haldane on behalf of the Judicial Committee, the judgment and the reasons in The Liquidators of the Maritime Bank case[7] were recognized by the Board as laying down the governing principles in respect of the relation of the Crown to the provinces. In substance, these judgments declare that, in the appointment of a provincial Governor, the Governor General in Council under section 58 is acting as the Executive Government of the Dominion which, by section 9 of the statute, is declared to be vested in the Queen; in other words,\nthe act of the Governor General and his Council in making the appointment is, within the meaning of the statute, the act of the Crown.\nLord Watson proceeds:\na Lieutenant-Governor, when appointed, is as much the representative of Her Majesty for all purposes of provincial government as the Governor General himself is for all purposes of Dominion government (Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. The Receiver-General of New Brunswick[8]).\nThe act of a Lieutenant-Governor in assenting to a bill or in reserving a bill is the act of the Crown by the Crown\u2019s representative just as the act of the Governor General in assenting to a bill or reserving a bill is the act of the Crown. There is nothing, however, in all this in the least degree incompatible with a Lieutenant-Governor reserving a bill for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor General who is the representative of the Crown or in the disallowance of an Act of the Legislature by the Governor General acting on the advice of his Council who, as representing the Sovereign, constitutes the executive government for Canada.\nIt seems proper in this connection to call attention to the functions of the Dominion Government respecting the appointment and the removal of a Lieuteant-Governor. By section 58 of the B.N.A. Act, the Lieutenant-Governor is appointed by the Governor General in Council by instrument under the Great Seal of Canada. His commission runs in the name of the Sovereign, just as the commissions of other great officers of state (appointed by the same authority under such instruments) run in the name of the Sovereign. But his Instructions emanate from the Governor General and it is the Governor General in Council who determines their character; and in assenting to bills, withholding assent, and reserving bills for the signification of the Governor General\u2019s pleasure, he exercises his discretion subject to the Instructions of the Governor General. He holds office during the pleasure of the Governor General (sec. 59). His salary is fixed and provided by the Parliament of Canada.\nIt is true it appears to have been the practice in Alberta and in some of the other provinces, although the practice is not uniform, for the Lieutenant-Governor to assent to bills in the name, not of the Governor General, but of His Majesty. The circumstance, however, that the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor acting under the authority and on behalf of the Crown has been given in a form more august than that prescribed by the statute could not, of course, impair in any way the legal validity of his assent that is expressed as the assent of the Sovereign, which in truth, in point of law, it is and is intended to be; and this practice is of no relevancy touching the law governing these matters which is to be ascertained from the enactments of the B.N.A. Act.\nThat the Lords of the Privy Council did not consider the principles enunciated in the two judgments just discussed implied as a consequence any qualification of the ex facie meaning of section 90 seems to follow from the tenor of the passage quoted in the first paragraph of this judgment from that of Lord Haldane in the later of the two appeals.\nWe come now to the precise questions submitted which are, as to both disallowance and reservation: Is the power still a subsisting power and, if so, is it subject to any limitations or restrictions?\nWe are not concerned with constitutional usage. We are concerned with questions of law which, we repeat, must be determined by reference to the enactments of the British North America Acts of 1867 to 1930, the Statute of Westminster, and, it might be, to relevant statutes of the Parliament of Canada if there were any.\nSection 90 which, with the changes therein specified, re-enacts sections 55, 56 and 57 of the B.N.A. Act, is still subsisting. It has not been repealed or amended by the Imperial Parliament and it is quite clear that, by force of subsection 1 of section 7 of the Statute of Westminster, the Dominion Parliament did not acquire by that statute, any authority to repeal, amend or alter the British North America Acts. Whether or not, by force of section 91 (29) and section 92 (1) of the B.N.A. Act, the Dominion Parliament has authority to legislate in respect of reservation, it is not necessary to consider because no such legislation has been passed.\nThe powers are, therefore, subsisting. Are they subject to any limitation or restriction?\nOnce more, we are not concerned with constitutional usage or constitutional practice. Nor is it necessary to consider whether the Parliament of Canada, though not competent to repeal or amend section 90 of the British North America Act, possesses authority by legislation to dictate the form or the substance of the Instructions to the Lieutenant-Governors as touching the reservation of bills or the rules and principles by which the Governor General is to be guided in exercising the power of disallowance. Here again, there is no pertinent legislation.\nAs to disallowance, it was said in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Wilson v. E. & N. Railway Co.[9], \u201cIt is indisputable that in point of law the authority is unrestricted.\u201d As to reservation, the statute in express terms (section 55, as re-enacted by section 90) imposes on the Lieutenant-Governor the duty to declare either that he assents to a bill presented to him, or that he withholds assent, or that he reserves the bill for the signification of the Governor General\u2019s pleasure. He is to act, the statute says, \u201caccording to his discretion, but subject to the provisions of this Act and to .... Instructions\u201d of the Governor General.\nThere is nothing in the British North America Act controlling this discretion; nor is there any other statute having any relevancy to the matter.\nThe power of reservation is subject to no limitation or restriction, except in so far as his discretion in exercising it may be controlled or regulated by the Instructions of the Governor General and it is not suggested that the Instructions contain anything of that Character.\nThe conclusion, therefore, is that the power of disallowance and the power of reservation are both subsisting powers, and that the former is subject to no limitations or restrictions and the latter only to the restriction that the discretion of the Lieutenant-Governor shall be exercised subject to the Governor General\u2019s Instructions.\nCannon J.\u2014The following questions were referred by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to this Court for hearing and consideration, pursuant to section 55 of the Supreme Court Act:\u2014\n1. Is the power of disallowance of provincial legislation, vested in the Governor General in Council by section 90 of the British North America Act, 1867, still a subsisting power?\n2. If the answer to Question 1 be in the affirmative, is the exercise of the said power of disallowance by the Governor General in Council subject to any limitations or restrictions and, if so, what are the nature and effect of such limitations or restrictions?\n3. Is the power of reservation for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor General of bills passed by the legislative assembly or legislative authority of a province vested in the Lieutenant-Governor by section 90 of the British North America Act, 1867, still a subsisting power?\n4. If the answer to Question 3\u2019 be in the affirmative, is the exercise of the said power of reservation by the Lieutenant-Governor subject to any limitations or restrictions, and if so what are the nature and effect of such limitations or restrictions?\nIt appears that these references were deemed advisable as a result of difficulties between the Dominion and the province of Alberta, following the disallowance by the Governor General of three acts passed on August 6th, 1937, by the legislature of Alberta. The other Provinces, although duly notified, did not take part in the argument.\nAfter hearing counsel for the Dominion and the province, I have without hesitation reached the conclusion that the four questions should be answered respectively as follows:\u2014\nQuestion 1. Yes. The power of disallowance is and remains in full vigour.\nQuestion 2. The power of disallowance by the Governor General in Council is subject to no limitation or restriction whatsoever, save that it has to be exercised within the period of one year after receipt of the Act by the Governor General.\nQuestion 3. Yes. The power of reservation is and remains in full vigour.\nQuestion 4. The exercise of the power of reservation by the Lieutenant-Governor is subject to no limitation or restriction whatsoever, save that the Lieutenant-Governor is, under the terms of sec. 90 of the British North America Act, required to exercise the power \u201caccording to his discretion but subject to the provisions of the said Act and to the Governor General\u2019s instructions.\u201d\nAnd I now proceed to give my reasons for reaching the above conclusions:\u2014\n1. The Province of Alberta having raised the controversy, it may be relevant to note that the Alberta Act, 4-5 Ed. VII (Canada) c. 3, sec. 3, provides as follows:\u2014\n3. The provisions of The British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the province of Alberta in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, as if the said province of Alberta had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by this Act and except such provisions as are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.\n2. The provisions of the British North America Act to be considered read as follows:\u2014\n55. Where a Bill passed by the Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor General for the Queen\u2019s Assent, he shall declare, according to his Discretion, but subject to the Provisions of this Act and to Her Majesty\u2019s Instructions, either that he assents thereto in the Queen\u2019s Name, or that he withholds the Queen\u2019s Assent, or that he reserves the Bill for the Signification of the Queen\u2019s Pleasure.\n56. Where the Governor General assents to a Bill\u2019 in the Queen\u2019s Name, he shall by the first convenient Opportunity send an authentic Copy of the Act to one of Her Majesty\u2019s Principal Secretaries of State, and if the Queen in Council within Two Years after Receipt thereof by the Secretary of State thinks fit to disallow the Act, such Disallowance (with a Certificate of the Secretary of State of the Day on which the Act was received by him) being signified by the Governor General, by Speech or Message to each of the Houses of the Parliament or by Proclamation, shall annul the Act from and after the Day of such Signification.\n57. A Bill reserved for the Signification of the Queen\u2019s Pleasure shall not have any Force unless and until within Two Years from the Day on which it was presented to the Governor General for the Queen\u2019s Assent, the Governor General signifies, by Speech or Message to each of the Houses of the Parliament or by Proclamation, that it has received the Assent of the Queen in Council.\nAn Entry of every such Speech, Message, or Proclamation shall be made in the Journal of each House, and a Duplicate thereof duly attested shall be delivered to the proper Officer to be kept among the Records of Canada.\n90. The following Provisions of this Act respecting the Parliament of Canada, namely,\u2014the Provisions relating to Appropriation and Tax Bills, the Recommendation of Money Votes, the Assent to Bills, the Disallowance of Acts, and the Signification of Pleasure on Bills reserved,\u2014 shall extend and apply to the Legislatures of the several Provinces as if those Provisions were here re-enacted and made applicable in Terms to the respective Provinces and the Legislatures thereof, with the Substitution of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province for the Governor General, of the Governor General for the Queen and for a Secretary of State, of One Year for Two Years, and of the Province for Canada.\n3. Blending the three sections with the directions of sec. 90, we find:\u2014\n(a) Where a Bill passed by the House or Houses of the Legislature is presented to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province for the Governor General\u2019s Assent, he shall declare, according to his Discretion, but subject to the Provisions of this Act and to the Governor General\u2019s Instructions, either that he assents thereto in the Governor General\u2019s Name, or that he withholds the Governor General\u2019s Assent, or that he reserves the Bill for the Signification of the Governor General\u2019s pleasure.\n(b) Where the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province assents to a Bill in the Governor General\u2019s Name, he shall by the first convenient Opportunity send an authentic Copy of the Act to the Governor General, and if the Governor General in Council within One Year after Receipt thereof by the Governor General thinks fit to disallow the Act, such Disallowance (with a Certificate of the Governor General of the Day on which the Act was received by him) being signified by the Lieutenant-Governor, by Speech or Message to the House, or, if more than one, to each of the Houses of the Legislature, or by Proclamation, shall annul the Act from and after the Day of such Signification.\n(c) A Bill reserved for the Signification of the Governor General\u2019s Pleasure shall not have any Force unless and until within One Year from the Day on which it was presented to the Lieutenant-Governor for the Governor General\u2019s Assent, the Lieutenant-Governor signifies by Speech or Message to the House, or, if more than one, to each of the Houses of the Legislature or by Proclamation, that it has received the Assent of the Governor General in Council. An Entry of every such Speech, Message, or Proclamation shall be made in the Journal of the House, or of each House, if more than one, and a Duplicate thereof duly attested shall be delivered to the proper Officer to be kept among the Records of the Province.\n4. It was accepted as common ground, at the hearing, that the statutory provisions are clear and that they are unrepealed. Counsel for Alberta agreed entirely with counsel for the Dominion that, when the directions given by section 90 are carried out in connection with sections 55 to 57, we get a perfectly clear statutory direction. One must reach the conclusion that these provisions must be given full force and effect, unless they have been amended by the Imperial Parliament. Far from doing so, the Statute of Westminster (1931), 22 Geo. V, Imp. ch. 4, sec. 7, enacts:\n7. (1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to (the repeal, amendment or alteration of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or any order, rule or regulation made thereunder.\n(2) The provisions of section two of this Act shall extend to laws made by any of the Provinces of Canada and to the powers of the legislatures of such Provinces.\n(3) The powers conferred by this Act upon the Parliament of Canada or upon the legislatures of the Provinces shall be restricted to the enactment of laws in relation to matters within the competence of the Parliament of Canada or of any of the legislatures of the Provinces respectively.\nIn my opinion these enactments would give new force, if necessary, to the existing provisions of the British North America Act and preserve them. The Imperial Conferences mentioned in the Alberta factum could not and did not purport to change the law. Moreover, the resolutions of these conferences do not apply to the right of the federal government to disallow or to the right of the Lieutenant-Governor to reserve, but to the right of the Governor General to reserve and to the right of the Imperial Government to disallow.\n5. Both powers have been often exercised in practice and the Lieutenant-Governors instructed accordingly. All the jurisprudence that has been quoted is to the same effect.\nThe Judicial Committee, in Wilson v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Ry. Co.[10], said, as regards the federal power of disallowance: \u201cIt is indisputable that in point of law the authority is unrestricted.\u201d How and when the power is to be exercised is a matter to be determined by the Governor General in Council. 6. It may be added, although it is not by itself a decisive consideration, that chapter 2 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta (1922) provides that in case of reservation by the Lieutenant-Governor of a bill for the assent of the Governor General, the clerk of the legislative assembly shall endorse thereon the date when the Lieutenant-Governor has signified that the same was laid before the Governor General and that the Governor General, was pleased to assent to the same. In the case of an Act of the province which has been reserved and afterwards assented to, provisions are made for the coming into force of the legislation.\n7. An additional reason for the preservation of this power of disallowance of provincial statutes is its necessity, more than ever evident, in order to safeguard the unity of the nation. It may become essential, for the proper working of the constitution, to use in practice the principle of an absolute central control which seems to have been considered an essential part of the scheme of Confederation; this control is found in the Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s power of reservation and the Governor General in Council\u2019s power of disallowance.\nCrocket, J.\u2014I take it that questions 1 and 2 submitted on this reference concern only the power of the Governor General in Council to disallow provincial legislation, that is to say, Acts passed by the Legislatures of the several Provinces of Canada, which have been assented to by their respective Lieutenant-Governors. The form of question 1 apparently assumes that s. 90 of the British North America Act vested this power of disallowance in the Governor General in Council and merely asks if that power is still a subsisting power.\nI am of opinion, not only that the clear and indisputable effect of s. 90, as the question assumes, was to vest the power of disallowance of provincial legislation in the Governor General in Council, but am of opinion also that that power still subsists, precisely as it has subsisted since the coming into force of the British North America Act in 1867, unimpaired by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, or any other enactment of the Imperial Parliament. The Statute of Westminster itself expressly declares by s. 7:\u2014\nNothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or any order, rule or regulation made thereunder.\nNone of the British North America Acts passed by the Imperial Parliament after the enactment of the principal Act of 1867, viz: the Act of 1871, c. 28, respecting the establishment of new Provinces in Canada; the Act of 1886, e. 35, as to the representation in the Parliament of Canada of territories not then forming part of any Province but forming part of the Dominion; the Act of 1915, c. 45, increasing the number of senators; the Act of 1916, c. 19, extending the duration of the then existing Parliament of Canada; and the Act of 1930, c. 26, confirming certain agreements between the Government of Canada and the western Provinces, purport to alter in any manner, either the respective legislative powers of the Dominion or of the Provinces, or the administrative prerogative of the Governor General in Council in relation to the disallowance of provincial legislation, as provided for in the principal Act of 1867.\nWhile s. 90 of the British North America Act of 1867 vests the power of disallowance in the Governor in Council by the very inconvenient method of extending and applying to the Legislatures of the several Provinces the provisions of the Act relating to the assent to bills by the Governor General, the disallowance of Acts by the Queen in Council and the signification of pleasure on bills reserved by the Governor General, \u201cas if those provisions were here re-enacted and made applicable in terms to the respective Provinces and the Legislatures thereof, with the substitution of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province for the Governor General, of the Governor General for the Queen and for a Secretary of State, of one year for two years, and of the Province for Canada,\u201d and does not re-produce these provisions as thus altered, the meaning and effect is perfectly clear, as I have said, so far as the power of disallowance is concerned, once those provisions are examined and re-produced with the required substitutions. The only provisions which the Act contains relating to the disallowance of federal Acts are those which are found in s. 56. There may be a question as to whether the intention of s. 90 was to substitute \u201cthe Governor General\u2019s name\u201d for \u201cthe Queen\u2019s name\u201d, concerning the assent to bills in the Legislatures of the Provinces. I am inclined to agree with the conclusion expressed by Dr. Todd in his \u201cParliamentary Government in the British Colonies\u201d (1894) for the reasons stated at p. 440 by that experienced and eminent authority on that subject, as well as for the reason that it has been definitely decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that the Lieutenant-Governor is as much the representative of the Sovereign for all purposes of the Provincial Government as is the Governor General for all purposes of the Dominion Government (see Maritime Bank v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[11], and Bonanza v. The King[12]; and In re The Initiative and Referendum Act[13], that the correct constitutional practice is for the Lieutenant-Governor to assent to or to withhold his assent in the Sovereign\u2019s name. This, however, is a mere matter of form. Whether a Bill is assented to by the Lieutenant-Governor of a Province in the King\u2019s name or in the Governor General\u2019s name, it must be taken to have been assented to in behalf of the Sovereign and to have become an Act which is subject to the exercise of the power of disallowance by the appropriate authority.\nReproducing, then, s. 56 with the substitutions mentioned in s. 90, we have the following provision, which is by the latter section, unmistakably made applicable in terms to the respective Provinces and the Legislatures thereof:\nWhere the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province assents to a Bill in the Queen\u2019s name (or in the Governor General\u2019s name), he shall by the first convenient opportunity send an authentic copy of the Act to the Governor General, and if the Governor General in Council within one year after receipt thereof by the Governor General thinks fit to disallow the Act, such disallowance (with a certificate of the Governor General of the day on which the Act was received by him) being signified by the Lieutenant Governor of the Province by speech or message to the Legislature or by proclamation, shall annul the Act from and after the day of such signification.\nThis provision having been thus written into our constitutional Act as one of the terms of the compact under which the original Provinces agreed to federate, and having been preserved inviolate by the Imperial Parliament to the present day together with all other provisions of the Act in relation to the distribution of legislative power between the Dominion and the Provinces as well as in relation to the executive power of the Dominion and Provincial Governments, as is so significantly emphasized by the express terms of the Statute of Westminster, I think the answer to question 1 must be in the affirmative.\nWith regard to question 2 as to whether the exercise of the power of disallowance of provincial legislation by the Governor in Council is subject to any limitations or restrictions, I am of opinion that, in point of law the authority is unrestricted as was distinctly held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, speaking by my Lord the Chief Justice of Canada, in Wilson v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Co.[14]; and that its exercise by the Governor in Council is subject to no limitation except that which is found in the enactment itself as above reproduced as to the time within which the authority must be exercised and the manner in which the disallowance must be signified, if the latter can properly be said to be a limitation upon the exercise of the power. The enactment plainly applies to any and every bill which becomes an Act of any Provincial Legislature by reason of the Lieutenant-Governor\u2019s assent in behalf of the Sovereign, and the words \u201cand if the Governor General in Council within one year after receipt thereof (i.e. after receipt of an authentic copy of the Act by the Governor General to whom the Lieutenant-Governor is required to send such copy) thinks fit to disallow the Act\u201d distinctly denote an entirely unfettered discretion on the part of the Governor General in Council so far as the exercise of the power of disallowing the Act is concerned, whether the Act be one which may be found to be intra or ultra vires of the Legislature, provided such power is exercised within a year after the receipt of the authentic copy by the Governor General. The last words of the enactment concern only the manner in which the disallowance of the Act is to be signified by the Lieutenant-Governor and made effective by the annulment of the Act from the day of such signification, whether it be by speech or message to the Legislature or by proclamation. We are, of course, concerned here only with legal limitations and restrictions\u2014not with any question of the expediency or inexpediency of the exercise of the power of disallowance in any particular case. That is the responsibility of the Governor in Council entirely.\nQuestions 3 and 4 with regard to the power of reservation for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor General of bills passed by the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Authority of a Province, which latter expression I assume comprises both the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council in any Province, whose constitution still comprises these two separate branches of its Legislature, take substantially the same form as questions 1 and 2 regarding the power of disallowance. They assume that such power of reservation was vested in the Lieutenant-Governors of the Provinces by the same section 90 of the British North America Act, and simply ask if it is still a subsisting power. As I have said with regard to the power of disallowance of provincial statutes, I am of opinion not only that the indisputable and clear effect of s. 90, as questions 3 and 4 assume, was to vest the power of reservation of bills for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor General in the Lieutenant-Governor, but am of opinion also that that power still subsists in the Lieutenant-Governors of the Provinces for the same reasons I have indicated in discussing the power of disallowance, s. 90 extending and applying the provisions of s. 55, regarding the presentation to the Governor General of a bill passed by the two Houses of Parliament for the Queen\u2019s assent, to the Legislatures of the Provinces in the same way as it extends and applies the provisions of s. 56 and with the same substitutions of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province for the Governor General and of the Governor General for the Queen. S. 55 with these substitutions would accordingly read, as applied to the Provincial Legislatures, as follows:\u2014\nWhere a bill passed by the Legislature is presented to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province for the Queen\u2019s (or the Governor General\u2019s) assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to the provisions of this Act and to the Governor General\u2019s instructions, either that he assents thereto in the Queen\u2019s (or the Governor General\u2019s) name, or that he withholds the Queen\u2019s (or the Governor General\u2019s) assent, or that he reserves the bill for the signification of the Governor General\u2019s pleasure.\nThe relevant part of s. 57 with the required substitutions stated in s. 90 would read as follows:\nA Bill reserved for the Signification of the Governor General\u2019s Pleasure shall not have any Force unless and until within One Year from the Day on which it was presented to the Lieutenant-Governor for the Queen\u2019s (or the Governor General\u2019s) Assent, the Lieutenant-Governor signifies, by Speech or Message to the Legislature or by Proclamation, that it has received the Assent of the Governor General in Council.\nThe intention and effect of s. 90, which embodies within it sections 55 and 57 with the above indicated substitutions, to confer upon the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province the power of reservation of bills for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor General is, in my opinion, clear and unmistakable. S. 13 should perhaps also be referred to in this connection. It reads:\u2014\nThe provisions of this Act referring to the Governor General in Council shall be construed as referring to the Governor General acting by and with the advice of the Queen\u2019s Privy Council for Canada.\nI shall, therefore, answer question 3 in the affirmative also.\nAs to question 4, whether the exercise of the said power of reservation by the Lieutenant-Governor is subject to any limitations or restrictions, I am of opinion that there are no limitations or restrictions to the exercise of the said power other than those indicated by the words \u201cbut subject to the provisions of this Act and to the Governor-General\u2019s instructions\u201d contained in the enactment itself.\nKerwin J.\u2014Pursuant to the provisions of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, His Excellency the Governor General in Council referred to this Court, for hearing and consideration, the following questions:\u2014\n1. Is the power of disallowance of provincial legislation, vested in the Governor General in Council by section 90 of the British North America Act, 1867, still a subsisting power?\n2. If the answer to Question 1 be in the affirmative, is the exercise of the said power of disallowance by the Governor General in Council subject to any limitations or restrictions and, if so, what are the nature and effect of such limitations or restrictions? 3. Is the power of reservation for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor General of bills passed by the legislative assembly or legislative authority of a province vested in the Lieutenant Governor by section 90 of the British North America Act, 1867, still a subsisting power?\n4. If the answer to question 3 be in the affirmative, is the exercise of the said power of reservation by the Lieutenant Governor subject to any limitations or restrictions, and if so, what are the nature and effect of such limitations or restrictions?\nSection 90 of the British North America Act, 1867, is as follows:\u2014\n90. The following Provisions of this Act respecting the Parliament of Canada, namely,\u2014the Provisions relating to Appropriation and Tax Bills, the Recommendation of Money Votes, the Assent to Bills, the Disallowance of Acts, and the Signification of Pleasure on Bills reserved,\u2014 shall extend and apply to the Legislatures of the several Provinces as if those Provisions were here re-enacted and made applicable in Terms to the respective Provinces and the Legislatures thereof, with the Substitution of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province for the Governor General, of the Governor General for the Queen and for a Secretary of State, of One Year for Two Years, and of the Province for Canada.\nSections 55, 56 and 57 are the only provisions in the Act relating to \u201cThe Assent to Bills, the Disallowance of Acts, and the Signification of Pleasure on Bills reserved,\u201d and with the substitutions directed to be made by section 90 would read:\u2014\n55. Where a Bill passed by the House or Houses of the Legislature of a Province is presented to the Lieutenant Governor of the Province for the Governor General\u2019s Assent, he shall declare, according to his Discretion, but subject to the Provisions of this Act and to the Governor General\u2019s Instructions, either that he assents thereto in the Governor General\u2019s Name, or that he withholds the Governor General\u2019s Assent, or that he reserves the Bill for the Signification of the Governor General\u2019s Pleasure.\n56. When the Lieutenant Governor of the Province assents to a Bill in the Governor General\u2019s Name, he shall by the first convenient Opportunity send an authentic Copy of the Act to the Governor General, and if the Governor General in Council within One Year after Receipt thereof by the Governor General thinks fit to disallow the Act, such Disallowance (with a Certificate of the Governor General of the Day on which the Act was received by him) being signified by the Lieutenant Governor of the Province, by Speech or Message to the House, or, if more than one, to each of the Houses of the Legislature, or by Proclamation, shall annul the Act from and after the Day of such Signification. 57. A Bill reserved for the Signification of the Governor General\u2019s Pleasure shall not have any Force unless and until within One Year from the Day on which it was presented to the Lieutenant Governor for the Governor General\u2019s Assent, the Lieutenant Governor signifies, by Speech or Message to the House, or, if more than one, to each of the Houses of the Legislature, or by Proclamation, that it has received the Assent of the Governor General in Council.\nAn Entry of every such Speech, Message, or proclamation shall be made in the Journal of the House or of each House, if more than one, and a Duplicate thereof duly attested shall be delivered to the proper Officer to be kept among the Records of the Province.\nThe questions submitted refer in general terms to the power of disallowance of provincial legislation and the power of reservation with reference to Bills passed by the Legislative Assembly or legislative authority of a province. At the date the Act of 1867 came into force, the only provinces to which the substituted provisions could apply were Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, but under the powers reserved by section 146 and in pursuance of the relevant Orders of Her Majesty in Council and of the relevant statutes, Imperial and Dominion, that ensued thereunder, these sections became applicable to the other provinces now forming part of the Dominion. No question was raised, and indeed it would appear that none could be suggested, but that the answers to the questions would apply to all the provinces and it is therefore unnecessary to set forth the various orders in council and statutes by which this conclusion is reached.\nThese sections of the Act (55, 56 and 57 as altered above) are clear and unambiguous and, if this be so, it follows, as stated by Earl Loreburn in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada[15]:\nIn the interpretation of a completely self-governing constitution founded upon a written organic instrument, such as the British North America Act, if the text is explicit the text is conclusive, alike in what it directs and what it forbids.\nIn my opinion, the power to reserve and the power to disallow were explicitly conferred by the terms of the provisions referred to, and on the point as to the original existence of these powers, perhaps nothing more requires to be said except to deal with a suggestion of counsel for the Attorney General of Alberta, referred to later. However, it is a matter of at least historical interest that a survey of the relevant well-known Quebec Resolutions of 1864 and resolutions adopted at the London Conference of 1866 and of the preliminary drafts of the Act, indicates that these provisions carry out the intention of the Fathers of Confederation. From time to time these resolutions and drafts have been referred to in that sense by the Judicial Committee and this Court in construing various sections of the Act.\nThere are set forth at pages 48 and 49 of Pope\u2019s Confederation Documents, Articles 50 and 51 of the Quebec Resolutions. Identical resolutions were adopted at the London Conference as numbers 49 and 50 respectively and are reproduced herewith as they appear at pages 107 and 108 of the same publication:\u2014\n49. Any Bill of the General Parliament may be reserved in the usual manner for Her Majesty\u2019s assent, and any bill of the Local Legislatures may, in like manner, be reserved for the consideration of the Governor General.\n50. Any Bill passed by the General Parliament shall be subject to disallowance by Her Majesty within two years, as in the case of Bills passed by the Legislatures of the said Provinces hitherto, and in like manner any Bill passed by a Local Legislature shall be subject to disallowance by the Governor General within one year after the passing thereof.\nIn order to give effect to these Articles, there was inserted in the rough draft of the Bill to provide for the Union, prepared by the London Conference, section 34, reading as follows:\u2014\n34. The Governor General may disallow any Bill passed by the Local Legislature within one year after the passing thereof, and upon the proclamation thereof by the Governor it shall become null and void; and no Bill which shall be reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the Governor General shall have any force or authority until the Governor General shall signify his assent thereto and proclamation thereof made within the Province by the Governor of the Province for which such Bill has been passed.\nThis provision was expanded in the fourth draft as sections 118, 119 and 120:\u2014\n118. Where a Bill passed is presented to the Lieutenant-Governor for his assent, he shall declare according to his discretion, but subject to the provisions of this Act, either that he assents thereto or that he withholds his consent, or that he reserves the Bill for the signification of the pleasure of the Governor-General.\n119. Where the Lieutenant-Governor assents to a Bill he shall by the first convenient opportunity send an authentic copy of the Act to the Governor-General, and if the Governor-General in Council within one year after the passing thereof, thinks fit to disallow the Act, such disallowance being signified by the Governor-General to the Lieutenant- Governor, or by proclamation, shall annul the Act from and after the day of such signification or proclamation.\n120. A Bill reserved for the signification of the Governor-General\u2019s pleasure shall not have any force unless and until within one year from the day on which it was reserved, the Governor-General signifies to the Lieutenant-Governor, or by proclamation that it has received the assent of the Governor-General in Council; an entry of every such signification or proclamation when transmitted by message from the Lieutenant-Governor, shall be made in the Journals of each House, as the case may be.\nIn the final draft these sections were omitted and in lieu thereof it was provided by section 93:\u2014\nThe provisions of Part V of this Act shall extend and apply to the Legislatures of the several Provinces as if those provisions were here re-enacted and made applicable in terms to the respective Provinces and Legislatures thereof.\nSections 54 to 58, inclusive, comprised Part V, and sections 56, 57 and 58 contained the provisions applicable to the Dominion relating to Assent to Bills, Reservation of Bills, the Disallowance of Acts, and the Signification of Pleasure on Bills reserved. Section 93 of the final draft was the precursor of section 90 as it appears in the Act.\nWe were told that according to the present general practice the Lieutenant Governors of the provinces assent to Bills in the name of the Sovereign and not in the name of the Governor General; and it was suggested by counsel for the Attorney General for Alberta that, to follow the terms of the substituted provisions of section 56, the assent should be in the name of the Governor General. We were also told that this had not always been the practice in each province, and that this is so is indicated in Todd\u2019s Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies, 2nd edition, at page 440. It was the opinion of the author of that book, as indicated on pages 440 and 442, that a Lieutenant Governor should assent to or withhold his assent from Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature in the Sovereign\u2019s name while, if he saw fit to reserve a Bill, it should be declared that the reservation was \u201cfor the signification of the pleasure of His Excellency the Governor General.\u201d\nWith that view I agree. Dealing with the executive power in the Dominion, section 9 of the Act provides:\u2014\nThe Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.\nAs to the legislative power, section 17 provides:\u2014\nThere shall be One Parliament for Canada, consisting of the Queen, an Upper House styled the Senate, and the House of Commons. The Governor General is the representative of the Sovereign for all purposes of the Dominion Government, so that when a Lieutenant-Governor assents to a Bill in the name of the Governor General, he really assents thereto in the name of the Sovereign. To do so directly in the name of the Sovereign is, therefore, strictly in conformity with the terms of its provisions.\nThis view is also consistent with the scheme of Union as exemplified throughout the Act and with the expressions of opinion found in three decisions of the Privy Council which were referred to by counsel for Alberta as well as by counsel for the Attorney General of the Dominion. The first of these is Liquidators of the Maritime Bank v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[16], where the position of a Lieutenant-Governor of a province was clearly defined. The second is Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. Ltd. v. The King[17], where it was pointed out, at page 580, that the earlier decision had dispelled \u201cwhatever obscurity may at one time have prevailed as to the position of a Lieutenant-Governor appointed on behalf of the Crown by the Governor General.\u201d In the third decision, In re The Initiative and Referendum Act[18], it is stated, at page 941, that the Maritime Bank case16 determined:\u2014\nThe Lieutenant-Governor is as much the representative of His Majesty for all purposes of the Provincial Government as is the Governor General for all purposes of the Dominion Government.\nAt page 943 of this third case the judgment continues:\u2014\nWhen the Lieutenant-Governor gives to or withholds his assent from a Bill passed by the Legislature of the province, it is in contemplation of law the Sovereign that so gives or withholds assent.\nWhile in none of these cases were the questions referred to this Court before their Lordships, the opinion I have just expressed appears to be in conformity with the above extracts from their judgments.\nIn any event it could hardly be argued, and in fact was not, that even if the practice in this respect were incorrect, it would render Bills which had been assented to, ineffective as statutes.\nIt was suggested rather than argued that the recommendations of the Imperial Conferences, and particularly the Conference of 1929, with respect to the constitutional practice as to the reservation by the Governor General of Bills passed by the Parliament of Canada, could in some way be relied on to show that the rights of reservation and disallowance with reference to provincial Bills or Acts no longer existed. Whatever the effect of the recommendations adopted at any of the Imperial Conferences (and with that problem we are not concerned), it cannot apply to alter the position as between the Dominion and the Provinces under the terms of the British North America Act.\nThis clearly appears from the Statute of Westminster, 1931, or to give the full title, \u201cAn Act to give effect to certain resolutions passed by Imperial Conferences held in the years 1926 and 1930\u201d. The third recital therein reads:\u2014\nAnd whereas it is in accord with the established constitutional position that no law hereafter made by the Parliament of the United Kingdom shall extend to any of the said Dominions as part of the law of that Dominion otherwise than at the request and with the consent of that Dominion:\nSection 2 is as follows:\u2014\n2. (1) The Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, shall not apply to any law made after the commencement of this Act by the Parliament of a Dominion.\n(2) No law and no provision of any law made after the commencement of this Act by the. Parliament of a Dominion shall be void or inoperative on the ground that it is repugnant to the law of England, or to the provisions of any existing or future Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom, or to any order, rule or regulation made under any such Act, and the powers of the Parliament of a Dominion shall include the power to repeal or amend any such Act, order, rule or regulation in so far as the same is part of the law of the Dominion.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in British Coal Corporation v. The King[19], Lord Sankey, at page 520, remarks:\u2014\nIt is true that before the Statute (Statute of Westminster), the Dominion Legislature was subject to the limitations imposed by the Colonial Laws Validity Act and by s. 129 of the Act (The British North America Act, 1867), and also by the principle or rule that its powers were limited by the doctrine forbidding extra-territorial legislation, though that is a doctrine of somewhat obscure extent. But these limitations have now been abrogated by the Statute. There now remain only such limitations as flow from the Act itself, the operation of which as affecting the competence of Dominion legislation was saved by s. 7 of the Statute, a section which excludes from the competence of the Dominion and Provincial Parliaments any power of \u201crepeal, amendment or alteration\u201d of the Act. But it is well known that s. 7 was inserted at the request of Canada and for reasons which are familiar. The \u201cfamiliar\u201d reasons mentioned by the Lord Chancellor are that a section proposed by the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation and Merchant Shipping Legislation, 1929, to be inserted in the proposed Statute of Westminster in order to make it clear that section 2 and other sections would effect no change in the existing position as between the Dominion and the provinces, was not satisfactory to the latter; and at a Dominion-Provincial Conference held in Ottawa in April, 1931, the terms of what is now section 7 were agreed upon. For present purposes it is sufficient to quote subsection 1 thereof:\u2014\n7. (1) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1930, or any order, rule or regulation made thereunder.\nThese words are so clear that comment or elaboration would appear to be superfluous.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the powers referred to still subsist. Again, while this question has not been considered by the Privy Council, as recently as 1921 it was stated in Wilson v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Co.[20]:\u2014\nIt is indisputable that in point of law the authority (i.e., to disallow) is unrestricted.\nAnd still later, in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada[21], there appears at page 210 a statement that the Governor in Council disallowed a certain provincial Act within a year from the date of its passing \u201cduring which his power of disallowance remained operative.\u201d\nThe circumstances under which the powers referred to may be exercised are matters upon which this Court is not constitutionally empowered to express an opinion since the power of disallowance is granted by the Act to the Governor General in Council and the power of reservation is to be exercised by the Lieutenant-Governor \u201caccording to his Discretion, but subject to the Provisions of this Act and to the Governor General\u2019s Instructions.\u201d\nI would, therefore, answer \u201cYes\u201d to questions 1 and 3, and to question 2,\u2014\u201dThe exercise of the said power of disallowance is subject only to the limitation of one year after the receipt of the Act by the Governor General, within which period the Governor General in Council must determine whether or not to disallow the Act.\u201d So far as I am aware there are no provisions of the British North America Act subject to which the discretion of the Lieutenant-Governor as to reservation is to be exercised, and I would therefore answer question 4,\u2014\u201dThe exercise of the said power of reservation is subject only to the discretion of the Lieutenant-Governor and to the Governor General\u2019s instructions.\u201d\nHudson J.\u2014Section 90 of the British North America Act and the other sections incorporated therewith by reference have not been repealed, so that in the case of Acts passed by the legislature of any province and assented to by the Lieutenant-Governor in the name of the Governor General, there is no room for serious argument. The Governor General could without doubt disallow such Acts and in the case of reserved Bills the matter is equally plain.\nIt appears, however, that the Acts of the Legislature giving rise to this reference were assented to by the Lieutenant-Governor in the name of the King, and in this situation it is argued that under section 90 the power thereby given to the Governor General has no field of operation. It was suggested that any possible alternative inevitably involves some apparent disregard of the words used and that the least possible distortion of the words would appear to be, to omit to make the directed substitution of the \u201cGovernor General\u201d for \u201cthe Queen\u201d and in this way authorize disallowance by the Sovereign, the Governor General being merely a channel of communication for that purpose. It was further argued that the situation would then correspond with the position of Lieutenant-Governors as defined in the Maritime Bank v. Receiver-General[22], Bonanza v. The King[23], and In re The Initiative and Referendum Act[24], where it was said:\nThe Lieutenant-Governor is as much the representative of His Majesty for all purposes of Provincial Government as is the Governor General for all purposes of Dominion Government.\nand\nwhen the Lieutenant-Governor gives to or withholds his assent from a Bill passed by the Legislature of the Province, it is in contemplation of law the Sovereign that so gives or withholds assent. The Quebec and London Resolutions and early draft Bills of the Confederation Act have been quoted and it is not necessary for me to repeat them. They leave no room for doubt that it was intended that the power of disallowance should be vested in the Governor General and that the Lieutenant-Governors should have the power to reserve legislation for the pleasure of the Governor General. In the final drafting of the Bill there seems to have been some sacrifice of clarity for the sake of brevity.\nAfter the Act was passed the practice was adopted in most of the provinces of giving assent to Bills in the name of the Sovereign. This practice was referred to and approved in Todd\u2019s Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies, 1st Ed. (1880), which was then and since has been regarded as standard authority. At page 329 he states:\nIn applying these provisions to the case of Bills passed by the provincial legislatures, constituted under the authority of the British North America Act, we arrive at the following conclusions:\u2014\n(1) That inasmuch as the Act empowers \u201cthe lieutenant-governor\u201d of each province, \u201cin the Queen\u2019s name, by instrument under the Great Seal of the province,\u201d to \u201csummon and call together\u201d the provincial legislature, and as it is a well-understood principle that all parliaments, whether federal or provincial, are opened in the Queen\u2019s name, and by Her governors; and that \u201clegislation is carried on in her name even in provinces, as in Canada, which are directly subordinate to a federal government, instead of to imperial authority,\u201d it necessarily follows that the constitutional practice which for the most part prevails in the several provinces of the Dominion, whereby the lieutenant-governor assents to or withholds his assent from Bills passed by the provincial legislature, \u201cin Her Majesty\u2019s name,\u201d is correct; and that, in this particular, we are not warranted in substituting the name of \u201cthe Governor General\u201d for that of \u201cthe Queen.\u201d\n(2) That nevertheless, whenever, \u201caccording to his discretion,\u201d the lieutenant-governor shall see fit to \u201creserve\u201d a Bill presented to him for the royal assent, he should declare that he reserves the same \u201cfor the signification of the pleasure of His Excellency the Governor General,\u201d inasmuch as, in such a case, it is manifestly intended by the British North America Act that the term \u201cgovernor general\u201d should be substituted for that of \u201cthe Queen,\u201d as indicating the functionary by whom, under such circumstances, the assent or dissent of the Crown is to be declared. This is the interpretation which is put upon the Act by constitutional practice in all the Dominion provinces. And the soundness of this conclusion is confirmed by the obvious intendment of the Act, in regard to the disallowance of provincial Acts as hereinafter stated.\n(3) That, whenever the lieutenant-governor shall have assented in the Queen\u2019s name to a Bill passed by the provincial legislature, it becomes his duty promptly to forward a copy thereof to the Governor General, in order that if the Governor General in Council should see fit, within one year after the receipt of the said Act, to disallow the same, such disallowance may be duly notified to the provincial authorities concerned therein. This also is in accordance with constitutional practice in the Dominion provinces.\n(4) And finally, with respect to provincial Bills which have been reserved for the signification of the Governor General\u2019s pleasure, it is clear that no such Bill can have any force, or go into operation, unless and until, within one year from the date of its being reserved by the lieutenant-governor, the Governor General shall intimate that the same has received the assent of the Governor General in Council; and an entry of such formal announcement shall be kept in the records and legislative journals of the particular province.\nThis practice has been continued by these provinces up to the present time. During all of this period, numerous Acts passed by legislatures and assented to by Lieutenant-Governors in the name of the Sovereign have been disallowed by the Governor General, and many Acts passed by legislatures and submitted to Lieutenant-Governors for their assent in the King\u2019s name have been reserved for the pleasure of the Governor General. The right of disallowance by the Governor General has, on many occasions, been recognized by the courts in the provinces, by this Court and also by the Privy Council, although it does not appear that in any of these cases the point raised by Mr. Biggar has heretofore been made. Some of the provincial legislatures, and notably Alberta itself, have by their own legislation recognized this procedure.\nA rewriting of section 90 to incorporate therein a right of disallowance reserved to the Sovereign, to be finally exercised in London and not in Ottawa, would be contrary to the uniform practice existing since Confederation and a violation of the clear intention of Parliament.\nIn none of the decisions of the Privy Council dealing with the position of Lieutenant-Governors do their Lordships consider the possible effect of section 90. In any event it is not necessarily inconsistent to hold that an assent by a Lieutenant-Governor is the act of the Sovereign, and at the same time to hold that such act is subject to the right to a subsequent veto by another representative of the Crown.\nThe assent of the Lieutenant-Governor is the essential act to enable the Governor General to exercise the power of disallowance, and in the application of section 90 it matters not whether the Lieutenant-Governor purports to give his assent in the name of the King or of the King\u2019s representative at Ottawa. I am of the opinion, (1) that the practice adopted of Lieutenant-Governors assenting to Bills in the name of the Sovereign is justified; (2) that nevertheless the power to disallow still remains in the Governor General. The questions submitted should be answered as follows:\nQuestion 1. Yes.\nQuestion 2. The power of disallowance by the Governor General in Council is subject to no limitation or restriction if exercised within the prescribed period of one year.\nQuestion 3. Yes.\nQuestion 4. The exercise of the power of reservation by the Lieutenant-Governor is subject to no limitation or restriction, save that the discretion of the Lieutenant-Governor shall be exercised subject to any relevant provision in his Instructions from the Governor General.\nThe (unanimous) answers of the Court to the questions referred, as certified to His Excellency the Governor General in Council, are set out on p. 73 ante.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W.

On the form of income tax return for 1933, the appellant set out, for the purpose of an allowance for depreciation, the value of machinery and other equipment at $168,458.72, and the amount of depreciation claimed was $17,255.55. Such equipment had been purchased by the appellant from another company bearing the same name and having the same shareholders as the appellant company. The amount of depreciation was totally disallowed, except for a small amount of $255.08 in respect of three new motor cars, by the Commissioner of Income Tax, acting on behalf of the Minister of National Revenue, on the ground that, as the company who had sold the machinery and equipment had been allowed over a period of years approximately 100% depreciation in their work values, the appellant was not entitled to any deduction for depreciation upon the same machinery and equipment. Section 5 of the Income War Tax Act provides that \u201c\u2018Income\u2019 * * * shall * * * be subject to\u201d, as exemption and deduction, \u201csuch reasonable amount as the Minister, in his discretion, may allow for depreciation * * *.\u201d Upon appeal, the Exchequer Court of Canada affirmed the decision of the Minister of National Revenue.\nHeld, The Chief Justice and Davis J. dissenting, that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.\nPer Crocket and Hudson JJ.\u2014The provisions of the relevant sections of the Income War Tax Act indicate that it was the intention of Parliament that there should be no depreciation allowance unless the Minister of National Revenue, in his sole discretion, decided that there should be. In this case, the Minister has exercised his discretion and the statute does not define or limit the field for operation of such discretion. Per Kerwin J.\u2014The discretion conferred upon the Minister by section 5 of the Act has been exercised without disregarding any statutory provision; and there is no ground upon which his determination may be challenged.\nPer The Chief Justice and Davis J. (dissenting): The ground upon which the Commissioner of Income Tax put his denial of any amount of depreciation was not a proper ground upon which to exercise the discretion that has been vested in the Minister. The Commissioner was not entitled, in the absence of any fraud or improper conduct, to disregard the separate legal existence of the appellant company, which was a new owner for all legal purposes; and its predecessor\u2019s depreciation allowance is immaterial when considering what is a reasonable amount to be allowed for its own depreciation. The decision of the Minister was not a legitimate exercise of the discretion which Parliament vested in him. The discretion granted by the statute to the Minister involves an administrative duty of a quasi-judicial character and is a discretion to be exercised on proper legal principles. The Commissioner, acting for the Minister, having exercised such discretion upon principles wrong in law, the case should be remitted to the reconsideration by the Minister of the subject-matter, stripped of the application of these wrong principles.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1938] Ex. C.R. 18) affirmed, The Chief Justice and Davis J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J., dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue confirming the appellant\u2019s assessment under the Income War Tax Act for the fiscal period of appellant ending March 31st, 1933.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nMartin Griffin K.C. for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and J. R. Tolmie for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Davis J. (dissenting) was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014The appellant is a company which was incorporated under the Companies Act of British Columbia on the 23rd day of March, 1932, with its head office and principal place of business in the city of Vancouver, where it carries on a laundry and dry cleaning business. The company is a taxpayer within the definition of that word in the (Dominion) Income War Tax Act, R.S.C., 1927, chap. 97 and amendments. As in duty bound it made its income tax return to the Government for its fiscal year that ended March 31st, 1933. On the form of return supplied by the Income Tax Department and required to be filled in and returned, the appellant set out, for the purpose of an allowance for depreciation, the value of the company\u2019s machinery at $146,690.13, furniture and fixtures at $5,740.74, horses and wagons at $1,352.50, and automobiles at $14,675.35; and in its said return the appellant claimed deductions for depreciation according to the customary percentages which were being allowed by the Department: 10% on machinery, horses and wagons, furniture and fixtures; and 20% on automobiles. The total amount of depreciation claimed amounted to $17,255.55. The amount was totally disallowed, with the exception of $255.08 in respect of three new motor cars which had been purchased by the appellant.\nThe correctness of values of the machinery and other equipment as set out in the return was not questioned by the Department. By sec. 80 of the Income War Tax Act,\nAny person making a false statement in any return or in any information required by the Minister, shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars or to six months\u2019 imprisonment, or to both fine and imprisonment.\nNo fraud or improper conduct was alleged against the appellant. What was said against the appellant was that the machinery and other equipment (save and except the three new motor cars) had been purchased by the appellant from another company, Home Service Company Limited, and that the latter company in turn had purchased the same from the liquidator of still another company (hereinafter for convenience called \u201cthe first company\u201d), which had had the same name as the appellant company, and that the shareholders of the appellant are the same persons as the shareholders of the first company (which had gone into voluntary liquidation) and that as the first company had been allowed over a period of years, approximately 100% depreciation on its book values of the said machinery and equipment, the present company, appellant, is not entitled to any deduction for depreciation upon the same machinery and equipment.\nFurther, it was said against the appellant that it set up its assets on its books at a greater sum than that at which the same assets had been carried on the books of the first company. The appellant does not deny that. It was proved in evidence that the figures which the appellant set up in its books as the value of the assets in question were the same as the prices which had been fixed by an independent appraisal as the purchase price of the machinery and equipment when purchased by the appellant from the said Home Service Company Limited. The appellant admitted that these amounts were greater than the amounts at which the same assets had been carried on the books of the first company\u2014but, it said, that was no concern of its. What is suggested is that the first company had carried these assets on its books for years, in fact prior to the coming into existence of a Dominion income tax in 1917, at valuations much below their real value, in consequence of which the allowance for depreciation to that company, on the ordinary percentage basis that had been adopted by the Department, had become exhausted.\nThe appellant is a separate legal entity. The Government looks to it as such as a taxpayer and has assessed it for income tax. What then are its rights? It is taxable upon its \u201cincome,\u201d which by sec. 3 of the Act means its \u201cannual net profit or gain.\u201d Now the annual net profit or gain of a commercial corporation cannot fairly be arrived at without taking into account depreciation in its machinery and equipment due to the ordinary wear and tear during the year. While sec 6 (b) of the Act provides that in computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed a deduction is not to be allowed in respect of any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, \u201cexcept as otherwise provided in this Act,\u201d sec. 5 had provided that\n\u201cIncome\u201d as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) Such reasonable amount as the Minister, in his discretion, may allow for depreciation, * * *\nIt was under this sec. 5 that the Minister of National Revenue disallowed entirely the deduction claimed from gross profits in respect of depreciation of the machinery and equipment.\nThe decision of the Minister was in fact the decision of the Commissioner of Income Tax whom the Minister, purporting to act under and by virtue of the provisions of the Act and particularly sec. 75 thereof, had authorized to exercise the powers conferred by the said Act upon the Minister as fully and effectively as he could do himself, he being of the opinion that such powers may be more conveniently exercised by the said Commissioner of Income Tax. Counsel for the appellant took no objection to the fact that the decision was that of the Commissioner and not that of the Minister.\nThe grounds for denying any depreciation on the said machinery and equipment to the appellant were very frankly and fairly stated in the decision, as follows:\nThe Honourable the Minister of National Revenue, having duly considered the facts as set forth in the Notice of Appeal and matters thereto relating hereby affirms the said assessment on the ground that while the company was incorporated and commenced operations during the year 1932 there was no actual change in ownership of the assets purchased or taken over from Pioneer Investment Company Limited by Home Service Company Limited (of which the taxpayer is a subsidiary) and set up in the books of the taxpayer a,t appreciated values; that in the exercise of the statutory discretion, a reasonable amount has been allowed for depreciation and that the assessment is properly levied under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act.\nNotice of such decision is hereby given in accordance with section 59 of the said Act.\nDated at Ottawa this 30th day of May, A.D. 1935.\nR. C. MATTHEWS,\nMinister of National Revenue.\nper C. F. ELLIOTT,\nCommissioner of Income Tax.\nThe appellant was entitled to an exemption or deduction in \u201csuch reasonable amount as the Minister, in his discretion, may allow for depreciation.\u201d That involved, in my opinion, an administrative duty of a quasi-judicial character\u2014a discretion to be exercised on proper legal principles. Section 60 of the Act entitles a taxpayer, after receipt of the decision of the Minister upon appeal from an assessment, if dissatisfied therewith, to appeal to the Court. The decision is appealable; but the exercise of the discretion will not be interfered with unless it was manifestly against sound and fundamental principles.\nThe Commissioner of Income Tax put his denial of any amount for depreciation on the said machinery and equipment upon the ground that \u201cthere was no actual change of ownership of the assets\u201d and they were \u201cset up in the books of the taxpayer at appreciated values.\u201d In my view that was not a proper ground upon which to exercise the discretion that had been vested in the Minister. The Commissioner was not entitled, in the absence of any fraud or improper conduct, to disregard the separate legal existence of the company and to inquire as to who its shareholders were and at what figures these assets had been carried on the books of some other individual, partnership or corporation. In the words of Lindley J. (as he then was) in Ryhope Coal Company, Ltd. v. Foyer[1]:\nThis company was incorporated and formed on the 21st of December, 1875, under the Companies Act of 1862, by persons who had for many years previously carried on and worked the colliery which the company was formed to continue to work and carry on. The Income Tax Commissioners have assessed the company upon the principle that the company is in substance, and for legal purposes, the same as the old partners. In my opinion, at starting, that cannot be right in point of law. a company incorporated under the Act of 1862 is for no legal purpose the same as the persons who have become a corporation with distinct rights and distinct liabilities, and whether the shares are bought by those who form it seems to me for that purpose utterly immaterial; and I think, therefore, the principle on which the Commissioners have proceeded from first to last in assessing this corporation of five, six, or seven old partners, is to be regarded as erroneous and fundamentally wrong.\nThe appellant was a new owner for all legal purposes and its predecessor\u2019s depreciation allowance is immaterial when considering what is a reasonable amount to be allowed for its own depreciation. What is virtually said here against the appellant is\u2014You are entitled to nothing because the beneficial ownership of your company is the same as the beneficial ownership of another company from which, indirectly, you purchased your machinery and equipment and we are entitled to look right through your legal existence and say that you are entitled to nothing at all for depreciation on your machinery and equipment.\nIn my view that is not a legitimate exercise of the discretion which Parliament vested in the Minister. I have not the slightest doubt that the Commissioner was as anxious to do justice as I am, but the public have been given the right to appeal to the court from the decision of the Minister and if the court is of the opinion that in a given case the Minister or his Commissioner has, however unintentionally, failed to apply what the court regards as fundamental principles, the court ought not to hesitate to interfere. I confess that I am influenced in this case by the insistence of many great judges upon the full recognition of the separate legal entity of a joint stock company and the impropriety in dealing with its affairs of ignoring its legal status as if it had never been incorporated and organized. And as to the familiar argument that we ought always to look \u201cat the substance\u201d of the thing, I shall only refer to the words of Lord Tomlin in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. The Duke of Westminster[2]:\nApart, however, from the question of contract with which I have dealt, it is said that in revenue cases there is a doctrine that the court may ignore the legal position and regard what is called \u201cthe substance of the matter,\u201d and that here the substance of the matter is that the annuitant was serving the Duke for something equal to his former salary or wages, and that therefore, while he is so serving, the annuity must be treated as salary or wages. This supposed doctrine (upon which the Commissioners apparently acted) seems to rest for its support upon a misunderstanding of language used in some earlier cases. The sooner this misunderstanding is dispelled, and the supposed doctrine given its quietus, the better it will be for all concerned, for the doctrine seems to involve substituting \u201cthe incertain and crooked cord of discretion\u201d for \u201cthe golden and streight metwand of the law\u201d (4 Inst. 41). Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax. This so-called doctrine of \u201cthe substance\u201d seems to me to be nothing more than an attempt to make a man pay notwithstanding that he has so ordered his affairs that the amount of tax sought from him is not legally claimable.\nLord Loreburn in the House of Lords in Leeds Corporation v. Ryder[3], said that the justices there were acting \u201cadministratively, for they are exercising a discretion which may depend upon considerations of policy and practical good sense\u2014and they must, of course, act honestly. That is the total of their duty.\u201d But that was a certiorari proceeding and the Licensing Act under consideration \u201cexpressly leaves\u201d as Lord Loreburn observed,\nto the discretion of the justices whether they will grant licences or not to persons whom they deem fit and proper persons.\nThat was, of course, quite a different case from the appeal now before us. Here the Minister was to say what was \u201ca reasonable amount\u201d to be allowed for depreciation and he says, in effect\u2014nothing. The statute expressly gives the taxpayer a right of appeal from the Minister\u2019s decision. In The Queen v. Vestry of St. Pancras[4], a metropolitan vestry had a discretion by a statute not merely as to granting or refusing a superannuation allowance to a retiring officer, but also, if an allowance were granted, as to the amount, subject to the scale of maximum allowance prescribed by the statute. Lord Esher, at p. 375, said:\nIf people who have to exercise a public duty by exercising their discretion take into account matters which the Courts consider not to be proper for the guidance of their discretion, then in the eye of the law they have not exercised their discretion.\nThe Income War Tax Act gives a right of appeal from the Minister\u2019s decisions and while there is no statutory limitation upon the appellate jurisdiction, normally the Court would not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by the Minister except on grounds of law. But here the Commissioner, acting for the Minister, did exercise a discretion upon what I consider to be wrong principles of law and it is the duty of the Court in such circumstances to remit the case, as provided by sec. 65 (2) of the Act, for a reconsideration of the subject-matter, stripped of the application of these wrong principles.\nI would therefore allow this appeal, set aside the assessment and the judgment appealed from and refer the matter back to the Minister. The appellant should have its costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014The appellant company in its income tax return for the fiscal period ending March 31st, 1933, claimed a depreciation allowance of $17,775.55. The Minister, on an appeal to him, disallowed this claim with the exception of $255.08, and an appeal from his decision to the Exchequer Court of Canada was dismissed.\nThe appellant contends (1) that under section 5 (6) of the Income War Tax Act the Minister is obliged to make some allowance for depreciation; and (2) that, in consequence of certain directions issued by him from time to time to inspectors of income tax, such allowance should be on a percentage basis as therein specified.\nThe Minister, on the other hand, contends that under section 5 he has an unfettered discretion to allow or disallow any claim in respect of depreciation, and moreover that in the present case the appellant company, although technically a different legal entity from a former company of the same name is in reality the alter ego of the old company, having the same name, the same shareholders, the same assets for few exceptions and no new capital, and that the old company had already been allowed a total of 100% depreciation in respect of the assets in question, and under these circumstances that he, the Minister, had not acted unreasonably.\nThe relevant provisions of the Act are as follows: the charging section is no. 9:\n9. There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year, of every person (a) residing or ordinarily resident in Canada during such year;\n* * *\n2. Save as herein otherwise provided, corporations and joint stock companies, no matter how created or organized, shall pay a tax upon income at the rate applicable thereto set forth in the first schedule of this Act.\nSection 3 defines income as the annual net profit or gain. Section 6 provides:\n6. In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n* * *\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\nSection 5:\n5. \u201cIncome\u201d as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\n(a) Such reasonable amount as the Minister, in his discretion, may allow for depreciation.\nReading these sections by themselves and without reference to any outside authorities, it would seem fairly plain that it was the intention of Parliament that there should be no depreciation allowance unless the Minister, in his sole discretion, decided that there should be. There is nothing anywhere to indicate the principle or basis on which the depreciation allowance is to be ascertained. It might vary according to different accounting methods, different economic theories, different general business conditions in the country. Nor is there anything in the statute which denies a right in the Minister to look beyond the legal facade for the purpose of ascertaining the realities of ownership or the possibilities of schemes to avoid taxation, and it would seem to be that it was the intention of Parliament that the Minister, and he alone, could properly estimate these different factors.\nThe authorities cited on behalf of the appellant are mostly of statutes, somewhat differently worded from ours, and in effect hold no more than that where the statute gives a discretion to administrative officers and provides an area in time or space for the exercise of such discretion, the Commissioners must take that into account. In the present case, the Minister has exercised his discretion and, as already stated, the statute does not define or limit the field for operation of such discretion.\nThe second point raised by the appellant need not be discussed. The regulations referred to turned out to be merely directions given to local officers of the department for their general guidance and could not be considered as any general rule binding in any way on the Minister. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014By subsection 1 of section 9 of the Income War Tax Act a tax is to be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person therein described. By section 2 (h) \u201cperson\u201d includes any body corporate and politic, and by subsection 2 of section 9 corporations and joint stock companies are to pay the tax at the rate applicable, as set forth in the First Schedule. As applicable to this appeal, section 3 defines \u201cincome\u201d as the annual net profit or gain from any trade, manufacture or business. The relevant parts of section 6 provide:\nIn computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n* * *\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act;\nThe only provision for an allowance for depreciation is contained in section 5 whereby income, for the purposes of the Act, shall be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) Such reasonable amount as the Minister, in his discretion, may allow for depreciation * * *\nIn the present case the Minister has made an allowance of $255.08 (as to which no question arises) and has given his reasons for not allowing the balance of the appellant\u2019s claim for depreciation as appears from the following extract from his decision:\u2014\nThe Honourable the Minister of National Revenue, having duly considered the facts as set forth in the Notice of Appeal and matters thereto relating hereby affirms the said assessment on the ground that while the company was incorporated and commenced operations during the year 1932 there was no actual change in ownership of the assets purchased or taken over from Pioneer Investment Company Limited by Home Service Company Limited (of which the taxpayer is a subsidiary) and set up in the books of the taxpayer at appreciated values; that in the exercise of the statutory discretion, a reasonable amount has been allowed for Depreciation and that the assessment is properly levied under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act.\nIt appears that the discretion conferred upon him by section 5 has been exercised without disregarding any statutory provision and I can find no ground upon which his determination may be challenged.\nThe English cases referred to by counsel for the appellant do not appear to me to assist in the determination of the matter. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Griffin, Montgomery & Smith.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. S.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nAlfred Watson (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1933: May 26; 1933: December 12.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Cannon, Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nNegligence\u2014Shipping\u2014Maritime law\u2014British ship\u2014Accident to member of crew\u2014High seas\u2014Port of registration\u2014Defence of common employment\u2014Conflict of laws\u2014Which law applicable\u2014Section 265 of the Merchants\u2019 Shipping Act (Imperial), 1894\u2014Jury trial\u2014Verdict\u2014Ascertaining its meaning\u2014Intention of the jurors\u2014Answer to question\u2014 Terms not clearly enunciated\u2014New trial.\nThe respondent, while a member of the crew of the ss. Cornwallis, owned by the appellant company, met with an accident on November 6th, 1935. The Cornwallis was a British vessel registered at Vancouver, B.C., and at the time of the accident was proceeding from the West Indies to Charlottetown, P.E.I. The respondent, a carpenter on board the vessel, who had been hired in Montreal, was engaged with other members of the crew in putting locking bars on the hatches. While so engaged, about one hundred miles off Bermuda, a wave crashed onto the deck, swept the respondent against the bulkhead and hatch combings and caused injuries for which the action was brought. The jury found the accident to be due to the fault of the appellant in the following language: \u201cQuestion: Was the said accident due to the fault of the defendant; if so, state in what said fault consisted? Answer: Yes (unanimous). If the Chief Officer, Lieutenant Scott, had ordered life lines erected earlier the accident might have been avoided.\u201d The trial judge, on the finding of the jury, ordered judgment to be entered for the respondent, and this judgment was affirmed on appeal. The appellant\u2019s grounds of defence was a denial of negligence, and, alternatively that, if there was any, it was the negligence of a fellow servant from which under the common law of England, which was applicable, no cause of action arose.\nHeld that there should be a new trial.\nPer The Chief Justice and Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\u2014The answer of the jury to the question submitted to them should be read as a whole; and, if so read, the meaning of the verdict is not sufficiently free from obscurity to enable one to conclude that the jury have found or intended to find the existence of a causal nexus between the fault and the injury to the respondent. The second sentence of the answer, in which the nature of the fault is explained, does seem to be concerned not only with the character of the fault, but with the relation between the fault and the accident as well. If the jury intended, by answering the first question in the affirmative, to say, with an appreciation of the purport of the words, that the accident was due (i.e., caused by) the fault of the appellant, it is difficult to understand how the jury could have used the language they do employ in the second sentence.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The finding of the jury was unsatisfactory. The verdict seems to be based not on a fact of which the jurymen were convinced, but on a probability or a possibility. The verdict is not sufficient to create the certainty required to connect the injuries suffered by the respondent with the alleged negligence or omission of the officer to order life lines erected earlier.\nPer The Chief Justice and Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\u2014In an action brought in the province of Quebec for damages in respect of personal injuries due to a tortious act committed outside that province, it is essential, as a first condition, that the plaintiff prove an act or default actionable by the law of Quebec; and in order to fulfil the second condition necessary for his right to recover, i.e., to establish that the tort charged is non-justifiable by the lex loci delicti, the plaintiff is entitled to pray in aid a presumption which is a presumption of law, viz., that the general law of the place where the alleged wrongful act occurred is the same as the law of Quebec. Where a defendant relies upon some differences between the law of the locality and the law of the forum, the onus is upon him to prove it. The provisions of section 265 of the Merchants\u2019 Shipping Act, 1894, apply to this case. It was the duty of the trial judge to apply the law of Quebec unless that law or some law of the Imperial Parliament or competently enacted law of the Parliament of Canada prescribed another rule. But a conflict of law appeared within the meaning of that section when it became apparent that the trial judge had to determine whether it was his duty to follow the rules of the law of Quebec or rules derived from some other system of jurisprudence. Therefore the lex loci delicti was the law of the port of registry, i.e., the law of British Columbia; and the trial judge was entitled to assume that that law was the same as the law of Quebec.\nPer Cannon J.\u2014The law applicable to this case is the law of Quebec. Lex fori was the law of Quebec; lex loci contractus was also the law of Quebec, because the respondent was engaged in Montreal. The lex loci commissi delicti would be either the law of England or that of the port of registration: the latter was not pleaded and the defence of common employment, under the law of England, was not established and was not put to the jury.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Greenshields C.J., with a jury[1], which had maintained the respondent\u2019s action for an amount of $4,000.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nI. C. Rand K.C. for the appellant.\nA. I. Smith and H. H. Harris for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014It is now settled that, in an action brought in the province of Quebec for damages in respect of personal injuries due to a tortious act committed outside that province, the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover rests upon the fulfilment of two conditions. These conditions are stated in the following passage in the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Carr v. Fracis Times & Co.[2]:\nIn the first place, the wrong must be of such a character that it would have been actionable if committed in England; and, secondly, the act must not have been justifiable by the law of the place where it was committed.\n\u201cJustifiable\u201d here refers to legal justification; and an act or neglect which is neither actionable nor punishable cannot be said to be otherwise than \u201cjustifiable\u201d within the meaning of the rule (Walpole v. Canadian Northern Railway)[3].\nThat this rule prevails in Quebec results from O\u2019Connor v. Wray[4].\nIt is essential that the plaintiff prove an act or default actionable by the law of Quebec. While it is also part of his case to establish that the tort charged is non-justifiable by the lex loci delicti in the sense mentioned, he is entitled to pray in aid a presumption which is a presumption of law, viz., that the general law of the place where the alleged wrongful act occurred is the same as the law of Quebec. Where a defendant relies upon some difference between the law of the locality and the law of the forum the onus is upon him to prove it. (The Parchim)[5]; Dynamit Actien-Gesellschaft v. Rio Tinto Co. Ltd.[6].\nIn practice, it appears to have been treated as matter of defence for the purposes of pleading as well as proof. (The M. Moxham[7]; Carr Times & Co. v. Fracis[8], per Lord Lindley). Statements of textwriters of a seemingly contrary import must be read in light of this consideration e.g., Cheshire, Private International Law, 306).\nThe alleged wrong was committed on board the ss. Cornwallis, a British ship owned by the appellants and registered in Vancouver. The tort, as the jury found, consisted in the negligent omission of the chief officer to order the erection of life lines at the proper time.\nAmong other defences, the appellants pleaded that the law governing the liability of the appellants for acts done by the officers and crew on board the ship was the common law of England; and that, by the common law of England, the appellants were not legally responsible to the respondent for the negligence of his fellow servant, the chief officer, in the course of his duties as such. At the trial, the appellants after verdict moved on this ground for judgment non obstante veredicto. On behalf of the respondent, the application was answered by reference to section 265 of the Merchants\u2019 Shipping Act (Imperial), 1894, which is in these words:\n265. Where in any matter relating to a ship or to a person belonging to a ship there appears to be a conflict of laws, then, if there is in this Part of this Act any provision on the subject which is hereby expressly made to extend to that ship, the case shall be governed by that provision; but if there is no such provision, the case shall be governed by the law of the port at which the ship is registered.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court[9] who tried the action held that the section applied, that the law applicable was the law of British Columbia; and that, on the state of the record and the evidence, he was bound to give judgment on the assumption that the law of British Columbia is the same as the law of Quebec. The Court of King\u2019s Bench agreed with the learned trial judge.\nI think the learned Chief Justice was right in holding that section 265 of the Merchants\u2019 Shipping Act applies. It was the duty of the learned Chief Justice to apply the law of Quebec unless that law or some law of the Imperial Parliament or competently enacted law of the Parliament of Canada prescribed another rule. I think a conflict of law appeared within the meaning of the section when it became apparent that the trial judge must determine whether it was his duty to follow the rules of the law of Quebec or rules derived from some other system of jurisprudence. I think, moreover, that this class of case is within the scope of the section, and that the law applicable for determining it is the law of the place of registry.\nI have not overlooked the doubt which has been expressed whether for the present purpose a wrong committed upon a ship on the high seas stands in the same relation to the law of the flag as that in which a wrong committed on land within the territory of another jurisdiction stands to the jurisprudence which exclusively prevails there. Having given the matter the best consideration I am capable of, I think the effect of this section is that the lex loci delicti is the law of British Columbia. We are not concerned with the question whether, if section 265 had no application, the learned trial judge ought to have dismissed the action upon the application of the appellants.\nIn this Court the appellants contended that the field of jurisprudence concerned with the responsibility of ship owners for the negligent acts of the ship\u2019s officers in the management of the ship is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament in respect of Navigation and Shipping and, there being no Dominion legislation dealing with the matter, the common law applies and British Columbia legislation is irrelevant. I am unable to agree with this view. It is inconsistent with the judgment in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[10]. In the absence of Dominion or Imperial legislation on the subject or of some special rule of law relating to navigation and shipping prevailing at the date of Confederation, the general rules of the law of British Columbia applicable to the responsibility of masters for the acts of their servants govern the liability of shipowners to whom such rules apply.\nNor do I think any ground of appeal based upon the law of British Columbia is admissible in this Court. In the first place, the law of British Columbia was not pleaded. Then there was no suggestion at the trial that the law of that province would be relied upon. This Court has power to amend, a power which it has exercised in appeals from Quebec, but I think we ought not to exercise it in this case.\nThe most serious question remains. The finding on the subject of negligence is expressed in question 4 and the answer thereto. They are in these words:\n4. Was the said accident due to the fault of the defendant; if so, state in what said fault consisted?\nA. Yes (unanimous). If the Chief Officer, Lieutenant Scott, had ordered life lines erected earlier the accident might have been avoided.\nThe view taken by the Court of King\u2019s Bench appears to be that the affirmative answer to the question whether the accident was due to the fault of the defendant is unequivocal and that the remaining words ought to be read as merely descriptive of the fault.\nI have given this matter anxious consideration. It is of the greatest importance that the verdict of a jury should be read with a determined effort to ascertain its meaning in substance and, if, on a fair reading, the intention of the jury in substance can be discovered effect ought to be given to that intention. I am forced to the conclusion, however, that this answer must be read as a whole. The second sentence, in which the nature of the fault is explained, does seem to be concerned not only with the character of the fault, but with the relation between the fault and the accident as well. Ex facie that seems to be so. My difficulty then is this: If they mean, by answering the first question in the affirmative, as they do, to say, with an appreciation of the purport of the words, that the accident was due to (that is to say, caused by) the fault of the appellants, I cannot really understand how the jury could have used the language they do employ in the second sentence. I am driven to the conclusion that the meaning of the verdict is not sufficiently free from obscurity to enable one to conclude that the jury have found or intended to find the existence of a causal nexus between the fault and the injury to the respondent. I say this with the greatest respect for the views of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench who thought otherwise.\nIn the result, there should be a new trial; the costs of both appeals and of the abortive trial to abide the result of the new trial.\nCannon J.\u2014The appellant complains of the concurrent judgments of the lower courts allowing; to the respondent $4,000 damages unanimously awarded by a jury for an accident to the respondent, on November 6th, 1935, while a member of the crew of the ss. Cornwallis, owned by the appellant. The Cornwallis was a British vessel registered at Vancouver, B.C., and at the time of the accident was proceeding on the high seas to Charlottetown, P.E.I. The respondent, a carpenter on board the vessel, was engaged, with other members of the crew, in putting locking bars on the hatches. While so engaged, about one hundred miles off Bermuda, a wave crashed onto the deck, where the respondent was working, swept him off his feet and carried him about twenty-five feet across the deck, causing him to strike his head violently against a bulkhead with the result that the respondent suffered a severe injury which necessitated an operation and a long treatment in the hospital from which he was finally discharged on the 17th of March, 1936.\nThe jury found the accident to be due to the fault of the appellant, in the following language:\nQuestion 4: Was the said accident due to the fault of the defendant; if so, state in what said fault consisted? Answer: Yes (unanimous). If the Chief Officer, Lieutenant Scott, had ordered life lines erected earlier the accident might have been avoided.\nThe defence was a denial of negligence, and, alternately that, if there was any, it was the negligence of a fellow servant from which, under the common law of England, which was applicable, no cause of action arose.\nOn appeal it was held that section 265 of the Merchants\u2019 Shipping Act (Imperial), 1894, applied, whereby, upon a conflict of laws appearing, the Court is to apply the law of the port of registry, in this case, Vancouver; that the law of British Columbia, in Quebec, must be proved as a fact; that no such fact had been alleged and no proof offered and that such law must be presumed to be the same as the law of Quebec, where the rule of common employment does not exist.\nSection 265 of the Merchants\u2019 Shipping Act of 1894 reads as follows:\nWhere in any matter relating to a ship or to a person belonging to a ship there appears to be a conflict of laws then if there is in this part of this Act any provision on the subject, which is expressly made to extend to that ship, the case shall be governed by that provision, but if there is no such provision, the case shall be governed by the law of the port at which the ship is registered.\nThe only provision in the Act which might have an application to the Cornwallis and its crew is section 261 applying to seagoing British ships registered out of the United Kingdom; but none of the paragraphs would cover damages resulting from an accident caused by the negligence of the owner or his servants; therefore, the case must be governed by the law of the port where the ship was registered. The vessel being registered in the port of Vancouver, in the province of British Columbia, the law of that province on negligence might have applied if it had been alleged and proven. The absence of allegation distinguishes this case from that of Logan v. Lee[11]. This Court, in cases from the province of Quebec, must follow the rule that all facts in support of the action, e.g., the law of another province, must be alleged and proved; otherwise it would be unfair for this Court to take suo motu judiciary notice of the statutory or other laws of another province, ignored in the pleadings, when the Quebec courts did not consider them, and, forsooth were prohibited from considering them as applying to the case.\nMoreover, common employment must not only be alleged but proven; and there should be a finding of the fact of common employment by the jury. This has not been done in this case.\nI, therefore, reach the conclusion that lex fori is the Quebec law; lex loci contractus is also Quebec law, because the respondent was engaged in Montreal. The lex loci commissi delicti would be either the law of England or that of the port of registration. The latter was not pleaded; and the defence of common employment, under the law of England, is not established\u2014was not put to the jury.\nTo my mind, the real difficulty in the case is the nature of the finding of the jury as to the cause of the accident. They affirm that the accident was due to the fault of the defendant; but, when asked in what the fault consisted, they would not affirm categorically that the cause of the accident was the omission of the Chief Officer Scott to order life lines erected earlier. They simply say that the accident might have been avoided. Is this a verdict sufficient to give us the certainty required to connect the injuries suffered by the respondent with the alleged negligence or omission? Is it clear, under the verdict, that the cause of the accident was this omission? The verdict seems to be based not on a fact of which the jurymen were convinced but on a probability or a possibility. It may be fairly implied from the verdict that even if these lines had been erected, in view of the nature of some of the evidence, as to the protection afforded by the life lines, against such a wave, the plaintiff would have been unable to resist the impact of the water and would have suffered the injuries of which he complains. This finding, which must be the basis of the judgment allowing damages, is unsatisfactory. If the jury were uncertain and unable to affirm that plaintiff would have been saved if the life lines had been erected, and this is the only negligence now suggested against the appellants, are we entitled to say that the verdict shows that the plaintiff has discharged the onus of proving that the alleged negligence or fault caused the damage?\nI would, therefore, agree with the Chief Justice and order a new trial, the costs of both appeals and of the abortive trial to abide the result of the new trial.\nNew trial ordered, costs of both appeals and abortive trial to abide result of new trial.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

The trust company made yearly income returns for each of the years 1919 to 1934 respectively to the Dominion Government on the form to be filed by trustees. No assessment was made until February 21, 1936, when assessments for income tax were made for all those years, interest being added. Liability to pay the tax was disputed. Sec. 11 (2) of the Income War Tax Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 97, as amended) provides that \u201cincome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustee * * *.\u201d\nHeld (reversing judgment of Maclean J., [1938] Ex. C.R. 95) (Kerwin J. dissenting): The income in question was not within said s. 11 (2) and was not taxable.\nPer The Chief Justice, Crocket and Davis JJ.: The fund was created for a purpose\u2014to be used \u201cfor the benefit of the aged and deserving poor,\u201d a class, in the town of Colne (a purpose not improbably to be satisfied by building and maintaining some institution)\u2014not, either as to capital or income, for any particular person or persons. What the settlor established was an arrangement or undertaking for promoting a defined public or social object without reference to the property appropriated for the purpose becoming vested at any time in any particular person or persons. No particular person will ever acquire a right to demand and receive the beneficial interest in the income from the fund or in any part thereof. Therefore s. 11 (2) (the only section suggested as under which the accumulating income is taxable) does not apply. (Holden v. Minister of National Revenue, [1933] A.C. 526, distinguished).\nPer Hudson J.: The persons intended under s. 11 (2) are persons who might become entitled to specific portions of the fund, and not a general class who would ultimately get the benefits of the fund in the way of charitable assistance.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting): Under the agreement between the settlor and the trustee the real beneficiaries of the trust are the aged and deserving poor of Colne. The members of the class who will benefit are unascertained persons within the meaning of s. 11 (2). As to further contentions against the assessments: The income is not exempt as being \u201cincome of a charitable institution\u201d within s. 4 (e) of the Act. Interest prior to date of assessment is payable under the Act (s. 55); s. 66 of the Act (considered in conjunction with other sections) does not leave it to the court\u2019s discretion whether interest should be exacted; it is merely an enactment establishing the exclusive jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to deal with the dispute. The question of costs stands in a different position; the appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing (without costs) an appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue confirming assessments for income tax. The material facts and circumstances of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported and are indicated in the above head-note. The appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment appealed from and the assessments in question were set aside, with costs to the appellant throughout. Kerwin J. dissented.\nS. Casey Wood K.C. and G. M. Jarvis for the appellant.\nJohn Jennings K.C. and J. R. Tolmie for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Crocket and Davis JJ. was delivered by\nDavis, J.\u2014On the 27th day of May, 1918, Peter Birtwistle, of the city of London, in the province of Ontario, made a deed of settlement of certain real and personal properties to The Trusts & Guarantee Company, Limited, of the city of Toronto, in the said province, as trustee upon the terms and conditions therein set forth. This settlement superseded an earlier settlement of the 20th of October, 1916, with respect to a sum of $100,000, the investments of which were covered, together with additional property, by the settlement of the 27th of May, 1918. The Trust Company was to administer and manage the trust subject to the directions and control of the settlor during his lifetime and after his death in its absolute discretion with the usual powers of administration and management of the trust fund. The fund was to be held and accumulated until the expiration of 21 years after the death of the settlor, at which date the trustee was to pay the whole of the then fund to the Municipal Council of the town of Colne in Lancashire, England, to be used by the said Council for the benefit of the aged and deserving poor of the said town of Colne in such manner and without restriction of any kind, as shall be deemed prudent to the said Council. The exact words of the provision are as follows:\nThe Trustee shall pay the whole of the Investment Account, together with accumulations thereon, to the Municipal Council of the Town of Colne in Lancashire, England, at the end of the period of twenty-one years after the death of the Settlor, to be used by the said Council for the benefit of the aged and deserving poor of the said Town of Colne in such manner and without restriction of any kind, as shall be deemed prudent to the said Council, save and except and the Settlor hereby declares it to be his wish that the said Council should in so far as possible or convenient, leave any of the said fund which is not required for immediate distribution to be held by the Trustee hereunder and invested by the Trustee under an arrangement similar to that comprised in this indenture, the Settlor believing that it will be advantageous for the Council to retain this colonial investment which the Settlor considers likely to return a better rate of interest than can be readily obtained in England.\nPeter Birtwistle died on April 19th, 1927; the fund with accumulations would therefore become payable to the Council of the town of Colne on April 19th, 1948. At December 31st, 1936, the fund amounted to $572,767.88 and it was estimated by the general manager of the Trust Company that if the trust were continued to the expiration of the twenty-one years from the date of death, the fund would then amount to approximately one million dollars. The fund has been earning approximately $25,000 a year. The town of Colne became desirous of terminating the trust and receiving immediate payment of the fund; the first intimation was a letter from the town clerk to the trustee of the 5th of September, 1933. Subsequently the question was raised in proceedings taken in the Supreme Court of Ontario for approval of a proposed compromise whereby substantial amounts were to be paid over to the town of Colne at that time. Rose, C.J., refused to approve the proposed agreement[2]. The Trust Company each year (1919 to 1934 inclusive) reported to the Dominion Government on the regular form required to be filed by trustees, executors, administrators; assignees, receivers and persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, known as Form T-3, the amount of the income received. The purpose of this return is for information and not for taxation at the source. The amount of the income was set out opposite the printed words \u201cIncome accumulating in hands of Trustees\u201d and by way of information there were written in under the printed heading \u201cName and address of Beneficiary\u201d on the form, the words \u201cIncome accrues to the Municipal Council of Colne, England, for the benefit of aged and deserving poor.\u201d\nNo assessment for income taxation in respect of the accumulating income from this fund was made by the Dominion of Canada under the Income War Tax Act, 1917, and amendments (now R.S.C, 1927, eh. 97) during any of the years 1919 to 1934 inclusive until February 21st, 1936, when assessments were made for all these years at the one time. To the normal tax were added surtaxes and interest aggregating $36,053.25. Of this sum $8,794.45 was interest alone. It is rather obvious that the litigation in the Ontario courts in 1935 attracted the taxing officials of the Dominion to endeavour to collect an income tax from this fund. The trust company denied that it was liable to pay a Dominion income tax on the income from the fund. The assessments were actually made against \u201cThe Peter Birtwistle Trust\u201d but no objection was taken by the trust company to this error; obviously the fund itself could not be assessed.\nSpeaking broadly (apart from non-residents) the Dominion income tax legislation does not contemplate taxation at its source but imposes the tax upon the persons or corporations who receive the income. A beneficiary under a will, for instance, receives his income from the estate intact; he is directly assessed by the Dominion upon the sum which he receives. The executor is required to make a return of the income received by him from the estate and to state the names and addresses of the beneficiaries entitled to that income. But there is a section in the Income War Tax Act, 11 (2), which provides that where income is accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests that income shall be taxable in the hands of the trustee. The original enactment was by sec. 4 of ch. 49 of the Statutes of Canada, 1920, and read as follows:\nIncome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustee or other like person acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of an unmarried person.\nBy sec. 16 of the 1920 statute, this section was deemed to have come into force at the commencement of the 1917 taxation period. The original enactment remained in force until 1927 when it was reproduced verbatim as sec. 11 (2) of the Revised Statutes of 1927, ch. 97. The section remained in force until 1934, when by ch. 55, sec. 7, of the Statutes of 1934, the section was repealed and the following substituted therefor:\n11. (2) Income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustee or other like person acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of a person other than a corporation, provided that he shall not be entitled to the exemptions provided by paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (i) of subsection one of section five of this Act.\nBy sec. 18 of the 1934 statute this new section was made applicable to income of the 1933 taxation period and to all subsequent periods. In 1936 by ch. 38, sec. 10, of the Statutes of that year the section was further amended but without any bearing on the question at issue in this appeal.\nSection 2 of the Income War Tax Act as it was in 1936 contained the following definitions:\n(h) \u201cPerson\u201d includes any body corporate and politic and any association or other body, and the heirs, executors, administrators and curators or other legal representatives of such person, according to the law of that part of Canada to which the context extends;\n(k) \u201ctaxpayer\u201d means any person paying, liable to pay, or believed by the Minister to be liable to pay, any tax imposed by this Act.\nThe Colne Corporation Act, 1933 (being Imperial statute 23 and 24 George V, ch. 35) by sec. 140 empowers the Corporation of Colne to accept, hold and administer any gift of property, whether real or personal, for any public purpose connected with the borough.\nIt may be convenient to mention here that sec. 4 of the Income War Tax Act, so far as relevant, provides:\nThe following incomes shall not be liable to taxation hereunder:\n\u2014(e) the income of any religious, charitable, agricultural and educational institution, board of trade and chamber of commerce. It was contended that upon a proper construction, the exemptions of subsection (e) must be confined territorially to institutions that are within Canada, but it is not necessary, in the view I take of the appeal, to put a construction upon the subsection.\nSection 11 (2), which is a charging section, contemplates income that will vest in and ultimately pass to persons for the time being unascertainable, such, for instance, as unborn issue, or to persons whose rights are for the time being merely contingent interests. The statute is dealing generally with income of persons or corporations. The trust fund with which we are dealing is not intended to pass, either capital or income, to any particular person or persons; the fund was created for a purpose, not for any particular person or persons. The purpose was that the fund should be used \u201cfor the benefit of the aged and deserving poor\u201d of the town of Colne. It was an arrangement or undertaking established by the settlor for promoting a defined public or social object without reference to the property appropriated for the purpose becoming vested at any time in any particular person or persons. Aged and deserving poor cannot be regarded otherwise than as a class in the community; to regard them otherwise is to destroy the character of what is obviously a charitable trust. No particular person will ever acquire a right to demand and receive the beneficial interest in the income from the fund, or in any part thereof. The population of the town of Colne is said to be about 25,000 and it is inconceivable that when the town in 1948 receives approximately a million dollars it will distribute it, or any substantial part of it, among particular persons; the purpose of the settlor will not improbably be satisfied by the erection and maintenance of a hospital or a home or some such institution that will serve the needs of the aged and deserving poor of the town. If I understood counsel aright during the argument, that was the sort of use to which the town intended to put the money when it sought in 1935 to obtain from the Ontario court payment over to it of the fund, or substantial portions of it.\nThe particular section in question, sec. 11 (2), was considered by the Privy Council in Holden v. The Minister of National Revenue[3], and in the judgment of their Lordships delivered by Lord Tomlin the section was said to be a true charging section and fixed the trustee of the accumulating income with liability for the tax. But the accumulating income in that case would, by force of, the will of the testator there in question, inevitably become payable as of right at a future date to particular persons who would become entitled to compel payment of such income to themselves. The point in issue now before us did not arise for consideration in that case.\nUnder the trust that is before us the income is not being accumulated for persons presently unascertainable or for persons with merely contingent interests within the meaning of sec. 11 (2). It is being accumulated for a purpose\u2014and the purpose is to make provision for the benefit of the aged and deserving poor of the town of Colne. It is not suggested that the accumulating income is taxable except under sec. 11 (2), and as that section does not apply, the income of the fund in the hands of the trust company was never taxable under the statute.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment appealed from and the assessments in question set aside, with costs to the appellant throughout.\nKerwin, J. (dissenting)\u2014Under the agreement of May 27th, 1918, between the settlor, Peter Birtwistle, and the trustee, The Trusts and Guarantee Company, Limited, the distinction between the borough of Colne and the council of the borough is not maintained. By clause 2 (b) the trustee is to pay the whole of the investment account provided for by the agreement, together with accumulations, to the Municipal Council of the Town of Colne at the end of the period of twenty-one years after the death of the settlor\nto be used by the said Council for the benefit of the aged and deserving poor of the said Town of Colne in such manner and without restriction of any kind, as shall be deemed prudent to the said Council.\nOn the other hand, under the latter part of clause (d) of paragraph 2,\nthe Settlor hereby expressly relinquishes and surrenders to the Trustee and the Municipality of Colne all the said income in excess of the amount thereof necessary to cover his expenses of living, and under clause (g) it is provided that:\u2014\nUpon the payment over to the Municipality of Colne at the expiration of the period hereinafter determined, together with interest at the rate and in the manner guaranteed hereunder, the securities held by the Trustee in respect of the said Investment Account shall become the property of the Trustee freed from the terms of the trusts hereby created in reference to the said account without any formal assignment or release from the Settlor or the Council of the Municipality of Colne.\nI have mentioned the terminology of the agreement in this one respect in order to draw attention to what appears to me to be another inexactitude. Clause 3 of the agreement provides:\nThe Trustee shall render to the Settlor regular statements in such form as may be required quarterly during the life of the Settlor and thereafter on similar dates to the beneficiaries of the estate.\nA careful reading of the agreement leaves no doubt in my mind that there is but one trust with two successive trustees and that the real beneficiaries of the trust are the aged and deserving poor of Colne.\nThis becomes of importance in considering both main grounds of appeal. The first is whether the members of the class who will benefit are unascertained persons within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 11 of the Income War Tax Act:\nIncome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustee or other like person acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of a person other than a corporation.\nIt has been determined in Holden v. Minister of National Revenue[4] that this is a true charging section, and in my opinion the question whether such members are unascertained persons within the ambit of that provision should be answered in the affirmative. Until the period of distribution arrives the recipients of the settlor\u2019s bounty are unascertainable.\nThe second ground raised by the appellant is that the income is income of a charitable institution within the meaning of those words as used in section 4 (e) of the Act, and therefore exempt from taxation. What has already been said disposes of the suggestion that the income is income of anyone other than the unascertainable aged and deserving poor of Colne and I do not find any assistance in the English cases referred to, which deal with statutes expressed in terms totally unlike the enactment under consideration.\nIt has also been urged that in any event no interest is payable upon the tax prior to the date of assessment. Commencing with the year 1919, the trustee furnished annual returns under the Act, and under the heading \u201cName and Address of Beneficiary\u201d inserted \u201cIncome accrues to the Municipal Council of Colne, England, for the benefit of aged and deserving poor.\u201d No assessment was made until 1936,\u2014apparently in consequence of the publicity occasioned by the report of a decision of the Supreme Court of Ontario[5], given on an application made by the trustee for approval of a proposed agreement between it and the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Colne. The assessment was then made for the years 1919 to 1934 inclusive and included interest at the statutory rate from the times each annual tax was payable.\nInterest is provided for by sections 48, 49 and 54, and section 55 enacts:\u2014\nNotwithstanding any prior assessment, or if no assessment has been made, the taxpayer shall continue to be liable for any tax and to be assessed therefor and the Minister may at any time assess, re-assess or make additional assessments upon any person for tax, interest and penalties.\nIt is suggested that in applying the provisions of these sections a difficulty arises by virtue of section 66:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of this Act, the Exchequer Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions that may arise in connection with any assessment made under this Act and in delivering judgment may make any order as to payment of any tax, interest or penalty or as to costs as to the said Court may seem right and proper.\nIt is contended that this provision leaves it to the Court\u2019s discretion whether interest should be exacted from the taxpayer.\nThe suggested difficulty disappears, however, when section 66 is considered in conjunction with the sections dealing with the rights of a party assessed who objects to the amount at which he has been assessed for income tax or who considers that he is not liable to taxation. By section 58 such a person may serve a notice of appeal upon the Minister of National Revenue who shall then \u201cduly consider the same and shall affirm or amend the assessment appealed against and shall notify the appellant of his decision by registered post\u201d (section 59). If the appellant is dissatisfied with the Minister\u2019s decision, he may notify the Minister that he desires his appeal to be set down for trial, and furnish a statement of facts (section 60). The Minister is to reply thereto (section 62) and transmit to the Exchequer Court certain documents and the matter is thereupon deemed to be an action in that Court (section 63). Section 65 provides for the Court permitting any fact or statutory provision not set out in the notice of appeal or notice of dissatisfaction to be pleaded or referred to and empowers the Court to refer the matter back to the Minister for further consideration. Then comes section 66 already quoted.\nIn my opinion, this section is merely an enactment establishing the exclusive jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to deal with the dispute. The power of the Court to make any order as to payment \u201cof any tax, interest or penalty\u201d is similar to the power conferred upon the Minister by section 55 to \u201cassess, re-assess or make additional assessments upon any person for tax, interest and penalties.\u201d In any event the opening words of section 66, \u201cSubject to the provisions of this Act,\u201d make it evident, I think, that the Court has no power to disregard the plain provisions of the Act imposing upon the taxpayer a liability for interest. The question of costs stands in a different position and there appears to be nothing in the Act to prevent the Court withholding costs from the Minister of National Revenue when successful, and, as a matter of fact, that is what was done by the President of the Exchequer Court in the present case.\nI would dismiss the appeal without costs.\nHudson, J.\u2014The charging section of the Income War Tax Act applicable to this case, if any, is section 11 (2), and after much hesitation I have come to the conclusion that income accumulated in the trust here is not for the benefit of unascertained persons within the meaning of that section. I think that the persons there intended are persons who might become entitled to specific portions of the fund, and not a general class who would ultimately get the benefits of the fund in the way of charitable assistance. For this reason I think that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment appealed from and assessment set aside.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wood & Jarvis.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Code, ss. 231, 69\u2014Evidence\u2014Onus of proof\u2014Authority of judgments in decided cases\u2014Dicta.\nDefendant, a farmer near Lang, Sask., speculated in grain futures on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. His speculations were carried on through plaintiff, a company doing a general banking business and operating a grain elevator at Lang. Defendant gave verbal orders to plaintiff\u2019s manager to buy or sell for future delivery, which orders plaintiff transmitted to Winnipeg brokers who carried them out on the Exchange, and forwarded to plaintiff \u201cconfirmation memoranda,\u201d which stated (inter alia) that \u201call transactions made by us for your account contemplate the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor.\u201d A by-law of the Exchange provided that \u201cunder all contracts of sale of grain for future delivery the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor is contemplated and may be enforced.\u201d Purchase and sale slips showing details of each transaction were also sent to plaintiff. Plaintiff received a share of the brokers\u2019 commission but had no other interest in the transactions. The trades were carried on margin. Plaintiff sent moneys for margins and charged them to defendant. In the beginning of 1930 defendant had not sufficient money to his credit with plaintiff to meet margin requirements and thereafter plaintiff advanced him money therefor, taking his promissory notes for the amounts, which notes were later discharged and replaced by other notes, on which plaintiff sued. The trial judge held that, upon the evidence, defendant was gaming in futures on the rise and fall in grain prices without any intention of actually dealing in the commodity itself, that plaintiff should be charged with knowledge of his real purpose, which was an illegal purpose, and aided and abetted him therein by purposely providing the money for margining his account from time to time as required, that under the combined effect of ss. 231 and 69 of the Criminal Code the parties were principals in the commission of the offence and plaintiff could not recover. His judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan (with variation as to costs), [1938] 1 W.W.R. 22. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld: Plaintiff was entitled to recover. The contracts entered into for defendant were binding, calling for delivery and payment, and were so intended and understood by the parties thereto; and hence were not gaming or wagering transactions within the law nor illegal within s. 231 of the Cr. Code (the construction and effect of s. 231 discussed), even though defendant may have intended, through the machinery of the Grain Exchange, to \u201cclose\u201d his transactions by turning over the fulfilment of his obligations to others by buying or selling grain (by legally binding contracts) before his time for fulfilment. Plaintiff\u2019s advances were to enable defendant to carry out binding obligations undertaken on his behalf, and were not for an illegal purpose.\nIronmonger v. Dyne, 44 T.L.R. 497; Forget v. Ostigny, [1895] A.C. 318; Thacker v. Hardy, 4 Q.B.D. 685; Franklin v. Dawson, 29 T.L.R. 479; and Woodward v. Wolfe, 155 L.T.R. 619, cited.\nHeld, further, per The Chief Justice (Davis J. concurring): Even assuming that there was illegality in defendant\u2019s intention to \u201cclose\u201d a transaction in manner aforesaid, and even assuming that the Winnipeg brokers (who financed the transactions, i.e., carried them on margin) were through knowledge thereof particeps criminis (which was not shown), yet the repayment of said brokers\u2019 loans (loans made to finance the transactions as aforesaid) was not in itself an illegal act within s. 69 or s. 231 of the Cr. Code (the illegal act, if any, consisted in the purchase or sale), and an advance for the purpose of such repayment (as the advances by plaintiff for the purpose of replenishing defendant\u2019s margin) may be recoverable and the debt thereby created may constitute good consideration for a promissory note. The burden of establishing illegality was on defendant. In order to charge plaintiff with aiding and abetting under s. 69, Cr. Code, it was for him to show that the advances in respect of which the notes were given were made in such circumstances as to constitute aiding and abetting a specific illegal purchase or sale, and this was not shown.\nPer The Chief Justice (Davis J. concurring): Beamish v. Richardson, 49 Can. S.C.R. 595, and Maloof v. Bickell, 59 Can. S.C.R. 429, discussed and explained. Beamish v. Richardson was not a decision (nor, indeed, was Maloof v. Bickell) upon the construction and effect of s. 231, Cr. Code, though opinions thereon were expressed. Misconceptions by provincial courts with regard to the effect of Beamish v. Richardson pointed out. Opinions expressed in that case touching the construction or effect of s. 231 formed no part of the ratio decidendi, and, however valuable and weighty as opinions, they are not of binding authority (Davidson v. McRobb, [1918] A.C. 304, at 322; Cornelius v. Phillips, [1918] A.C. 199, at 211; Leeds Industrial v. Slack, [1924] A.C. 851, at 864; East London Railway Joint Committee v. Greenwich Union Assessment Committee, [1913] 1 K.B. 612, at 623-4). Further, the evidence in the present case (discussed) does not bring the facts of this case within the opinions expressed in Beamish v. Richardson (as touching the application of s. 231) with regard to the facts there in question.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] dismissing (except in the matter of costs) its appeal from the judgment of Taylor J. The action was brought to recover on certain promissory notes given by defendant to plaintiff and alternatively to recover for money lent by plaintiff to defendant. The defendant, a farmer near Lang, Saskatchewan, speculated in grain futures on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. The plaintiff was a company doing a general banking business and operating a grain elevator at Lang, and did defendant\u2019s banking and financial business and handled most of his grain through its elevator. The defendant\u2019s grain speculations were carried on through the plaintiff, verbal orders by defendant to plaintiff\u2019s manager being transmitted by plaintiff to Winnipeg brokers who carried them out on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. The notes sued on were given by the defendant in place of over-due notes (which were discharged) which (except as to the sum of $1,350 hereinafter mentioned) had been given by defendant to plaintiff for loans made to meet defendant\u2019s marginal requirements. The trial judge, Taylor J., held that, upon the evidence, defendant was gaming in futures on the rise and fall in grain prices without any intention of actually dealing in the commodity itself, and plaintiff should be charged with knowledge of his real purpose, which was an illegal purpose, and aided and abetted defendant therein by purposely providing the money for margining his account from time to time as it was required, that under the combined effect of ss. 231 and 69 of the Criminal Code, the parties were principals in the commission of the offence and plaintiff could not recover (except, under the alternative claim for money lent, the sum of $1,350, found to have been, advanced independently of the grain trading, with interest). His judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan (with a variation as to costs)1. The material facts of the case sufficiently appear in the judgments now reported and are also dealt with at length in the judgment appealed from[2]. By the judgment now reported the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court was allowed with costs throughout.\nG. W. Forbes K.C. for the appellant.\nW. G. Ross K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justicle.\u2014There is no evidence that any of the transactions with which we are concerned were not real transactions giving rise to legal obligations on both sides. Indeed, the evidence is all the other way. The respondent (Edwards) himself so states and the one rule of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange which is before us, under which the transactions were carried out, is explicit that the actual receipt and delivery of the property is contemplated and may be enforced.\nOf all the transactions of Edwards from 1912 or 1913 to 1931 there appears to have been only one which was carried through by the Winnipeg brokers (Reliance Grain Company) to the date of delivery, and in that case he was required to make payment and did make payment and receive delivery. To use the language of the Chief Justice of Canada in Maloof v. Bickell[3]: \u201cthey were * * * bona fide transactions made for good consideration on the\u201d Winnipeg Grain Exchange; and\nthere was no evidence of any express, implied or tacit understanding that the contracts so made were not enforceable or that any loss or gain in reference to the price of the commodities contracted for should be paid by a settlement of differences.\nThis is really not disputed as regards the contracts themselves as effected on the Grain Exchange by the Reliance Grain Co., but it applies equally to the transactions as between the appellants (the Prudential Company) and Edwards. Edwards, indeed, does not deny that he understood quite well that if he did not, as respects a purchase for example, sell before the date of delivery he would be obliged to accept delivery and pay the price agreed upon. There is not the slightest evidence of any sort of understanding that he could escape his obligation by a mere settlement of differences. In truth, neither the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal has found that any such understanding existed, and it is very clear to me that no such finding could be justified on the evidence.\nThe view of the Court of Appeal, as well as of the trial judge, is that the issue between the parties is determined by the fact that Edwards, whose evidence in this respect has been accepted by the learned trial judge, says he did not in any case intend to make or accept delivery, and, by the additional fact found by the trial judge that the Prudential Company were aware of this. These findings are based upon the evidence of Edwards and it is important to understand what he means by delivery. This he explains, and he makes it quite clear, that, by delivery, he means delivery of the commodity in kind at a terminal elevator and that, as to the acceptance of delivery, the cardinal feature is the actual payment of the full price. He says clearly enough that he intended neither of these things. This is, of course, not in the least degree inconsistent with his evidence that he intended that every transaction entered into on the Exchange by the Reliance Grain Company in Winnipeg should be, and was as he understood, a real transaction\u2014a bargain involving legal and enforceable obligations to deliver or accept delivery and pay. His evidence really amounts to this: that his intention in the case of a purchase was to \u201cclose\u201d the transaction by a sale. There is no evidence as to the practice on the Grain Exchange excepting that afforded by the one rule before us, viz., that\nUnder all contracts of sale of grain for future delivery the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor is contemplated and may be enforced.\nThere is nothing to show, for example, that the Grain Exchange provides machinery for setting off the obligations on one contract against the obligations of another and thereby extinguishing them.\nThe evidence is equally consistent with a totally different procedure: a procedure by which, through some form of novation, the obligation of the customer is assumed by a third party whom the creditor is, by the rules of the Exchange, bound to accept as his debtor in lieu of the customer. Novation is obviously contemplated and provided for by the confirmation memorandum which is in these terms: We have made the following transactions for your account and risk, under the by-laws, rules, regulations and customs of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and also those of the Winnipeg Grain and Produce Exchange Clearing Association.\nAll transactions made by us for your account contemplate the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor. On all marginal business we reserve the right to close transaction when margins are running out without further notice. We also reserve the privilege of substituting other responsible parties as principals with you in these transactions at any time until closed, in accordance with the rules of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, where the transactions are made, and to clear all transactions through clearing associations from day to day in accordance with the usage prevailing at the time.\nThis trade has been, or may be, cleared through the said clearing association, and on being so cleared, we will be the only persons responsible for the carrying out of this trade or trades, and furthermore we will be the only persons against whom you will have any recourse for the fulfilment thereof.\nThere is no evidence of the nature of the proceedings in the clearing house; none that any one of the transactions was actually cleared through the clearing house.\nIt is plain that these transactions were neither gaming nor wagering transactions within the language of the law. Edwards in every instance incurred an enforceable legal obligation to carry out the sale or purchase, an obligation which he must perform by actual payment or delivery or satisfy or transfer by entering into another equally binding and enforceable obligation. Such transactions are not wagering or gaming transactions. Ironmonger v. Dyne[4].\nThe consideration for the promissory notes sued upon, as we shall see presently, was the discharge of overdue promissory notes given by Edwards to the Prudential Company partly in consideration of moneys advanced to Edwards and remitted to the Reliance Grain Company in order to replenish Edwards\u2019 margin account with them.\nThe Court of Appeal, as well as the trial judge, have held that, since Edwards did not in any of his purchases or sales intend to accept or make delivery, he was in each case guilty of an offence under s. 231 of the Criminal Code, and that the Prudential Company, being aware of his intentions, cannot recover in respect of the advances made. It will be necessary to consider whether the notes sued on, assuming Edwards to be right in his contention as to the construction and application of the statute, were given for an illegal consideration or for no consideration. Before coming to this question, it is convenient first to discuss the effect of s. 231 of the Criminal Code.\nThe Court of Appeal and the trial judge, in deciding in favour of Edwards, conceived themselves to be following what is spoken of as a decision of this Court in Beamish v. Richardson[5] on the construction of that section. In truth, there was no decision in Beamish v. Richardson5 touching the construction or effect of that section. Opinions were expressed, but, as I shall presently explain in detail, they form no part of the ratio decidendi and, however valuable and weighty as opinions, they are not in any way binding upon us and cannot relieve us from the duty of forming and giving effect to our own views.\nIn considering s. 231, it is essential to read that section in light of the title and preamble of the statute in which it was originally enacted (51 Vict., ch. 42):\nAn Act respecting Gaming in Stocks and Merchandise.\nWhereas gaming and wagering on the rise and fall in value of stocks and merchandise are detrimental to commercial and public morality, and places affording facilities for such gaming and wagering, commonly called bucket shops, are being established; and it is expedient to prevent such gaming and wagering, to punish the persons engaged in them, and to prohibit and punish the opening and maintaining of places therefor, and the frequenting thereof: Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\u2014\nand also of sections 232 and 233 which reproduce sections of the same statute in a slightly modified form.\nWhen s. 231 is read with sections 232 and 233 in light of the preamble and title of the parent statute, I think, on a true construction of it, it does not contemplate transactions such as those disclosed by the evidence before us; transactions, that is to say, in which there is a binding legal obligation on the one side to deliver and on the other side to pay, and in which these obligations are enforceable and intended to be enforceable in point of law.\nI think this result is not affected by the fact that one of the parties intends to take advantage of the machinery of the stock exchange or commodity exchange on which the transactions are effected to sell, in the case of a purchase, for example, before the date of delivery, by a real sale legally binding and enforceable between himself and the purchaser. It is true that in such a case it can rightly be said that the customer has no intention of making delivery personally or by his agent, but it does not necessarily follow that actual delivery is not contemplated or that the customer has no intention that actual delivery shall be made.\nThere is no evidence before us in this record to show that actual delivery was not made in any single transaction with which we are directly concerned; the evidence goes no farther than this: Edwards says he did not accept delivery except in one case which occurred prior to these transactions. He does not even negative delivery to the Reliance Grain Company in Winnipeg. I do not think a purchase of commodities for future delivery is brought within the section by reason of the fact that the purchaser intends to make a profit by the rise of the market price by selling before the arrival of the date of delivery and that, by arrangement between him and the seller, delivery is to be made to the sub-purchaser and payment made by him. Such a transaction may not improperly be described as speculating in many circumstances but nobody would think of describing it as wagering or gaming and it most assuredly is neither wagering or gaming within the meaning of the law. We should, I think, be wresting the statute from its purpose if we construed it as applying to such dealings.\nNor do I think the statute applies, to put the case in its simplest form, where the transaction contemplates delivery and payment and the enforceability of the obligations to deliver and pay, merely because one of the parties intends to make use of the machinery of an exchange in such a way as to discharge his obligation to deliver by the acquisition of a converse obligation to deliver to him and the setting off of these obligations one against the other; provided always that the converse obligation is equally real and equally enforceable in point of law.\nIt is, perhaps, proper to say that I see no reason to change the views I expressed in Beamish v. Richardson[6] and Maloof v. Bickell[7] (supra) touching the construction and effect of section 231, Cr. C.\nStrictly, it is unnecessary to consider this last hypothesis in the case before us. The progress of the transactions through the machinery of the Grain Exchange is not traced. The machinery of the Exchange itself, as already observed, is not explained to us. We are left entirely in the dark with regard to it. The evidence again, as already observed, is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that in every case the obligation to pay or to deliver was performed by a substituted debtor. The evidence discloses no knowledge on the respondent\u2019s part of the actual procedure or proceedings on the Exchange. It is capable of the interpretation that to \u201cclose\u201d a transaction merely meant he was relieved of his personal obligation to pay or to deliver as the case might be. The precise means by which that was effected, under the rules of the Exchange, whether by novation or otherwise, obviously did not concern him. His evidence is strictly limited to his own personal intentions. He knew quite well at the time of the transactions now in question, from his own experience, that if he gave an order for the purchase of future wheat and did not sell before the maturity of the contract he would be called upon to accept delivery and to pay the full price.\nMy conclusion, therefore, is that the respondent has failed to establish the illegality of these transactions and that on that ground his defence fails.\nThere is another ground upon which I am inclined to think the respondent fails. I think the proper conclusion from the evidence is that the consideration for the notes sued on was the discharge of the existing overdue notes, some of which were given in consideration of advances made by the appellants to the respondent and paid to the Winnipeg brokers in order to replenish Edwards\u2019 margin. The Winnipeg brokers, the Reliance Grain Company, were financing Edwards\u2019 transactions on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. In other words, they were carrying these transactions on margin. Now, the evidence does not show, as counsel for the Prudential Company points out, that the advances in question were made to finance purchases or sales about to be made or thereafter to be made. They were made in part repayment of loans by the Reliance Grain Company in respect of transactions already entered into.\nAssuming a purchase and a subsequent fall in the market price, a consequent shortage of margin and an advance for the purpose of replenishing the same by the Prudential Company to Edwards by way of remittance to the Reliance Grain Company; and assuming illegality in the sense found in the courts below, namely, illegality consisting in the intention of the respondent to close the transaction by a converse sale on the Exchange and not to carry it through by acceptance of delivery and payment; was there anything illegal in the payment to the Reliance Grain Company? There is no finding that they were particeps criminis and, on the evidence before us, I do not see how such a finding could be sustained.\nBut, apart from this, assuming knowledge ought to be imputed to the Reliance Grain Company and that they were particeps criminis, it does not follow that repayment of the loan by Edwards was an illegal act. The illegal act, if any, consisted in the purchase. The loan to enable the purchase to be made with knowledge of its illegality we may assume would have constituted the brokers aiders and abettors. It does not follow that repayment of the loan even on that assumption was an illegal act. The learned trial judge finds that there was an agreement on the part of the Prudential Company to make advances to replenish margins. The finding, if pertinent, must amount to this: that the Prudential Company had agreed for some valid consideration, in the case of a given purchase, for example, that they would make the advances necessary to maintain Edwards\u2019 margin with the Reliance Grain Company. That seems to me, with great respect, to be very improbable, and I can find no satisfactory evidence to support it. The Court of Appeal have not expressed their concurrence in this finding.\nThe onus is on Edwards in the strict sense to prove illegality; that is to say, the burden of establishing illegality is on him. If the evidence leaves the point in doubt he fails on that issue.\nIn order to charge the Prudential Company with aiding and abetting under s. 69, aiding and abetting a specific offence must be proved. It is necessary, therefore, to find the particular sale or sales, purchase or purchases, entered into by the respondent in violation of s. 231, in respect of which the offence of aiding and abetting is to be established. You cannot, under the Criminal Code, charge aiding and abetting in the abstract. You must prove the particular offence and then connect the alleged aider and abettor with that offence. You must, that is to say, show that the advances in respect of which the discharged notes were given were made in such circumstances as to constitute aiding and abetting a specific illegal purchase or sale.\nAssuming knowledge of illegality on the part of the Reliance Grain Company, and consequent illegality in the loan by them to enable the intended purchase to be made, I know no authority for the proposition that the repayment of such a loan in whole or in part would necessarily be illegal, or that an advance for the purpose of repaying such a loan would not be recoverable or that the debt thereby created would not constitute good consideration for a promissory note.\nI think, if I may say so, that the Court of Appeal have overlooked the circumstance that these advances by the Prudential Company were for repaying loans by the Reliance Grain Company and, I may add., I think they must have overlooked the fact that there is no finding of complicity between the Reliance Grain Company and the client Edwards.\nTo sum up on this point. The respondent\u2019s case is that the notes, the discharge of which constituted the consideration for the notes sued on, were given for an illegal consideration; for a debt created by advances made by the Prudential Company to enable him to replenish his margin with the Reliance Grain Company. The onus is upon him to establish this case.\nI am not satisfied that he has established the alleged illegality. He has not established the alleged illegality, first, because he has not shown that any of the advances were made in order to enable him to make an illegal sale or purchase; second, because the repayment of a broker\u2019s loan made in order to effect an illegal sale or purchase, even if known to be so by him, is not in itself an illegal act within section 69 or section 231 of the Criminal Code; and, third, there is not sufficient evidence of knowledge by the brokers of the illegality of Edwards\u2019 conduct, and, consequently, no foundation for the proposition that the loan by the brokers was an illegal act within these sections.\nOn these grounds I think the appeal should succeed. It seems to be desirable, however, to say a word with regard to two cases, Beamish v. Richardson[8] and Maloof v. Bickell[9], which have been the subject of discussion in the courts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.\nI have already observed that Beamish v. Richardson8 was not a decision, nor indeed, was Maloof v. Bickell9, upon the construction or effect of s. 231 of the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan came to the conclusion that what was said in the judgments of three members of the Court in the first mentioned case was binding on them and, as already observed, they speak of these opinions as a decision. These opinions have also been discussed in judgments in the Courts of Appeal for Manitoba and Alberta.\nThe practical question which a provincial court of appeal has to consider when confronted with deliberate and considered opinions in judgments delivered in this Court which do not form part of the ratio decidendi may, no doubt, be an embarrassing one. I am addressing myself to the effect of these opinions, not from the point of view of the provincial court, but strictly from the point of view of the judges of this Court.\nFirst, as regards Beamish v. Richardson8. There was a great deal of evidence before this Court in that case as to the nature of the proceedings on the Grain Exchange and in the Clearing House and there were marked differences of opinion as to the effect of that evidence.\nTwo members of the Court, Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Brodeur, expressed the view that the facts as disclosed in the evidence brought the case within s. 231. One member of the court expressed an opinion as to the construction of s. 231 which was a fully considered and definitive opinion as to the statute, but he did not rest his judgment on that ground because, as he said, it was unnecessary to do so in view of the fact that he was proceeding upon another ground, but also, as seems clear from his language, because he was not deciding that the facts had been established which, in his view of the statute, would make it applicable.\nPlainly, it was no part of the ratio of the decision. The law on this point is well known and well understood but, in view of what was said in the Court of Appeal, I quote one or two passages in the numerous deliverances that might be cited on the subject. In Davidson v. McRobb[10], Lord Dunedin said:\nMy Lords, i apprehend that the dicta of noble Lords in this House, while always of great weight, are not of binding authority and to be accepted against one\u2019s own individual opinion, unless they can be shown to express a legal proposition which is a necessary step to the judgment which the House pronounces in the case.\nIn Cornelius v. Phillips[11], Lord Haldane said:\n* * * dicta by judges, however eminent, ought not to be cited as establishing authoritatively propositions of law unless these dicta really form integral parts of the train of reasoning directed to the real question decided. They may, if they occur merely at large, be valuable for edification, but they are not binding.\nAgain, in Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society, Ltd. v. Slack[12], Lord Dunedin said:\nMy Lords, if a decision is binding, there is an end of it. But if you have only to do with dicta, though such dicta may well serve to help you to form your own opinion, I cannot see that they ought to overrule it. It is a different question when a practice follows on dicta. A practice it might not be right to disturb, but then it is the practice and not the dicta that forms the binding authority. Further, the present case seems to be the last in which such a course ought to be followed, because Lindley L.J., sitting in the Court of Appeal with A. L. Smith and Davey L. JJ., distinctly stated in Martin v. Price[13] that the question was still an open one.\nIn my view I respectfully think that the Master of the Rolls and Warrington L.J. ought not to have confined themselves to the question of whether the dicta in Dreyfus[14] were carefully considered\u2014their conclusion is one with which I cordially agree\u2014but ought to have considered whether their own opinions or the dicta in Dreyfus14 were right, and if they thought that their view was right, to have said so and let a higher Court, if it was so minded, go back to Dreyfus14.\nIn East London Railway Joint Committee v. Greenwich Union Assessment Committee15, Farwell L.J. said:\nIt is the decision of the House only that binds the Court; the opinions of individual Law Lords are valuable in assisting us to form our own judgments, but are of no binding authority; for example, if a decision of the Exchequer Chamber were criticized unfavourably in the House of Lords, it would remain binding on us unless it were expressly overruled. The House of Lords by its order can declare the law to be entirely different from anything that it has been supposed to be for years, but no opinion of individual peers, however eminent and however numerous, can have this effect. In Maloof v. Bickell, Mr. Justice Kelly[15], who tried the case, held that the customer had no intention of making or accepting delivery of the commodity and the Toronto brokers who would forward their orders to their correspondents in Chicago for execution on the Chicago Board of Trade had knowledge of this fact. The pertinent passage in his judgment reads:\nI would have great difficulty in coming to the conclusion that either plaintiff or defendants in the present transaction contemplated or had any intention of making or receiving an actual delivery. The plaintiff, a man with no suggestion of experience in actual grain deliveries, and operating as he did operate in his numerous transactions preceding these, clearly had no such intention; and it would be very surprising if defendants expected ever to be called upon to make or accept actual delivery. In none of plaintiff\u2019s numerous purchases and sales with defendants did any actual delivery take place; nor were such even hinted at. The circumstances clearly lead to the conclusion that defendants knew plaintiff did not intend or expect actual delivery to be made or accepted.\nOn this finding he held, in deference to the opinions expressed in Beamish v. Richardson[16], that the transaction was illegal by force of s. 231. In the Court of Appeal[17], reasons for judgment were given by Mr. Justice Ferguson with whom two out of three of his colleagues concurred. He swept aside the findings of the trial judge, holding\nThere is no evidence * * * that the plaintiff * * * had no intention or was not able or willing to perform the contracts.\nHe adds:\nIt does not seem to me that there is evidence on which it can be found that the defendants * * * had any notice or knowledge that the principals to the contracts negotiated by them or through their instrumentality had not bona fide intentions to make or accept delivery of the commodities.\nMr. Justice Ferguson distinguished the facts in Beamish v. Richardson[18] from the facts in Maloof v. Bickell. The actual relation between the broker and the client in the earlier case, he declared, was that of vendor and purchaser and he added that the broker \u201cin addition to his commission for acting as broker, benefited or lost according to the rise or fall of the market\u201d; this he thought was one of the grounds on which the majority of this Court had proceeded. With great respect, this was a misapprehension. No suggestion was made in the judgments, of this Court that the brokers stood in the relation of vendors to their client or that they were concerned in the profit or loss from the rise or fall of the market. That, it is quite plain, is one main ground of distinction upon which he proceeds, but there are other grounds which he sums up in these two paragraphs:\nThe commission evidence establishes that the contracts entered into were real bona fide transactions made for good consideration on the Chicago Board of Trade through reputable brokers, and there is no evidence of any express, implied or tacit understanding that the contracts so made in Chicago were not enforceable or should not be enforceable or that any loss or gain in reference to the price of the commodities contracted for should be paid by a settlement of differences.\nThis is not a case of fictitious transactions such as were under consideration in Pearson v. Carpenter[19] but is a case of real transactions such as were found and considered in Forget v. Ostigny[20]; Buiten-landsche Bankvereeniging v. Hildesheim[21]; and the defendants were not vendors to their clients as was the case in Beamish v. Richardson[22]. See also 27 Hals. pp. 258-260.\nThe last element of the sentence, I repeat, was penned in error. But, except as regards that, on appeal to this Court, two judges of this Court concurred in the reasoning of these paragraphs. On page 430, the Chief Justice says:\nThe other finding, reversing the trial judge, was that the transactions in question were not within the prohibitions of s. 231 of the Criminal Code; that they were on the contrary bona fide transactions made for good consideration on the Chicago Board of Trade; and that there was no evidence of any express, implied or tacit understanding that the contracts so made were not enforceable or that any loss or gain in reference to the price of the commodities contracted for should be paid by a settlement of differences. Nelson v. Baird[23]. In other words, that the purchase and sale of the wheat in question at the times and in the manner in which it was bought and sold were bona fide transactions authorized by the plaintiff and were not illegal gambling transactions within the provisions of s.,231 of the Criminal Code. See Forget v. Ostigny[24].\nAt p. 442, Mr. Justice Mignault says:\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the appellant\u2019s action and the respondents\u2019 counter-claim for $156.62 on the ground that the transactions in question amounted to gambling transactions, prohibited as such by article 231 of the Criminal Code. The Appellate Division, on the contrary, decided that they were real purchases and sales under the authority of Forget v. Ostigny24, and similar cases. In this I agree, but I think, for the reasons stated above, that the appellant\u2019s appeal here fails. I should not like to be misunderstood as suggesting that in Maloof v. Bickell[25], either Mr. Justice Idington, Mr. Justice Anglin or Mr. Justice Brodeur had any intention of withdrawing their opinions expressed in Beamish v. Richardson[26]. I am quite sure they had no such intention. On the other hand, the passages quoted from the judgments of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Mignault seem to indicate what they regard as the true badges of illegality under s. 231.\nThe Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan appears to have proceeded upon the view that the facts disclosed by the evidence in that case bring the case within the opinions of the majority of the judges in Beamish v. Richardson26 as touching the application of s. 231. With great respect, I should, I think, refer to what appears to be a serious misconception by the Court of Appeal as to the effect of the evidence.\nThe judgment states that the confirmation shows the transactions had passed through the clearing house. I can find no such statement in the confirmation note; nor, as already observed, can I find any evidence in the record that any of the transactions in question passed or did not pass through the clearing house. With great respect, I am unable to agree that the evidence brings the facts of this case within the opinions mentioned. As to the facts, Mr. Justice Anglin says[27]:\nI incline to think the evidence discloses that neither the plaintiffs nor the defendant at any time contemplated that delivery of the grain sold should be made or taken under the agreements purporting to be contracts for the sale of such grain which the defendant authorized and the plaintiffs made. The intent always was to meet the obligation to deliver by an off-set of a contract to purchase a like quantity of grain\u2014to adjust the differences between the selling and the buying prices and by thus dealing in such differences to make gain or profit by an anticipated fall in the price of the merchandise.\nThe plaintiffs and the defendant in Beamish v. Richardson26 were the brokers, who were the principals on the Exchange, and the customer. As to the Winnipeg brokers who executed the respondent\u2019s orders on the Exchange, there is no evidence, as we have already seen, of any such intent as that which Mr. Justice Anglin was inclined to ascribe to the brokers in the former case. As to the evidence of the customer, I have pointed out what that amounts to and, I repeat, it falls very far short of establishing the proposition that neither the customer nor the broker who executed his orders contemplated the delivery of the grain should be made or taken under the contracts. Still less does it establish an intent always to meet the obligation to deliver by an offset of a contract to purchase a like quantity. As already pointed out, the evidence of the respondent is entirely too vague to support a finding of fact that he had any definite idea as to the modus operandi by which his transactions would be closed and we are left equally in the dark as to the procedure by which they were in fact.\nTurning to the Judgment of Mr. Justice Idington. It rests, as regards the application of the statute, upon the evidence as to the procedure on the Exchange and the evidence of the actual dealings between the parties. With him, one fact that he finds established is cardinal, viz., that in all the dealings by the brokers on behalf of the customer, not one pound of any commodity was ever delivered; a finding, curiously enough, which corresponds precisely with the finding of Mr. Justice Kelly in Maloof v. Bickell[28] and which the Court of Appeal for Ontario considered to be of no significance whatever.\nIt may be, for all I know, that evidence of the same character as that on which Mr. Justice Idington proceeds, evidence, for example, showing in detail the course of procedure in the clearing house and the proceedings actually followed in the transactions under consideration, could have been adduced in this case, but the onus, as I have said, was on the respondent and, as regards this procedure, we are left in ignorance and it may be that since Beamish v. Richardson[29] the procedure has undergone radical changes.\nI have had an opportunity of reading the judgments of my brothers Davis and Hudson and I agree with their reasons.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment should be entered for the appellant for the principal of the notes sued upon with interest at the proper rate or rates; with liberty to the respondent, if so advised, to have a reference to the Local Registrar of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for the Judicial District of Regina to ascertain and settle the exact figures if the parties cannot agree; costs of the reference to be costs in the cause.\nCrocket, J.\u2014I concur in the judgments of both my Lord the Chief Justice and my brothers Davis and Hudson, that in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in this case the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment entered for the appellant for the principal of the notes sued upon with interest at the proper rate or rates, and with liberty to the respondent to have a reference to the Local Registrar of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for the Judicial District of Regina, to ascertain and settle the exact figures, if the parties cannot agree, on the terms stated in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice.\nDavis, J.\u2014This is an action on several promissory notes, for different amounts, all payable on demand. The defence is that the notes were given in settlement of an account for moneys loaned for illegal purposes, i.e., gambling in grain futures contrary to sec. 231 of the Criminal Code. As the learned trial judge said,\nThe defendant had his gamble and now seeks to unload his loss on the private banking concern now in liquidation which he alleges knowingly loaned him the money for margining his trades in futures.\nThe conclusion of the trial judge was that the respondent (defendant) was merely gambling in futures on the rise and fall in the prices of grain without any intention of actually dealing in the commodity itself and that the evidence was sufficient to charge the appellant (plaintiff) with knowledge of the respondent\u2019s real purpose and on the facts of the case the learned trial judge found that the appellant aided and abetted the respondent in his illegal purpose by purposely providing the money for margining his account from time to time as it was required, and that the combined effect of sec. 231 and sec. 69 of the Criminal Code made the parties principals in the commission of the offence. The trial judge\u2019s further conclusion was that Steidl, the appellant\u2019s former manager, knew full well that the respondent never had the remotest intention of doing anything but gamble on the market.\nIt was known that when he (i.e., the respondent) sold for future delivery twenty thousand bushels of this now, ten thousand bushels of another future, etc., etc., in the trades so privately and roughly recorded by Steidl, that he had no grain nor expectation of having grain to make delivery, and that when he bought for future delivery he would have no more use for the commodity he agreed to take in the future than he would have for a carload of plugged nickels. Steidl knew he was gaming on the market and not dealing in the commodities in which he was gaming and was an active aid and abettor therein.\nThe total amount sued for was $9,623.90 with interest. The trial judge found that, independently of the grain trading, the appellant had properly advanced to the respondent three sums, aggregating $1,350. For this sum with interest the appellant was given judgment against the respondent but otherwise the action was dismissed. Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, which Court affirmed the trial judgment with some variations as to the disposition of costs[30]. The plaintiff appeals.\nIt is with the greatest respect that I find myself unable to accept the judgment of the careful and experienced trial judge, Mr. Justice Taylor, confirmed as it has been by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The learned trial judge found that it was quite clear upon the respondent\u2019s evidence \u201cthat the trades were actually executed from time to time on the Exchange.\u201d The respondent\u2019s evidence indeed made it plain that in every case, whether he bought or sold, he \u201cwanted a real sale to be made or a real purchase to be made on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange for future delivery.\u201d\nThe respondent dealt and intended to deal in grain futures on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and the appellant acted as his broker, carrying his accounts on margin and dealing through a Winnipeg broker who had a seat on the Exchange. While the records of the transactions as between the appellant and respondent were loosely kept, there cannot be the slightest doubt that had the price of grain gone up when the respondent thought it was going up, or had it gone down when the respondent thought it was going down, and resulted in a money profit on trading, the respondent would very gladly have taken the profit. But it is plain that his marginal trading was on the whole unsuccessful and that he suffered substantial loss. Now he says, when confronted with a demand for payment of his promissory notes covering an adverse balance, that it was mere gambling of a criminal nature that he was engaged in and that the appellant was a party with him in this unlawful course of conduct and he contends that he is not bound to pay. But he knew that his transactions were being carried out in the regular course on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and he intended that they should be. In one sense it is true, in most marginal trading on a stock market, that the customer does not expect to be called upon to make physical delivery of share certificates representing the shares that he has sold or to take physical delivery and make payment in full for the shares which he has bought. When a marginal trader sells either short or long he probably seldom visualizes the obligation to take or to give delivery\u2014he is so hopeful of a rising or a falling market in the particular stock or commodity in which he is trading that he expects within a short time to be able to close his account and take out a money profit. But the legal obligation is always there and he knows perfectly well that it is there. If a customer who deals on a recognized stock exchange could, every time he loses heavily by the stock going the opposite way from that which he expected, turn round and say that he never intended to have any real transactions in the stock or commodities but was merely gambling in breach of the Criminal Code, it would be quite impossible to carry on the business of a well regulated public stock exchange which renders its own peculiar public service. Here, the respondent admits that he wanted real sales to be made and real purchases to be made for him on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange for future delivery. I cannot see that he can escape from the payment of his losses.\nIf I may say so, with great respect, I am in entire agreement with the conclusion as well as with the reasons for the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nHudson, J.\u2014This action was brought on promissory notes made by defendant in favour of the plaintiffs, and in the alternative for moneys lent by the plaintiffs to the defendant. The only defence which requires consideration here is that the notes were given or the money lent in respect of transactions in the nature of gaming or wagering and contrary to law, and particularly contrary to section 231 of the Criminal Code. The courts below upheld the contention of the defendant, except in respect to a sum of $1,350 and interest, part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\nThe defendant, a substantial farmer growing large crops of grain in the neighbourhood of Lang, Saskatchewan, also over a period of many years speculated in grain futures on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange.\nThe plaintiffs carried on a general banking business and also operated a grain elevator at Lang. They did the defendant\u2019s banking and financial business, handled most of his grain through their elevator, and in addition to this the defendant\u2019s grain speculations were carried on through them. The method of procedure was that the defendant gave a verbal order to the plaintiff\u2019s manager to buy or sell a specified quantity of wheat for future delivery. These orders were then transmitted by the plaintiffs to the Reliance Grain Company to be carried out on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. When the orders had been executed, the Reliance Grain Company forwarded to the plaintiff what was called a confirmation memorandum. Several of these were put in evidence and were in the following language:\nEXHIBIT \u201cD. 15\u201d\nConfirmation Memorandum\nGrain Exchange,\nWinnipeg, Jany. 15, 1931.\nFrom\nReliance Grain Company Limited\nMessrs. Prudential Exch. Coy. Ltd., Lang, Sask.\nWe have made the following transactions for your account and risk, under the by-laws, rules, regulations and customs of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and also those of the Winnipeg Grain and Produce Exchange Clearing Association.\nAll transactions made by us for your account contemplate the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor. On all marginal business we reserve the right to close transaction when margins are running out without further notice. We also reserve the privilege of substituting other responsible parties as principals with you in these transactions at any time until closed, in accordance with the rules of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, where the transactions are made, and to clear all transactions through clearing associations from day to day in accordance with the usage prevailing at the time.\nThis trade has been, or may be, cleared through the said clearing association, and on being so cleared, we will be the only persons responsible for the carrying out of this trade or trades, and furthermore we will be the only persons against whom you will have any recourse for the fulfilment thereof.\nBOUGHT\nQuantity Market Delivery Article Price\nM\n5 July Wht. 57\u215e Your\nReference\nEdwards\n1 July 58\u00bd Mrs. Knouse\nEvidence was admitted of a by-law of the Grain Exchange in the following terms:\nUnder all contracts of sale of grain for future delivery the actual receipt and delivery of the property and payment therefor is contemplated and may be enforced.\nPurchase and sale slips showing details of each transaction were also sent to and received by the plaintiff. The learned trial judge has held that the trades in question were actually executed from time to time on the exchange.\nThe plaintiffs were compensated by one half of the brokers\u2019 commission but had no other interest in the transactions.\nThe trades were carried on margin; the money for the margins was usually advanced by the plaintiff for the defendant and charged to the defendant in his current account with the bank. He got monthly statements of these payments. Sometimes the moneys were advanced in Winnipeg through shipments of actual grain made by the defendant. These operations continued over a period of 15 or 16 years, so far as appears, to the profit of the defendant. Subsequently, however, the defendant was less wise or less fortunate, as the case may be, and in the beginning of 1930 he had not sufficient money to his credit with the plaintiff to meet margin requirements and the advances which gave rise to the present litigation were thereafter made by the plaintiffs at the defendant\u2019s request. These advances seem all to have been in respect of contracts for sale or purchase previously entered into and presumably were made to maintain outstanding contracts, that is, the defendant\u2019s right to deliver or to receive the quantity of grain on the terms specified.\nNotes were given by the defendant at the time to the plaintiffs and these notes were subsequently marked paid and given to the defendant and new notes taken in their place. The defendant swore repeatedly and positively that he never intended to take or make delivery in any of these transactions and that the plaintiffs\u2019 manager knew this from the very beginning. Notwithstanding that his statements were denied by the plaintiffs\u2019 manager, the learned judges chose to accept the defendant\u2019s story.\nJust what the defendant meant by taking or making delivery may be inferred from some of his answers. He was asked:\nQ. I am not talking about cash. You wanted a real sale to be made or a real purchase to be made on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange for future delivery? A. Yes.\nThat he knew that these contracts involved an obligation to take or make actual delivery at the time fixed by the contract is shown by an experience which he had in 1928, when he took delivery of some 25,000 bushels of grain which he had bought on margin. He explains this transaction in the following terms:\nI thought\u2014the premium was so high on cash grain that I did not think it could be delivered on contracts so I left it go and when the time came I couldn\u2019t get out and they unloaded on me.\nQ. They gave you the grain you had previously bought? A. Yes.\nAt another place he states:\nQ. Now, when you were buying grain for future delivery you were hoping it would rise in prices? A. I was gambling in the rise in price.\nQ. You were expecting it would rise in price? A. Anybody that gambles that way will expect it to rise.\nQ. When you had bought grain for a future delivery did you intend to sell an equal quantity of grain when the price was high enough to suit you? A. Well, I did not wait. i had to sell out when it came time, whether it was up or down.\nQ. You would expect your broker to go into the market and sell? A. I would instruct Mr. Steidl to sell.\nQ. An equivalent quantity of grain? A. Yes.\nQ. And the same thing would apply where it went short? A. I would expect him to buy it back.\nQ. You would expect him to buy an equivalent quantity of grain? A. Yes.\nIt would then appear that what the defendant had in mind when he said he did not intend to make delivery was that although he recognized that the contracts were binding contracts, he intended to turn over the fulfilment of the obligation to somebody else by buying or selling a similar quantity of grain on the best terms he could before the date for fulfilment. He also recognized that if he failed to do this he would then be called upon to make or take actual delivery himself. It appears that the defendant had himself adequate resources to take care of any call for delivery.\nThe question, then, is whether or not the conduct of the parties here was a violation of the provisions of section 231 of the Criminal Code. Before discussing this section, it might be wise to consider the law prior to its enactment and as the law still is in England. The case of Thacker v. Hardy[31] is most frequently cited. The head-note fairly summarizes the opinions of four very eminent judges. It is as follows:\nThe plaintiff, a broker, was employed by the defendant to speculate for him upon the Stock Exchange: to the knowledge of the plaintiff the defendant did not intend to accept the stock bought for him, or to deliver the stock sold for him, but expected that the plaintiff would so arrange matters that nothing but differences should be payable by him; the plaintiff knew that unless he could arrange matters for the defendant as the latter expected, the defendant would be unable to meet the engagements which the plaintiff might enter into for him. The plaintiff accordingly entered into contracts on behalf of the defendant, upon which the plaintiff became personally liable; and he sued the defendant for indemnity against the liability incurred by him and for commission as broker:\u2014\nHeld, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover; for the employment of the plaintiff by the defendant was not against public policy, and was not illegal at common law, and, further, was not in the nature of a gaming and wagering contract against the provisions of 8 & 9 Vict., c. 109, s. 18.\nThere are several quite recent decisions in England to the same effect: see Franklin v. Dawson[32]; Woodward v. Wolfe[33].\nIn Halsbury (2nd Ed.), vol. 15, at p. 493, it is stated:\nIf one who is desirous of \u201cspeculating\u201d employs a broker on the Stock Exchange to buy or sell for him, their relation is that of principal and agent. The broker charges a commission for his services, and a rise or fall in the price of the stocks purchased or sold does not affect him. If such be the case, there is nothing at stake between the parties, and there is no wager. As long, therefore, as the relation of the parties is really only that of broker and client, the contract between them cannot itself be a wager, even although the broker may know that the client does not expect to be called upon to settle the transaction except by the payment of differences.\nIn the case of Forget v. Ostigny[34], the same principles were applied by the Privy Council in an appeal from Quebec. It is said there by the Lord Chancellor at p. 322 of the report:\nThe appellant was employed by the respondent as his mandatory or agent to make certain contracts of purchase and sale on his behalf. The contracts made, which were unquestionably within the authority given by the respondent, were certainly not gaming contracts as between the parties to them. They were real transactions: the shares purchased and sold were in every case delivered, and the price of them paid or received, as the case might be. All this is not in dispute. The appellant having entered into these contracts as agent for the respondent, the latter was prim\u00e2 facie bound to indemnify the former against any liability incurred in respect of them. He was, on the other hand, exclusively entitled to the benefit of them. If the shares purchased increased in value the result was a gain to the respondent and did not involve any loss to the appellant. If, on the other hand, the shares decreased in value, while the respondent sustained a loss no gain resulted to the appellant. In neither contingency, therefore, did the respondent\u2019s gain involve a loss to the appellant. His remuneration was in any event a fixed commission of \u00bc per cent. It would be, of course, an abuse of language to apply the term \u201cbet\u201d to such a transaction. Their Lordships cannot think that it is any more legitimate to speak of it as a gaming contract between the appellant and the respondent.\nI think that from these decisions it is clear that the transactions involved in the present case were not gaming or wagering transactions within the law and were valid and enforceable unless prohibited by section 231 of the Criminal Code.\nThe present section 231 originated in an Act passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1888, being 51 Vict., chap. 42, entitled \u201cAn Act respecting Gaming in Stocks and Merchandise.\u201d This Act was introduced by the following preamble:\nWhereas gaming and wagering on the rise and fall in value of stocks and merchandise are detrimental to commercial and public morality, and places affording facilities for such gaming and wagering, commonly called bucket shops, are being established; and it is expedient to prevent such gaming and wagering, to punish the persons engaged in them, and to prohibit and punish the opening and maintaining of places therefor, and the frequenting thereof.\nThen followed provisions which are in substance the same as those subsequently incorporated in section 231 of the Criminal Code. This section reads as follows:\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to five years\u2019 imprisonment, and to a fine of five hundred dollars, who, with the intent to make gain or profit by the rise or fall in price of any stock of any incorporated or unincorporated company or undertaking, either in Canada or elsewhere, or of any goods, wares or merchandise,\n(a) without the bona fide intention of acquiring any such shares, goods, wares or merchandise, or of selling the same, as the case may be, makes or signs, or authorizes to be made or signed, any contract or agreement, oral or written, purporting to be for the sale or purchase of any shares of stock, goods, wares or merchandise; or\n(b) makes or signs, or authorizes to be made or signed, any contract or agreement, oral or written, purporting to be for the sale or purchase of any such shares of stock, goods, wares or merchandise in respect of which no delivery of the thing sold or purchased is made or received, and without the bona fide intention to make or receive such delivery.\n2. It is not an offence under this section if the broker of the purchaser receives delivery, on his behalf, of the articles sold, notwithstanding that such broker retains or pledges the same as security for the advance of the purchase money or any part thereof.\nTransactions on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange have been the subject of much litigation in the Prairie Provinces and have given rise to the expression of very divergent views in the courts. Most of the judges who held such transactions in some respect similar to the present to be of a kind prohibited by section 231, have based their decisions on views expressed by some of the judges of this Court in the case of Beamish v. Richardson[35]. Notwithstanding those views, I think it is still open to us to determine this case according to our own views as to the interpretation and application of the section.\nThe transactions under consideration in the case of Forget v. Ostigny[36] already referred to, took place before the Act of 1888 came into force, but it had been enacted before the Privy Council came to give its decision and this reference was made to it by the Lord Chancellor:\nMuch stress was laid on the fact that the respondent never asked for delivery of any of the shares purchased, and that the appellant never tendered such delivery. The question whether a contract is intended to be executed by delivery according to the obligations expressed upon the face of it is no doubt an important test for determining whether it is a real one or only a gambling arrangement under the guise of a commercial contract.\nIn the Act passed by the Dominion Parliament in 1888 (51 Vict., c. 42) with a view of putting down what were then known as \u201cbucket shops,\u201d it is provided (sect. 1) that: \u201cEvery one who * * * with the intent to make gain or profit by the rise or fall in price of any stock of any incorporated or unincorporated company or undertaking, * * * or of any goods, wares or merchandise makes * * * any contract or agreement, oral or written, purporting to be for the sale or purchase of any such shares of stock, goods, wares or merchandise, in respect of which no delivery of the thing sold or purchased is made or received, and without the bona fide intention to make or receive such delivery; and every one who acts, aids or abets in the making or signing of any such contract or agreement is guilty of a misdemeanour.\u201d\nA proviso was, however, added in the following terms: \u201cbut the foregoing provisions shall not apply to cases where the broker of the purchaser receives delivery, on his behalf, of the article sold, notwithstanding that such broker retains or pledges the same as security for the advance of the purchase-money or any part thereof.\u201d\nTheir Lordships think this proviso was enacted by way of precaution only, inasmuch as they cannot doubt that, where a real contract of purchase has been made and carried out by a broker on behalf of a principal, delivery to the broker is delivery to the principal just as much as if it had been actually made to himself.\nIn the present case, the respondent might at any time on tendering the balance due in respect of any of the shares purchased have required the appellant to deliver them to him. As has been pointed out, he received the dividends upon them, and any increase in their value enured exclusively for his benefit, whilst if there were a diminution of value the loss was exclusively his.\nIt seems to me that delivery to or by a vendee of the defendant would be as effective as delivery to or by an agent.\nThe purpose of the statute was to prohibit bucket shops and to render void gaming or wagering transactions. There can be no suggestion that there was any bucket shop transaction involved here, once it is admitted that real contracts were entered into. Nor do I think there was any gaming or wagering as those words are construed in law. There was, it is true, speculation, which is quite a different thing. The contracts entered into for the defendant were real; they were not fictitious. They called for delivery and all the parties thereto understood them to be enforceable. I think the word \u201cdelivery\u201d in a criminal statute should be construed broadly enough to include anything which would be considered as delivery under the Sales of Goods Act. The contracts entered into were similar to the contracts on which practically the whole of the grain business of Canada is carried out and similar to contracts which have been in use on stock and commodity exchanges since long before the enactment of the legislation under consideration.\nNow, if the contracts were valid and enforceable contracts entered into by the Reliance Grain Company on behalf of the defendant and the defendant fully understood the nature of the obligation which was being entered into on his behalf, I do not think that he should be relieved of the responsibility for moneys advanced by the plaintiffs to enable him to carry out binding obligations which had been undertaken on his behalf, even if he himself never intended to fulfill these obligations by delivery of the grain but intended to relieve himself of such obligations by so arranging things that the delivery might be made by others. For these reasons I think that the appeal should succeed and the judgment of the courts below be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiffs for the amount of the notes sued upon with interest at the proper rate or rates. I have not entered into any discussion of the views expressed by former members of the Court in the case of Beamish v. Richardson (1), in view of the reference thereto made by My Lord the Chief Justice.\nTaking this view, I do not think it necessary to discuss the other grounds of appeal put forward on behalf of the plaintiffs.\nI concur in the suggestion that the respondent, if so advised, shall have liberty to have a reference to the Local Registrar of the Court of King\u2019s Bench of the judicial district of Regina, to ascertain the correct figures if the parties cannot agree.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cross, Jonah, Hugg & Forbes.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1938: May 16, 17; 1938: December 19.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nContracts\u2014Covenant in restraint of trade\u2014Whether binding\u2014Principles applicable\u2014Nature of covenant\u2014Reasonableness\u2014Circumstances\u2014Onus.\nBoth respondents, Connors Bros. Ltd. and Lewis Connors & Sons Ltd., packed and sold sardines and other fish in the Bay of Fundy area in New Brunswick. By an agreement of June 9, 1925, Connors Bros. Ltd. agreed to purchase on demand within a certain time appellant\u2019s shares in Lewis Connors & Sons Ltd. Appellant was engaged as manager of the latter company. By an agreement of October 2, 1926, appellant sold his shares in Lewis Connors & Sons Ltd. to Connors Bros. Ltd., and his employment as manager was terminated. In this agreement, and in the earlier agreement in practically the same terms, appellant covenanted that he would not \u201cdirectly or indirectly engage in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada.\u201d In April, 1937, appellant claimed that said covenant was not binding, being such as should not be enforced in restraint of trade, and took proceedings, by way of originating summons, to have the question determined.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, 13 m.p.R. 68, and judgment of Baxter C.J., 12 m.p.R. 102) (Crocket and Kerwin JJ. dissenting): The said quoted covenant should be declared to be unenforceable.\nPer The Chief Justice, Davis and Hudson JJ.: A covenant in restraint of trade is prima facie invalid; the onus is on the person who seeks to enforce it to show that it is valid\u2014one which was reasonably necessary for his protection at the time when it was entered into (and is not otherwise contrary of public policy). The nature of the business, the position of the covenantor, and the scope of the covenant must be considered. In the present case the appellant, brought up from boyhood in the sardine business, was only 37 years of age at the date of the covenant, which was restrictive for his lifetime. Upon all the facts and circumstances in evidence (and assuming that the words \u201cdirectly or indirectly engage in the sardine business\u201d are capable of precise definition and are not so vague as to be void for uncertainty), the respondents had not shown that the terms of the covenant could pass the test of reasonableness as between the parties.\nVancouver Malt v. Vancouver Breweries, [1934] A.C. 181, at 189-190, and Gilford Motor Co. v. Home, [1933] 1 Ch. 935, at 958, referred to.\nPer The Chief Justice: In exacting the stipulation, the controlling shareholders of Connors Bros. Ltd. were not chiefly applying their minds to the protection of the business of Lewis Connors & Sons Ltd. or of themselves as purchasers of shares in that company; their aim was to eliminate competition and get control of the business of Canadian sardines in themselves through Connors Bros. Ltd. and it was the business thus controlled with respect to which they were protecting themselves; therefore the agreement itself provides no evidence of serious weight as to its reasonableness in respect to the protection of the business of Lewis Connors & Sons Ltd. It was incumbent upon respondents to show clearly\u2014and this they failed to do\u2014facts from which it could be determined (as a question of law). that the comprehensive restriction was reasonably necessary to protect the interest acquired. (As ancillary to a contract of employment, the stipulation, on its face, was clearly unreasonable).\nVancouver Malt v. Vancouver Breweries, [1934] A.C. 181, at 190-191; British Reinforced Concrete Co. Ltd. v. Schelff, [1921] 2 Ch. 563, at 574-576, and other cases, referred to.\nThe Chief Justice also discussed (but expressed no final opinion upon) the question as to detriment to the public interest. Having regard to ss. 2 (1) (b), 2 (1) (c) (v) (vi) and 32 of the Combines Investigation Act (R.S.C., 1927, c. 26) (s. 498 (c), Cr. Code, also referred to), it may not be that enhancement of prices is the only relevant form of public detriment in this country.\nPer Crocket and Kerwin JJ. (dissenting): Appellant\u2019s covenant was not one in gross but was one to be gauged by the principles applicable to a covenant exacted by the purchaser of the good-will of a business. (These principles discussed, and cases cited. Nordenfelt\u2019s case, [1894] A.C. 535, is applicable to the present case). In the circumstances of the case, the restraint gave to Connors Bros. Ltd., with respect to the business and good-will purchased by it, nothing more than reasonable protection against something which it was entitled to be protected against. In no respect (upon the evidence) could the operation of the covenant be said to be injurious to the public. Appellant is barred from engaging in the sardine business in Canada as owner, in partnership with others Or as a shareholder of an incorporated company engaged in such business in Canada. (It was held inadvisable to answer in the present proceedings a question raised by the originating summons, but not answered in the courts below, as to whether appellant was barred from working at that business in Canada as an employee).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1] dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Baxter C.J.[2] deciding against him certain questions raised for determination upon an originating summons, issued on appellant\u2019s application, for an interpretation and construction of, and a declaration as to the rights of the parties herein under, a covenant contained, in practically the same terms, in each of two agreements in writing; which covenant the appellant claimed was not binding upon him, being such as should not be enforced in restraint of trade. The covenant in question (as contained in each agreement) is set out, and the material facts and circumstances sufficiently appear, in the judgments now reported. Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. The appeal to this Court was allowed, the judgments below set aside, and judgment directed to be entered declaring that the covenant in question, in so far as it prohibits the appellant from engaging directly or indirectly in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada, is unenforceable; appellant to have his costs throughout. Crocket and Kerwin JJ. dissented.\nJ. H. Drummie for the appellant.\nC. F. Inches K.C. and A. N. Carter for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the reasons as well as in the conclusion of Mr. Justice Davis.\nIt is well settled that, at common law, all contracts, covenants and stipulations in restraint of trade of themselves are contrary to public policy and therefore void. If that is a complete description of the transaction it is contrary to public policy and the courts will not enforce it. This appears, not to be upon the ground that the common law regarded such arrangements as necessarily harmful to the public interest, but because the policy of the common law has always been that the courts should not enforce them unless they can be justified by reason of special circumstances (Morris v. Saxelby)[3]. The onus of proving the facts upon which such justification rests is upon the party who alleges justification. Once the facts are ascertained, the question of reasonableness is a question of law for the court.\nIt would seem to be involved in the general principle thus stated (McEllistrim v. Ballymacelligot[4], Vancouver Malt and Sake Brewing Co. Ltd. v. Vancouver Breweries, Ltd.[5]) that a \u201cbare covenant not to compete,\u201d to quote from Lord Macmillan\u2019s judgment in the last mentioned case at p. 190, will not be enforced. \u201cCovenants restrictive of competition,\u201d still quoting from the same passage,\nwhich have been sustained have all been ancillary to some main transaction, contract, or arrangement, and have been found justified because they were reasonably necessary to render that transaction, contract or arrangement effective.\nAs regards the stipulation in the agreement of June, 1925, the respondents, as their principal ground of justification, take their stand upon the proposition that this stipulation is ancillary to a contract for the sale and purchase of shares in Lewis Connors & Sons, Ltd. (hereafter referred to under the designation \u201cLewis Connors\u201d) between the appellant and the respondents Connors Bros. In their factum the respondents state their position thus:\nThe principle clearly established by this case [the Nordenfelt case[6]] is that where a stockholder upon transfer of his stock, binds himself not to compete with the corporation, the agreement is generally enforced on the ground that ownership of stock carries with it an interest in the good-will of the business, and that the covenant is reasonably necessary to protect the good-will.\nThe suggestion was made by the appellant in the Court below that the covenants under discussion in this case were merely restraints on competition (i.e., covenants in gross, so-called) and as such void as in Vancouver Malt Co. v. Vancouver Breweries[7] (where nothing was sold, and the covenant was consequently held invalid). The suggestion is simply contrary to the fact. The covenants in the case at bar formed part of contracts for the sale of shares in a business, as the covenant in the Nordenfelt case[8], with which this case is on all fours. In that case Nordenfelt was selling shares in a company\u2014not a controlling interest\u2014as a part of the contract by which he covenanted not to compete. The good-will was treated as an interest in the shares and the covenant was held not to be \u201cin gross\u201d but as falling within the special category of restrictive covenants contained in contracts for the sale of a business.\nIn determining whether the restrictive covenants challenged in this case were reasonable as between the parties the very lenient rules governing contracts for the sale of a business must be applied as they have been applied by the learned Chief Justice.\nI shall first deal with this contention.\nHave facts been proved by the respondents which establish the proposition that this sweeping stipulation was \u201creasonably necessary to render\u201d this contract for the transfer of shares \u201ceffective,\u201d or, to put it in other words, in order to enable the respondents to enjoy what they acquired under it? The restriction, as regards Canada, is unlimited both as to time and area. It is for the plaintiffs to show that the restriction in order to be \u201creasonably effectual\u201d must be Dominion-wide (Vancouver Malt v. Vancouver Breweries[9].\nThe fact that the purpose of the McLeans, the controlling shareholders of Connors Bros., as was well understood by all parties, was to eliminate competition, not only by Lewis Connors but of the appellant and of his father personally, and to do this with the object of establishing a practical monopoly in the business of packing and selling Canadian sardines, is, to my mind, decisive on one point. In exacting the stipulation in question, they were not exclusively or chiefly applying their minds to the protection of the business of Lewis Connors or of themselves as purchasers of shares in Lewis Connors. Their aim was to get a monopoly in the business of Canadian sardines controlled by themselves through Connors Bros. and it was the business thus controlled with respect to which they were protecting themselves.\nIt follows, of course, that the agreement itself provides no evidence of serious weight as to the reasonableness of the arrangement in respect of the protection of the business of Lewis Connors. It cannot be said that there is any presumption that Connors Bros, were merely protecting, what they were acquiring. They were getting for themselves, for their own business, protection against competition; and it is perfectly plain from the evidence that it was for this they were paying for the shares a price considerably above the market value, more than the shares themselves would have been worth.\nIn these circumstances, and such being the purposes and objects of the parties to the agreement, it was incumbent upon the respondents to show clearly that it was necessary for the protection of the interest they acquired in the Lewis Connors business to exact this comprehensive stipulation.\nIn June, 1925, when the agreement was made, it appears from the evidence that the only competition encountered by Canadian sardine packers in Canada was that arising from the import of Norwegian sardines. The French sardines, it may be assumed, being of a higher grade and fetching much higher prices, did not come into the same field. There were, according to the evidence, something like 30,000 cases of Norwegian sardines sold in the course of a year in the Dominion. The Lewis Connors Canadian business amounted to 26,000 odd cases in the year 1925. The only evidence as to the scope in point of territory of the Canadian business is that given in cross-examination by the appellant and the strongest statement that can be found in his evidence is in this question and answer:\nQ. Is it fair to say that Lewis Connors & Sons, Ltd., were selling in all the provinces of Canada?\nA. I think perhaps they were selling some in pretty near every province in Canada.\nThere are some other statements with regard to other countries extremely vague and of doubtful import which have really no bearing on the point immediately before us.\nNow, let it be observed, first of all, that there is a very considerable territory in the Dominion of Canada which is not included in any province. There are the Yukon Territory and the North West Territories. There is not a word of evidence to indicate that the business of Lewis Connors extended into, for example, the Yukon Territory; and yet the covenant, as I read it, and according to the construction contended for by the respondents, would seem to exclude the appellant from acting as agent in Dawson for any concern other than Connors Bros. or Lewis Connors selling French or Norwegian sardines there.\nBut this is not the strongest point. This statement of the appellant cannot fairly be read as a positive affirmation that Lewis Connors were in 1925 or 1926 engaged in selling sardines in all the provinces of Canada. It is a hesitating statement \u201cI think perhaps,\u201d and the scope of the area is defined as \u201cpretty near.\u201d Clearly, it excludes one or more of the provinces, and there is nothing to indicate the province excluded. It may be British Columbia. It may be Quebec.\nThe Canadian business for 1936 was less than the Canadian business for 1925. Lewis Connors were entirely under the control of Connors Bros., all of the directors of the former being directors of the latter. The packing establishment of Lewis Connors was discontinued at the end of 1925, and thereafter all the packing for them was done by Connors Bros. It is clear enough that any considerable expansion of the business of Lewis Connors was not aimed at or expected. It follows that the appellant is by this stipulation excluded from business and employment which, so far as the evidence shows, there is no reason to suppose would be likely to injure the business of Lewis Connors.\nBut there is another consideration. This evidence of Bernard Connors speaks of \u201cselling some\u201d that \u201che thinks, perhaps\u201d were sold in \u201cpretty near every province in Canada.\u201d Now, six of the provinces extend over very wide territory. There is nothing to show that this indefinite \u201csome\u201d sold in, for example, some locality in the province of Ontario, would be affected by the employment of the appellant in some other far remote locality in another part of the province, and yet, strictly, the evidence leaves us at that point. It is consistent with the assumptions that there were no sales in one or more provinces and that in any given province business was limited to a single locality. The onus is on the respondents to establish the facts. They are in control of Lewis Connors. They have the books of Lewis Connors in their possession. It would have been in their power to adduce precise evidence as to the localities in which Lewis Connors were carrying on business in 1925 and 1926 and the extent of the business in each locality. Since, as the export and shipping manager of Connors Bros. says, the Lewis Connors customers of 1925 were retained, there could have been no difficulty in showing, not only the provinces in which they had customers, but the locality in each province to which their goods were shipped. Furthermore, there should have been no difficulty in showing localities in which retail sales took place. These facts should have been adduced by the respondents as facts necessary to be considered in order to decide whether or not the restriction was a reasonable one, that is to say, reasonably necessary to make the contract for the sale of shares effective or, to apply Lord Parker\u2019s words (Morris v. Saxelby[10], supra, at p. 709) whether or not, if the plaintiff should engage at any time during his natural life anywhere in the Dominion of Canada directly or indirectly in the business of packing or selling sardines, \u201cit would in all probability enure to the injury of\u201d Lewis Connors or of Connors Bros, as purchasers of an interest in that business.\nI quote as apposite the following passage from the judgment of Lord Blanesburgh (then Younger L.J.) in British Reinforced Concrete Engineering Co. Ltd. v. Schelff[11]:\nI should have thought that the law on this subject was clear. It is the business sold which is the legitimate subject of protection, and it is for its protection in the hands of its purchaser, and for its protection only, that the vendor\u2019s restrictive covenant can be legitimately exacted. A restrictive covenant by a grocer on the sale of his business in a country town, if it would be unreasonable and void when the purchaser was acquiring it as his sole business, does not become valid if the purchasers are, say, Messrs. Lipton, with branches everywhere. The point is perhaps most clearly brought out in those recent cases in the House of Lords in which the essential distinction between vendors\u2019 and employees\u2019 restrictive covenants has been so clearly laid down. Take, for instance, the justification for a wider vendor\u2019s covenant in Lord Shaw\u2019s speech in Mason\u2019s case[12]: \u201cIf the contract, for instance, be for the sale of a business to another for full consideration or price, there may be elements going in the strongest degree to shew that such a contract\u2014in so far as it restrains the vendor from becoming a rival of the business whose goodwill he has sold and which he has bargained he shall not oppose\u2014* * * is enforceable, and, indeed, that declinature by the law to enforce it would amount to a denial of justice.\u201d Again in Saxelby\u2019s case[13] Lord Parker says: \u201cIn the Nordenfelt case[14], that which it was required to protect was the good-will of a business transferred by the covenantor to the covenantee, and that against which protection was sought was competition by the covenantor throughout the area in which such business was carried on.\u201d He does not say \u201cgoing to be carried on.\u201d Take again Lord Watson\u2019s observations in the Nordenjelt case[15]: \u201cI think it is now generally conceded that it is to the advantage of the public to allow a trader who has established a lucrative business to dispose of it to a successor by whom it may be efficiently carried on. That object could not be accomplished if, upon the score of public policy, the law reserved to the seller an absolute and indefeasible right to start a rival concern the day after he sold. Accordingly, it has been determined judicially, that in cases where the purchaser, for his own protection, obtains an obligation restraining the seller from competing with him, within bounds which having regard to the nature of the business are reasonable and are limited in respect of space, the obligation is not obnoxious to public policy, and is therefore capable of being enforced. Whether\u2014when the circumstances of the case are such that a restraint unlimited in space becomes reasonably necessary in order to protect the purchaser against any attempt by the seller to resume the business which he sold\u2014a covenant imposing that restraint must be invalidated by the principle of public policy is the substance of the question which your Lordships have to consider in this appeal.\u201d Lord Herschell in the same case says[16]: \u201cI think that a covenant entered into in connection with the sale of the good-will of a business must be valid where the full benefit of the purchase cannot be otherwise secured to the purchaser.\u201d In all these cases the business sold is treated as the subject of permissible protection; and similar judicial utterances could be indefinitely multiplied.\nAnd in my judgment when the matter is looked at on principle these statements necessarily mean what they say.\nThe respondents also advance an argument, not very precisely stated, based upon some supposed relation between the subject-matter of the stipulation and the appellant\u2019s connection with the respondents Connors Bros, while \u201che was interested in it as a shareholder, director and plant manager.\u201d In my view, it is not necessary to enquire into the question whether there is any \u201cmain transaction, contract or arrangement\u201d disclosed by the evidence to which the stipulation in question could be said to be \u201cancillary\u201d and to which this particular argument can apply. In the pertinent sense, on the face of it, it appears to me to be plain that, as ancillary to a contract of employment, the stipulations under consideration are, to borrow once more a phrase of Lord Macmillan\u2019s in Vancouver Malt Co. v. Vancouver Breweries[17], \u201cout of all reason\u201d.\nI am also far from satisfied that it was necessary for the protection of the Lewis Connors business outside of Canada to prohibit the appellant engaging in the sardine business in his own name in any part of the world for a period of ten years. In 1925, the foreign sales of sardines by Lewis Connors amounted to a little over 26,000 cases. The sales in the Dominion of Canada for the same year amounted to a few hundred cases more. In 1936, the foreign sales had increased by about 5,000 cases; the Canadian sales having been diminished by about 1,000 cases. We have no figures for 1935. In view of these figures, I find myself unable to accept the proposition that the prohibition of the use by the appellant of his own name during the period of ten years succeeding April, 1925, in any single locality outside of Canada in any sardine business was necessary for the protection of this very limited foreign business of Lewis Connors.\nI may also add that I think the evidence falls far short of establishing facts sufficient to support the conclusion that such a restriction was necessary for the protection of the foreign trade of Connors Bros. This provision with regard to the use of the name \u201cConnors\u201d would appear to be severable; but the unnecessarily sweeping character of it points to the conclusion that the parties were not really applying their minds to the question whether or not the restriction was one which their legitimate interests required.\nThere is another most important consideration. I am inclined to think that the evidence establishes detriment to the public interest. The aim was admittedly to create a monopoly in the packing of Canadian sardines and there appears to be no doubt that it was successful. I am not sure that, having regard to sections 2(1) (b) and 2(1) (c) (v) and (vi) and section 32 of the Combines Investigation Act (R.S.C., 1927, ch. 26), enhancement of prices is the only relevant form of public detriment in this country. The policy of the law as manifested by those sections and section 498 (c) of the Criminal Code seems to condemn restrictions upon competition even in the case of transactions of this character, that is to say, where an interest has been acquired in a business quite independently of the effect of the transaction upon prices. I do not pursue this topic further and I express no final opinion upon the point in the absence of argument.\nIt has been held by this Court (Weidman v. Shragge)[18], that, in considering whether an agreement in restraint of trade falls within section 498 of the Criminal Code as unduly preventing or lessening competition, the fact that the agreement is reasonable from the point of view of the parties, is not conclusive; and in that particular case it was held that the agreement was invalid. So, in applying section 32 of the Combines Investigation Act, it is by no means clear that reasonableness as between the parties concludes the question whether or not a combine is \u201clikely to operate against the interest of the public, whether consumers, producers or others.\u201d\nI should add that I do not understand that the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick, in discussing the topic of injury to the public, is suggesting that enhancement of price is the only pertinent form of injury. In speaking of enhancement of price, I have in mind the explanation in the Adelaide Steamship Company\u2019s case[19] of the phrase \u201cpernicious monopoly\u201d employed by Bowen L.J. in Nordenfelt\u2019s case[20] as a monopoly having the effect of increasing prices.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The appellant is Bernard Connors and the respondents are Connors Bros., Limited, and Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited. The proceedings were commenced by an originating summons issued by the appellant under Rule 54A of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for the determination of three questions of interpretation, which the appellant alleged arose under covenants contained in two certain agreements dated respectively June 9th, 1925, and October 2nd, 1926. The three questions submitted are as follows:\n(a) Whether, upon construction of the provision written variously in the said agreements as \u201cwill not directly or indirectly engage in any other sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada\u201d and \u201cwill not directly or indirectly engage in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada\u201d the said Bernard Connors, the covenantor mentioned in both agreements, is at the present time and shall be thenceforward barred from engaging in the sardine business in Canada as owner by himself or in partnership with others of such a business or as a shareholder of an incorporated company engaged in such business in Canada.\n(b) Whether, upon construction of the words \u201cwill not directly or indirectly engage in\u201d used in said covenants the said Bernard Connors is barred at law from working at the sardine business in Canada as an employee of any person, persons, firm or corporation engaged in the sardine business in Canada.\n(c) Whether, upon construction of the said covenants and particularly the following words contained therein \u201cnor for a period of ten years from the 30th day of April, A.D. 1925, use the name of Connors in connection with the sardine business in any country whatsoever,\u201d the said Bernard Connors may at this time and thenceforward lawfully use the name of \u201cConnors\u201d in connection with the sardine business in Canada.\nThe Chief Justice of New Brunswick[21], before whom the motion came, determined that Question (a) should be answered in the affirmative and Question (c) in the negative. As to Question (b), the Chief Justice considered that there existed \u201ca wide difference between the plaintiff working at a machine which seals the tins of sardines and superintending the operations of a new company,\u201d and in the exercise of the discretion given by the Rule, declined to give any answer. Upon appeal to the Appeal Division[22] his order was affirmed.\nEvidence was led on behalf of both parties before the Chief Justice, and from it and the exhibits filed the relevant facts appear to be as follows.\nSome years ago Lewis Connors, the father of the appellant, and Patrick W. Connors, an uncle, commenced a fish business in the Passamaquoddy area of the Bay of Fundy in the Province of New Brunswick. The undertaking thrived and in time it was transferred to Connors Bros., Limited. At an early age the appellant had entered the business and by 1923, when he was about thirty-five years of age, had been working in it for a considerable period. In that year the shareholders of Connors Bros., Limited, sold their holdings to A. Neil McLean and associates, who formed a new company bearing the same name. It is the latter company that is one of the respondents. Shortly after the consummation of this sale by the transfer of the assets of the old company to the new, Lewis Connors, the appellant and another son purchased a factory in the same area and, first as a partnership and later under the name of a company incorporated as Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited (the other respondent), carried on the same kind of business as Connors Bros., Limited. Some comment has been made as to the manner in which this business was conducted but it is unnecessary to deal with these strictures. It is important, however, to realize that Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, packed and sold the same products as Connors Bros., Limited, consisting of kippered herrings, canned herrings, finnan haddies, clams, flaked fish, chicken haddies, and sardines. The most important of these was the last named, and it is common ground that the Passamaquoddy area is the only place in the Dominion of Canada where sardines may be packed in a practical and economical manner.\nWhether as a result of the ensuing competition or because, as A. Neil McLean testified, Lewis Connors approached him with a view of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, selling out to Connors Bros., Limited, negotiations ensued between the rival companies and as a result an option agreement dated April 30th, 1925, was entered into between Lewis Connors and the appellant, of the first part, and A. Neil McLean and Allan McLean, of the second part. At this time the issued capital stock of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, consisted of $50,000 preferred and $100,000 common stock, and under the agreement the Connors were to sell to the McLeans $25,000 preferred and $52,500 common stock in exchange for $25,000 preferred and $30,000 common stock of Connors Bros., Limited. In substance, the latter company was thus acquiring a controlling interest in Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, but, by the purchase of a comparatively small number of shares, Lewis Connors and the appellant, together with Patrick W. Connors, might easily secure control of Connors Bros., Limited, and to obviate this a Voting Trust Agreement of May 23rd, 1925, was signed. It is not necessary to enter into the details of this trust agreement, but ultimately the option contained in the document of April 30th, 1925, was exercised and an agreement of June 9th of the same year, implementing the terms of the option agreement, was entered into between Connors Bros., Limited, of the first part, and Lewis Connors and the appellant, of the second part. This agreement provides: (1) That with reference to the remaining outstanding capital stock of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited ($25,000 preferred and $47,500 common), Connors Bros., Limited, would at any time within five years from January 1st, 1926, and on demand from any of the stockholders of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, who at the time of such demand held any part of the remaining outstanding issued capital stock of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, purchase the holdings of such stockholders so making such a demand on the basis of $35,000 cash for $72,500 capital stock. (2) That Connors Bros., Limited, should relieve and discharge Lewis Connors and the appellant from all personal liability with respect to the bank account of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited. (3) That a measure of co-operation between the two companies, which is not of importance in the present inquiry, should exist.\n(4) The said Lewis Connors and Bernard Connors agree with said Connors Bros., Limited, that they will not either directly or indirectly engage in any other sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada, nor directly or indirectly use the brands of either Connors Bros., Limited, or Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, in the Dominion of Canada, or elsewhere, nor, for a period of ten years from the 30th day of April, 1925, use the name of Connors in connection with the sardine business in any country whatsoever.\nThis is one of the covenants, the construction of which is sought and the legality of which is impugned.\nBy another agreement bearing even date Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, engaged the appellant for five years as manager, the salary being guaranteed by Connors Bros., Limited.\nThe appellant commenced his duties as manager of the factory in West Saint John and, when the business was transferred to Black\u2019s Harbour, he went there but was not satisfied. Disputes had arisen between the appellant and the two companies and finally by an agreement of October 2nd, 1926, between the appellant, of the first part, Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, of the second part, Connors Bros., Limited, of the third part, and the two McLeans, of the fourth part, the appellant sold his 172 shares of the capital stock of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, to Connors Bros., Limited, for $11,416, and his employment agreement was ended by mutual consent. By clause 3, which is the second covenant, the construction and legality of which is in question:\nThe party of the first part also agrees with the said parties of the second and third parts that he will not directly or indirectly engage in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada nor directly or indirectly use the brands of either Connors Bros., Limited, or Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, in the Dominion of Canada or elsewhere, nor for a period of ten years from the 30th day of April, A.D. 1925, use the name of Connors in connection with sardine business in any country whatsoever.\nThe terms of clause 5 may be more conveniently referred to when dealing with the appellant\u2019s contention that in any event he was, by it, released from the burden of the restrictive covenant contained in the agreement of June 9th, 1925. Within a comparatively short time after the execution of the agreement of October 2nd, 1926, the appellant commenced a fish business under the name of Harbour Packing Company, which he subsequently had incorporated. Still later he started a business under the name, \u201cThe B. Connors Fish Company,\u201d also subsequently incorporated. Throughout this period, the appellant and these companies were dealing in all the products already mentioned, except sardines. Lewis Connors died in 1934. In the meantime the respondents had continued their operations, of which the packing and merchandizing of sardines was the larger and more important part. On April 15th, 1937, the appellant intimated that he considered the two restrictive covenants not binding upon him and asked for a formal release. Upon this being refused, the present proceedings were commenced.\nThe question immediately arises as to the principles upon which the restricting covenant contained in the agreement of June 9th, 1925, is to be construed. Are the rules applicable to a covenant exacted by the purchaser of the good-will of a business to be applied? It was argued that the business sold was one belonging to Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, and that the agreement by the appellant was intended to prevent competition per se and is, therefore, invalid. Such a contention was advanced in N ordenfelt\u2019s case[23], and was rejected. There, Nordenfelt had previously transferred his business to a limited company and it was upon the sale of the business by the latter to the respondent that the personal covenant of Nordenfelt was insisted upon. The Court treated the position on the same footing as if the obligations of the covenant had been undertaken in connection with the direct transfer by Nordenfelt to the purchaser. It is true that he was the only one interested in the original business, but without determining how far that principle is to be extended, it is, in my view, applicable to the circumstances of the present case.\nThe appellant was an active participant in the business, as well of the first Connors Bros, company as of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited. He was a shareholder, to a substantial extent, in each company and took an active part in the negotiations leading to the sale by the latter company to Connors Bros. Limited. He secured his proportion of the preferred and common stock of Connors Bros. Limited, in exchange for his holdings in Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, and an agreement by Connors Bros. Limited, to purchase, for cash, his share of the remaining outstanding capital stock in the event of his desire to sell. Furthermore, he was one of the guarantors of the bank account of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, and from this liability he was relieved in pursuance of the agreement of June 9th, 1925.\nUpon this narrative I conclude that the appellant\u2019s covenant is not one in gross but, on the contrary, is one to be gauged by the principles mentioned. These are now well settled. Lord Macnaghten sets them out at page 565 of the Nordenfelt case[24] in these words:\nThe true view at the present time, I think, is this: The public have an interest in every person\u2019s carrying on his trade freely: so has the individual. All interference with individual liberty of action in trading, and all restraints of trade of themselves, if there is nothing more, are contrary to public policy, and therefore void. That is the general rule. But there are exceptions: restraints of trade and interference with individual liberty of action may be justified by the special circumstances of a particular case. It is a sufficient justification, and indeed it is the only justification, if the restriction is reasonable\u2014reasonable, that is, in reference to the interests of the parties concerned and reasonable in reference to the interests of the public, so framed and so guarded as to afford adequate protection to the party in whose favour it is imposed, while at the same time it is in no way injurious to the public. That, I think, is the fair result of all the authorities.\nHis judgment was not authoritatively approved until Mason\u2019s case[25], and its full effect was not explained until Morris v. Saxelby[26]. In the latter case[27] Lord Atkinson quoted with approval that part of Lord Mac-naghten\u2019s judgment in the Nordenfelt case[28] set out above, and at the conclusion of the passage pointed out that Lord Macnaghten had used the plural, \u201cparties concerned,\u201d in the earlier portion of the passage, meaning to include both the covenantor and covenantee,\u2014\nwhile in the latter portion of the passage he merely speaks of \u201cprotection\u201d being given to the covenantee, which does not injure the public. But in the opening lines of the passage he had already said that the individual (here the covenantor), as well as the public, have an interest in freedom of trading. Lord Atkinson continues:\u2014\nIf it be assumed, as I think it must be, that no person has an abstract right to be protected against competition per se in his trade or business, then the meaning of the entire passage would appear to me to be this. If the restraint affords to the person in whose favour it is imposed nothing more than reasonable protection against something which he is entitled to be protected against, then as between the parties concerned the restraint is to be held to be reasonable in reference to their respective interests, but notwithstanding this the restraint may still be held to be injurious to the public and therefore void; the onus of establishing to the satisfaction of the judge who tries the case facts and circumstances which show that the restraint is of the reasonable character above mentioned resting upon the person alleging that it is of that character, and the onus of showing that, notwithstanding that it is of that character, it is nevertheless injurious to the public and therefore void, resting, in like manner, on the party alleging the latter.\nLord Parker of Waddington, with whom Lord Sumner agrees, phrases the matter in a slightly different form but the substance is the same.\nIn Atwood v. Lamont[29], Lord Justice Younger (with whom Lord Justice Atkin agreed) points out that it had been established by the House of. Lords that it is for the covenantee to show that the restriction sought to be imposed upon the covenantor goes no further than is reasonable for the protection of his business and that the restraint must be reasonable not only in the interests of the covenantee but in the interests of both contracting parties.\nIn Fitch v. Dewes[30], Lord Birkenhead, at page 163, states:\nThe Courts have been generous in elucidating these matters by the enunciation of general principles in the course of the last few years, and I am extremely anxious not to carry this process further to-day; therefore I say plainly and, I hope, simply, that it has for long now been accepted that such an agreement as this, if it is impeached, is to be measured by reference to two considerations: first, is it against the public interest? and, second, does that which has been stipulated for exceed what is required for the protection of the covenantee? It might perhaps be more properly stated, as it has sometimes been with the highest authority stated, does it exceed what is necessary for the protection of both the parties?\nThe Lord Chancellor proceeds to point out that in that case there was required only the consideration of the earlier question.\nComing then to the covenant of June 9th, 1925, the first part provides that so far as the appellant is concerned he \u201cwill not either directly or indirectly engage in any other sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada,\u201d that is, other than the sardine business of Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, as manager of which company he was engaged for a period of five years. On the construction of this sentence, \u201cbusiness\u201d must include packing as well as selling, and in my opinion the restraint affords to Connors Bros., Limited, with respect to the business and good-will purchased by it, nothing more than reasonable protection against something which it was entitled to be protected against. The courts have uniformly refrained from setting out what restriction in point of area or time may be reasonable, and have left these questions to be determined upon a consideration of the circumstances in each particular case. In the present instance, as I have already mentioned, the packing of sardines in Canada is concentrated in the Passarnaquoddy area, and, in my view, it cannot be said to be unreasonable that the appellant should agree not to pack sardines in the Dominion. Sardines were sold by Lewis Connors and Sons, Limited, throughout the world as well as in every province of Canada. And again I hold that the respondents were entitled to accept from appellant a covenant limited to not selling them in Canada. The appellant is not prevented from packing or selling other fish in Canada or elsewhere and as a matter of fact has done so since shortly after October of 1926. This last consideration, to my mind, is conclusive in determining that the covenant is not too wide in point of time, even remembering that the appellant was about thirty-seven years of age in 1925.\nThe evidence is that the price of the sardines to the public has not been increased but, on the contrary, has probably been lowered. The record also discloses that the price paid to the fishermen has not decreased. There is, of course, nothing to prevent anyone else engaging in the sardine business in Canada and I cannot see that the operation of the covenant may be said to be injurious to the public in any respect.\nIt is then contended that the appellant was relieved of his obligations under this covenant by the release contained in clause 5 of the agreement of October 2nd, 1926. That clause is in the following terms:\nThe parties of the second, third and fourth parts hereby release the said party of the first part (the appellant) from all claims and demands of every nature and description which they or either of them have or which hereafter they or either of them may have against the party of the first part by reason of anything to the date of these presents including but without limiting the generality of the foregoing any claims by reason of any shortage in inventory alleged misrepresentation or for alleged improper conduct of the party of the first part in connection with the business of the said Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, or the purchase of an interest therein or stock thereof.\nI am inclined to think that the proper construction of this clause is that it refers only to what the appellant may have done down to the date of the agreement and not to anything that he may have previously agreed to do or refrain from doing. It is significant that the employment agreement was ended by a separate clause. In any event, the insertion of clause 3 in the agreement of October 2nd, 1926, makes it clear that it was never intended that the appellant should be released from the earlier covenant.\nThis conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the terms of that clause, 3, and we are left, therefore, with the question as to whether the appellant is barred for life from engaging in the sardine business in Canada, as owner only. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that he is prevented from so engaging in partnership with others and I think that the Chief Justice of New Brunswick arrived at the proper conclusion that the appellant is also prevented from engaging in such business as a shareholder of an incorporated company engaged in such business in Canada.\nSo far as Question (c) is concerned, the name \u201cConnors\u201d has been registered in Canada as a trade mark in connection with the sale of Fish and Fish Products and such trade mark is now owned by Connors Bros., Limited. It is obvious, therefore, that the appellant may not use that name in connection with the sardine business.\nIrrespective of the difficulty in the appellant\u2019s way in securing an answer to Question (b), in view of the fact that the Chief Justice in the exercise of the discretion conferred by Rule 54A declined to express an opinion, and of the fact that the Judges in the highest Provincial Court agreed with him, I entertain no doubt that for the reasons given by the Chief Justice, it would be inadvisable to give any opinion unless and until the appellant undertakes to act in some form of employment for some person or corporation engaged in the sardine business in Canada.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The judgment of Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDavis, J.\u2014On June 9th, 1925, the appellant, then a man of 37 years of age, who had been brought up from boyhood in the sardine business with his father and uncle, sold his shares in the respondent company Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, to the respondent company Connors Bros., Limited, and with his father entered into the following covenant in an agreement with the respondent Connors Bros., Limited:\nThe said Lewis Connors and Bernard Connors agree with said Connors Bros., Limited, that they will not either directly or indirectly engage in any other sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada, nor directly or indirectly use the brands of either Connors Bros., Limited, or Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, in the Dominion of Canada, or elsewhere, nor, for a period of ten years from the 30th day of April, A.D. 1925, use the name of Connors in connection, with the sardine business in any country whatsoever.\nThe appellant thereupon entered the employ of Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, but on October 2nd, 1926, disputes having arisen between the parties, the engagement of employment was terminated upon the terms of a further agreement in writing of that date. That agreement contained the following covenant:\nThe party of the first part (i.e., the appellant) also agrees with the said parties of the second and third parts (i.e., Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, and Connors, Bros., Limited) that he will not directly or indirectly engage in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada nor directly or indirectly use the brands of either Connors Bros., Limited, or Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, in the Dominion of Canada or elsewhere, nor for a period of ten years from the 30th day of April, A.D. 1925, use the name of Connors in connection with the sardine business in any country whatsoever.\nSubsequent to the expiration of the ten-year period from the 30th of April, 1925, referred to in the said clause of the agreement, the appellant desired to engage in the sardine business in Canada and addressed a letter on April 15th, 1937, to the respondent Connors Bros., Limited, in which, after referring to the two covenants above set forth, he said:\nI wish to point out to you that I do not consider the provisions cited above to be binding as agreements in restraint of trade. I have no desire to use or intention of using the brands of either Connors Bros., Limited, or Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, but I do desire to engage in and work at the sardine business in Canada and\/or elsewhere and it is also my desire to use the name of \u201cConnors,\u201d if I so choose, in connection with the sardine business in Canada or elsewhere. If the agreements I have cited above are good and valid agreements enforceable at law or in equity, I neither desire nor intend to violate them. It has occurred to me that you may consider them enforceable and, should I engage in the sardine business in Canada, you may take steps to restrain me from doing so or, after I have done so, sue me for damages for breach of contract. Naturally I have no desire to make plans for or invest capital in a business I may be restrained from carrying on at great cost and inconvenience to me.\nAccordingly I would ask you to accept this letter as notice of my intention to engage in the sardine business in Canada and\/or elsewhere and to use, if I see fit, the name \u201cConnors\u201d in connection with the sardine business in Canada or elsewhere, my activities in these respects to start as soon as possible after this date. I would therefore ask you to advise me on or before April 26th, 1937, whether you consider the above agreements, or either of them, enforceable and intend to hold me to them, that is to say, prohibiting me from engaging in the sardine business in Canada for all time. It may well be that you consider the period of twelve years, which has since elapsed, sufficient restraint in point of time so far as your purposes are concerned. If that is the case, I should be pleased to have you advise me accordingly, and to receive from you a release from the said agreements.\nIf I do not hear from you in the time suggested, or if I do not secure a release from the said agreements, or if you advise me that you intend to treat the agreements as enforceable, I shall feel that I am entitled to ask the Chancery Court for directions on the agreements mentioned in order that I may know whether I can legally enter this business. For that purpose, I am advised, I shall be forced to make you party to an application by way of originating summons for a court construction of and declaration on the agreements mentioned so far as they apply to my engaging in the sardine business along the lines I have in mind.\nThe solicitors for Connors Bros., Limited, and Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, replied under date of April 24th, 1937, that they had been instructed to inform the appellant that their clients\nconsider the provisions of the contracts quoted in your letter to be legally binding upon you in every respect, and that they have no intention whatever of releasing to you, or abandoning in any way their rights under these agreements.\nOn the 27th of April, 1937, the appellant commenced these proceedings for an interpretation of the covenants and for a declaration of the rights of the parties thereunder and propounded for the Court the following questions for determination:\n(a) Whether, upon construction of the provision written variously in the said agreements as \u201cwill not directly or indirectly engage in any other sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada\u201d and \u201cwill not directly or indirectly engage in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada,\u201d the said Bernard Connors, the covenantor mentioned in both agreements, is at the present time and shall be thenceforward barred from engaging in the sardine business in Canada as owner by himself or in partnership with others of such a business or as a shareholder of an incorporated company engaged in such business in Canada.\n(b) Whether, upon construction of the words \u201cwill not directly or indirectly engage in\u201d used in said covenants the said Bernard Connors is barred at law from working at the sardine business in Canada as an employee of any person, persons, firm or corporation engaged in the sardine business in Canada.\n(c) Whether, upon construction of the said covenants and particularly the following words contained therein \u201cnor for a period of ten years from the 30th day of April, A.D. 1925, use the name of Connors in connection with the sardine business in any country whatsoever,\u201d the said Bernard Connors may at this time and thenceforward lawfully use the name of \u201cConnors\u201d in connection with the sardine business in Canada.\nThis course of proceeding by way of originating summons was taken pursuant to Order 54A of the New Brunswick Judicature Act. The matter came on for hearing before Chief Justice Baxter in the Chancery Court of New Brunswick and in his judgment delivered on August 24th, 1937[31], the learned Chief Justice of New Brunswick answered question (a) in the affirmative, declined to answer question (b) and answered question (c) in the negative, and ordered the appellant to pay the costs of the application. The plaintiff then appealed to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, at the November Sittings in 1937, and, after taking time to consider, the Appeal Court[32] dismissed the appeal with costs on February 8th, 1938, written judgments being delivered by Grimmer J. and LeBlanc J. The appellant on February 18th, 1938, obtained special leave from the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to appeal to this Court and brought on the appeal for hearing in due course.\nIt is always unsatisfactory to deal with questions of this kind in the abstract without concrete facts being in issue. Take, for instance, the questions whether the appellant is barred from engaging in the sardine business in Canada \u201cas owner by himself\u201d or \u201cin partnership with others\u201d of such a business or \u201cas a shareholder\u201d of an incorporated company engaged in such business in Canada or \u201cfrom working at\u201d the sardine business in Canada as \u201can employee of\u201d any person, persons, firm or corporation engaged in the sardine business in Canada. In the view that I have arrived at, it is unnecessary to consider, if indeed the Court would be justified in determining, the detailed propositions involved in the submitted questions.\nThe agreement of October 2nd, 1926, which contains the secondly above-recited covenant, terminated the employment of the appellant with the respondent Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited, for a five-year term from June 9th, 1925, at a salary of $5,000 a year under an agreement of June 9th, 1925, that had been made as part of the bargain for acquiring the shares of the appellant and his father in Lewis Connors & Sons, Limited. By the said agreement of October 2nd, 1926, the respondents expressly released the appellant \u201cfrom all claims and demands of every nature and description which they or either of them have or which hereafter they or either of them may have against\u201d the appellant \u201cby reason of anything to the date of these presents * * *\u201d but a new covenant was taken from the appellant in substantially the same words as the covenant in the earlier agreement. I will assume in the respondents\u2019 favour, what I do not think it necessary to decide, that the latter clause was intended merely to repeat and confirm the covenant in the earlier agreement and is to be treated, if in law there is any difference in the application of the principles respecting covenants in restraint of trade, as a covenant with the vendor of shares of a business rather than a covenant by an employee in favour of his employer.\nThe main question in this case is whether the provision against engaging directly or indirectly in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada, during the entire lifetime of the appellant, is too wide to be enforceable. The answer to that question depends upon whether, in the particular facts of the case, the covenant was reasonably necessary for the protection of the business carried on by the covenantees at the time when it was entered into. The court, in order to determine the question, must consider three things: the nature of the business, the position of the covenantor, and the scope of the covenant. The question of the validity of covenants in restraint of trade has been considered many times in recent years and in more than one case the House of Lords has laid down the principles applicable to such covenants. It is quite unnecessary to attempt to repeat them. One principle is perfectly clear and that is, that in approaching such questions the court must bear in mind that a covenant which is in restraint of trade is prima facie invalid and that the onus is on the person who seeks to enforce it to show that it is a valid covenant\u2014a covenant which is reasonably necessary for the protection of his business and is not otherwise contrary to public policy. I need only, I think, refer to the language of Lord Macmillan in Vancouver Malt v. Vancouver Breweries[33]:\nThe law does not condemn every covenant which is in restraint of trade, for it recognizes that in certain cases it may be legitimate, and indeed beneficial, that a person should limit his future commercial activities, as, for example, where he would be unable to obtain a good price on the sale of his business unless he came under an obligation not to compete with the purchaser. But when a covenant in restraint of trade is called in question the burden of justifying it is laid on the party seeking to uphold it. The tests of justification have been authoritatively defined by Birkenhead, L.C., in these words: \u201cA contract which is in restraint of trade cannot be enforced unless (a) it is reasonable as between the parties; (b) it is consistent with the interests of the public. * * * Every contract therefore which is impeached as being in restraint of trade must submit itself to the two standards indicated. Both still survive\u201d: McEllistrim v. Ballymacelligott Co-operative Agricultural and Dairy Society, Ltd.[34].\nLord Hanworth, M.R., in Gilford Motor Co. v. Home[35], referring to page 475 of 1 Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 13th ed., dealing with the Nordenfelt Co.\u2019s case[36], said that the true view is\nthat any restraint, whether general or partial, is prima facie invalid, but may be good if the circumstances of the case show it to be reasonable.\nThe covenant here in question, like all such covenants, must be considered with regard to the surrounding circumstances. The appellant, a young man brought up in the sardine business since 14 years of age, was at the age of 37 years restrained during his lifetime from directly or indirectly engaging in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada. My conclusion upon the evidence is, assuming that the words \u201cdirectly or indirectly engage in the sardine business\u201d are capable of precise definition and are not too vague as to be void for uncertainty (the very questions submitted to the court indicate the uncertainty of the meaning to be attributed to the words), that the respondents have not shown that the terms of the covenant can pass the test of reasonableness as between the parties. Nothing really turns upon the prohibition against the use of the brands of either of the respondents because the appellant would have no right to use the brands of these companies without leave or licence. The prohibition against the use of the name \u201cConnors\u201d in connection with the sardine business was limited for a period of ten years, which has since expired.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the judgments below set aside and it should be declared only that the covenant in so far as it prohibits the appellant from engaging directly or indirectly in any sardine business whatsoever in the Dominion of Canada is unenforceable.\nThe appellant should have his costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

The bank had taken from A. the form of security under s. 88 of the Bank Act (now 1934, c. 24, Dom.) and assignments of the moneys payable by respondent under the contracts. The bank sued, under the security and assignments, as assignee of A\u2019s rights against respondent and alternatively for damages for conversion. Respondent, among other defences, challenged the validity of the security under the Bank Act, claimed certain credits and priorities, and denied that any further moneys were payable under the contracts. The contracts between A. and respondent were dated October 31, 1933, and April 26, 1934. The pulpwood to be cut was on Crown lands on which a company, New Lepreau Ltd., held licences to cut timber. A. was president of that company and held a majority of its shares, nearly all the remaining shares being held by respondent. The contract of October 31, 1933, was first made in the name of New Lepreau Ltd. but later A\u2019s name was substituted.\nThe trial judge, Barry, C.J. K.B.D., gave judgment for the bank for the amount of its claim, $8,000 and interest. The Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, 12 M.P.R. 219, reduced the judgment to $192.02. It held that, so far as the bank\u2019s case was based on s. 88 of the Bank Act, it failed, as A. was not the \u201cowner\u201d entitled to give security within s. 88 (the pulpwood being, so far as the evidence disclosed, the property of New Lepreau Ltd.); that (apart from s. 88) on A\u2019s assignments to the bank of the moneys payable by respondent under the contracts, the bank should recover, but, on the proper debits and credits, the amount recoverable was only $192.02. the bank appealed.\nHeld (Kerwin J. dissenting in part): The judgment at trial for the bank for the amount of its claim should be restored.\nA\u2019s assignments given as security under s. 88 of the Bank Act were valid under s. 88. (Per Cannon, Crocket and Hudson JJ.: A. must be treated as the owner of the pulpwood when it was cut, within the meaning of s. 88). (Per Davis and Hudson JJ.: A. had at all times a qualified ownership or interest in the pulpwood as soon as it was cut, sufficient to entitle the bank to take from him security under s. 88). (Per Kerwin J.: The security under s. 88 must be given by the owner. The proper inference from the evidence is that A. was the owner and that he gave security to the bank under s. 88).\nThough down to a certain date the assignments by A. to the bank as security under s. 88 described the wood as \u201call the rough or draw shaved spruce and fir pulpwood\u201d on the described location, omitting \u201cor sap peeled\u201d spruce and fir pulpwood (inserted in later assignments; and also inserted in A\u2019s first and subsequent applications for credit and promises to give security), it was held that all the spruce and fir pulpwood (including sap peeled wood) got out by A. on the described location was included in the pledges to the bank (affirming the trial judge, who held that the particular designations only served to indicate the season of the year in which the wood is cut).\nAs to respondent\u2019s claim that, should the bank\u2019s security be held valid under s. 88, respondent\u2019s liability, if any, rested in a claim for conversion, and that damages should be fixed by ascertaining the value of the pulpwood at the time and in the condition that respondent took possession of it, involved in which was the question of certain expenditures by respondent:\u2014\nHeld (Kerwin J. dissenting on this point), that respondent was bound to pay the full amount of the bank\u2019s advances to A.\nPer Cannon, Crocket and Hudson JJ.: A\u2019s assignments as security under s. 88 being valid, and the bank having kept respondent fully informed of every step in its negotiations with A., there is no right in respondent to deduct from the amount of the bank\u2019s advances any moneys which respondent paid to A. or to anybody else for supplies, wages, stumpage, or any other purpose in pursuance of the terms and conditions of its agreement with him. Per Davis and Hudson JJ.: Practical difficulties arise in any attempt to fix value at any particular stage; respondent took possession of the wood with full knowledge of the bank\u2019s position and rights and destroyed the identity of the wood in using it in its mill operations; it is respondent\u2019s knowledge that is the determining factor in this case; A\u2019s evidence was that all the moneys got from the bank were actually used in the woods operations; the evidence does not establish that the actual value of the wood when respondent took possession of it was less than the amount of the bank\u2019s advances against it.\nKerwin J. dissented as to the amount recoverable, holding that respondent was liable in damages for conversion, the damages being the value of the logs at the time and place of conversion; that in fixing such damages there should be deducted, from the ascertained value of the logs in the state in which they were to be delivered, at the place of delivery, under A\u2019s contracts with respondent, certain sums expended by respondent in bringing the logs to that state at that place, being for wages and supplies in such operation, stumpage, workmen\u2019s compensation, taxes, etc., rent for housing men, and freight; (Reid v. Fairbanks, 13 C.B. 692, Morgan v. Powell, 3 Q.B. 278, Burmah Trading Corpn. Ltd. v. Mirza Mahomed, L.R. 5 Ind. A. 130, at 134, cited). On above basis he fixed the bank\u2019s claim at $4,788.62 and interest thereon from the date when respondent received the last of the logs.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], reducing the amount of the judgment given by Barry, C.J. K.B.D., in favour of the plaintiff ($8,000 and interest, in all $8,897.53) to $192.02. The action was brought by the plaintiff bank to recover the sum of $8,000 (and interest) alleged to be the unpaid balance of moneys advanced by the bank to one Atkinson to assist him in getting out pulpwood under two contracts between him and the defendant company. The bank had taken from Atkinson the form of security under s. 88 of the Bank Act and assignments of the moneys payable by defendant under the contracts. The bank sued, under the security and assignments, as assignee of Atkinson\u2019s rights against respondent and alternatively for damages for conversion. The material facts of the case and issues in question are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. The bank\u2019s appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored, with costs throughout, Kerwin J. dissenting in part.\nW. F. Chipman K.C. and C. L. Dougherty for the appellant.\nC. F. Inches K.C. and M. Gerald Teed for the respondent. The judgment of Cannon and Crocket JJ. was delivered by\nCrocket, J.\u2014This action arose out of two contracts, which the defendant entered into for the purchase of pulpwood for the defendant\u2019s pulp manufacturing operations at its mill at Fairville, New Brunswick, the first contract dated October 31, 1933, and the second April 26, 1934. Although stating in its introduction that it is made between E. C. Atkinson (New Lepreau Ltd.) of Fredericton and the defendant, the first contract was signed New Lepreau Ltd. by Ewart C. Atkinson, President, and Port Royal Pulp and Paper Co. Ltd. by its manager. By it the seller agreed to sell and deliver to the defendant and the defendant agreed to purchase and accept 1,000 to 4,000 cords of draw shaved or rossed spruce and fir pulpwood at $6.50 per cord. The pulpwood was to be cut from lands owned or controlled by the seller and situated at New River, N.B., (these lands were Crown lands on which New Lepreau Ltd. held a licence to cut timber), and was to be shipped from New River, consigned to the defendant at Fairville or such other points as the company might designate, freight to any other point than Fairville to be equalized on Fairville freight rate. It was agreed that the contract should continue as directed by the defendant until all pulpwood had been shipped to the defendant during the winter 1933-34, \u201cto be completed by June 1, 1934.\u201d The contract provided that payment should be made by the defendant to the seller on the 15th day of each month for all pulpwood delivered to and accepted by the company during the previous month, and also that if there were any encumbrances or government dues on the wood the company \u201cshall deduct same from remittance to the seller.\u201d\nAtkinson was the president of New Lepreau Ltd., in which he owned a controlling interest, holding 247 of the 489 shares of its capital stock, the remaining shares, with the exception of five qualifying shares, being held by the defendant company. On January 20th Atkinson gave notice under the provisions of The Bank Act of his intention to give security under s. 88 to the plaintiff Bank. This notice was duly registered in the office of the Receiver-General at Saint John on January 22nd. Two days later he made application to the plaintiff on the usual printed form for a revolving line of credit to the amount of $5,000 for his pulpwood business and for advances thereunder on the security of all the rough or draw shaved or sap peeled spruce and fir pulpwood\nwhich are now owned or which may be owned by the undersigned from time to time while any advances made under this credit remain unpaid, and which are now or may hereafter be in the Lawrence flowage on New River Stream in the County of Charlotte,\nand agreed to give the Bank\nfrom time to time and as often as required security and further security for the said advances by way of assignments under section 88 of The Bank Act\ncovering all the said goods, and appointed the Bank his attorney \u201cto give from time to time such security and further security.\u201d Simultaneously he executed an agreement with the Bank in the regular printed form also as to its powers in relation to all advances and securities held therefor.\nOn March 1, 1934, the manager of the defendant wrote Atkinson that following their conversation and correspondence the defendant would agree\nto change the contract * * * dated October 31, 1933, which is in the name of the New Lepreau Ltd. to E. C. Atkinson, personal account.\nOn the same date the defendant advised the Bank of this change in the contract, and on March 10th Atkinson executed an assignment to the Bank by way of security under s. 88 of\nall moneys, claims, rights and demands whatsoever which the undersigned may now, or at any time hereafter, have or be entitled to under or by virtue of or in respect of or incidental to [the said contract], the said moneys, claims, rights and demands or any of them, or any part or parts thereof, being hereinafter referred to as the \u201cdebt.\u201d\nIt sets forth in para. 2 that Atkinson agrees that\nthe debt shall be held by the Bank as general and continuing collateral security for the fulfilment of all obligations, present or future, of the undersigned to the Bank, whether arising from dealings between the Bank and the undersigned or from any other dealings by which the Bank may be or become in any manner whatsoever a creditor of the undersigned, and whether such obligations were or be incurred alone or jointly with another or others, and whether as principal or surety, and whether matured or not, and whether absolute or contingent.\nAlso by para. 14 that it\nis given in addition to and not in substitution for any similar assignment heretofore given to and still held by the Bank and is taken by the Bank as additional security for the fulfilment of the aforesaid obligations of the undersigned to the Bank and shall not operate as a merger of any simple contract debt or in any way suspend the fulfilment of, or prejudice or affect the rights, remedies and powers of the Bank in respect of, the said obligations or any securities held by the Bank for the fulfilment thereof.\nOn March 12th the manager of the Bank sent the defendant a copy of this assignment, requesting it at the same time in future to send all cheques in payment direct to the Bank and to advise the Bank what payments the defendant had made to date on the contract. On March 16th the defendant acknowledged receipt of the assignment of the contract and informed the Bank that its advances on the contract during the winter amounted to $484.90 plus an amount of about $4,000 over-advance on a previous contract it had with Atkinson and which, the letter stated, Atkinson had asked the defendant to charge against the new contract. To this letter the Bank made the following reply:\nReferring to your letter of the 16th inst., in which you advise that $484.90 has been paid against the contract dated Oct. 31st, 1933, with Mr. E. C. Atkinson, we note that you have a claim against him for $4,000 on the previous contract which has not yet been completed owing to pulp to be shipped. We have advanced him $3,000 on the contract dated Oct. 31st, under Section 88 Security, and therefore shall expect our advances in this connection to be repaid before your claim of $4,000 mentioned.\nNo pulpwood had been shipped or delivered to the defendant under the October, 1933, contract up to this time.\nThe Bank made its first advance\u2014$1,000\u2014on January 24, 1934\u2014the date of Atkinson\u2019s application for the $5,000 credit\u2014and four other advances of $500 each between that date and March 19th. No further advance was made until May 28th.\nIn the meantime, on April 26th, the defendant entered into the second contract, this time with Atkinson personally. By this contract Atkinson agreed to sell and deliver and the defendant to purchase and accept 10,000 cords of peeled spruce and fir pulpwood at $7.25 per cord, which was \u201cto be cut from lands owned or controlled by the seller and situated in Charlotte County, N.B.\u201d This last contract provided that advances on the pulpwood should be made by the defendant to Atkinson at the rate of $1.25 per cord when it had been sawed and piled in the forest ready for scaling, an additional dollar per cord when the wood had been hauled to the river ready for driving and the further advance of 50 cents a cord when it had been driven down the river to New River Station, and that the balance of the purchase price should be paid on the 20th day of each month for all pulpwood delivered to and accepted by the defendant during the previous month. It . contained the same provision as regards shipment as the contract of Oct. 31st, 1933, and as to deduction for any encumbrances or government dues.\nOn May 27th Atkinson executed an assignment to the Bank as security under s. 88 of \u201call moneys, claims, rights and demands whatsoever, which the undersigned may now, or at any time hereafter, have or be entitled to under or by virtue of or in respect of or incidental to\u201d this last contract in the same terms as his assignment of his rights under the first contract.\nOn July 14th the defendant wrote a letter to Atkinson advising him that it agreed to alter the contract to read, \u201cwhatever shipment you may have this summer up to a quantity of 3,000 cords we will take care of this shipment on the terms in this contract.\u201d\nOn July 16th Atkinson made application to the Bank for a further revolving line of credit for his pulpwood business to the amount of $10,000 and for advances to him thereunder on the security of all\nthe rough or draw shaved or sap peeled spruce and fir pulpwood which are now owned or which may be owned by the undersigned from time to time while any advances made under this contract remain unpaid, and which are now or may hereafter be in the Lawrence flowage on New River Stream in the County of Charlotte\n\u2014the same locus as described in his application for the $5,000 credit on January 24th. This application was in precisely the same form and contained the same undertakings on the part of Atkinson as that of January 24th in respect of the first contract. At the same time Atkinson signed another agreement as to the powers of the Bank in relation to all advances and securities held therefor in the same form as that of January 24th in reference to advances and securities in connection with the first contract. The Bank made its first advance thereunder ($1,000) on July 17th, on which date the manager sent the defendant Atkinson\u2019s assignment of May 27th. In his covering letter he made reference to the defendant\u2019s letter to Atkinson of July 14th and the statement contained therein as to its agreement to \u201ctake delivery of 3,000 cords this summer\u201d and asked the defendant to advise him the amount the defendant had advanced to Atkinson on pulpwood not delivered. The defendant acknowledged the receipt of this letter on July 19th and advised the Bank that the amount of advances to Atkinson on pulpwood was $10,975.62, and on July 24th wrote Atkinson that it was \u201cgoing to make all the effort possible to provide further advances of three thousand for August 6th.\u201d\nUp to the time when the second contract was entered into (April 26, 1934), the Bank had made advances to Atkinson to the amount of $3,000 on the security it took from Atkinson in January, 1934, in connection with the first contract of October 31, 1933, the last of these advances\u2014$500\u2014having been made on March 19th. In addition to the $1,000 advanced on May 28th, four other advances of $200 each and another, $500, were made in the month of June after Atkinson had entered into his second contract for the 10,000 cords of pulpwood to be cut on the same limits and for which, the record makes it quite clear, the Bank had not been fully repaid, neither when Atkinson executed the assignment to the Bank of his rights under the second contract on May 27th nor when he obtained his additional credit of July 16th. On the making of all these advances the Bank took from Atkinson a demand note for the amount of each advance with interest from date until paid, to which was attached a signed promise to give the Bank from time to time, as required, security and further security for such note by way of assignments and further assignments under s. 88 upon the goods mentioned in his application for the line of credit as well as a further assignment of the \u201cgoods now owned by the undersigned and now in the possession of Atkinson in the Lawrence flowage on New River Stream in the County of Charlotte or elsewhere.\u201d To each of these assignments was attached a schedule setting out the advances made under the line of credit to date. The schedule annexed to the assignment of May 28th shows nine advances amounting to $4,000 and that of June 30th eleven advances amounting to $5,000. On July 17th, 1934, after the Bank received Atkinson\u2019s application for the $10,000 credit and the assignment of his rights under the second contract, the assignment of the pulpwood at the Lawrence flowage under s. 88 is stated as being given in consideration of an advance of $6,000 and the attached schedule setting out the advances includes all those made from May 28th to July 17th, totalling $6,000, while the demand note of $1,000 given to the Bank on that date (July 17th, 1934) is stated in Atkinson\u2019s attached written promise as being given\nfor an advance made to the undersigned under the terms of the \u201cApplication for credit and promise to give bills of lading, warehouse receipts or security under Section 88\u201d made by the undersigned to the Bank and dated January 24th and July 16th day of 1934.\nThe Bank made two further advances of $1,000 each in July; six advances in August amounting to $3,500; four in September amounting to $1,125; three in October amounting to $300; one in November of $100; three in December amounting to $650 and two in January, 1935, amounting to $239.45.\nAn examination of the schedules attached to the various individual assignments shows that on August 6th Atkinson\u2019s indebtedness to the Bank in respect of its advances to him for his pulpwood operations under both contracts had reached $8,000 and that, although subsequent advances, were made during August, September, October, Novemberr. December and down to January 29th, 1935, on further demand notes with individual assignments under s. 88. attached thereto similar to the one referred to as given on July 17th, 1934, the subsequent advances effected no increase in his net indebtedness to the Bank beyond this sum. This, presumably, was due to the fact that the demand notes given thereafter by Atkinson to the Bank, secured as described, were in reality the consequences of adjustments of interest and renewals of previous notes.\nWhile the first contract of October 31, 1933, described the wood Atkinson agreed to sell and deliver to the defendant and the defendant agreed to purchase and accept as \u201cdraw shaved or rossed spruce and fir pulpwood\u201d and the contract of April 26th, 1934, as \u201cpeeled spruce and fir pulpwood,\u201d all the individual assignments executed by Atkinson in consideration of the various advances made to him by the Bank from January 24th under his formal applications for credit of January 24th and July 16th, 1934, described the wood as \u201call the rough or drawn shaved spruce and fir pulpwood\u201d down to September 11th, 1934. The assignment taken on the latter date and all subsequent, assignments down to January 29th, 1935, described the wood covered thereby as \u201call the rough or drawn shaved or sap peeled spruce and fir pulpwood.\u201d Atkinson cut and delivered to the defendant a total of 6,00545 cords of pulpwood under the two contracts, of which the defendant claimed that 707-17 cords were cut and delivered under the first contract and the balance amounting to 5,298.26 cords were cut and delivered under the second. The purchase price, therefore, of the 707.17 cords at the contract price of $6.50 per cord would amount to $4,596.60 and the purchase price of the 5,298.26 at the contract price of $7.25 per cord to $38,412.37, making for the 6,005.43 cords $43,008.97.\nNone of the pulpwood was shipped to the defendant under either contract until November, 1934, Atkinson having made his first shipment on the 12th of that month. The defendant received the entire quantity of 6,005.43 cords between November 1st, 1934, and the last day of July, 1935.\nAlthough the Bank in its action, which it brought in February, 1936, sued in the alternative for the wrongful taking and conversion of the pulpwood and for the purchase price under the two contracts as assignee of Atkinson\u2019s rights thereunder, it claims on either head only to the amount of the advances made by it and interest on the demand notes given therefor.\nThe defendant in its statement of defence challenged the validity of all of the Bank\u2019s assignments from Atkinson under the provisions of s. 88 and denied that it wrongfully converted any of the pulpwood. It denied also that it was aware of Atkinson\u2019s assignment of May 26th, 1934, of his rights under the second contract until it received from the Bank a copy thereof on or about July 17th, 1934. It claimed that it paid the Bank and Atkinson jointly all moneys thereafter accruing due to the latter under the contract of April 26th and denied that any further moneys were due and payable by it to the plaintiff or to Atkinson under that contract. It also raised the question as to the Bank\u2019s having no security on any of the \u201csap peeled\u201d pulpwood until after September 11th, and claimed that the defendant had an equitable right in the wood as soon as it was cut and marked and that the Bank had actual knowledge or notice of its said equitable right. The defendant also raised the question as to its right to charge against the Bank\u2019s security a sum of $5,330.91, alleged to have been due to it by Atkinson for over-advances on a previous contract it had with Atkinson in the spring of 1933. This apparently was the amount at which, after the termination of the operations of 1934-5, under the two contracts of October 31st, 1933, and April 26th, 1934, it figured its over-advances to Atkinson in relation to the earlier contract of the spring of 1933, and which in its letter to the Bank under date of March 16th, 1934, it placed at $4,000\u2014the amount that letter stated Atkinson had asked the defendant to charge against the new contract of October 31st, 1933. The Bank in its reply hereinbefore set out refused to assent to this proposition and informed the defendant that it would expect its advances to Atkinson on the October 31st contract under s. 88 security to be repaid before the said claim of $4,000.\nThe defence also put forward a claim that, of the 6,005.43 cords of pulpwood it received from Atkinson, 522.34 cords were cut upon lands of the Fraser Co. Ltd. or the Restigouche Co. Ltd., without the consent or licence of either of those companies and that, the stumpage on this 522.34 cords ($1,044.68) having been paid after its delivery to the defendant, it was entitled to deduct this amount from the amount of the advances made by the Bank to Atkinson.\nIt also claimed priority over the Bank\u2019s security to an amount of $11,096.56 for moneys paid to New Lepreau Ltd. and\/or Atkinson under its contract of October 31st, 1933, prior to its receipt of notice of Atkinson\u2019s assignment to the Bank of his rights thereunder, and moneys subsequently paid to Atkinson and\/or the Bank, which it alleged were received by the Bank. It also claimed priority over the Bank\u2019s security in respect of the following moneys:\nMoneys paid for wages for the operation \u2026\u2026\u2026 $9,631 11\nMoneys paid for supplies for the operation\u2026\u2026... 4,482 31\nMoneys paid for stumpage, Crown Land\nTimber Licence fees, Workmen\u2019s\nCompensation Board Assessment \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 7,376 56\nMoneys paid for rent, housing men for\noperation \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 26 00\nMoneys paid for freight on wood received\u2026\u2026\u2026 5,607 81\nThe action was tried by Barry, C.J. K.B.D., without a jury, who found a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount of its claim, $8,366.66, to which he added $530.87 to represent the accrued interest on the principal sum of $8,000 from the date of the delivery of the particulars to the date of his judgment.\nThe defendant appealed from this judgment to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court, with the result that the judgment was reduced to $192.02, with costs of the action, while the Bank was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal. The judgment of the Appeal Court was delivered by Baxter, C.J., and concurred in by Grimmer and Fairweather, JJ. It seems to have been based principally on the conclusion that Atkinson was not an \u201cowner\u201d within the meaning of s. 88 of the Bank Act and that, so far as the Bank\u2019s case was based on that section, it could not be supported. Having reached that conclusion, the court proceeded to deal with the case on the basis of the assignment which Atkinson made to the Bank of all his rights under the contract of October 31st, 1933, a copy of which the Bank sent to the defendant on March 12th.\nReferring to the defendant\u2019s letter of March 16th as to the charging of the $4,000 over-advanced on the previous contract, the learned Chief Justice said:\nI cannot see, in view of the testimony, any justification for applying the original deficit to anything but the contract of 31st October, 1933. It seems clear, however, that the deficit on the earlier contract was agreed to be charged against the contract of 31st October, 1933, before Atkinson\u2019s assignment to the Bank.\nThis, of course, refers to the agreement between the defendant and Atkinson and not between them and the Bank. As already pointed out, the Bank refused to assent to the proposal. Then the learned Chief Justice dealt with the contract of April 26th, 1934, and pointed out that after July of that year the defendant paid all the operating expenses and the Bank ceased to make any further advances to Atkinson. His Lordship held that the defendant received wood to the value of $4,596.60 under the contract of October 31st, 1933, and which it could properly set off against the balance of $5,330.91 due upon the earlier contract, leaving a loss to the defendant of $734.31 in respect of the earlier contract, which it was not entitled to charge against the contract of April 26th, 1934. He subtracts the $5,330.91 from the total debit against Atkinson of $43,551.26 for the over-advance in respect of the earlier contract of the spring of 1933 and for moneys paid and supplies provided by the defendant on account of Atkinson\u2019s operations under the contract of April 26th, 1934, leaving $38,220.35 as the debit chargeable to the latter contract. \u201cUnder that contract,\u201d he says, \u201cthe defendant received 5,298.26 cords at $7.25 per cord which would give Atkinson a credit of $38,412.37, or a balance in his favour of $192.02.\u201d\nIf the Appeal Court is right in its conclusion that the Bank\u2019s securities under s. 88 of the Bank Act were invalid because Atkinson was not the owner of the pulpwood within the meaning of that section and the case is one which rests entirely, so far as the Bank is concerned, upon the assignments to it, apart from the provisions of s. 88, of Atkinson\u2019s rights under the two contracts of October 31st, 1933, and April 26th, 1934, the result at which it arrived might be difficult to impeach.\nThis appeal, however, in my view, turns entirely upon the question as to the validity of the Bank\u2019s assignments under s. 88 in respect of the two contracts of October 31st, 1933, and April 26th, 1934, and their relation to each other. As to this, after the fullest and most careful consideration I have been able to give to the case, I find myself in complete accord with the reasons by which Barry, C.J., K.B.D., so lucidly and logically supports his judgment. There is no material dispute respecting any one of the facts I have above set forth. As the learned trial judge points out, the question is: In whom during the interim between the first advance of $1,000 to Atkinson on July 17th, 1934, and the shipments of the pulpwood to the defendant in the following November rested the legal title to the pulpwood? I quote the following passages from his judgment:\nBefore the banks were authorized to loan money on such operations as those with which we are now dealing, it was the common practice of purchasers under a contract to cut lumber, to make it a term of the written contract with the operator that the property in the lumber cut would be in the contractee from the stump. This would be a protection to the party who was advancing the money to the operator to carry on the operation. But no such stipulation, I venture to think, will be found in the contracts of the present day, in cases at any rate where the operator has to go to a bank for assistance, for the very obvious reason that such a stipulation would deprive the operator of the very assistance which he wanted, in the event of neither the operator nor the purchaser of the output being able to finance the operation. No bank would loan to a pulpwood operator, were the product of the operation as soon as cut, to become the property of the purchaser of the output. So, also, I think it would be true to say, that no bank: would be willing to advance money to a woods-operator of any kind, to enable him to carry on an operation, unless he could satisfy the bank that he had a contract with some responsible party, to take at a commercially attractive price, the output of the operation. If that be sound doctrine then we are met here with the paradoxical contention of the defendant, which advances the proposition, and one which I think untenable, that because Ewart C. Atkinson had contracted to sell his pulpwood cut to the defendant company and the plaintiff bank was aware of the fact, it could not under the Bank Act take security for advances on the pulpwood, the subject-matter of the contract between Atkinson and the defendant company. There is nothing in the Bank Act that I can see to prevent the bank from doing so.\n* * *\nIt is set out in the defendant\u2019s factum that: \u201cIn the summer of 1934, the defendant\u2019s manager, Mr. Lacroix, becoming aware that the plaintiff\u2019s advances had reached $8,000, endeavoured to negotiate some compromise between the parties in a settlement of their conflicting claims, and believing that there would be sufficient wood to meet the claims of both parties, endeavoured to reach an arrangement whereby the wood would be conveyed to the defendant by Bill of Sale, and the plaintiff would receive $2 a cord as the wood was delivered at the mill. This offer, however, was refused.\u201d\nAlthough this offer was refused, it shows at least one thing, that is that the defendant at that time had little faith and did not think itself secure in the title which it now asserts, but was anxious to have the wood conveyed to it by Bill of Sale from the plaintiff so as to put its title to the wood upon a sounder basis and beyond further question.\nPulpwood is pulpwood whether draw shaved, rossed or sap peeled. The particular designations, if I understand the matter, only serve to indicate the season of the year in which the wood is cut; nothing more. If cut in the spring while the sap is running freely, and the bark can be easily removed, it is sap peeled wood. If cut in the fall and winter, when the sap has stopped running, the bark is more firmly attached to the tree trunk, and another method of removing it has to be resorted to; it is then called rough draw shaved or rossed, but to say that it is an entirely different commodity from the sap peeled wood is, I think, a fallacy.\nThe title to all of the spruce and fir pulpwood gotten out by Ewart C. Atkinson during the two seasons and put into the Lawrence flowage on New River Stream in the County of Charlotte, no matter of what particular description it may be called, was in my opinion pledged to the plaintiff bank upon the taking of the securities referred to.\n* * *\nThere is no evidence that there was any other operator simultaneously cutting pulpwood on the ground operated by Atkinson, or that there was any other operator putting wood into the Lawrence flowage on New River Stream in the County of Charlotte. There was no danger of Atkinson\u2019s cut becoming intermingled or mixed up with the cut of any other operator. There was not the slightest danger of failure of identification. Extrinsic evidence, could, as we have seen, have been resorted to if necessary. Therefore it is that I say that in my opinion the description of the pulpwood pledged by Atkinson to the bank, anterior to the 11th of September, 1934, was broad enough in its terms to include \u201csap peeled\u201d wood, although that term was not used in the securities taken. Aside from all that, however, I can see no objection to the bank taking additional security upon the sap peeled pulpwood at the time of the renewals of the $8,000 note. If the bank holding pledged pulpwood as security for the notes, substitutes for these notes renewals from time to time, without, however, receiving actual payment, the whole series of notes and renewals form links in the chain of liability, which is secured by the pledged pulpwood. Although as a matter of book-keeping the bank may have treated the first notes, and the subsequent substituted notes, as paid by the application of the proceeds from time to time of the renewals, there is no payment in fact of the notes for which the security was given.\nThe facts of the transactions between Atkinson and the bank are not really in dispute here; it is the legal effect of those transactions that is the question. The bank had before it the contracts between Atkinson and the defendant company, and therefore knew that the company as purchaser of the pulpwood under the contracts, would, when the liens and charges against it were discharged, become its owner. In its negotiations with Atkinson the bank was not acting in the dark or behind closed doors, but on the contrary kept the defendant fully informed of every step in the negotiations. I think one would be justified in saying that the company knew as much of what was going on between the bank and Atkinson as did the bank itself. That I think is so fully demonstrated by the mass of documentary evidence which was introduced at the trial, that I see no reason for further referring to this phase of the case.\nI have no hesitation in holding, for my part, that upon the undisputed facts as disclosed by the evidence, Atkinson must be treated as the owner of the pulpwood when it was cut, within the meaning of s. 88 of the Bank Act, and that his assignments to the plaintiff Bank were valid thereunder. This being so, and the Bank having kept the defendant fully informed of every step in its negotiations with Atkinson, as the learned trial judge has found, I cannot understand upon what ground the defendant\u2019s claim can be justified that it has a right to deduct from the advances made by the Bank any moneys which it (the defendant) paid to Atkinson or to anybody else for supplies, wages, stumpage or any other purpose in pursuance of the terms and conditions of its agreement with him.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment with costs throughout.\nDavis, J.\u2014The transactions out of which this litigation arose were carried on throughout their various stages by the parties to this litigation and one Atkinson, with whom both parties were dealing, in such a loose and unbusinesslike manner as necessarily to create a state of facts which now involves difficult questions of law. And the evidence at the trial was not in any way developed to lessen the manifest difficulties and confusion. The respondent, Port Royal Pulp & Paper Company Limited (hereinafter for convenience referred to as the Port Royal Company) carried on, as its name implies, a pulp and paper business in the province of New Brunswick. One of its sources of supply for pulpwood appears to have been the standing timber in what is commonly called the Lawrence flowage in Charlotte county in the said province held under licence to cut from the Crown by another New Brunswick company, New Lepreau Limited. There is so little evidence in the case directed to the narrative and the really material facts (the Crown timber licence is not even produced) that the Court is driven to conjecture to a large extent as to what really occurred. It is plain that prior to the transactions involved in this litigation New Lepreau Limited had acted as a contractor in taking out wood from its limits for the Port Royal Company. Atkinson and the Port Royal Company were the owners of practically all of the shares of New Lepreau Limited. What is a common practice in the woods operations of large pulp and paper companies in this country was no doubt adopted by the Port Royal Company, that is, to engage a contractor to cut, haul and deliver pulpwood to the mill rather than do the work by servants or employees of the company, because of practical business considerations in dealing with the woods operations in that way. In this case, the Port Royal Company and Atkinson (although we are told nothing about it) may have incorporated and organized New Lepreau Limited, and very likely did, for that very purpose. All we know is that Atkinson held 247 shares and the Port Royal Company 241 shares out of a total issued capital stock of 490 shares. Why the Crown timber licence to cut was not taken in the name of the Port Royal Company rather than in the name of New Lepreau Limited is not explained. The common practice in this country undoubtedly is for the large pulp and paper mills to acquire their own timber limits from the Crown upon which to cut timber for the supply of wood to their mills and then to let out to different contractors the cutting and delivery of the wood to the mills. All that is plain in the evidence is that the timber involved in this case was cut upon Crown land in respect of which New Lepreau Limited held a licence to cut. For reasons best understood by themselves, not attempted to be explained in any way in this litigation, the Port Royal Company made two contracts with Atkinson personally whereby Atkinson undertook and agreed to cut on the New Lepreau limits and deliver to the Port Royal Company at its mills, and the appellant bank undertook to assist Atkinson in financing his woods operations. The singular fact is that although all the parties were perfectly familiar with the position of New Lepreau Limited, no one of them appears to have paid the slightest attention to the rights of that company. So far as the evidence shows, New Lepreau Limited for the purposes of these two contracts was just obliterated from the picture. The two contracts for the delivery of the pulpwood were dated October 31st, 1933, and April 26th, 1934, respectively. The first contract covered 1,000 to 4,000 cords of pulpwood and the second contract covered 10,000 cords. The first of these contracts had in fact been made between the Port Royal Company and New Lepreau Limited, Atkinson signing for New Lepreau Limited as its President, but sometime about March 1st, 1934, Atkinson and the Port Royal Company agreed to strike out the name New Lepreau Limited on this contract and substitute therefor Atkinson\u2019s name as the seller. The first of the several promissory notes sued on in this action, secured by sec. 88 security, was taken by the bank subsequent to this change in the first contract. The second contract was taken directly in the name of Atkinson as seller. . The Port Royal Company clearly understood the position of New Lepreau Limited, whatever it was, because the Port Royal Company was with Atkinson in substance a joint owner of the company. The appellant bank knew of New Lepreau Limited because it had a pledge of Atkinson\u2019s shares in that company and it had the Crown timber licence of that company in its possession. But New Lepreau Limited, so far as the evidence discloses, was disregarded in these two transactions. It is shown in the evidence that at the time of the first contract Atkinson was personally indebted to the appellant bank in a large sum of money and that on an earlier contract (of the spring of 1933) which the Port Royal Company had with New Lepreau Limited the Port Royal Company ultimately sustained a loss of approximately $5,000. The conclusion appears to me to be inescapable that both the appellant bank and the Port Royal Company desired to see Atkinson get a chance to make some money for himself by taking these pulpwood contracts in his own name and at his own risk, in the hope that he might recoup both the bank and the Port Royal Company, to some extent at least, for their losses. Atkinson undoubtedly agreed with the Port Royal Company that that company might charge up against him the amount of its loss on the New Lepreau Limited contract that had been made in the spring of 1933, although at the time of entering into the contracts the actual amount of the loss, or of any loss at all, had not been ascertained.\nIn due course Atkinson cut and delivered to the Port Royal Company large quantities of pulpwood under the two contracts in question. The Government dues for cutting the timber from Crown lands were ultimately paid to the Government and there is no suggestion that the Government ever raised any question of trespass. New Lepreau Limited is not a party to these proceedings and does not appear to have raised at any time any question as to Atkinson\u2019s right to go in and cut on the areas covered by its Crown timber licence, and a fair inference on the evidence is that both the Government and New Lepreau Limited knew and were quite satisfied that Atkinson should personally take the contracts in question here. It made no difference to the Government, so long as it got its Crown dues paid, which it did, and it is only reasonable to assume that New Lepreau Limited (owned and controlled as it was by Atkinson and the Port Royal Company) was content that what was done should be done. We do not know what consideration moved New Lepreau Limited, but there is nothing to indicate any protest or unwillingness on its part that Atkinson should personally cut on its limits. New Lepreau Limited did not own the land or the standing timber; it had a mere right or licence to cut and remove on payment of Crown dues.\nIt is perfectly plain that Atkinson had no money and was known to have no money to finance the woods operations covered by his two contracts. While Atkinson was not strictly an employee or servant of the Port Royal Company in relation to his woods operations under the two contracts, he was virtually in the position of an agent or employee. The arrangement, no doubt, was a matter of business convenience; Atkinson in this way could borrow money at the bank on the wood by giving security under sec. 88 of The Bank Act and, over and beyond whatever borrowings he could make from the bank to finance the operations in ease of the Company, the Company would itself advance moneys to Atkinson during the course of the woods operations to enable him to carry out his contracts. And that is what actually happened. The bank advanced substantial sums; the Company advanced substantial sums; and Atkinson superintended the woods operations and delivered the wood to the Company. Both the bank and the Company were perfectly familiar from the beginning to the end with the fact (though perhaps not with the exact details) of the borrowings and advances from each of them to enable Atkinson to carry out his contracts.\nOn the completion of the contracts, it became obvious that Atkinson had not made any profit. When the amount of wood which he had actually delivered had been calculated at the contract price per cord, the total advances of the bank and of the Company exceeded the total contract price. The bank was out of pocket $8,366.66 and the Company claimed to be out of pocket $542.29, although in arriving at the latter sum the Company had charged up against Atkinson on the two contracts the amount of its loss on the New Lepreau Limited contract that had been made in the spring of 1933, the actual loss from which contract had in the meantime become ascertained at $5,330.91.\nThe bank demanded from the Port Royal Company that it pay the balance that remained outstanding upon Atkinson\u2019s borrowings in respect of the two contracts which had, to the full knowledge of the Company, been secured not only by sec. 88 security but by assignments of the purchase moneys under the two contracts. There does not appear to have been any effort made by the bank to collect from Atkinson; no doubt because his position must have been worse at the conclusion of the two contracts than it was when he undertook them. The Port Royal Company, while not denying in any way that it got the pulpwood, took two positions against the bank. First, it said that the bank security under sec 88 was invalid because Atkinson was not the owner of the wood that had been cut\u2014it said that it was the timber of New Lepreau Limited and not of Atkinson\u2014and that the bank was therefore not entitled to take sec. 88 security from him. Second, that it was entitled as between itself and the bank to charge against Atkinson\u2019s contracts the $5,330.91 loss that it had suffered in the contract with New Lepreau Limited of the spring of 1933, and that when this sum was charged up against Atkinson on the contracts, there was a debit against Atkinson of $542.29. A subsidiary point taken on behalf of the Port Royal Company, but a point without any substance, was that the difference between rossed or rough draw shaved pulpwood and sap peeled pulpwood materially affected the issues in the action.\nThe learned trial judge, the Chief Justice of the King\u2019s Bench Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Chief Justice Barry, gave judgment in favour of the appellant bank for its full claim with interest ($8,897.53) and costs. An appeal was taken by the Company from that judgment to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which allowed the appeal and reduced the amount of the judgment in favour of the bank to $192.02. The members of the Appeal Court took the view that Atkinson was never an \u201cowner\u201d within the meaning of sec. 88 of The Bank Act and that the bank was therefore not entitled to take from him sec. 88 security. They held that\nSo far as the evidence discloses, the wood was the property of the New Lepreau Limited.\nBut although the Crown timber licence was not produced at the trial, it was perfectly plain that it was Crown land and that the standing timber was Crown property. All that the licensee, New Lepreau Limited, had was a right to enter upon and to cut and remove the standing timber; and no doubt, as stated by one of the counsel on the hearing of the appeal before us, the licence contained the usual provision that the property in the wood would not pass from the Crown to the licensee until the Crown dues were paid. However, in the conclusion of the Appeal Court that Atkinson was not an \u201cowner\u201d within the meaning of sec. 88, that Court held that the bank\u2019s security under sec. 88 was invalid. The Appeal Court then considered the rights of the bank by virtue of its assignments from Atkinson of the purchase moneys under the two contracts. That Court held that the Port Royal Company was entitled, as between itself and the bank, to charge against Atkinson the deficit ($5,330.91) on the New Lepreau contract of the spring of 1933, upon the ground that Atkinson had agreed to the charging of this deficit against him before the date that the bank had taken the assignment from Atkinson of the first of the contracts involved in this action (that is, the contract of October 31st, 1933). But the Appeal Court held that the agreement to charge the deficit against Atkinson only applied to the first of the two contracts (that of October 31st, 1933) and not to the second of the contracts (that of April 26th, 1934) and therefore arrived at the conclusion that, so treating the deficit, any credit to Atkinson on the first contract had been wiped out; but, disregarding the deficit, or any part of it, on the second contract, Atkinson had a credit balance of $192.02 on the second contract for which amount, and for which amount alone, the Appeal Court held the bank was entitled to recover from the Port Royal Company on the basis of the assignment to the bank by Atkinson of the second contract.\nOn the argument before this Court, counsel for both parties very ably discussed at considerable length the history and the effect of sec. 88 security, but I do not find it necessary for the purpose of this appeal to become involved in the consideration of the somewhat intricate points of law argued on this branch of the case. It seems quite plain to me that Atkinson had at all times a qualified ownership or interest in the wood, as soon as it was cut from the standing timber, sufficient to entitle the bank to take from him sec. 88 security. I think the attack upon the bank\u2019s security fails.\nThat being so, the question was then argued that the liability of the Port Royal Company, if any, to the bank rests in a claim for damages for wrongful conversion. An attempt was made by the Company to fix the damages (in the event that its attack upon sec. 88 security failed) by ascertaining the exact value of the pulpwood at the time and in the condition the Company took possession of it. In dealing with deliveries from time to time of thousands of cords of pulpwood very practical difficulties arise in any attempt to fix value at any particular stage. The Company took possession of the wood with full knowledge of the bank\u2019s position and of its rights, and destroyed the identity of the wood in using it in its mill operations. It is the knowledge of the Company that is the determining factor in this case. Atkinson\u2019s evidence is that all the moneys he got from the bank were actually used in the woods operations and not diverted to any other purpose. The evidence does not satisfy me that the actual value of the wood when the Company took possession of it was less than the amount of the bank\u2019s advances against it and I think that under all the circumstances the Company is bound to pay the full amount of the bank\u2019s advances.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, with costs throughout.\nKerwin, J. (dissenting in part)\u2014The first point to be determined in this appeal is whether the security which banks may take under subsections one and three of section 88 of the Bank Act must be given by the owner of the products, goods, wares and merchandise therein referred to. Prior to 1890, when Parliament inserted in the Bank Act the forerunner of section 88, it was possible for a bank to lend money upon a warehouse receipt issued by the possessor of the goods to a third party (the owner) or upon a warehouse receipt issued by the owner who originally was one of a select class of manufacturers but which class had been considerably widened by 1890. Chapter 31 of the statutes of that year retained the privilege, so far as warehouse receipts issued by the possessor, not being the owner, were concerned, but it abolished the right of the bank to loan upon warehouse receipt issued by the possessor, who was also the owner, and substituted what is now known as Schedule C security. If subsection 3 of section 74 of the Act of 1890 had provided only that the bank should acquire by virtue of such security the same rights as if it had acquired them by virtue of a warehouse receipt, it might have been contended that, the security being given by an owner, no rights could be acquired by the bank, and it was to overcome that difficulty that it was provided that the security might be given by the owner.\nIt appears obvious to me that if security under section 88 is not given by the owner, it is of no avail, as the bank cannot acquire title from a person who has none. The notice of intention to give security must be given by the person to whom the loan is to foe made. That, I think, is apparent from subsection 17 of section 88, which reads as follows:\nAny person intending to give a bank security under the authority of this section must give notice of such intention before any loan is made by the bank to such person and the security taken, by signing a document hereinafter called a \u201cnotice of intention,\u201d which may be in the form set out in Schedule G to this Act or to the like effect.\nI have no hesitation, therefore, in coming to the conclusion that the security must be given by the owner.\nWhile the licences to cut timber had been issued in the name of New Lepreau Limited and the first contract for the sale of logs to the respondent was made by that company, and the contract of October, 1933, was at first made between the same parties, the respondent agreed to the alteration whereby Atkinson was substituted as vendor under the last mentioned contract. New Lepreau Limited is not a party to these proceedings, and, while there is no evidence that it agreed to the alteration, it must be borne in mind that all the shares in that company, except a few qualifying ones, are held by the respondent and Atkinson, and as a matter of fact the latter\u2019s certificates were left with the appellant. The distinction between a company and its shareholders is well known, but no claim has been made by New Lepreau Limited that it is the owner of the logs. Furthermore, it is only by virtue of the two contracts filed as exhibits that the respondent claims any interest in the logs, and I think the proper inference from the evidence is that Atkinson was the owner and that he gave security to the Bank under section 88.\nIt was argued that the securities were not validly given or taken, but I find no substance in this contention as, with reference to the last twenty-one advances made by the Bank to Atkinson (which are the only ones in question), the evidence is clear that these were made contemporaneously with the taking of the securities, and in any event the second notice by Atkinson of intention to give security had been given after the amendment to the statute in 1934, and the advances in question are all later than the date of the coming into force of that enactment.\nIt was also contended that, in any event, of the securities taken only the twelve last were valid. This argument is based upon the fact that the nine prior securities described the products of the forest owned by Atkinson and in his possession as being \u201call the rough or draw shaved spruce and fir pulpwood\u201d and as being \u201cin the Lawrence flowage on New River stream in the County of Charlotte,\u201d while in the latter securities the words \u201cor sap peeled\u201d were inserted after the words \u201cdraw shaved.\u201d I agree, however, with what the trial judge said with respect to this:\nPulpwood is pulpwood whether draw shaved, rossed or sap peeled. The particular designations, if I understand the matter, only serve to indicate the season of the year in which the wood is cut; nothing more. If cut in the spring while the sap is running freely, and the bark can be easily removed, it is sap peeled wood. If cut in the fall and winter, when the sap has stopped running, the bark is more firmly attached to the tree trunk, and another method of removing it has to be resorted to; it is then called rough draw shaved or rossed, but to say that it is an entirely different commodity from the sap peeled wood is, I think, a fallacy.\nI am of opinion that the description in the securities objected to is sufficient.\nUpon the basis of the respondent\u2019s own figures, as contained in its factum, the total advances made by the appellant, after deducting all sums received by it from the respondent, left a balance of approximately the principal sum claimed by the appellant in this action, $8,000. As security for the repayment of this sum together with interest thereon, the Bank, under subsection 7 of section 88, had acquired the same rights in respect of the logs as if it had acquired the same by virtue of a warehouse receipt; that is, in the circumstances, all the right and title of the owner, Atkinson (section 86). Notwithstanding that the respondent had notice of the Bank\u2019s rights, it converted the logs to its own use and is therefore liable in damages for such conversion; i.e., the value of the logs at the time and place of conversion.\nNo evidence was directed to the determination of the proper amount of damages on that footing. The respondent, however, submitted a statement showing the value of the logs at the place they were to be delivered by Atkinson to the respondent under his contracts with it. The appellant has accepted this value as correct, although it was arrived at only after certain amounts had been expended by the respondent subsequent to the conversion. The items deducted by the respondent from the value in its statement are as follows:\n1. Moneys paid to E. C Atkinson before\nassignment of the Draw Shaved contract\nand moneys subsequently paid to\nE. C Atkinson and\/or the Royal Bank\nwhich were received by the bank \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $11,096 56\n2. Wages paid by Port Royal \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... 9,631 11\n3. Supplies \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... 4,482 31\n4. Stumpage, Workmen\u2019s Comp., taxes etc\u2026\u2026 7,376 56\n5. Rent, housing men \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 26 00\n6. Freight on wood received under the\ncontracts \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 5,607 81\n$38,220 35\nNo question arises as to the first item, and I understood counsel for the appellant to admit the propriety of allowing the fourth item. In no case did it challenge the accuracy of the amounts or the fact that they had been paid for the purposes mentioned. I have no doubt, however, that Item 2, being the amount paid by the respondent as wages in the manufacture of the logs to a point where they acquired the value accepted by the appellant; Item 3, being the amount paid for supplies in connection with the same work, Item 5, being rent for housing the workmen, and Item 6, being the freight on the wood to the point of delivery, should all be allowed. In case I misunderstood counsel\u2019s admission, I should add that in my view Item 4 is in the same position.\nThis is not a claim for detinue such as arose in Glen-wood v. Phillips[2], but the general rule applicable is stated in Reid v. Fairbanks[3], as epitomized in the Second Edition of Halsbury, Vol. 10, page 138, paragraph 178:\nThe value of a chattel which was converted whilst in an unfinished state is estimated by ascertaining what would have been its value in a complete state at the place where it was converted and deducting the amount which it would have cost to complete it.\nAn allowance for freight under the circumstances has been justified ever since the decision in Morgan v. Powell[4], which was approved in Burmah Trading Corporation v. Mirza Mahomed[5].\nIn addition to the items to which I have referred, the respondent seeks to deduct from the value of the logs the balance of an old claim under the first contract between it and New Lepreau Limited and which it claims Atkinson authorized it to set off against the amount that would ultimately be due him by the respondent under the later contracts of 1934 and 1935. Even with Atkinson\u2019s consent it can have no right to deduct this sum from the amount of damages that it should properly pay.\nRespondent\u2019s statement shows that, excluding this sum, it paid out $38,220.35 and that the increased value of the logs was $43,008.97. The balance of $4,788.62 represents the value at the time and place of the conversion. As assignee of Atkinson\u2019s rights under the two contracts, the appellant can claim no greater amount, and I would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct that judgment be entered for this sum together with interest thereon at five per cent. per annum from July 31st, 1935, being the date agreed upon in the pleadings of each party by which the respondent had received the last of the logs. The respondent should pay the costs of the action and of the appeal to this Court but they are entitled to their costs of the appeal to the Appeal Division.\nHudson, J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed and judgment at the trial restored, with costs throughout, for the reasons given by my brothers Crocket and Davis.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hanson, Dougherty & West.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Sanford & Teed.\n[1] 12 M.P.R. 219; [1937] 4 D.L.R. 254.\n[2] [1904] A.C. 405.\n[3] (1853) 13 C.B. 692.\n[4] (1842) 3 Q.B. 278.\n[5] (1878) L.R. 5 Ind.

The respondent was not licensed under the Dentistry Act (R.S.B.C., 1936, c. 72) and did not do any work in British Columbia. Section 62 of that Act provides that \" any person not registered under the Act *** who practises dentistry or dental surgery in the province shall be guilty of an offence against this Act\"; and section 63 provides that \"any person shall be deemed to be practising the profession of dentistry\" who does certain specified things \" or who holds himself out as being qualified or entitled to do all or any of the above things ***.\" At the suit of the Attorney-General on relation of the College of Dental Surgeons of the province, the trial judge granted an injunction restraining the respondent from (a) holding himself out within the province by means of advertising as being qualified to practise dentistry and (b) advertising within the province in a manner which if done by a registered dentist would be improper or unprofessional. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, this judgment was set aside.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (53 B.C.R. 50), that the respondent was not subject to the provisions of the Dentistry Act of British Columbia. This statute applies only to a person holding himself out within the province as being qualified or entitled to do in the province any of the things enumerated in section 63; and held, also, that the dental college has no right to be granted an injunction restraining the respondent, who is not one of its members, from inserting advertisements which may, in the opinion of the college, be considered as improper or unprofessional conduct.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, D. A. MacDonald J. [2], by which the respondent was restrained from advertising in the province of British Columbia in respect of the practice of dentistry. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR. L. Maitland K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. A. MacInnes and F. C. Aubrey for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I have fully considered the able and ingenious argument of Mr. Maitland who rests his appeal on two grounds: first, that the respondent in his advertisements in the newspapers in Fernie and Nelson held himself out as qualified or entitled to examine, diagnose, or advise or to perform operations as set forth in section 63 of the Dentistry Act (R.S., 1936, c. 72); second, that these advertisements were offences against the rules of professional ethics as understood and practised by the members of the dental profession properly qualified to practice in British Columbia.\nAs regards the second ground, notwithstanding the able and attractive manner in which it was advanced by Mr. Maitland, I am really unable to discover anything in the Dentistry Act, nor do I know of any rule or principle of law which confers upon the dental college or the qualified members of the dental profession the right to invoke the aid of the courts in regulating the conduct of people who are not members of the profession, except by way of prosecution under section 62, which is now to be considered in connection with the first ground.\nAs to the first ground, section 63 is concerned with defining what constitutes \"practising the profession of dentistry within the meaning of\" the Dentistry Act. By that definition acts constituting the practice of dentistry fall into two main categories. The first of these categories comprises examining, diagnosing, advising on the condition of the teeth and the jaws; taking, making, performing and administering impressions, operations and treatments of, for and upon the teeth and jaws; and fitting artificial teeth and dentures in and upon the jaws. The second category includes cases in which anybody \"holds himself out as being qualified or entitled to do all or any\" of the things falling within the first category.\nBy section 62, any person not registered under the Act \"who practices dentistry or dental surgery in the prov- ince\" in the sense of section 63 is guilty of an offence against the Act.\nOn behalf of the appellant it is contended that by the advertisements in evidence the respondent held himself out as being qualified or entitled to do all or some of the things which constitute the practice of dentistry as embraced within the first category; and that, as the publication of the advertisement is an act within British Columbia, done at his instance, he is thereby practising dentistry in that province.\nI am disposed to attribute a liberal and comprehensive scope to the word \"qualified\"; but I think the advertisements with which we are here concerned do not fall within the second category in section 63 for this reason. The primary object of the statute is to regulate the practice in British Columbia of dentistry in the ordinary sense of these words; in the sense, that is to say, of the first of the categories in section 63. Authority to practise dentistry in British Columbia in this sense is given to persons on the register by section 61; and, by section 62, persons not on the register are prohibited from doing so. Then, there is statutory authority by section 61, to do the things within the second of the categories of section 63 (holding out) and there is a prohibition against them by section 62 which applies to persons who are not registered. The last mentioned authority and prohibition are plainly ancillary; and, prima facie therefore, they do not extend to things having no intelligible relation to the practice of dentistry in British Columbia in the ordinary sense, that is to say, in the sense of the first category; and that seems to be an admissible reading of the language. The words \" holds himself out\" (in British Columbia) \"as being qualified or entitled to do all or any of the above things\" may fairly be read as equivalent to \" presents himself in British Columbia,\" etc.; and, having regard to the context, to the sense in which such words as \" entitled \" and \" qualified \" are employed in other parts of the Act, and to the general object of the statute, I think that is the right construction.\nThe appeal accordingly should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by Kerwin J.\u2014The appellant, the Attorney-General for British Columbia, on the relation of the College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia, brought action against the respondent, David Cowen, for an injunction. Before the judge of first instance the motion for an injunction was by consent turned into a motion for judgment, which judgment was given in the following terms:\u2014\nThis Court doth order, adjudge and decree that the defendant be and he is hereby perpetually restrained from holding himself out within the province of British Columbia by means of advertising of any kind as being qualified to practise the profession of dentistry and the defendant, his servants and agents and each and every of them be and he is and they are hereby perpetually restrained from advertising within the province of British Columbia in respect of the practice of dentistry in any manner which if done by a member of the College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia would be improper or unprofessional.\nOn appeal, this judgment was set aside with Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissenting, as he would have dismissed the appeal with a variation in the judgment by striking out the words:\u2014\nand the defendant, his servants and agents and each and every of them be and he is and they are hereby perpetually restrained from advertising within the province of British Columbia in respect of the practice of dentistry in any manner which if done by a member of the College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia would be improper or unprofessional.\nThe respondent is a United States citizen residing in Spokane, in the state of Washington. He has an office there and in Coulee Dam in the same state where he practises his profession of dentistry. He does not do any work in British Columbia. In various newspapers published in the southeastern part of British Columbia he has inserted advertisements which, in the opinion of several members of the relator college, are unethical and unprofessional. The respondent takes the position that he is not bound by these opinions, with which he does not agree, and insists that he has the right to continue such advertisements.\nThe appellant's claim may be divided into two branches. The first depends upon the construction of section 63 of the Dentistry Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C., 1936, chapter 72, which reads as follows:\u2014\nAny person shall be deemed to be practising the profession of dentistry within the meaning of this Act who, for a fee, salary, reward, or commission paid or to be paid by an employer to him, or for fee, money, or compensation paid or to be paid either to himself or an employer, or any other person, examines, diagnoses, or advises on any condition of the tooth or teeth, jaw or jaws of any person, or who either directly or indirectly takes, makes, performs, or administers any impression, operation, or treatment or any part of any impression, operation, or treatment of any kind, of, for, or upon the tooth or teeth, jaw or jaws, or of, for, or upon any disease or lesion of the tooth or teeth, jaw or jaws, or the malposition thereof, of any person, or who fits any artificial denture, tooth, or teeth in, to, or upon the jaw or jaws of any person, or who holds himself out as being qualified or entitled to do all or any of the above things: Provided that this section shall not interfere with the privileges conferred upon physicians and surgeons by any Act relating to the practice of medicine and surgery in this province, nor with the privileges heretofore conferred upon registered students, nor with the ordinary vending or calling of a druggist.\nThe real dispute hinges upon the meaning to be ascribed to the italicized words. The mere enumeration of certain things, the doing of any one of which is to be deemed practising, was apparently not considered sufficient for the protection of the profession and the public. The enumeration would make clear that certain things were considered dentistry as to which some question might otherwise arise but the legislature has not attempted to declare the doing of any of these acts outside the province an offence and in my opinion it has not constituted the advertising done by the respondent an offence. I read the words under discussion to relate to a holding out within the province by a person that he has the education and training, or that he is registered under the Act, to do any of the enumerated things in the province.\nThat construction is borne out by a reference to the other sections of the Act. By section 2 a College of Dental Surgeons in and for the province of British Columbia is continued, the membership of which is to be composed of those who on or before a certain date were by law authorized to practise the profession in the province and of all other persons who may become and be registered members under the Act. By sections 3 and 4 the members are constituted a body corporate with a governing body styled the Council. By section 19, this Council is to cause to be kept by the registrar \"The Register of the Members of the College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia,\" and by section 20:\u2014\nOnly those persons whose names are entered and registered in the register shall be qualified and permitted to practise dentistry and dental surgery in the province except as hereinafter provided.\nProvision is then made for the registration of members, for the rectification of the register in certain events and (section 39) for the suspension or cancellation of the regis- tration of any person registered under the Act who, after due inquiry by the Council, is adjudged to have been guilty of infamous or unprofessional conduct. By section 56, there is due and payable to the College annually by each member of the College actually engaged in the practice of his profession, the sum of ten dollars, upon which a certificate is to be issued by the registrar stating that such member is entitled to practise the profession in the province. By section 57, if any member practises the profession in the province without having taken out a certificate for the current year, he is rendered subject to a fine and suspension from membership. By section 59 an annual list of members is to be prepared and a copy published in the Gazette;\nand production of a copy of the Gazette containing the list shall be prima facie evidence of the right of every person named in the list to practise the profession of dentistry or dental surgery in the province for one year from the date of the list, and the absence of the name of any person from the list shall be prima facie evidence that such person is not registered or entitled to practise under this Act.\nSection 61 enacts that every person registered and holding an unexpired annual certificate shall be entitled to practise the profession in the province, while section 62 provides that any person not registered under the Act or not holding an unexpired annual certificate or permit (for which provision is made later in the statute), or who has been suspended from practice, or whose name has been erased from the register, who practises the profession in the province shall be guilty of an offence against the Act.\nWithout mentioning in detail later sections of the Act in which the expression is used, a final reference may be had to the proviso in section 63 itself whereby\nthis section shall not interfere with the privileges conferred upon physicians and surgeons by any Act relating to the practise of medicine and surgery in this province.\nThese continued references make it clear to me at least that the proper construction of section 63 is as I have indicated.\nThe second branch of the appellant's case is that even if the above conclusion be held to be the correct one, it is against the public interest to permit the respondent to continue advertisements of the nature complained of. As to this, it appears sufficient to point out, that while, in the opinion of several reputable dentists in the province, such advertising, if done by a member of the College, would be improper or unprofessional conduct, such matters are by the Act left to the Council for inquiry and determination subject to an appeal; and furthermore, the Council could, of course, exercise jurisdiction only over its own members. Having concluded that the respondent had not committed an offence against the Act, I fail to see how it may be said that he has infringed any public right at common law. There is no basis for the suggestion that he had committed public mischief.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCannon J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nHudson J.\u2014The defendant is a dentist residing and practising his profession in the city of Spokane, in the state of Washington. Although not a member of the College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia, he advertises freely in a number of newspapers in British Columbia published in cities near the border, with a view to inducing residents of British Columbia to go to him for dental treatment. This action was brought in the name of the Attorney-General on the relation of the College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia, for an injunction restraining the defendant, his servants and agents from advertising by any means in the province of British Columbia in respect of the practice of dentistry by him, and particularly from advertising in such respects in any newspapers published in British Columbia.\nThe complaint of the relator is, first, that the advertising of the defendant was of such a nature that, if carried on by a member of the plaintiff college, it would be considered as a breach of professional ethics and as unprofessional conduct, according to the standards of that college; secondly, that the defendant's advertising campaign was an invasion of the statutory rights of members of the plaintiff college.\nOn a motion for injunction heard by agreement as a motion for judgment before Mr. Justice MacDonald, an order was made perpetually restraining the defendant from holding himself out within the province of British Columbia by means of advertising, as being qualified to practise the profession of dentistry. On appeal to the Court of Appeal this judgment was reversed by a majority of the Court. Chief Justice Martin there held that the Dentistry Act, chapter 72 of R.S.B.C, is concerned alone with the practice of dentistry within the province, and the prohibition there of acts relating to the practice of dentistry does not extend to those carried outside it, as in this case. Mr. Justice McQuarrie concurred with the Chief Justice and held that the plaintiff is not subject to any rule, regulation or principle of ethics established by the College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia, of which he is not a member, and furthermore that there is no statutory enactment prohibiting a resident of a foreign country from advertising in British Columbia. Mr. Justice O'Halloran took the view that the advertising in question did not amount to any violation of the provisions of the statute on the ground that it was of a non-professional or nonethical character, but held that by the provisions of the statute the defendant had no right to hold himself out in British Columbia as being qualified to practise the profession of dentistry, even though that practice was carried on in another jurisdiction.\nI agree with the view that the advertising itself although it may be unethical and unprofessional according to the standards of the plaintiff college, does not justify an injunction against the defendant who is not a member of such a college.\nThe purpose of the Dentistry Act was to regulate and control the practice of dentistry in the province of British Columbia. Sections 62 and 63 seem to me to be the only ones which require consideration in this case. Section 62 provides:\nAny person not registered under this Act, or not holding an unexpired annual certificate or permit as hereinafter provided, or who has been suspended from practice, or whose name has been erased from the register, who practises dentistry or dental surgery in the province shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.\nSection 63:\nAny person shall be deemed to be practising the profession of dentistry within the meaning of this Act who ***\nThen follows an enumeration of the different acts which shall be considered as \"practising dentistry.\" This portion of the section ends by these words:\nor who holds himself out as being qualified or entitled to do all or any of the above things. Section 62 creates the offence, namely, the practice by unqualified persons of dentistry in the province. Section 63 defines what shall be considered the practice of dentistry. Mr. Maitland ably and ingenuously argued that the later words in the section meant \"holding out within the province\" and must be construed to include the practice of dentistry, whether within or without the province. After very careful consideration of all that has been said, I cannot agree with this argument. It seems to me quite clear that the \"holding out\" referred to in the section must mean holding out as being qualified to do the things which were forbidden by the preceding words and by section 62, namely, the practice of dentistry within the province.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Maitland, Maitland, Remnant & Hutcheson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

McIlraith for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN, J.\u2014The accused was charged under section 229 of the Criminal Code with keeping a disorderly house, that is to say, a common bawdy house. This latter expression is defined by section 225 of the Code as follows:\nA common bawdy-house is a house, room, set of rooms or place of any kind kept for purposes of prostitution or for the practice of acts of indecency, or occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for such purposes.\nThere is no dispute about the facts, as the accused gave evidence from which it appears that she had rented a room and there had intercourse with men who paid her. Some called at the room and others were accosted by her on the street. Another girl lived with her but nothing turns upon this as this girl was not a prostitute. No woman had intercourse with men in the room except the accused. The magistrate dismissed the charge, following the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Sorvari[1]. That Court, with Middleton J.A. dissenting, affirmed the acquittal and from its order the Crown now appeals.\nPrior to 1907, a common bawdy house was defined by section 225 of the Code as \u201ca house, room, set of rooms or place of any kind kept for purposes of prostitution,\u201d but in that year, by 6-7 Edward VII, chapter 8, section 2, the section was repealed and a new one enacted in the same terms but with the addition at the end, of the words \u201cor occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for such purposes.\u201d These added words clearly cover the circumstances in the present case where there was not an isolated act of fornication but a habitual occupation of the room for purposes of prostitution.\nThis same view had been expressed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Margaret Smith[2], but this decision was not cited to the court that decided the Sorvari case1 or to the court below in the present appeal. To the same effect is the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Rex v. Miket[3].\nThe appeal should be allowed.

Fuller (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1938: May 2, 3; 1938: December 12.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Crocket, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nConspiracy\u2014Duress\u2014Action for alleged obtaining of property by threat of criminal prosecution\u2014Jury\u2019s findings\u2014Ground of action\u2014Substance of the claim\u2014Remedy.\nPlaintiff, who had been the general manager and a shareholder of a company, alleged that defendants, one of whom: was the president and a large shareholder of the company, entered into an unlawful conspiracy to obtain from him a transfer of his shares in the company by threats of criminal prosecution; that pursuant to the conspiracy defendants made such threats and, induced thereby, he delivered to defendants a transfer of the shares as demanded; and he claimed recovery of their value. Defendants denied plaintiff\u2019s allegations and they alleged breaches of duty in plaintiff\u2019s management of the company, resulting in loss to it, and that plaintiff surrendered his shares in satisfaction of claims on behalf of the company for such loss. At the trial two totally different stories in the evidence went to the jury, who, in answers to questions submitted, found in favour of plaintiff\u2019s allegations. Judgment was given to plaintiff for the amount awarded as damages by the jury, being the value of the shares plus interest. An appeal by defendants to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan was dismissed, [1938] 1 W.W.R. 241. Defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer The Chief Justice, Crocket and Davis JJ.: There was evidence to justify the jury\u2019s findings. These findings were in effect that there was an intentional design on defendants\u2019 part to obtain from plaintiff, without any valuable consideration, a transfer of his shares and that the same was demanded and obtained by menaces and illegal extortion. This was quite sufficient to answer the argument that a mere threat in itself is not unlawful. A threat to prosecute may not of itself be illegal where a just debt actually exists and where the transaction between the parties involves a civil liability as well as, possibly, a criminal act (Flower v. Sadler, 10 Q.B.D. 572, at 576). Here the findings plainly negatived defendants\u2019 story that the transaction was merely the legitimate compromise of a claim for damages for breach of duty. Moreover, no question of plaintiff\u2019s civil liability to the company set up by defendants was asked of the jury and defendants had no finding that there was any such liability.\nPer Davis J.: Remarks with regard to conspiracy as a ground of action. Inclination expressed to the opinion that civil conspiracy is not properly applicable to cases where physical property is sought to be recovered on the ground of duress and is really only relevant in cases of general or undefined rights, such as a right to trade, as distinguished from defined rights, such as the right to property. Doubt expressed whether the present, case properly lies in conspiracy. But, whether or not plaintiff\u2019s remedy was properly laid as an action in conspiracy, the substance of the claim was that plaintiff had been maliciously and unlawfully deprived of his property by duress and coercion on defendant\u2019s part; that was the issue that was contested at the trial and that was the issue that really went to the jury.\nKerwin and Hudson JJ. adopted the reasons of Mackenzie J.A. in the Court of Appeal, [1938] 1 W.W.R. at 244-260.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] dismissing their appeal from the judgment of Taylor J., on the verdict of a jury, that the plaintiff recover from the defendants the sum of $26,840 and interest.\nThe action was brought to recover from the defendants the value of certain shares of stock in the Reliance Lumber Co. Ltd. The plaintiff had been the owner of the said shares; and he alleged that defendants entered into an unlawful conspiracy to obtain from him a transfer of said shares by threats of criminal prosecution; that pursuant to the conspiracy the defendants threatened to institute criminal proceedings against him unless he would transfer the shares to them; that, induced by said threats, he delivered to defendants a transfer of the shares, defendants obtained possession of the share certificates and had ever since been in possession of the same.\nThe plaintiff had been the general manager, and the defendant Stoltze was the president, of said company. The other defendants were employees of Stoltze and as such had made certain investigations into the affairs of the company. In their defence the defendants denied plaintiff\u2019s allegations, and they alleged breaches of duty in plaintiff\u2019s management of the company, as a result of which, it was alleged, the company lost large sums of money and suffered and would suffer loss of profits, which the plaintiff became liable to repay and make good to the company, and that plaintiff agreed to surrender his shares to the company in full satisfaction of all claims of the company against him in respect of the aforesaid matters, and did so, delivering the share certificates endorsed in blank, and that the shares were now held by or on behalf of the company.\nDefendants\u2019 allegations were denied by plaintiff.\nThe delivery of the share certificates (endorsed in blank), and also the resignation of the plaintiff as general manager of the company, took place immediately after a certain interview between the defendants and the plaintiff. Conflicting accounts of what was said at that interview were given at the trial.\nThe evidence is discussed at some length in the judgment of Davis J. in this Court, now reported, and also in the judgment of Mackenzie J.A. in the Court of Appeal[2].\nAt the trial the jury found in favour of the plaintiff. The questions submitted and the jury\u2019s answers thereto were as follows:\n1. Did the plaintiff receive any valuable consideration for the transfer of his interest in his shares in the Reliance Lumber Company Limited referred to in the memorandum of agreement dated March 16th, 1936.\nAnswer: No.\n2. Did the defendants, on or about the 16th day of March, 1936, enter into a conspiracy to obtain a transfer of the plaintiff\u2019s shares of the capital stock of the Reliance Lumber Company Limited by threats of criminal prosecution of the plaintiff?\nAnswer: Yes.\n3. If you so find, did the defendants, pursuant to the said conspiracy, threaten to criminally prosecute the plaintiff?\nAnswer: Yes.\n4. And if you find in the affirmative in answering questions 2 and 3 was the plaintiff induced by the said threat to transfer and deliver his said shares in the said company to the defendants?\nAnswer: Yes. 5. Assess the damage sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the said conspiracy, if you have so found.\nAnswer: $26,840, plus interest at legal rate (from) March 16th, 1936.\n6. Did the defendants agree not to prosecute the plaintiff?\nAnswer: Yes, by implication.\nThe trial judge directed that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the amount, with interest, as awarded by the jury. The defendants appealed from the verdict and findings of the jury and from the said judgment to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal[3], and defendants appealed to this Court. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nF. L. Bastedo K.C. for the appellants.\nG. H. Yule K.C. and R. L. Winton for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I do not desire to lay down any rule of general application as to the scope of actions founded on conspiracy. Subject to that, I concur with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Davis.\nCrocket, J.\u2014Subject to the same reservation as that indicated in the learned Chief Justice\u2019s memorandum, I concur in the judgment of my brother Davis.\nDavis, J.\u2014From some time in the year 1909 until March 16th, 1936, the respondent Fuller had been the general manager of the Reliance Lumber Company, Limited, a Dominion company with head office at Saskatoon in the province of Saskatchewan and with an executive office in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A. The company carried on a retail lumber business in the province of Saskatchewan and had in March, 1936, about thirty lumber yards, mostly in the northern part of the province. The respondent resided in Saskatoon. The appellant Stoltze is the President of the Company and resides in St. Paul, Minnesota. His father, now deceased, had owned nine-tenths of the capital stock of the company and the respondent the other one-tenth. On the death of his father in 1928, the appellant Stoltze and his wife became the owners of, and still hold, nine-tenths of the stock of the company. The respondent remained the owner of the other one-tenth of the stock of the company. Stoltze\u2019s co-appellants, Kemper and Hadrath, also reside in St. Paul, Minnesota, and were requested by Stoltze in February, 1936, to investigate for him certain charges of mismanagement against the respondent in respect of the company\u2019s affairs that had been reported to Stoltze by one Davies. Hadrath was in the employ of Stoltze, having done both clerical and executive work for some years for him in connection with different companies with which Stoltze was connected. Stoltze described Hadrath as his \u201cconfidential man\u2014what in the United States we call in slang a trouble shooter. When something goes wrong I send him down to attend to it; if there is a problem before me, I ask him to look into it.\u201d Stoltze admitted that Hadrath had no special knowledge of the business of the Reliance Lumber Company. Kemper was an uncle of Stoltze\u2019s wife and had been assisting Stoltze in his office in St. Paul. Stoltze said he trusted him entirely but \u201che had no particular qualifications for this work.\u201d\u2014that is, of investigating the affairs of the Reliance Lumber Company. Neither Hadrath nor Kemper appear to have had any shares in the company.\nOn March 16th, 1936, the respondent turned over to the appellant Stoltze all his shares in the company and resigned as secretary, general manager and a director of the company. His shares were admitted to be worth $30,000 and there is no question that they were his own property. The share certificates, immediately prior to their delivery to Stoltze, were in the Dominion Bank at Saskatoon, collateral to loans to the respondent of $3,160. This amount the company paid to the Bank in order to release the security. On April 2nd, 1936, the respondent by his solicitor demanded from the appellant Stoltze the immediate reassignment and delivery to the respondent of the share certificates in question, or their value, his contention being that the transfer of the shares had been obtained by duress, in the form of threats of prosecution. This action by the respondent against the appellants Stoltze, Kemper and Hadrath followed the refusal of Stoltze to return the share certificates.\nTwo totally different stories were given to the jury. The evidence on behalf of the appellants (defendants) was that at a meeting of the four persons, parties to this action, in the company\u2019s office in Saskatoon on the said March 16th, 1936, the affairs of the company were discussed for about an hour; charges of mismanagement and breach of duty by the respondent as general manager of the company were made on the basis that the respondent had caused the company great loss by buying lumber through the medium of his son, so that his son would get a commission; that after the respondent had asked what he could do or should do about the \u201cmess\u201d that Stoltze had told him he had got the company into, Stoltze suggested to the respondent that he might turn in his stock in reparation; and that the respondent agreed to do that. Stoltze said at the trial that his understanding was that the respondent was voluntarily turning over the stock in reparation of the damage he had permitted to be done to the company and that he, Stoltze, believed the turning over of the stock would be an equitable solution because he was satisfied that the losses were much greater than the value of the stock.\nThe respondent\u2019s story was that on returning from a western business trip he was summoned to his office at the company\u2019s head office by telephone on the day in question, March 16th, 1936, and found the three appellants there; they had Changed the lock on the door of his office before his arrival; they made charges against him and threatened him with criminal prosecution and demanded, to avoid his prosecution, that he turn over to them all his shares in the capital stock of the company. The crucial part of his evidence as to the interview in the office that morning is this:\nHadrath and Kemper both said, You had better come clean, come clean. And we have got the goods on you. * * * After that was gone over, it got to such an extent that I hardly knew what to say. And then it was Hadrath said, You had better throw yourself into the hands of Mr. Stoltze. * * * Another question came up that seemed to break the ice, was this: Why did you give Gerald\u2014which is my son\u2014all of this business? I said, Mr. Stoltze knows that Gerald got this business. Mr. Stoltze rather flew off in a huff, and he said, I didn\u2019t know that he got all of the business, or so much of the business. * * * He (Stoltze) says, You have had no sympathy with others, and I haven\u2019t sympathy with you; you ought to be in gaol, and that is where we are going to send you; and your friend Arthur Moxon agrees.\nMr. Moxon was the company\u2019s solicitor in Saskatoon and a man of very high standing in his profession. The significance of the words \u201cand your friend Arthur Moxon agrees\u201d would be very apparent to a local jury. I was simply crushed; my mind was nearly a blank. They asked me a few more questions; and I was mentally\u2014I hardly knew what they did ask; asked a few more questions. And I says, What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Or what can I do? What do you want me to say? I didn\u2019t know where I was at. I hadn\u2019t been told. And finally Mr. Stoltze came on to the scene again\u2014* * * he spoke up. And he says, We want your shares in the Reliance Lumber Company; we want your resignation; we want you to agree not to compete with the Reliance Lumber Company anywhere, and to get out of the country.\nThe respondent said that he was crushed by all this; that Hadrath then went out into another room and came back with a paper which he respondent signed, containing his resignation and authority to the Dominion Bank to turn over his shares in the company. The respondent said that when Hadrath presented the document to him he said he thought he had better get a lawyer but was told by Stoltze, \u201cThis has got to be done before you get out of this room.\u201d Stoltze, on his cross-examination, when asked \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to him (the respondent) quietly, it seems the obvious thing to do, and say, Let us get together and talk about this quietly\u2019?\u201d answered, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen to be my way of doing things.\u201d\nThe respondent was obviously a man who was well and favourably known in his community, active in the work of the Y.M.C.A. and of the Rotary Club and was President of the Saskatoon Exhibition Board. He was a married man and his home was in Saskatoon. He said that he signed the document, not that he had done anything wrong, but he thought of \u201call those different things, different friends, and people, and associations, and I couldn\u2019t do it\u2014the disgrace of it.\u201d He very positively swore that during his administration of the company\u2019s affairs he never knowingly did anything or omitted to do anything to the prejudice of the company; that there was in his mind no just ground for the complaints and charges that were made; and that he was not attempting to stifle the prosecution of any just changes against him. Overcome by the threats of these three men and the situation that confronted him, he sought escape by acquiescing in their demands that he turn over his shares.\nNow those were the two stories that went to the jury. There was a mass of evidence directed to show that here and there the respondent had given advantage to his son in the buying of lumber for the company and suggestions that the company had as a result been getting a poorer grade of lumber than it otherwise would have obtained. The charges were of the most general character and the respondent gave his explanation of the several impeached transactions. There was no suggestion that the respondent was offered any release by the company of any claims the company might have against him for any loss that may have occurred as a result of the alleged breaches of duty. What was said by the appellants was that these losses were in excess of $30,000 and that it was a fair transaction to take the respondent\u2019s shares in the company in reparation for the losses.\nIt is perfectly plain that the jury accepted the respondent\u2019s story of what took place and, it being entirely contradictory of the appellants\u2019 story of what occurred, the jury obviously disbelieved the appellants. The jury\u2019s verdict was that the appellants should pay the respondent $26,840 (being the value of the stock, $30,000, less the amount of the loans paid to the Bank, $3,160) together with interest on that sum at the legal rate from March 16, 1936.\nWithout for the moment giving consideration to the form of the action or to certain objections taken by the appellants as to the rejection of evidence, no one could fairly disagree with the jury, upon the contradictory evidence, having arrived at the conclusion they did. If it had not been for the exhaustive review of the evidence and the very able argument presented to us by Mr. Bastedo, counsel for the appellants, I should not have thought that there was the slightest hope for any interference with the jury\u2019s verdict.\nMr. Bastedo, however, contended with great force that, the action being laid in conspiracy and there being no express plea of malice and nothing in the charge to the jury on malice, malice cannot reasonably be read into the questions to and the answers by the jury. If the action was properly framed in conspiracy, I should not find any difficulty in implying not only a charge but proof of malice. I have very considerable doubt myself that a case of this kind properly lies in conspiracy. Where, for instance, the charge is a charge of defrauding a man of his money, the allegation of conspiracy may add nothing to the charge and be mere surplusage. Conspiracy may be important where the act complained of is prima facie not a violation of a right, but may become so by reason of malice or spite. I am inclined to think that civil conspiracy is not properly applicable to cases where physical property is sought to be recovered on the ground of duress, and is really only relevant in cases of general or undefined rights, such as the right to trade, as distinguished from defined rights, such as the right to property. But however that may be, the effect of the jury\u2019s findings in this case is that there was an intentional design on the part of the three appellants to obtain from the respondent, without any valuable consideration, a transfer of the respondent\u2019s shares in the company that were worth $30,000 and that the same was demanded and obtained from the respondent by menaces and illegal extortion. That is quite sufficient to answer the argument that a mere threat in itself is not unlawful. As Lord Justice Cotton said in Flower v. Sadler[4], a threat to prosecute is not of itself illegal where a just and bona fide debt actually exists and where the transaction between the parties involves a civil liability as well as, possibly, a criminal act. But here the jury\u2019s findings plainly negative the appellants\u2019 story that the transaction was merely the legitimate compromise of a claim for damages for breach of duty. Moreover, the appellants set up a civil liability on the part of the respondent to the company for alleged loss by reason of the alleged breaches of duty but no such question was asked of the jury and the appellants have no finding that there was any such liability. Whether or not the remedy of the respondent was properly laid as an action in conspiracy, the substance of the claim was that the respondent had been maliciously and unlawfully deprived of his property by duress and coercion, on the part of the appellants. That was the issue that was contested at the trial and that was the issue that really went to the jury.\nObjection was taken by Mr. Bastedo to the refusal of the learned trial judge to admit evidence that was tendered on behalf of the appellants at the trial as to the details of the report made to Stoltze by one Davies with charges of the respondent\u2019s misconduct as general manager of the company, and as to information given by Davies to Stoltze as a result of which Stoltze caused the investigation to be made by Hadrath and Kemper, and of conversations between these persons, and of information obtained by Hadrath and Kemper on their trip of investigation through western Canada; also general evidence of the yard agents of the Reliance Lumber Company as to purchases of lumber being of a poor and inferior quality and below invoice grade, and evidence of prices paid by the Reliance Lumber Company to other companies in respect of which the respondent\u2019s son was alleged to be getting a commission. On the question of the exclusion of this evidence, the jury had before them the report of Davies upon which Stoltze acted, and the learned trial judge was quite right in declining to permit the trial to be dragged out interminably. The report of Davies was quite sufficient in itself for the purposes of the appellants. In any event the exclusion of the evidence did not occasion any substantial wrong.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin, J.\u2014Notwithstanding Mr. Bastedo\u2019s able argument, I think this appeal should be dismissed. I cannot usefully add anything to the judgment of Mr. Justice MacKenzie[5].\nHudson, J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs for reasons mentioned by Mr. Justice MacKenzie in the court below[6].\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Estey, Moxon, Schmitt & McDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Gilbert H.

But we think the learned President is right that Snader\u2019s procedure is an application of the ideas disclosed by Adamson which anybody familiar with and skilled in the art might be expected to arrive at without the exercise of invention in the sense of the patent law.\nNo doubt the Commissioner of Patents ought not to refuse an application for a patent unless it is clearly without substantial foundation.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Boyer J., and maintaining in part the respondent's action n\u00e9gatoire.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nM. M. Sperber K.C. for the appellant.\nM. I. Sigler for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The issue between the parties to this appeal concerns a brick wall, fourteen feet in length and twelve inches thick at its base, diminishing to a thickness of eight inches at the third story. The wall rests, as to one half on the property of the appellants and as to the other on the property of the respondents.\nThe courts below have agreed that, the wall having been erected by the appellant's predecessor in title, the respondent never acquired title to rights of mitoyennet\u00e9 in it. The appellant has created openings in this wall and inserted therein sheets of translucent but not transparent glass. The question in controversy concerns their right to maintain these openings in this state.\nI agree with the Court of King's Bench that article 534 of the Civil Code of Quebec is plainly not applicable, the wall in question not being \u201cun mur non-mitoyen joignant l'h\u00e9ritage d'autrui.\u201d Nor does article 533 strictly apply because, to quote the judgment of that Court, \u201cce mur n'est pas mitoyen au sens de l'article 533 du Code Civil.\u201d\nI agree also with the Court of King's Bench that the last paragraph of article 515 appears to give the key to the principle for determining the controversy before us. Although that article deals with a different case, yet, reading it with articles 533 and 534, there can, I think, be little doubt as to the governing consideration. Mr. Justice St. Jacques says:\nCette disposition du dernier paragraphe de l'article 515 nous fait voir le sens et la signification qu'il faut donner aux mots employ\u00e9s dans l'article 534, pour d\u00e9signer le mur dans lequel il peut \u00eatre pratiqu\u00e9 des jours ou fen\u00eatres \u00e0 fer maill\u00e9 et verre dormant. Ce n'est que dans un mur non-mitoyen joignant imm\u00e9diatement l'h\u00e9ritage d'autrui que de telles fen\u00eatres ou jours peuvent \u00eatre pratiqu\u00e9s.\nWith this I agree. Mr. Justice St. Germain has given convincing reasons for concluding that the openings in question here constitute \u201cjours\u201d in the sense of article 534.\nIt follows that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cannon, Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014The parties own two adjoining immoveables situate on Hutchison street, in the city of Montreal. Appellant's property was built in 1910; respondent's in 1911. The twelve inches northwest brick wall of appellant's property is for a depth of 55 feet built half on appellant's land and half on the adjoining land acquired by the respondent in 1919. When respondent's building was erected, in 1911, the appellant's wall was used, for a depth of forty-one feet; and on that part joists and beams were inserted to support the weight of respondent's building. The remaining fourteen feet of the wall for its whole height has never been used by respondent or her auteurs. It is a plain brick wall which faces the back yard of respondent's building.\nIn September, 1936, appellant made two openings in the said fourteen feet of the said wall. These openings, one on the second story and the other on the third story, had inside or interior window frames with blue coloured frosted glass. The windows were nailed to the sills at the bottom and at the sides, and in addition there were mouldings put up at the sides to prevent the windows being pushed up; these mouldings were also nailed. There were hinges for shutters or exterior windows which were never put on.\nThe date of the construction of the windows, as originally or later used, is of little importance, except perhaps in respect to the costs of the injunction proceedings, with which we are not now concerned, as the Court intimated to the parties during the argument that, in view of the concurrent judgments of the Quebec courts on this question of procedure, it should not be raised again before us. It is enough to say that, after the demand for injunction, appellant caused the outside frame to disappear, filled the opening with bricks of translucent but not transparent glass, which bricks are sealed and do not project outside the wall. The trial judge found that the structure or alterations made by the appellant were illegal and based his finding on article 534 C.C. which prohibits, not only windows, but lights, i.e., anything that will permit the light of day to penetrate, except in the manner indicated by the article. Such lights or windows must be provided with an iron trellis the bars of which are not more than four inches apart, and a window-sash fastened with plaster or otherwise in such a way that it must remain closed. The trial judge, therefore, ordered the appellant to close completely that part of the windows which is less than seven feet from the floor in such a manner that the light could not penetrate through this part, and in so far as the surplus height is concerned, the appellant was ordered to put in window sashes pursuant to the terms of article 534.\nThe respondent accepted this judgment and precluded the Court of King's Bench from giving full effect to their finding which was that the appellant had no right whatsoever to construct opening windows or lights.\nThe appellant accepts the findings of fact of the Court of King's Bench, which are as follows:\nAttendu qu'il est prouv\u00e9 que le mur dans lequel la d\u00e9fenderesse a pratiqu\u00e9 les fen\u00eatres ou jours est construit en partie sur le terrain de la demanderesse et en partie sur celui de la d\u00e9fenderesse; qu'il a toutes les caract\u00e9ristiques d'un mur fait pour devenir mitoyen;\nAttendu qu'il ne ressort pas de la preuve que la demanderesse et ses auteurs aient la mitoyennet\u00e9 du mur en en payant la valeur;\nConsid\u00e9rant que si ce mur n'est pas mitoyen au sens de l'article 533 du Code Civil, il n'est pas non plus un mur non-mitoyen joignant l'h\u00e9ritage d'autrui, puisqu'il est assis en partie sur le terrain de la demanderesse;\nThe Court of King's Bench refused to the appellant the benefit of article 534 because the wall does not adjoin the land of the respondent but is built half on it. They applied, however, the principle established in par. 3 of article 515, which reads as follows:\n515. Every proprietor may raise the common wall at will, but at his own cost, upon paying an indemnity for the additional weight imposed, and bearing for the future the expense of keeping it in repair above the height which is common.\nThe indemnity thus payable is the sixth of the value of the super-structure.\nOn these conditions such superstructure becomes the exclusive property of him who built it; but it remains, as to the right of view, subject to the rules applicable to common walls. The ratio decidendi of the Court of King's Bench may be found in the following quotation from the reasons of Mr. Justice St. Jacques:\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse peut-elle pr\u00e9tendre que ce mur lui est propre et qu'elle peut y faire des ouvertures permettant \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re ou au jour de p\u00e9n\u00e9trer \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de sa maison?\nDans cette partie du mur de six pouces d'\u00e9paisseur qui est assise sur le terrain de la demanderesse, il ne peut s'agir d'un mur propre \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, au sens de l'article 534 du Gode civil. Ce mur n'en est pas un \u201cjoignant imm\u00e9diatement l'h\u00e9ritage\u201d de la demanderesse; il y est assis en partie, et ce n'est pas parce que la demanderesse n'aurait pas pay\u00e9 la moiti\u00e9 du co\u00fbt ou de la valeur de ce mur que la d\u00e9fenderesse peut y faire des ouvertures, m\u00eame pour y obtenir le jour, suivant les dispositions des articles 534 et 535.\nLes codificateurs nous disent que l'article 533 et les deux suivants sont tir\u00e9s de la Coutume de Paris et sont conformes au Code Napol\u00e9on. Et ils ajoutent que \u201cc'est \u00e0 leur occasion que s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9e de savoir si le copropri\u00e9taire, qui exhausse \u00e0 ses. propres frais le mur mitoyen, a droit de faire dans l'exhaussement les ouvertures permises dans le mur qui lui serait propre; et l'on se rappellera que les Commissaires ont fait adopter de d\u00e9cider cette question dans la n\u00e9gative au moyen du paragraphe ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 515, pour les raisons qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9es en le commentant.\u201d\nOr, sous l'article 515, ils ont dit:\n\u201cLes deux premiers paragraphes de cet article sont pris des articles 195 et 197 de la Coutume de Paris, et diff\u00e8rent peu de l'article 658 du Code Napol\u00e9on. Quant au troisi\u00e8me paragraphe qui ne se trouve ni dans l'un ni dans l'autre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 afin de trancher la question controvers\u00e9e sous l'ancienne jurisprudence de savoir si dans cet exhaussement, il \u00e9tait permis \u00e0 celui qui l'avait fait d'y pratiquer des vues de coutume, de m\u00eame que si tout le mur lui \u00e9tait propre, suivant l'article 200 de la Coutume. Les Commissaires ont pens\u00e9 que le mur mitoyen exhauss\u00e9 ne saurait \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 au mur propre joignant sans moyen \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritage d'autrui parce que, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, cet exhaussement est fait pour moiti\u00e9 sur le terrain du voisin et peut \u00e0 peine \u00eatre regard\u00e9 comme lui appartenant exclusivement; ils sont donc d'avis que le droit en question ne doit pas exister, et l'ont ainsi d\u00e9clar\u00e9, sans pr\u00e9tendre qu'en cela il y ait eu introduction de droit nouveau.\u201d\nLe troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 515 est \u00e0 l'effet que bien que la partie du mur ainsi exhauss\u00e9e soit propre \u00e0 celui qui l'a faite, elle reste, quant au droit de vue, sujette aux r\u00e8gles applicables au mur mitoyen. Cette disposition a pour but, ainsi que le disent les codificateurs, d'\u00e9viter la controverse qui existait en France \u00e0 ce sujet.\n* * *\nOn voit, donc quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la raison qui a inspir\u00e9 les codificateurs dans le r\u00e9daction de l'article 515; c'est que' l'on a voulu \u00e9viter ce conflit de jurisprudence et d\u00e9terminer, d'une fa\u00e7on nette, que la partie du mur exhauss\u00e9e, bien que propre \u00e0 celui qui a fait cet exhaussement, reste soumise \u00e0 la prohibition de l'article 533 quant au droit de vue, parce que le mur repose sur deux h\u00e9ritages et qu'on ne peut pas dire que, tout en n'\u00e9tant pas mitoyen, il est propre exclusivement \u00e0 l'une des parties.\nCette disposition du dernier paragraphe de l'article 515 nous fait voir le sens et la signification qu'il faut donner aux mots employ\u00e9s dans l'article 534, pour d\u00e9signer le mur dans lequel il peut \u00eatre pratiqu\u00e9 des jours ou fen\u00eatres \u00e0 fer maill\u00e9 et verre dormant. Ce n'est que dans un mur non-mitoyen joignant imm\u00e9diatement l'h\u00e9ritage d'autrui que de telles fen\u00eatres ou jours peuvent \u00eatre pratiqu\u00e9s.\nLe mur dans lequel la d\u00e9fenderesse a pratiqu\u00e9 des ouvertures qui, \u00e0 l'origine, avaient l'apparence de v\u00e9ritables fen\u00eatres pouvant donner droit de vue, n'est pas ce mur que d\u00e9crit l'article 534. Il n'est pas mitoyen, en ce sens que rien ne fait voir dans la preuve que le droit de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par le paiement d'une partie du co\u00fbt de construction du mur; mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit avec toutes les caract\u00e9ristiques d'un mur destin\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir mitoyen, et, en plus, il est assis en partie, pour une moiti\u00e9, sur l'immeuble de la demanderesse. Celle-ci peut, en tout temps, acqu\u00e9rir la copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 du mur, si elle n'est pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 en mesure d'\u00e9tablir que ses auteurs l'ont fait.\nQuant \u00e0 la copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 du terrain sur lequel le mur est b\u00e2ti, elle est certaine et admise de part et d'autre. Les ouvertures que la d\u00e9fenderesse a pratiqu\u00e9es dans ce mur ne me paraissent pas autoris\u00e9es par l'article 534, m\u00eame si elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites strictement en conformit\u00e9 avec les exigences de l'article 535.\nI accept the views of the Court of King's Bench and apply as they have done, by analogy, the principle of art. 515, par. 3, concerning the superstructure built by one of the owners of a common wall to the wall built, as in this, case, by the owner half on his property and half on his neighbour's land. It may be true that under modern conditions these articles of our Code may create difficulties and unnecessary hardships to those who wish to improve their properties. There seems to be a tendency in France to alleviate the strictness of the rule. For instance, in the case of Lacrevaz C. Ecuvillon[2], they have decided what would seem favourable to the appellant's contention:\nLes art. 676 et 677, C. Civ., qui r\u00e9glementent les jours de souffrance, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 emp\u00eacher de voir dans le fonds voisin, d'y jeter des immondices et de s'y introduire, ne sont pas applicables au cas o\u00f9 un propri\u00e9taire fait garnir une ouverture pratiqu\u00e9e dans son mur de \u201cplots\u201d ou blocs de verre d'une certaine \u00e9paisseur, formant par leur assemblage une cloison solide qui permet de recevoir la lumi\u00e8re de l'ext\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur, mais \u00e0 travers laquelle il n'est pas possible de distinguer les objets plac\u00e9s au dehors; la paroi de verre ainsi scell\u00e9e dans la mur, et qui ne permet ni la vue, ni le jet des immondices, ni l'introduction des personnes, constitue une sorte de mur \u00e9clairant, et il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'elle soit rev\u00eatue d'un treillis de fer, ni qu'elle soit plac\u00e9e \u00e0 la hauteur d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par l'art. 677 (C. civ., 676 et 677).\nIl en doit \u00eatre surtout ainsi, lorsque cette cloison translucide est \u00e9tablie au-dessus et au-dessous d'autres ouvertures incontest\u00e9es, prenant jour et vue sur l'h\u00e9ritage voisin, et ne saurait, partant, \u00eatre pour ce dernier la source d'aucune g\u00eane.\nIt must be said, however, that this decision of a court of first instance is not accepted as final by the official report, in a foot-note. See Gazette du Palais, Table 1930-1935, Vo.

The trial judge instructed the jury that the burden lay upon the respondent to prove negligence against the appellant. The jury found that the burns on the respondent's head were not \" the result of negligence, but rather accidental.\" The trial judge dismissed respondent's action.

A. MacDonald J. which had dismissed the respondents' action, after a trial with a jury, and ordering a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ.W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nC. F. H. Carson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014The respondent Edna Field claimed damages in this action for injuries alleged to have been suffered by her as the result of a burn which she says she received in the appellant's departmental store in Vancouver while having a permanent wave in the beauty parlour operated and conducted by the appellant in its store; and her husband claimed in the same action substantial special damages for hospital and medical attention as well as general damages. The claims were based upon the alleged negligence of the appellant, its servants or agents, and particulars of the negligence were set forth in the statement of claim as follows:\n(a) The operators in charge at the said defendant's beauty parlour did not take due care in giving the treatment in question.\n(b) The said operators allowed the apparatus used to become extremely hot, causing the burn in question.\nThe case was tried with a jury and it was essentially a question of fact. Two totally different stories were presented to the jury. The appellant's evidence went to show that during the giving of the permanent wave in the beauty parlour the woman complained that she was hot at the back of her head and that the operator at once applied a cooling device. The appellant said that the woman had only a blister at the back of her head which probably was caused, as was not unusual, by the pulling effect of the treatment on the hair. To those in charge of the beauty parlour it appeared to be an insignificant thing. That occurred in the morning and in the evening the woman came back to the store with her husband, complaining that she had been burnt. The nurse in attendance at the store (Miss Walker) said she found a slightly reddened area about the size of a five-cent piece at the back of the head, slightly to the left, and that the skin had evidently been broken. The woman was complaining of severe pain and in order to give her relief and to protect the area from infection, the nurse cleansed the area round about with alcohol and applied a moist boracic compress for a minute or so until it was clean, and then put on a sterile dressing. The husband asked to be reimbursed the $5 his wife had paid for the permanent wave and wanted to be paid for his time in coming down to the store in the evening with his wife. Upon the appellant's evidence there was merely a small blister, not as a result of any excessive application of heat but as one of the incidents of the modern electrical treatments for waving the hair which may occur to certain people by a pulling effect on the hair at some particular point and result in a slight blister.\nBut the respondents' story was entirely different. It rested largely upon the evidence of a Dr. McEown. He said he was called to examine the woman the same evening and according to his story he found a deep burn on the left scalp about the size of a fifty-cent piece and on the right hand side of the head another burn about the size of a quarter, not as deep as the burn on the left. He proceeds in his story to attribute to this a severe condition of shock together with a heart condition and a hemorrhage and subsequently a very serious physical condition of the thyroid glands and very severe internal trouble which necessitated removal of certain organs of the body, resulting in a very serious condition of health. Several medical witnesses were called on both sides.\nTwo stories could not be more different. The learned trial judge expressed no view upon the facts but told the jury the facts were entirely for them.\nYou have got to decide before you give a verdict in this case whether Dr. McEown is an honest man. There is no side stepping it, because counsel for the defence made it an issue as to Dr. McEown when he was in the box. There is no misunderstanding. It is a clear issue. He said, \"Dr. McEown, I think you are trying to mislead this jury, trying to deceive them.\" Now, maybe he did. It is for you to say. I have no opinion on it at all.\nThe items of the special damages claimed by the husband which the jury had before them showed a charge of Dr. McEown for services amounting to $580. It is perfectly plain on the findings of the jury that they did not accept the respondents' story. If they had the damages could not have been anything but a very substantial amount. For the reasons to which we shall refer later, the jury made it abundantly plain that they regarded the occurrence in the beauty parlour as giving rise to a small amount of damages. The husband's claim for special damages for hospital, nursing and medical attendances amounted to $1,410.30. The jury's award of $500 to Mrs. Field, alone, indicated clearly, we think, that the jury concluded that the husband's expenses were in no way attributable to the burn in the beauty parlour.\nThe learned trial judge put the case to the jury very clearly on three separate issues, though no specific questions were put to the jury.\nThe first issue was whether the woman was burnt by any act of negligence on the part of Miss Ferguson, the operator in the beauty parlour who administered the treatment for a permanent wave.\nThe charge is that Miss Ferguson, no matter how expert she may be, on this occasion did not take the care which a reasonable operator would have taken in order to prevent her customer from being injured; and that is a question of fact for you to decide, and it is the first fact, because if you find that Miss Ferguson was not to blame at all for this accident, then the case ends right there and you need not worry about doctors or anything else.\n***\nIt is not necessary that she intended to injure the woman. She, of course, did not; it is the last thing in the world she wanted; but did she fail to do what a reasonably competent person would do, with the result that this woman's head was burned. That is a question for you.\nNow the jury found on that issue:\nIt is our opinion that there has been nothing to show that the burns on Mrs. Fields' head was the result of negligence, but rather accidental.\nNo one could rightfully quarrel with the jury coming to that conclusion upon the evidence. The jury might have stopped at that conclusion, for they had been told by the learned trial judge that if Miss Ferguson was not to blame for the accident that would be the end of the case.\nThe second issue put to the jury, if they found that negligence caused injury to the woman, was the question of damages. The trial judge divided the claims for damages into three parts. Firstly, he dealt with the husband's claim for special damages. As to that item the trial judge told the jury: *** the amount that was agreed upon was $1,410.30, which may be subject to any deduction that you may make from that if you say, oh, now, a lot of this treatment was the result of the operation and had nothing to do with the burn at all, then you would have to make some deduction there. What it would be you would have to decide.\nThe second item in the claim for damages dealt with was that of the husband for general damages for loss of consortium. The third item was that of Mrs. Field for general damages. The learned trial judge on this last item told the jury:\nShe is entitled to compensation for her pain and her suffering and her loss of time, and in this particular case she is entitled, if you find that her present condition is the result of that accident, of that negligence, she is entitled to fair and full compensation for the serious condition in which her health now is.\nThe other side of the picture is this: If all that happened here, as the defence contends, was a slight burn which broke the skin, and as so often happens when the skin is broken anywhere and by any means blood poisoning set in and she was laid up for a month\u2014you might give her the benefit of the doubt, say two months, but that there was nothing very serious about it, and they got it all healed up, the hair is growing in again, and nobody would ever know the scar was there, now if you take that view you would not allow her very much; and it is a question of the time and the burn suffered there, so you see the very difficult question you have to decide, and all you have to go on is the history of the case, and the doctors' evidence is as to what did cause this present condition; and there is a straight line of cleavage as I pointed out before. If you think that the plaintiff's doctors are right, the damages would be very substantial indeed. If you think the defendant's doctors are right, they would not be very much; but in either case, it would be for you to fix.\nA third issue distinctly arose out of the claims for damages. That was, was the condition of the woman at the time of the trial the result of the injury alleged by her to have been sustained in the beauty parlour? There was a great deal of medical testimony on both sides on this question. The learned trial judge told the jury:\nI do not wish to influence you in any way and I can tell you perfectly frankly that I have formed no opinion on these facts. It is not the part of my duty to do so, and I have not done it. I knew most of these doctors, and I am very glad that you are here to make the decision as to which of them was mistaken. They are directly at issue, and you will have to take the responsibility of deciding which one of them-which line of doctors has made a mistake. Somebody has made a mistake, as you know, you have got to make the decision.\nNow the finding of the jury on this question was:\nAs to the effect of the shock and infections on Mrs. Field's present condition, we find no connection.\nHere again no one could rightfully quarrel with the jury in reaching that conclusion upon the very conflicting testi mony. But the jury added: \"We award her $500.\u201d The learned trial judge said, after hearing the verdict of the jury:\nYou cannot award her anything. Mr. Foreman, the action must be dismissed. I made that as clear as language can make, that unless you found the defendant to blame, you could not give the plaintiff any damages. The action will be dismissed.\nThe jury having expressly found that in their opinion the burns on Mrs. Field's head were not the result of negligence, but rather accidental, the jury had no right, as the trial judge very properly held, to award her anything. Obviously they wanted to give her some solatium.\nUpon an appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia from the judgment dismissing the action with costs, the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment and directed a new trial. Mr. Justice McQuarrie said that if the verdict as interpreted by the learned trial judge amounts to a finding that the plaintiffs are not entitled to any damages, it showed in his opinion that the jury disregarded material indisputable facts in evidence, and in that case there should be a new trial. He thought that the appellant's nurse, Miss Walker, having admitted that when she examined the alleged burn she had found a small slightly reddened area on the back of the woman's head, and that the skin was broken as if there had been a blister, together with the fact that there was no fault on the part of the injured woman herself, would entitle the plaintiffs to some damage. But the learned judge in appeal said further that he considered a new trial was also rendered necessary by reason of misdirection by the trial judge inasmuch as he erred in his direction to the jury as to the onus of proof and should have instructed the jury that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied to the facts of the case. On that point he agreed with the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Sloan.\nMr. Justice Sloan (with whom the Chief Justice of British Columbia concurred) put his judgment upon the ground that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was applicable to the facts of the case. After reviewing and considering a number of authorities, Mr.Justice Sloan concluded:\nThis case falls within that class of case where \"the onus is upon the defendant to establish affirmatively inevitable accident, or in other words, absence of negligence on his part.\" The learned trial judge had told the jury that the burden throughout lay upon the plaintiffs to prove to the jury that the woman was injured by negligence and that that negligence was the cause of the illness. Mr. Justice Sloan reached the conclusion, in reliance upon the decision of this Court in United Motor Service v. Hutson [2], amongst other cases, that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury on the law relative to the burden of proof. We had occasion recently in Sisters of St. Joseph v. Fleming [3], to make some observations which we thought pertinent upon the application of the maxim res ipsa loquitur. It is unnecessary for us in this case to consider whether or not that doctrine has any application to this case. It is sufficient in our view to observe that the case for the respondents was formulated in the pleadings and developed at the trial as an action of negligence against the appellant without any reference to the rule of res ipsa loquitur. And the case went to the jury, without any objection, on the basis of an action for negligence in which the burden lay upon the respondents. That being so, the respondents are not entitled upon an appeal to recast their case and put it upon a basis which had not been suggested at the trial.\nThe case of Scott v. Fernie [4] laid down that rule and held that nothing in then sec. 66 of The (British Columbia) Supreme Court Act afforded an escape. The present sec. 60 (R.S.B.C., 1936, chap. 56) is substantially the same as old sec. 66 which was considered in that case. The unanimous judgment of the Court (Hunter C.J., Martin and Duff JJ.) was delivered by the present Chief Justice of this Court. The then sec. 66 of the Act of 1904 (although the first and second provisoes had been introduced into the section after the trial of the action, the Court considered itself governed by them so far as they were applicable) was held not to abrogate the long established rule which holds a litigant to a position deliberately assumed by his counsel at the trial.\nIn the case before us in this appeal the issues of fact for the jury were settled during the conduct of the trial and the issues submitted to the jury were accepted on both sides as the issues upon which the jury were to pass. Counsel for the respondents urged that in any case the finding of the jury that there was nothing to show that the female plaintiff's head had been burnt as a result of negligence was perverse. Mr. Justice McQuarrie in the Court of Appeal thought it clear that the respondents were entitled to some damages, the amount of which should have been fixed by the jury. That learned judge relied upon the fact that there was no fault on the part of the injured woman. In his view if the verdict as interpreted by the trial judge amounts to a finding that the respondents were not entitled to any damages, it showed that the jury had disregarded material undisputed facts in the evidence and that there should be a new trial. It is really another way of applying the res ipsa loquitur rule, and Mr. Justice McQuarrie agreed with the other members of the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in his direction to the jury as to the onus of proof and should have instructed the jury that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied to the facts of the case. The case having been put to the jury as one of negligence, the jury undoubtedly accepted the evidence of Miss Macdonald, the manager of the beauty parlour, when she said that she had never known in her experience as an operator of any head burns occurring before this case.\nIt is just one of those things you can't account for\u2014no fault of the operator and no fault of the machine.\nAsked if the hair ever gets at times pulled tight, Miss Macdonald answered :\nIt is usually what causes what we call a pull blister. It is not a burn. It is the pulling of the scalp tight which causes the blister and it will have the same effect as a burn, because the skin will break and it will blister.\nThis evidence of Miss Macdonald, I think, explains the language of the jury on the question of negligence:\nIt is our opinion there has been nothing to show that the burns on Mrs. Field's head was the result of negligence, but rather accidental.\nDealing with the case as one of negligence, which was the way the case was developed and presented to the jury, their finding cannot in my view be said to be perverse.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs to the appellant throughout, if asked.\nThe respondents made a motion to quash the appeal upon the ground that, the appeal being from a judgment upon a motion for a new trial, sec. 65 of the Supreme Court Act required notice to be given in writing to the opposite party, or his attorney of record, within twenty days after the decision complained of, or within such further time as the Court appealed from, or a judge thereof, allows. The motion was well founded at the time it was launched but before it came on for hearing the necessary extension of time had been granted by a judge of the court appealed from. The motion was therefore not pressed but the respondents are entitled to their costs of the motion.\nThe judgment of Crocket and Kerwin JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The rule of res ipsa loquitur was not relied upon at the trial and may not be put forth to assist the plaintiffs before the provincial Court of Appeal or this Court. This being so, there is no ground upon which the verdict of the jury may be disturbed. It reads as follows:\nIt is our opinion that there has been nothing to show that the burns on Mrs. Field's head was the result of negligence, but rather accidental. As to the effect of the shock and infections on Mrs. Field's present condition, we find no connection. We award her $500.\nThe finding that there was no negligence and no connection between the female plaintiff's condition at the time of the trial and the shock and infection of which she complained disposes of the matter and the latter part of the answer must be disregarded.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored, with costs throughout, but the respondents are entitled to the costs of their motion to quash the appeal as the appellant secured an extension of time only after service of the notice of motion.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Farris, Farris, McAlpine, Stultz, Bull & Farris.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Wismer & Fraser.\n[1] (1937) 52 B.C.

(Samson v. Frazier, [1937] 2 K.B. 170, and Morten v. Hilton therein cited and reported in foot-note).\nIn the present case, the judgments at trial and on appeal for recovery by the brokers of balance of account, on the basis of the loss represented by subsequent purchases by the brokers to cover the short sale and charged to the customer, were sustained.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Rose C.J.H.C. by which the plaintiffs recovered against him the sum of $2,413.72 (and interest from date of the writ) claimed by the plaintiffs (stock brokers) as being the balance owing by the defendant to them on purchases made by them to cover the defendant\u2019s short sale of shares of stock. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Davis J. now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nL.M. Singer K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. and G.D. Watson for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading and considering the judgment of my brother Davis and I fully concur in his conclusion as well as his reasons. On the hearing of the appeal, I was impressed by the force of Mr. Singer\u2019s argument touching the purchases of Bidgood Kirkland Gold stock on the 23rd of January, 1936. I think the tenor of the judgment of Rose, C.J.H.C., shows he had concluded that the subsequent purchases charged against the appellant were in fact purchases made by the broker on the appellant\u2019s account; that such, in other words, was the real nature of these transactions.\nIt would seem that the learned Chief Justice must have been satisfied that the purchases of the 23rd of January were on account of other customers and that the Court of Appeal must have agreed with the conclusions of the Chief Justice on both these points.\nCANNON J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Crocket, Davis and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nDAVIS J.\u2014This appeal involves a short selling transaction in an unlisted mining stock. The appellant was the customer; the respondents were his broker. The stock rose rapidly in price when the customer expected it would go down, with the result that when the account was closed it showed a loss to the customer of $2,413.72, for which amount with interest the respondents sued in this action. Judgment was delivered at the conclusion of the trial of the action by Rose, C.J.H.C., in favour of the respondents for the full amount of the claim. That judgment was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The customer appealed further to this Court.\nThe respondents carry on business as stock brokers in the city of Toronto and are members of the Toronto Stock Exchange. They also deal in unlisted mining shares. On January 16th, 1936, the appellant instructed the respondents to sell short for his account and risk 4,000 shares in Bidgood Kirkland Gold Mines, Limited. The stock at the time was not listed on any stock exchange and dealings were effected between brokers who were dealing in unlisted securities. It is plain that both parties knew and intended that the transaction was to be a short sale; that the appellant did not own or possess any of the shares of the com- pany; and that the respondents would lend or obtain the necessary shares to complete the sale.\nOn the said 16th of January, 1936, the respondents sold, pursuant to the appellant\u2019s instructions and for his account, 4,000 shares of the Bidgood stock to another Toronto broker, Stratton, Hopkins & Company, at 34 cents per share. That that was a genuine sale is really not disputed. The price of the Bidgood shares shortly thereafter began to rise and kept up at a substantially higher price at all material times. The range of the prices of the stock is indicated by the evidence:\nJanuary\n30th,1936..................................\n.52 \u2013. 55\nFebruary\n6th..............................................\n.70\n\u201c\n19th............................................\n.82\n\u201c\n24th............................................\n1.00\n\u201c\n25th............................................\n1.15 \u2013 1.21\nMarch\n3rd..............................................\n.93\n\u201c\n4th..............................................\n1.03 \u2013 1.05\n\u201c\n9th..............................................\n.86\nApril\n3rd..............................................\n.96\u00bd\n\u201c\n8th..............................................\n1.00\n\u201c\n17th............................................\n1.25\n\u201c\n18th............................................\n1.52\nand subsequently went as high as $2.10. At the date of the trial, March 16th, 1937, the price was $1.50.\nAlthough repeated demands were made upon the customer for margin, either by cash or collateral, it is plain that the account was never at any time adequately margined within the requirements of the broker. The learned trial judge found as a fact that the appellant\u2019s account was insufficiently margined and that the appellant knew that the respondents were not satisfied with its position. The respondents say that under these circumstances, for the protection of their customer as well as of themselves, they bought in Bidgood shares for the appellant\u2019s account as follows: on February 25th, 1936, 200 shares at 1.14 and 100 shares at $1.20; on April 18th and 20th, 2,000 shares in eight lots at prices ranging from 1.48 to 1.58; and on April 25th, 1,700 shares in fourteen small lots at prices ranging from 1.42 to 1.45. Confirmations of these purchases were sent to the appellant as the same were made. The appellant never at any time instructed the respondents to purchase shares of the stock to cover his short sale and endeavoured to repudiate the purchases, on the ground that he had neither instructed the purchases nor consented to them. The net loss in the appellant\u2019s account was $2,413.72. The appellant declined to pay this sum and this action followed.\nIn a short sale, brokers are entitled to do what is reasonable having regard to the interests of their customer as well as to their own interests and if a customer fails to comply with the reasonable requirements of his broker to protect his speculative margin account against an adverse balance, the broker is entitled from time to time to do what is reasonable under the existing circumstances to protect the account against loss, having regard to the prevailing prices of the stock. Samson v. Frazier[1], where a decision in the House of Lords in 1908, Morten v. Hilton[2], in a case involving a short sale of speculative securities, was relied upon and a report of the case appended as a foot-note. Lord Loreburn in the House of Lords in the Morten case2 said that he thought brokers, left without proper instructions, would be entitled to do what was reasonable in their own interests and those of their principal, which were largely identical, and that in a speculative account when their principal would not close the account, or give security, or even attempt to transfer the account to some other broker\u2019s care, their action ought not, if in good faith, to be lightly condemned.\nBut what is said here, and with great force in the able argument of Mr. Singer on behalf of the appellant, is that the respondents on January 23rd, 1936, within a few days of the sale of the 4,000 shares, purchased the same number of shares for the appellant\u2019s account at a loss of only $440 and that the respondents\u2019 right of indemnity, if any, is fixed and limited by the purchase made that day. Moreover, the appellant charges that when he instructed the respondents to sell short 4,000 shares of the Bidgood stock, Charles A. Gentles, one of the respondents, and S.J. Zacks, the respondents\u2019 manager, attracted by what appeared to be an opportunity to make some profit themselves in the stock, sold short on the same day they sold for the appellant 500 and 2,000 shares for their own respective accounts, and that on January 23rd, 1936, when the respondents bought 6,500 shares of the stock they were in reality covering not only the appellant\u2019s but their own accounts. It was proved in evidence that the respondents did purchase 6,500 of Bidgood on January 23rd, 1936. If the purchase of 4,000 of those shares was actually made by the respondents for the appellant\u2019s account, the respondents were not justified at that time in buying back 4,000 shares to close the appellant\u2019s account, but in any case the loss to the appellant would only have been $440. Neither were the brokers entitled, as against the appellant, to go out into the market as purchasers for themselves of Bidgood shares, if such purchases had the effect of raising the price of the stock, adverse to the interest of their principal. But the respondents\u2019 evidence was directed to show that there were several customers other than the appellant, some of them individuals and some of them well-known stock exchange brokers in Toronto, who were dealing at the time in this unlisted mining stock through the respondents and that the purchases which were made on January 23rd, 1936, were made for some of these other customers who were in fact buying the stock for an expected upward rise. The whole evidence is rather loose and unsatisfactory but the learned and experienced Chief Justice who heard the case went into the matter with his usual care and I think the result of his judgment is that he treated these purchases on January 23rd, 1936, as having been made in the ordinary course of business by the respondents for other customers and that the subsequent purchases, charged up to the account of the appellant as above set forth, represented real purchases made and intended to be made to close the appellant\u2019s account. This is at least a reasonable implication from all the facts that were put in evidence. Unless that was in substance the finding of the learned trial judge, he could not, and of course would not, have given judgment in favour of the respondents for the balance of the account on the basis of the loss represented by the subsequent purchases charged to the appellant. The evidence is by no means as clear and convincing as it might well be in a case such as this, but the Court of Appeal reviewed the evidence and came to the same conclusion as the learned trial judge and unanimously dismissed the appeal. We have not the advantage of any written reasons. In my opinion, we would not be justified in taking a different view of the case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Louis M. Singer.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Smith, Rae, Greer & Cartwright.\n[1] [1937] 2 K.B. 170.\n[2] [1937] 2 K.B., foot-note at 176, 177, 178.\n"}

(Suppliant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1938: March 2, 3; 1938: June 23.\nPresent: Duff C.J. and Cannon, Davis, Kerwin and Hudson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nContract\u2014Crown\u2014Petition of right to recover from the Crown sum paid in settlement of prior action by the Crown on claim for revenue taxes\u2014Suppliant claiming refund under alleged oral condition of settlement\u2014Evidence\u2014Letter from Minister of the Crown subsequent to settlement, not enforceable as an agreement binding the Crown.\nAppellant company sought to recover from the Crown, in right of the Dominion, a sum paid in settlement of a prior action brought by the Crown to recover revenue taxes alleged to have been due and payable by appellant. In the present suit, appellant claimed that said settlement had been subject to the (oral) condition that a refund would be made to appellant if it were later established that it was not liable for the taxes. At the time of the settlement there was pending a similar action by \u2022 the Crown against another company, which action was ultimately decided largely against the Crown; and appellant contended that on the application of the law therein determined to the facts in appellant\u2019s case, it would not be liable for the taxes claimed against it in the action in which the settlement had been made, and that under the alleged condition to the settlement it was now entitled to a refund. Subsequent to the said settlement, in reply to a letter from the member of Parliament for the district in which appellant carried on business, the Minister of National Revenue wrote to said member that \u201cwe do not desire to collect any taxes not properly due the Crown, and if it can be shown that any overpayment has been made * * * or if it is established that they [appellant] were not liable for any tax that they may have paid, you can assure them that refund will be made.\u201d There was no reference in said correspondence to any alleged condition of the settlement (and appellant did not base a claim upon the Minister\u2019s said assurance as an independent agreement).\nHeld: On the evidence, appellant had failed to establish that the settlement was subject to the alleged condition.\nHeld also: The minister\u2019s said letter could not be a basis for claim by appellant. The moneys paid by appellant became part of the consolidated revenue fund of Canada and it would require a statute, or something of like force, to clothe the minister of a department with authority to agree to repay to a subject moneys voluntarily paid by the subject in settlement of an action brought by the Crown for payment of taxes alleged to have become due and payable. The Minister\u2019s assurance in said letter, once it was determined that it was not confirmation of a condition to the original settlement, could not be sued upon as an independent agreement, because it was not competent for the Minister to fetter the future executive action of the Government. Judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, [1937] Ex. C.R. 99, dismissing appellant\u2019s petition of right, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the suppliant company from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing its action. The action was brought by way of petition of right to recover from the Crown moneys paid by the suppliant to the Crown under a settlement made in a prior action taken by the Crown against the present suppliant to recover payment of certain sales taxes and excise taxes under the Special War Revenue Act, 1915, as amended, alleged to be due and payable in respect of beer manufactured and sold, and for interest and penalties in respect thereof. In the present action the suppliant alleged (and the Crown denied) that the said settlement in the prior action had been subject to the condition that a refund would be made to the suppliant if it were later established that the suppliant was not liable for the taxes. The suppliant claimed exemption from the taxes under provisions in the said Act. At the time of the said settlement there was pending a similar action by the Crown against another company in which questions were involved which were ultimately decided against the Crown[2]. In the present action the suppliant contended that on the application of the law determined in the said action by the Crown against the other company to the facts of the present suppliant\u2019s own case (which facts, it was contended by the suppliant, but disputed by the Crown, were similar in effect to those in the said action against the other company), the suppliant would not be liable for the taxes which the Crown had claimed against it in the action in which said settlement had been made; and that under the alleged condition to the settlement, the suppliant was now entitled to a refund.\nBy the judgment now reported, the appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs (on the ground that said alleged condition to the settlement was not established).\nS. L. Springsteen K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C., A. C. Hill K.C., and C. F. H. Carson K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nDavis J.\u2014The appellant in this action by way of Petition of Right seeks to recover from the Crown, in right of the Dominion, the sum of $268,338.32 paid by it to the Crown in settlement of a prior action brought by the Crown against the appellant in respect of non-payment of certain revenue taxes alleged to have been due and payable by the appellant to the Crown. The prior action was commenced in October, 1927, and the period covered was from January 1st, 1925, to May 1st, 1927. The settlement of that action in June, 1928, at $260,000 included the Crown\u2019s further claims in respect of the period from May 1st, 1927, to March 31st, 1928. The amount of the settlement, though large, was considerably less than the total claim for taxes, interest and penalties in respect of the period covered by the settlement. The balance of the sum sought to be recovered in this action, $8,338.32, is the amount subsequently agreed upon and paid for the month of April, 1928. There was considerable discussion between the parties, after the settlement, as to the claim for April, 1928, to which we shall refer later.\nThe appellant was a brewery company incorporated under the laws of the province of Ontario and carried on business at the town of Walkerville near the international boundary between Canada and the United States across the river from the large city of Detroit, Michigan. This action is founded upon the allegation that the settlement of the prior action was subject to the condition that, broadly speaking, the appellant was to be entitled to the return of the moneys paid under the settlement in the event that a similar action which was then pending against the Carling company should be finally determined in favour of the contention of both companies that the taxes sought by the Crown were not in law recoverable because the beer in question had been manufactured and sold for export. The Carling company subsequently carried its litigation through to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and successfully resisted the claim against it for payment of the taxes. Carling Brewing and Malting Company Ltd. v. The King[3]. There was no formal agreement of settlement of the first action. On June 7th, 1928, the appellant sent the Minister of National Revenue its cheque for $200,000 with the following letter:\nWalkerville Brewery Limited\nWalkerville, Ontario\nJune 7, 1928.\nThe Minister of National Revenue,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir,\u2014\nConfirming the verbal arrangement arrived at between your Department and our Mr. Thistle, we herewith enclose you our cheque for $200,000. The understanding is that we are to send you a further cheque for $60,000 within sixty days. The last mentioned cheque, together with the cheque enclosed is in full settlement of the claim contained in the Information dated 27th of October, 1927, and also all other sales and gallons tax, interest and penalties up to the 30th day of April, 1928, and it is understood that the action commenced by the Crown is to be discontinued without costs and that upon payment of the full amount of settlement of $260,000, your Department is to give us a full release of all claims up to the 30th day of April, 1928.\nYours truly,\nWalkerville Brewery Limited.\n(Sgd.) H. Radner.\nThe Commissioner of Excise in acknowledging the letter and cheque pointed out that the settlement did not go beyond the end of March, 1928, in that the records for April had not been completed and consequently no assessment for April had been made at the time.\nMr. Thistle mentioned in the letter was an officer of the appellant company but he died before the trial of this action, which did not commence until April 20th, 1936. There is nothing in the letter itself to indicate that the settlement was in any way subject to the condition which is now alleged.\nThe further payment of $60,000 that was to have been made within sixty days was not in fact made until October 13th, 1928. On August 20th, 1928, the appellant telegraphed the Minister of National Revenue:\nWould appreciate extension of sixty days on balance owing on sales and manufacturers taxes wire reply collect.\nThe Commissioner of Excise replied the same day as follows:\nDepartment regards terms of settlement reached with your company as being exceedingly liberal and is not prepared to grant any extension of time whatever for payment of sixty thousand dollars due ninth instant. Subsequently the Commissioner telegraphed the appellant on September 4th as follows:\nReference my wire twentieth ultimo regarding payment sixty thousand dollars stop unless Department hears from you relative to settlement by eighth instant legal proceedings for recovery of balance due will be proceeded with immediately thereafter.\nAnd again on September 14th the Commissioner telegraphed the appellant:\nAs previously stated Department not prepared to grant delay of sixty days for payment of sixty thousand dollars balance sales tax stop Necessary legal action being proceeded with at once to collect this amount.\nThe $60,000 payment was finally made on October 13th, 1928, with the following letter from the appellant:\nOct. 13, 1928.\nMinister of National Revenue,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir,\u2014\nWe are enclosing herewith our cheque in the amount of $60,000 in full payment of all claims of your Department against this company in respect to sales and gallonage taxes, this payment being the balance of the $260,000 amount agreed to during the early part of the year.\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this settlement and oblige,\nYours very truly,\nThe Walkerville Brewery Limited.\n(Sgd.) E. Thistle.\nIt is to be observed that this letter was signed by Mr. Thistle, with whom it is now alleged an arrangement for the conditional payment had been made. Here again there is nothing in the letter to indicate that the settlement had been made upon the condition now alleged by the appellant. The Hon. N. W. Rowell was counsel for the Government in the first action and in his evidence at the trial of this action he said that the Minister, shortly after the case had been fixed for trial, had informed him that certain proposals for settlement had been submitted and had asked him to look into and report upon certain matters in connection with the proposed settlement. Mr. Rowell said he went into the matter and approved and recommended a settlement for the lump sum of $260,000 for the period up to March 31st, 1928; that he never heard of any condition to the settlement and if there was any condition it was not submitted to him when he was asked to recommend a settlement.\nThe position taken by the appellant in this action was stated very plainly in the Information and in the appellant\u2019s factum and was not departed from by the learned counsel for the appellant before us, that the alleged condition was made with the Minister prior to the settlement and, of course, prior to the payment of $200,000 under the settlement on June 7th, 1928. The letters to which we shall shortly refer between the Minister and Mr. Odette in August, 1928, are not relied upon as evidence of any agreement made at that time but as confirmation of the oral agreement alleged to have been made prior to June 7th, 1928, as a condition of the settlement. The appellant does not seek to obtain the repayment of the moneys upon any assurance or promise of the Minister subsequent to the settlement, but upon a promise which, it is said, formed a term or condition of the settlement of the first action at $260,000. It is not unnatural that there is always some suspicion attached to a claim based upon an alleged oral agreement set up as a term or condition of an agreement that had been put in writing, but evidence directed to prove such an oral agreement is, of course, admissible. We should not find it difficult as a matter of law to enforce against the Crown on a Petition of Right an oral condition to a settlement if it is firmly established in fact that the condition was made as part of the settlement and that the condition has been satisfied. Therefore we have carefully analyzed and examined the evidence tendered in proof of the alleged condition.\nMr. Odette, who gave evidence on behalf of the appellant, was at the time of the settlement the Member of the House of Commons for the district in which the appellant was carrying on its business. We quote from his evidence:\nMr. Thistle, of the Walkerville Brewery, telephoned me at my office in Ottawa, the Parliament Buildings, and asked me to arrange an appointment. At the request of Mr. Thistle I arranged an appointment with Mr. Euler, Minister of National Revenue, and, at Mr. Thistle\u2019s request, I accompanied him to Mr. Euler\u2019s office and Mr. Thistle requested Mr. Euler to withhold the present claim until a similar claim against Carling\u2019s Brewery was settled. It was then before the Court. Mr. Euler declined to do that, he declined to withhold action; he was pressing for payment of the claim. If my recollection serves me rightly, Mr. Euler told Mr. Thistle that if payment was made the Department would waive the interest and penalties. Mr. Thistle asked Mr. Euler what the position would be if the court determined these taxes were not payable. Mr. Euler said if the court determined that these taxes were not payable then the amount paid could be refunded as the Department did not wish to collect from any one taxes that were not just. Q. Do you recall the final amount that was agreed upon between the Minister and Mr. Thistle; were you present?\nA. I do not know about that.\nQ. Were you familiar with the fact as to whether all of the payment that was agreed upon was made in one sum or otherwise?\nA. I know it was not, because later on, after Parliament had adjourned, either Mr. Radner or Mr. Thistle telephoned me at Tilbury that the final payment on this claim was due and asked me if I would be good enough to write Mr. Euler and ask him to write me and confirm the understanding reached between the representative of the brewery and Mr. Euler when I was present.\nWhile the exact date of the interview with the Minister is not given, it was admittedly earlier than June 7th, 1928, when the payment of $200,000 was made.\nMr. Odette was speaking at the trial in April, 1936, of an interview that had taken place eight years before. He was in no way personally concerned in the matter but was present, as he says, \u201cmore or less for the purpose of introducing the parties.\u201d In attempting to recall the details of the interview, he said very frankly, \u201cif my recollection serves me rightly.\u201d He admitted that he was speaking \u201clargely from the letters, as to the matter\u201d and would have to go back to the letters to refresh his memory. Before we look at the letters themselves, it is to be observed that Mr. Odette\u2019s recollection was that Mr. Thistle asked the Minister what the position \u201cwould be\u201d if the Court determined the taxes were not payable and that the Minister said that in that event the amount paid \u201ccould be refunded\u201d as the Department did not wish to collect from any one taxes that were not just.\nWe now turn to the letters. On August 3rd, 1928, Mr. Odette wrote a personal letter to the Minister which was as follows:\nTilbury, Ontario,\nAugust 3rd, 1928.\nPersonal.\nHonourable W. D. Euler,\nMinister of National Revenue,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Euler:\u2014\nConfirming my conversation with you yesterday regarding payment of arrears of sales and gallonage taxes by the Walkerville Brewery Company, Walkerville, on which a final payment of $60,000 is due from the above Company, I believe on the 8th of this month. The President of the Company is anxious to know what position the Company will be in, in the event of the courts deciding that sales and gallonage taxes are not payable on exported goods. I stated to him that your Department did not desire to collect taxes that were not justly due and that in the event of such an occurrence as above mentioned, or in the event of the Walkerville Brewery over-paying, that they would be in a position to file claim with your Department for refund.\nI understand that this is your attitude in the matter, and I would thank you to drop me a line confirming same, so that I can phone the Walkerville Brewery Company previous to the 8th instant, so that their check may go forward to you promptly.\nYour usual prompt attention will be appreciated. With kind regards, I am,\nYours very truly,\nAnd on August 14th, 1928, the Minister, in a personal letter to Mr. Odette, replied as follows:\nMinister of National Revenue\nCanada\nOttawa, August 14, 1928.\nPersonal.\nMr. E. G. Odette, M.P.,\nTilbury, Ont.\nDear Mr. Odette,\nAbsence from Ottawa has prevented my replying earlier to your letter of the 3rd inst. with reference to arrears of Sales and Gallonage Taxes due by the Walkerville Brewery Company, Walkerville.\nYou are right in your understanding as to my attitude. We do not desire to collect any taxes not properly due the Crown, and if it can be shown that any overpayment has been made by the company in question, or if it is established that they were not liable for any tax that they may have paid, you can assure them that refund will be made.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) W. D. Euler.\nMr. Odette did not ask the Minister to confirm in writing some oral understanding or agreement that had been made prior to or at the time of the settlement. He wrote that the president of the appellant company \u201cis anxious to know what position the company will be in\u201d in the event of the courts deciding that the taxes were not payable. He states what he understands the Minister\u2019s \u201cattitude\u201d in the matter to be and, while he asks the Minister to confirm that understanding \u201cso that\u201d the appellant\u2019s \u201ccheck may go forward to you promptly,\u201d the letter does not even suggest the then existence of an oral agreement by way of a condition to the settlement that had been made in June and under which $200,000 had already been paid. Nor does the Minister\u2019s reply even suggest that there had been, up to that time, any promise or assurance that in certain events the moneys would be refunded. Mr. Euler, who was the Minister at the time of the settlement in 1928 and was again a Minister of the Crown at the time of the trial of this action in 1936, was not called at the trial.\nIt is convenient at this point to refer to the letter that Mr. Thistle wrote on behalf of the appellant on January 9th, 1930, to the Department of National Revenue when there was a dispute as to the taxes for the month of April, 1928. In that letter Mr. Thistle advised the Department that the matter had been referred to the company\u2019s solicitor, Mr. Barnes of Windsor, and that the Department would hear from him. In a letter of Mr. Barnes to the Commissioner of Excise on January 6th, 1930, he said in part:\nIt is our contention that the Department, having accepted the cheque so enclosed with the letter of June 7th, 1928, above mentioned and the further cheque of $60,000, which was sent on October 13th, 1928, cannot now take the position that the terms of settlement were not as set out in our client\u2019s letter of June 7th, 1928.\nThe appellant was at that time insisting that its letter of June 7th, 1928, be treated as setting out the terms of settlement. There was no suggestion that the settlement was subject to the condition now alleged.\nNotwithstanding the letter of the Minister to Mr. Odette of August 14th (a copy of which Mr. Odette sent the appellant by letter dated August 17th), there is not a word in the subsequent letter of the appellant of October 13th (above set out) to the Minister enclosing the final cheque of $60,000 to indicate that the settlement had been made on the condition that the payments would be refunded if it were later established that the appellant had not been liable for the taxes claimed in the action.\nThe appellant has failed to establish its claim that the settlement at $260,000 was subject to the condition which it now alleges. The entire basis of this action is the existence of an arrangement or understanding made prior to or contemporaneous with the settlement as a condition for the repayment of the moneys. It was not contended that the $60,000 payment could be recovered on any other basis; that is, that it could be treated separately and recovered upon the letter of the Minister of August 14th. The settlement, of course, had been made in June and $200,000 on account had been paid at that time. Payment of the balance of $60,000, had it been withheld, could have been enforced under the settlement. We do not overlook the fact that the Minister in his personal letter to Mr. Odette of August 14th, 1928, said that\nif it can be shown that any overpayment has been made by the company in question, or if it is established that they were not liable for any tax that they may have paid, you can assure them that refund will be made.\nBut the appellant does not seek to recover the moneys upon the basis of that assurance as an independent agreement. The learned counsel for the appellant no doubt fully recognized the difficulty there would have been in any such claim, in that the Minister had not authority to make any such agreement independent of the settlement, binding upon the Crown. The moneys paid became part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada and it would require a statute, or something of like force, to clothe the Minister of a Department with authority to agree to repay to a subject moneys voluntarily paid by the subject in settlement of an action brought by the Crown for payment of taxes alleged to have become due and payable. It may be useful to mention some of the authorities which we have considered: Commercial Cable Co. v. Government of Newfoundland[4]; Mackay v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[5]; Auckland Harbour Board v. The King[6]; Attorney-General v. Great Southern and Western Ry. Co. of Ireland[7].\nIt is not for us to consider whether the appellant company has just cause for complaint against the Government outside a court of law\u2014that is to say, assuming the facts to be the same as those in the Carting case[8] whether the Government is acting arbitrarily and is morally in the wrong in declining to implement the assurance of the Minister. That would be something altogether outside our province. All we have to determine as a court of law is whether there was an enforceable agreement made by the Minister binding upon the Crown to refund the moneys in question. The assurance given by the Minister in his letter to Mr. Odette, once it is determined that it was not confirmation of a condition to the original settlement, cannot be sued upon in a court of law as an independent agreement, for the reason that it was not competent for the Minister to fetter the future executive action of the Government.\nThe appellant further contended in the action that in any event the payments had not been made voluntarily but by force of threats by the Minister and officers of the Department that unless payment were made the appellant\u2019s licence to carry on the trade or business of a brewer would be revoked and would not be renewed and the appellant would thereby be forced to discontinue its business as a brewer. It may well be that the appellant had some fear that if it did not settle the Government\u2019s action against it, the Government might not renew its licence, and there is evidence that the renewal of the licence in 1928 was held up for some little time. But the evidence does not establish any threats against the appellant or that there was any involuntary action on its part in entering into the settlement or in making the payments sought to be recovered.\nIn view of our conclusions, it is unnecessary for us to consider the question of fact whether the goods in this case were manufactured and sold for export as was proved in the Carling case[9].\nThe learned trial judge concluded:\nIn the main I am satisfied that the goods in question were sold by the suppliant for export, that it saw the same were exported, and that in fact they were exported, within the meaning of the Carling case9 * * * If, therefore, I had to dispose of this case solely upon the question of fact as to whether the goods were manufactured and sold for export, and were in fact exported, I would feel obliged to sustain the contention of the suppliant. If the suppliant were here being sued for the taxes in question, as in the Carling case9, I would feel obliged to hold that the Crown must fail in its action.\nMr. Tilley made a powerful attack upon this finding of fact of the learned trial judge, but we do not find it necessary to examine all the evidence to ascertain whether we should come to the same conclusion. We have assumed, for the purpose of determining the legal question involved in the appeal, that the facts were favourable to the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McTague, Springsteen & McKeon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

Its deliveries up to 4 o\u2019clock p.m. were made by a certain delivery service. In the evening one S. would telephone inquiring if there were parcels to deliver, and if so would call for them and make delivery (within the time prescribed by regulations under the Liquor Control Act), collecting payment and securing signatures to orders and receipts. He was paid a stipulated sum per parcel, payment being made weekly. While delivering parcels as aforesaid, the motorcycle which he was driving struck K. who died as the result. The question on this appeal was appellant\u2019s liability for damages by reason of the accident (in an action brought under the Ontario Fatal Accidents Act). At the trial, which was had with a jury, the trial judge, on motion at close of plaintiff\u2019s case, dismissed the action as against appellant. The Court of Appeal for Ontario (Middleton J.A. dissenting) ([1937] O.R. 205) set aside said dismissal and ordered a new trial between plaintiff and appellant, confined to the question of liability of appellant and assessment of damages. Appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: Appeal allowed and judgment at trial restored. (Duff C.J. and Davis J. dissenting).\nPer Crocket J.: This was a clear case of casual or collateral negligence on the part of a private carrier for hire. In the operation of the motorcycle, S. was not appellant\u2019s servant within the meaning of the rule which makes a master liable for the acts of a servant in the performance of his duty as such\u2014he was not subject to appellant\u2019s control or direction, he was entirely his own master; his negligence, therefore, cannot properly be attributed to appellant. Also, neither the agreement under which S. was entrusted with the custody of the wine for delivery, nor any of the regulations made under the Liquor Control Act imposed any responsibility upon appellant for the injury of third persons by the negligent operation of the motorcycle. It is only upon the basis of appellant\u2019s employment of S. to make this particular delivery by means of a motorcycle in itself involving such danger to third persons that the accident might reasonably have been foreseen that appellant could properly be fixed with responsibility for K.\u2019s death. In that case appellant\u2019s responsibility would really rest upon its own direct negligence in employing S. to make the delivery by that means rather than upon the so-called doctrine of vicarious responsibility (City of Saint John v. Donald, [1926] S.C.R. 371, at 383-4); it cannot be said that the delivery of parcels on occasion by means of a hired motorcycle is inherently dangerous.\nPer Kerwin J.: A person employing another is not liable for the latter\u2019s collateral negligence unless the relation of master and servant exists between them. It may be assumed that appellant knew that the delivery would be made by motorcycle, and that it therefore authorized delivery by that means. But, while appellant had the right to take the work out of S.\u2019s hands, it had not the right to say that he was to continue the work and direct him during the continuance of it. S. was the agent of appellant so as to make appellant liable for anything done by S. with its authority; but appellant was not liable for S.\u2019s negligence in driving the motorcycle, as that was a casual or collateral matter which appellant did not authorize expressly or by implication. Not being subject to appellant\u2019s control as to the manner of driving, S. was not its servant. There was no evidence of any authority in S. to drive negligently and there was, therefore, nothing to leave to the jury.\nHudson J. adopted the reasons of Middleton J.A. (dissenting) in the Court of Appeal ([1937] O.R. at 228-232).\nPer Duff C J. and Davis J. (dissenting): There was evidence on which a jury might reasonably find that, in the management of his motorcycle while driving it at the place and time in question, S. was acting in appellant\u2019s business in execution of his duty as its agent; that being so, plaintiff\u2019s case should have been submitted to the jury. The jury might not unreasonably find that in the circumstances in which the wine was placed in S.\u2019s custody for delivery, the only practicable means of carriage was by some kind of motor vehicle; and, having regard to the practice, that on the occasion in question the goods were entrusted to and received by him on the tacit understanding that carriage would be effected by motorcycle; and that it was well understood that he must drive through the public streets. By force of the regulations made under the Liquor Control Act, S., who was not a common carrier within their meaning, could only lawfully be in possession of the parcels as appellant\u2019s agent; and a jury would be entitled to find as a fact that appellant\u2019s store manager was familiar with the purport of the regulations governing the sale of wine at the store, and, moreover, as a consequence, that S. was entrusted with the wine in the only capacity in which (not being a purchaser or approved carrier) he could lawfully be entrusted with it, namely, as appellant\u2019s agent. (Inclination expressed to the opinion that, under the principle stated in In re Hallett\u2019s Estate, 13 Ch. D. 696, at 727, it was not competent either to appellant or S. in an action of this character to deny that the wine was in fact entrusted to S. for carriage and delivery as appellant\u2019s agent). The parcels having been placed in S.\u2019s custody as agent, obviously it was his duty as agent to take reasonable care for the safe carriage and delivery, and it would be clearly open to the jury to find that, as incidental to that duty, he was under an obligation to his principal in respect of the management of the motorcycle; and it would be incumbent upon the trial judge to instruct them that if they thought S.\u2019s duty as agent embraced the duty to manage his motorcycle in such a manner as not to risk the loss of the wine or any part of it, it was for them to say whether the management of the motorcycle generally was a matter incidental to the functions expressly entrusted to him.\nThe rule respondeat superior, and its ground, discussed, and authorities referred to. The rule does not rest upon any notion of imputed guilt or fault. The principal having the power of choice has selected the agent to perform in his place a class or classes of acts, and it is not unjust that he who has selected him and will have the benefit of his services if efficiently performed should bear the risk of his negligence in matters incidental to the doing of the acts.\nThe fact that the damages were assessed against S. (who did not appear and was not represented at the trial) and judgment taken against him did not preclude the plaintiff, in the special circumstances of this case [discussed by Rowell, C.J.O. below in [1937] O.R. at 223, 224], from proceeding further against appellant.\nAPPEAL by the defendant company from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Honeywell Co. C.J. dismissing the action as against the defendant company.\nThe plaintiff was the widow of, and the administratrix of the estate of, John Todd Kerr, deceased, who died as the result of being struck, on March 20, 1936, on Avenue Road, Toronto, Ont., by a motorcycle owned by the defendant Leslie Sinclair and driven by the defendant Wilbert Sinclair, who at the time of the accident was delivering parcels of wine to customers of the defendant company, which was a duly incorporated company, licensed to manufacture and sell native wine throughout the province of Ontario and had a retail store on Yonge street, Toronto.\nThe action was brought under the Fatal Accidents Act (Ont.) on behalf of the plaintiff and her infant children to recover damages by reason of the death of the said deceased. The defendants Sinclair did not appear at the trial nor were they represented by counsel. At the trial, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, on motion by counsel for the defendant company, the trial judge dismissed the action as against it. It was then agreed between counsel that the trial judge should dispose of the action as against the other defendants without reference to the jury. He fixed the damages at $12,000, and gave judgment against the defendants Sinclair for that sum. Upon appeal by the plaintiff to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the dismissal of the action against the defendant company, the Court of Appeal (Middleton J.A. dissenting) allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment below, and ordered that a new trial be had between the plaintiff and the defendant company, at which trial the issues should be confined to the question of the liability of the defendant company for the negligence of the defendant Wilbert Sinclair and to the assessment of damages as against the defendants[2]. Middleton J.A., dissenting, would dismiss the appeal. The defendant company appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe defendant Wilbert Sinclair was not a common carrier within the meaning of the regulations made under the Ontario Liquor Control Act.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment the trial judge stated as follows with regard to the facts:\nThis company [defendant company] had its regular delivery service during the day time, and after hours had its parcels delivered by various carriers. It was shown that the defendant Wilbert Sinclair had applied to the [defendant company] for the privilege of delivering parcels, and stated that he could deliver by motorcycle or by car. It was not shown that the [defendant company] made any stipulation as to how he was to deliver. Sinclair was not under any obligation to deliver. He would call up in the evening by telephone and ask if they had any parcels to deliver. If they had, he would come to their store, 223\u00bd Yonge street, receive the parcels, and proceed to deliver them. With the parcels there went a bill on a form provided by the Liquor Control Board, which, among other things, required on delivery of the parcel the signature of the purchaser, the address, the driver\u2019s signature, and a line for entry of the method of delivery. On none of the forms was the method of delivery specified. There was no written agreement between the [defendant company] and the defendant Sinclair. The instructions, according to the evidence of the manager, were to take a parcel to the address, take the form or bill, and have it signed by the person getting it. On C.O.D. orders cash was to be received before turning over the parcel. The manager did not know that Sinclair did not have a licence. He was paid every Saturday 25 cents for delivering each parcel within Toronto, and 35 cents outside of Toronto. When he met with difficulty he would phone in for instructions. Sometimes the defendant Sinclair did not phone up, or did not come for parcels, and the [defendant company] had to obtain someone else to make the delivery. There was no control over Sinclair as to route or time. There was no specification as to how he was to deliver, whether by motorcycle, car or street car. In the course of his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, Rowell, C.J.O., stated as follows with regard to the facts:\nAccording to the evidence, the procedure adopted by the defendant company was as follows: an order was received by telephone and the name of the purchaser, his address and the quantity of wine required was entered upon the order form by Johnston or the clerk in the office who received the order. The order was then filled and ready for delivery. All deliveries up to four o\u2019clock in the afternoon were made by Eddy\u2019s Delivery Service, but they made their last call at four o\u2019clock, and orders received after that hour were delivered by the defendant Wilbert Sinclair, who called for the parcels or cartons at six or half past six o\u2019clock in the evening. It was his duty, before delivering the wine to the purchaser, to secure the purchaser\u2019s signature to the original order, which must be forwarded by the company to the Liquor Control Board. He must also secure payment of the purchase price and a receipt for the wine on delivery. He could not deliver the wine without securing the signature to the original order, or without payment of the purchase price, and delivery had to be made within the time prescribed by the Regulations. If the residence of the purchaser was an apartment house, boarding house or rooming house or hotel, he must hunt out the purchaser and make delivery directly to him. If any difficulty arose in making delivery in accordance with his instructions, it was his duty to telephone to Mr. Johnston and receive special instructions and to act on those instructions. He was required to return to the company the following day the original order for purchase duly signed and the purchase price. Having regard to the time within which delivery must be made to comply with the regulations, it could only be made by motor-cycle or motor car, and it appears quite clear from the evidence that Johnston knew and approved of the use of the motor-cycle for delivery of the wine. Sinclair was paid twenty-five cents a carton for deliveries within the city limits and thirty-five cents outside the city, the payments being made weekly.\nBy the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was allowed (with costs of both appeals) and the judgment of the trial judge restored. The Chief Justice and Davis J. dissented.\nT.J. Agar K.C. for the appellant.\nE.L. Haines for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J. (dissenting) was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal and in substance with the reasoning of the Chief Justice of Ontario. The new trial ordered by the judgment of the Court of Appeal is limited to the issue of the responsibility of the appellants for the negligence of Wilbert Sinclair and the damages. The question now to be decided is whether there was evidence upon which a jury might reasonably find that, in the management of his motorcycle while driving it through the public streets on the evening in question on his way to make delivery of the parcels entrusted to him, Sinclair was acting in the business of the appellants in execution of his duty as their agent. If there was such evidence, the plaintiff\u2019s case ought to have been submitted to the jury.\nThe jury might not unreasonably find that in the circumstances in which the wine was placed in Sinclair\u2019s custody for delivery, the only practicable means of carriage was by some kind of motor vehicle; and, having regard to the practice, that on the particular occasion with which we are concerned, the goods were entrusted to Sinclair and received by him on the tacit understanding that carriage would be effected by motorcycle; and, moreover, that it was well understood he must drive through the public streets.\nWhen Regulations numbered 57 to 62 are read with those numbered 113, 119 and 120, it appears that carriage of beer from a brewery or warehouse to the residence of a purchaser (except by a purchaser) is regulated in this sense, that the liquor must be carried by the brewer, by his agent or by a common carrier sanctioned by the Board, unless authority to make such carriage otherwise is given by the Board. These provisions with regard to the carriage of beer are, by force of s. 103, applicable to native wines.\nBy force of these regulations, Sinclair, who, admittedly, was not a common carrier within the meaning of the Regulations, could only lawfully be in possession of the parcels of wine he was carrying as agent of the appellants. I am inclined to think that, under the principle stated by Sir George Jessel in Re Hallett[3], it is not competent either to the appellants or to Sinclair in an action of this character to deny that the wine was in fact entrusted to Sinclair for carriage and delivery as the agent of the appellants:\nNow, first upon principle, nothing can be better settled, either in our own law, or, I suppose, the law of all civilized countries, than this, that where a man does an act which may be rightfully performed, he cannot say that that act was intentionally and in fact done wrongly. A man who has a right of entry cannot say he committed a trespass in entering. A man who sells the goods of another as agent for the owner cannot prevent the owner adopting the sale, and deny that he acted as agent for the owner. It runs throughout our law, and we are familiar with numerous instances in the law of real property. A man who grants a lease believing he has sufficient estate to grant it, although it turns out that he has not, but has a power which enables him to grant it, is not allowed to say he did not grant it under the power. Wherever it can be done rightfully, he is not allowed to say, against the person entitled to the property or the right, that he has done it wrongfully. That is the universal law.\nIn any case, a jury would be entitled to find as a fact that the manager of the appellants\u2019 store was familiar with the purport of the Regulations governing the sale of the wine at the store and, moreover, as a consequence, that Sinclair was entrusted with the wine in the only capacity in which (not being a purchaser or approved carrier) he could lawfully be entrusted with it, namely, as the agent of the appellants.\nThe parcels having been placed in Sinclair\u2019s custody as agent, obviously it was his duty as agent to take reasonable care for the safe carriage and delivery of the wine and it would be clearly open to the jury to find that, as incidental to that duty, he was under an obligation to his principal in respect of the management of the motorcycle; and it would be incumbent upon the trial judge to instruct them that if they thought Sinclair\u2019s duty as agent embraced the duty to manage his motorcycle in such a manner as not to risk the loss of the wine or any part of it, it was for them to say whether the management of the motorcycle generally was a matter incidental to the functions expressly entrusted to him.\nIt would appear to be necessary to make some reference to the ground upon which the responsibility of a principal for the acts of his agent rests.\nRespondeat superior is a rule which does not rest upon any notion of imputed guilt or fault. The fallacy that it does was responsible for the difficulty that great lawyers of the last century felt (Bramwell B., for example) in admitting the liability of a corporation for the fraud of its agents. In Hern v. Nichols[4] the point in issue was the responsibility of a merchant for the deceit of his factor beyond the sea. Holt C.J. states the broad ground of responsibility thus:\n* * * for seeing somebody must be a loser by this deceit, it is more reason that he that employs and puts a trust and confidence in the deceiver should be a loser, than a stranger.\nIn Hall v. Smith[5], Best C.J. says:\nThe maxim of respondeat superior is bottomed on this principle, that he who expects to derive advantage from an act which is done by another for him, must answer for any injury which a third person may sustain from it.\nThe principal having the power of choice has selected the agent to perform in his place a class or classes of acts, and, to adapt the language of Henn Collins M.R. in Hamlyn v. Houston[6], it is not unjust that he who has selected him and will have the benefit of his services if efficiently performed should bear the risk of his negligence in \u201cmatters incidental to the doing of the acts, the performance of which has been entrusted to him.\u201d\nThe rule has been precisely explained in the House of Lords in two modern cases in which Story\u2019s statement of it has been adopted. In Percy v. Corporation of the City of Glasgow[7], Lord Haldane said:\nAs was laid down by Story in a passage adopted in an earlier case by Blackburn J. and approved in this House in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[8], \u201cthe principal is liable to third persons in a civil suit for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences, and other malfeasances or misfeasances, and omissions of duty of his agent in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or participate in, or indeed know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts, or disapproved of them.\u201d The limitation is that \u201cthe tort or negligence occurs in the course of the agency. For the principal is not liable for the torts or negligences of his agent in any other matters beyond the scope of the agency, unless he has expressly authorized them to be done, or he has subsequently adopted them for his own use and benefit.\u201d\nIn Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Co.[9] mentioned by Lord Haldane, these passages from Story were made part of the reasoning of Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment in which Lord Loreburn, Lord Atkinson and Lord Shaw concurred. They had previously been quoted by Lord Blackburn (Blackburn J. as he then was) with apparent approval in delivering the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench (Cock- burn, C.J., Blackburn, Mellor and Lush JJ.)[10]. Story\u2019s statement of the law having been thus adopted and acted upon by the House of Lords, it is, I think, binding upon this Court (Robins v. National Trust Co.)[11]\nAn argument was addressed to us by the appellants based upon the allegation that Sinclair and the appellants being joint tortfeasors and the respondent, in default of appearance by Sinclair, having had the damage assessed against Sinclair and taken judgment against him, is precluded from proceeding further against the appellants. I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that, in the special circumstances of this case, the appellants cannot succeed on this ground.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCROCKET J.\u2014I agree with Middleton J.A. and also with my brother Kerwin that this is a clear case of casual or collateral negligence on the part of a private carrier for hire in the operation of the motorcycle which he used for the purpose of making delivery of the package of wine to the purchaser\u2019s residence, and that the driver, not being subject to the control or direction of the appellant in the operation of the motorcycle, was not its servant within the meaning of the rule which makes a master liable for the acts of a servant in the performance of his duty as such. Sinclair, to my mind, was entirely his own master as regards the operation of the motorcycle and his negligence, therefore, cannot properly be attributed to the appellant.\nI am also of the opinion that neither the agreement, under which Sinclair was entrusted with the custody of the wine for delivery to the purchaser\u2019s residence, nor any of the regulations made under the provisions of the Liquor Control Act concerning the delivery of liquor or wine to private residences imposed any responsibility upon the appellant for the injury of third persons by the negligent operation of the motorcycle. It is only upon the basis of the appellant\u2019s employment of Sinclair to make this particular delivery by means of a motorcycle in itself involving such danger to third persons that the unfortunate accident might reasonably have been foreseen that the appellant could properly be fixed with responsibility for the death of the intestate. In that case the appellant\u2019s responsibility would really rest upon its own direct negligence in employing Sinclair to make the delivery by that means rather than upon the so-called doctrine of vicarious responsibility. See judgment of Anglin, C.J., in City of Saint John v. Donald[12], at bottom of p. 383 and top of p. 384. For my part, I am not prepared to hold that the delivery of parcels on occasion by means of a hired motorcycle is inherently dangerous\u2014any more so than their delivery by a hired motor car or motor truck. Accidents to strangers, of course, are always possible in the operation of either motor cars or motorcycles, and, indeed, in these days very probable if due care is not exercised by those in charge of them. I do not feel justified, however, in acceding to the suggestion that a merchant or any other person by the mere act of hiring a motor truck, motor car or motorcycle on occasion to make delivery of goods by such means assumes liability for any negligence of which the driver of the hired vehicle may be guilty.\nIn my opinion the learned County Court Judge (Honeywell) had no other recourse upon the undisputed facts than to dismiss, as he did, the action as against the appellant.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment with costs throughout.\nKERWIN J.\u2014The facts are set out in the reasons for judgment of the members of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[13] and need not be repeated. The only question in this appeal, to my mind, is whether the relationship of master and servant existed between the appellant and Wilbert Sinclair whereby the former would be rendered liable for the collateral negligence of the latter.\nLord Blackburn in Dation v. Angus[14] states:\nEver since Quarman v. Burnett[15] it has been considered settled law that one employing another is not liable for his collateral negligence unless the relation of master and servant existed between them.\nOmitting all reference to circumstances where the employer owes a duty which he cannot avoid by hiring another, I do not read any of the decisions that are binding on this Court and that are usually cited for the purpose, as altering the law as thus set forth and in effect Pollock and Salmond in their books on Torts treat this statement to be the result of the cases.\nIn the Thirteenth Edition of Pollock, at page 82, the author points out that the rule being that a master is liable for the acts, neglects and defaults of his servants in the course of the service, it is necessary to define \u201cservant,\u201d and states as to this point that \u201cit is quite possible to do work for a man in the popular sense, and even to be his agent for some purposes, without being his servant.\u201d That part of the text which follows, and which I transcribe, was approved by McCardie J. in Performing Rights Society v. Mitchell and Booker[16]:\nFor the acts or omissions of such a one about the performance of his undertaking his employer is not liable to strangers, no more than the buyer of goods is liable to a person who may be injured by the careless handling of them by the seller or his men in the course of delivery.\nTo the same effect is the Eighth Edition of Salmond which at pages 88 and 89 draws the distinction between the case of a principal who is liable only for those acts of his agent which he expressly or impliedly authorized but which rule is subject, so far as here applicable, to an exception which governs the particular form of agency which exists in the case of master and servant.\nIn the case at bar it may be assumed that the appellant knew that the delivery of wine would be made by motorcycle and that it, therefore, authorized the delivery by that means. But while the appellant had the right to take the work out of Sinclair\u2019s hands, it had not the right to say that he was to continue the work and direct him during the continuance of it. In thus paraphrasing another extract from the judgment in the Performing Rights case16, I have not overlooked the fact that McCardie J. was there considering the test to be applied in deciding whether a man is a servant or an independent contractor, but I think the test is also the proper one as to when a man is that particular class of agent defined as servant. Indeed it is but an elaboration of the definition given by Lord Justice Bramwell in Yewens v. Noakes[17], where he says, \u201ca servant is a person subject to the command of his master as to the manner in which he shall do his work.\u201d\nThe matter is discussed in the Fourth Edition of Bevan on Negligence, at page 713, where the author, after quoting this definition, also gives the evidence of Lord Justice Bramwell taken before the First Committee of the House of Commons on Employers\u2019 Liability, and then continues:\nOnce again, the distinction between a servant and an agent is the distinction between serving for and acting for. An agent as contrasted with a servant has a discretion as to the time and manner of performance, and sometimes as to acting or not acting.\nIn my judgment, Wilbert Sinclair was the agent of the appellant so as to make the latter liable for anything done by him with its authority. But the appellant is not liable for Sinclair\u2019s negligence in driving the motorcycle, as that was a casual or collateral matter which the appellant did not authorize expressly or by implication. Not being subject to the appellant\u2019s control as to the manner of driving, Sinclair was not its servant. There was no evidence of any authority in Sinclair to drive negligently and there was, therefore, nothing to leave to the jury.

A testator in his will, after certain specific gifts, directed that his trustee stand possessed of the residue of the estate upon trust for conversion and, after payment of debts, etc., to invest the residue and pay the income therefrom to the testator's wife during her life and upon her death (which occurred\u2014subsequently to the testator's death) to pay a certain share thereof to a son (which was done), and to invest one-half of the residue in trust to pay the income therefrom to another son during his life (with power to pay him a limited sum from the principal) and upon his death his share (or so much thereof not received by him) was to \"go and be disposed of as he may by deed or will appoint,\" with gift over in default of appointment. As to the remaining half of said residue the following provision (now in question) was made: to invest it in trust to pay the income therefrom to the testator's daughter during her lifetime \"and upon her death said share to go and be disposed of as she may by deed or will appoint,\" and in default of such appointment (or so far as it should not apply), if she should die leaving issue then living, the share to go to her child or children then living, equally, to be paid to each on attaining 21 years of age, income in meantime to be applied for support, etc., during respective minorities; if she should die without leaving issue then living and without having made any such appointment as aforesaid, the share to go to the testator's two sons equally or to the survivor of them. The daughter demanded payment of the share covered by this provision, and the question of her rights thereunder came before the court,\nHeld: The daughter could exercise her said power of appointment by deed in her own favour so as to vest in her immediately her share of the residue of the estate and so as to entitle her to have the same transferred to her immediately.\nAuthorities referred to and discussed.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Alberta, [1938] 2 W.W.R. 433, affirming judgment of Shepherd J., [1938] 2 W.W.R. 152, reversed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] affirming the judgment of Shepherd J.[2] answering in the negative a certain question submitted to the court on an application (upon originating notice of motion) by the executor of the will of Dr. F. H. Mewburn, late of Edmonton, Alberta, deceased, for an order determining the rights or interests of the present appellant, a beneficiary under the said will, and more particularly for an order determining the said question, which is hereinafter set out.\nThe said deceased died on January 29, 1929. By his will, made December 24, 1924, he appointed the present respondent executor and trustee thereof, and, after certain specific gifts, he directed that the trustee should stand possessed of all the residue of his property real and personal upon trust for conversion and, after payment of the testator's debts, etc., and certain payments by way of legacy, then upon trust for investment of the residue and to pay all the income therefrom to his wife during her life, and upon her death, (and after sale of residence, lots and furniture, in which his wife had been given only a life interest), from the proceeds of the investments (and of said sale)\nas to one-third thereof after deducting the sum of [$5,000] which I have already advanced to my son Frank Hastings Hamilton Mewburn to pay the remainder of said one-third to him if then living or as he may by deed or will appoint\nwith gift over in default of appointment. (The said son, after his mother's death, was paid his share). The will then provided:\nI further direct that as to the residue of my estate and investments my trustee shall invest * * * one-half thereof * * * in trust to pay the income therefrom * * * to my said son Arthur Fenwick Mewburn during his life with power * * * to pay and advance to him from time to time part of the principal but not more in all than [$10,000]. Upon the death of my said last mentioned son I direct that as to his share or so much thereof as he shall not have received the same shall go and be disposed of as he may by deed or will appoint\nwith gift over in default of appointment, alternatively according to whether said son died leaving a widow only, a widow and child or children, or a child or children only, living at the time of his death, or leaving no issue or widow then living. Then came the provision now in question, which read as follows:\nAs to the remaining half of said residue I authorize and direct my trustee to invest, reinvest and keep the same invested in such securities as aforesaid in trust to pay the income therefrom yearly or oftener if convenient to my said daughter Helen Chilton Mewburn during her lifetime and upon her death said share to go and be disposed of as she may by deed or will appoint and in default of such appointment or so far as such appointment shall not apply if she should die leaving issue then living I direct that her said share shall go to her child or children then living and if more than one then equally among them to be paid to each of said children on attaining the age of twenty-one years the income in the meantime to be paid and applied for the support, maintenance and education of such child or children during their respective minorities. If my said daughter should die without leaving issue then living and without having made any such appointment as aforesaid her said share shall be divided equally between and added to the shares hereby respectively given to my said two sons or to the survivor of them.\nThe testator's widow died on March 23, 1937. A division of the residuary estate as at that date was made with the approval of all interested parties. The share belonging to the son, Frank Hastings Hamilton Mewburn, was paid to him. Separate trusts were set up with respect to the shares of the estate belonging to Arthur Fenwick Mewburn and the present appellant, Helen Chilton Mewburn Robinson (described in the will as Helen Chilton Mewburn), the trusts being administered by the executor.\nOn October 12, 1937, the present appellant wrote the trustee as follows: \"I have decided to ask you to turn over to me all the stocks and bonds which have been allocated to me from the estate of my father, the late Dr. F. J. Mewburn.\"\nThe trustee thereupon applied to the court for advice and direction as aforesaid. (The other sons did not oppose the present appellant's claim. No question was raised in the appeal as to the formalities which are necessary to exercise the power of appointment or as to the sufficiency of the demand which the present appellant made on the trustee).\nThe question submitted was:\nCan Helen Chilton Mewburn Robinson exercise the power of appointment vested in her by the said will, by deed in her own favour so as to vest in her immediately her share of the residue of the said estate and so as to entitle her to have the same transferred to her immediately?\nShepherd J. answered the question in the negative[3], and this was affirmed by the Appellate Division (Ford J.A. dissenting)[4], and appeal was brought to this Court. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the appeal was allowed and the question answered in the affirmative.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nH. G. Nolan K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Rinfret, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014We are asked to determine the following question, which arises in the interpretation of the will of the late Doctor F. H. Mewburn and in the administration of his estate:\nCan Helen Chilton Mewburn Robinson exercise the power of appointment vested in her by the said will, by deed in her own favour so as to vest in her immediately her share of the residue of the said estate and so as to entitle her to have the same transferred to her immediately?\nBy his will, after several specific devises and bequests, the testator directs his trustees to stand possessed of the residue of his estate in trust to pay debts and funeral and testamentary expenses and certain other sums, and to pay the income to his wife during her life. Upon the latter's death (which has occurred) the trustees are to hand over one-third of the ultimate residue to a son, less the sum of five thousand dollars advanced by the testator to him. As to one-half of the ultimate residue, provision is made for another son, and then comes the part in question:\nAs to the remaining half of said residue I authorize and direct my trustee to invest, reinvest and keep the same invested in such securities as aforesaid in trust to pay the income therefrom yearly or oftener if convenient to my said daughter Helen Chilton Mewburn during her lifetime and upon her death said share to go and be disposed of as she may by deed or will appoint and in default of such appointment or so far as such appointment shall not apply if she should die leaving issue then living I direct that her said share shall go to her child or children then living and if more than one then equally among them to be paid to each of said children on attaining the age of twenty-one years the income in the meantime to be paid and applied for the support, maintenance and education of such child or children during their respective minorities. If my said daughter should die without leaving issue then living and without having made any such appointment as aforesaid her said share shall be divided equally between and added to the shares hereby respectively given to my said two sons or to the survivor of them.\nIt may be taken that the testator intended(1) that his daughter should enjoy the income for her life and(2) that she might direct where the corpus should go but that such direction should take effect only upon her death. However, it is argued that because of her general power to appoint by deed there is a rule of law whereby, notwithstanding this expressed intention, the daughter is entitled to appoint the share in question to herself by deed and to call upon the trustees to transfer the corpus to her. The provision made by the testator whereby his daughter would be assured of an income for her life would thus be set at naught and she would be able to use the fund as she thought fit.\nIn Barford v. Street[5], Sir William Grant had to consider a will by which the residue of the testator's personal estate and all his real estate were given and devised to a trustee to pay the rents, issues, interests, dividends, and produce, to Mary Barford during the term of her natural life, and from and immediately after her decease upon trust to convey, etc., the whole of the residue to and among such person or persons, and in such proportions, and at such time or times, and in such manner, as Mary Barford in her lifetime should from time to time by any deed or will appoint; and in default of such appointment to pay and divide the estate among the children of Richard Barford, her father. Mary Barford executed a deed poll directing the trustee to convey and assign all the estate to her. In giving judgment, the Master of the Rolls said:\nWhat do you contend to be the nature and extent of her interest? An estate for life with an unqualified power of appointing the inheritance comprehends everything. What induced me at first to doubt was the indication of an intention in the Codicil, that the estate should remain in the trustee for the life of the Plaintiff, with powers to her, inconsistent in a great degree with the supposition of her having, or being able to acquire, the absolute interest. But I do not think, I can by inference from thence control the clear and express words, by which the power is given to the devisee to dispose of this estate in her lifetime by any deed or deeds, writing or writings, or by her last Will and Testatment. How can the Court say, that it is only by Will that she can appoint? By her interest she can convey her life estate: By this unlimited power she can appoint the inheritance. The whole equitable fee is thus subject to her present disposition. The consequence is, that the trustee must convey the legal fee according to the prayer of the Bill.\nIn Irwin v. Farrer[6], there was a legacy in trust to be laid out in stock; the trustees were to pay the dividends as they came due to A. for life and after her decease they were to pay the principal according to her appointment by will or otherwise. A., conceiving herself, by the power so given, to be entitled to an absolute interest in the legacy, applied to the executors for payment, and, upon their declining, filed a bill. Upon the argument Barford v. Street[7] was cited and in a short judgment the Court of Exchequer declared that under the will the legatee had an absolute power of disposition over the whole fund; that the demand, by the bill, was a sufficient indication of her intention to take the whole for her own benefit; and the execution of a formal appointment in writing was not necessary.\nIn Reith v. Seymour[8], it was decided that, on the construction of the will in question, the widow took only an estate for life with a power of appointment, and that the sale by her of a sum of three per cent. stock, which constituted nearly the whole of the residue, and the investment of the proceeds in the purchase of long annuities in her own name, did not amount to an exercise of the power. The Master of the Rolls, Sir John Leach, distinguished the case of Irwin v. Farrer[9] but only on the ground that the sale and investment by the widow, in the case before him, was not equivalent to the demand by bill by the legatee in the earlier case.\nIn Hughes v. Wells[10], it was decided that a wife had no power to dispose of certain trust funds otherwise than by a perfect appointment. At page 767 the Vice-Chancellor, Sir George Turner, discussed the question as to whether the life estate, which he determined was the interest taken by the widow, coupled with such a power, was tantamount to absolute ownership, and determined that Barford v. Street7 did not warrant a conclusion in the affirmative because, as he pointed out, in the Barford case the power had been exercised. He also referred to Irwin v. Farrer(3) and Holloway v. Clark-son[11], mentioning that in those cases no formalities were required in the execution of the powers and, as was observed by Sir John Leach in Reith v. Seymour(2) with reference to Irwin v. Farrer(3), it was required in the last mentioned case that the power should be exercised. In London Chartered Bank of Australia v. Lempri\u00e8re[12], their Lordships of the Judicial Committee had to consider whether, under the circumstances, by a general engagement (a letter to the Bank) a married woman had bound her separate estate for the repayment of the obligation. They had also to determine how far this obligation affected the corpus of a certain fund established under a settlement in which she had a limited interest only, with a power of appointment. The gift was to her for her separate use for life without any restraint on anticipation, with remainder as she should, notwithstanding her coverture, by deed or will appoint, with remainder to her executors and administrators. No appointment was made by her except by a will subsequent to the general engagement. It was held that there was an absolute gift to the sole and separate use of the woman. However, it will be noticed that the remainder was to her executors and administrators and it would seem that that was the determining factor on that branch of the case.\nIn the case at bar, there is no such remainder and the Lempri\u00e8re case12, therefore, does not touch the precise point we have to determine. Nor does the decision in Meagher v. Meagher[13] bear upon the matter, as the only question argued and determined in this Court was as to whether an interest in certain real and personal estate was given to the daughters of a testator as trustees or as individuals. But the reasons for the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, delivered by Sir William Meredith[14], are of interest as indicating the view of the Chief Justice of Ontario that, notwithstanding the intention of the testator that beneficiaries should take a life 2state, that estate, when coupled with a general power of appointment (construed to include an appointment by deed), enabled the beneficiaries to exercise the power in their own favour and so become entitled to the whole property. The trial judge had decided that the following clause in the will in question gave the absolute interest to the beneficiaries:\u2014\nTo hold all my property in lots eight and nine in the third concession from the bay in the township of York, together with all stock, crops, furniture and other goods and chattels and personal property thereon for my said daughters Mary Ann Meagher and Margaret Ellen Meagher for themselves and to make such disposition thereof from time to time among my children or otherwise as my said daughters decide to make, they my said daughters in the meantime to have all the rents and profits therefrom.\nSir William Meredith disagreed with this view because of the words \"they my said daughters in the meantime to have all the rents and profits therefrom\" and held that the daughters took a life interest with a general power of appointment. He observed, however, that this would make no practical difference since the daughters might exercise the power in their own favour and so become entitled to the whole property. He referred to the following quotation from the Second Edition of Farwell on Powers, page 8 (continued in the Third Edition at page 9):\nThe donee of a general power may appoint to himself. (Irwin v. Farrer.(1)).\nWith reference to the case of Irwin v. Farrer[15], it is observed in Sugden on Powers, 8th edition, page 211:\nA power to appoint by will, or otherwise, of course authorizes an appointment by deed.\nAnd in the same text book, at page 104, Barford v. Street[16] is referred to for the following proposition:\nA devise to A. for life, expressly, with remainder to such persons as he shall by deed or will, or otherwise, appoint, will of course not give him the absolute interest, although he may acquire it by the exercise of his power.\nThis extract is referred to in Smith v. Smith[17], by the Master of the Rolls who, dealing with the will there in question, concludes at page 525:\nIt follows, therefore, that if John Graydon Smith had desired he might have acquired the absolute ownership in fee; but that, till he did so, he was merely tenant for life with power of appointment by will or deed.\nIn Templeton v. Royal Trust Company[18], the majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal determined, notwithstanding the clear intention of the testator that only on the death of the life tenant should the corpus be distributed as he might direct, that, as the power of appointment was exercisable by deed, the life tenant could exercise it in that manner in his own favour so as to entitle him to have the corpus transferred by the trustee of the testator's will to him immediately.\nBarford v. Street18 is not mentioned in Jarman on Wills but in the Seventh Edition, at page 1160, after a consideration of a number of authorities, the result is stated to be as follows:\n(1) A gift to A for life, with a power of appointment by deed or will, with a gift over away from A or his estate, or with no gift over, gives A entire dominion over the fund, and therefore if he applies to the Court for it the Court need not require a formal appointment of the fund, as his application to the Court is a sufficient intention to take the fund.\nAs authority for this proposition, the author cites Irwin v. Farrer[19].\nIn the present case, I conclude that the daughter's life interest, coupled with a power to appoint the corpus by deed, enables her so to appoint to anyone, including herself. The testator's manifest intention is contrary to the authority he conferred upon her. By g;iving his daughter a power to appoint by will only, he could have ensured that his wishes should be respected. If it be urged that in that event she would be unable to appoint by deed the corpus or part of it so as to assist a child, the same argument now advanced as to why she should not be authorized to deprive herself of the income, would apply. On principle as well as upon a consideration of the authorities referred to, she is able to exercise the power and disregard the testator's wishes.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the question answered in the affirmative. The costs of the appellant and the respondent Trust Company on the application to the judge of first instance were fixed by him and ordered to be paid out of the corpus, and this order as to costs should stand. The costs of all parties of the appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and of this appeal should be paid out of the same fund, those of the trustee as between solicitor and client.\nCANNON J.\u2014I would allow the appeal and answer the question in the affirmative. The order of the judge of first instance as to costs should stand and the costs of all parties of the appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and of this appeal should be paid out of the corpus, those of the trustee as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1] [1938] 2 W.W.R. 433; [1938] 3 D.L.R. 459.\n[2] [1938] 2 W.W.R. 152.\n[3] [1938] 2 W.W.R. 152.\n[4] [1938] 2 W.W.R. 433; [1938] 3 D.L.R. 459.\n[5] (1809) 16 Ves.

The purchaser was notified thereof. The assignment was not registered. Subsequently the bank made further loans to S. Certain next of kin of S's wife, deceased, had claimed that said land had been purchased with her moneys and that the land and proceeds of sale thereof were held by S. in trust for her estate, and they sued and obtained judgment against S. in favour of their claim. Respondent company was appointed administrator of her estate (in place and stead of S.) and title to said land was registered in its name. It notified the bank (which had received no prior actual notice) of its claim that the moneys due under said agreement for sale were the property of said estate; and its claim, and the opposing claim of the bank under said assignment, came (by action and special case) before the court. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia (52 B.C.R. 438) held (reversing judgment of Fisher J., 52 B.C.R. 16) that the assignment to the bank was in contravention of the Bank Act (Dom., 1934, c. 24), s. 75 (2) (c) (prohibiting a bank, except as authorized by the Act, from lending upon the security of lands), unless it could be said to come within s. 79 (1) (b) (empowering a bank to take, by way of additional security for debts contracted to it in the course of its business the rights of vendors under agreements for the sale of property); that it did not come within s. 79 (1) (b) except with respect to the indebtedness of $500 for which it was taken as additional security, but of which sum the bank had later received payment; that a bank cannot take such an assignment as security for an anticipated future indebtedness; and in respect to which it purported to be security for any future indebtedness the assignment was invalid. The bank appealed.\nHeld: The bank had no right, under the assignment, to any moneys now in question payable under the agreement of sale.\nPer The Chief Justice: The assignment could not take effect in virtue of said s. 79 (1) (b). That enactment is a special provision dealing with a particular case and declares the law with regard to that case.\nPer Crocket and Kerwin JJ.: The assignment was invalid under said s. 75 (2) (c); the obligation of the purchaser to pay the purchase price under the agreement of sale being inseparable from the vendor's obligation to convey the land.\nPer Davis J.: The instrument taken by the bank was an invalid assignment; the legal chose in action which the bank sought to obtain (merely the debt of the purchaser) could not in point of law be separated from the assignor's obligation to convey upon payment of the debt. (As to a vendor's interest, reference made to Simpson v. Smyth, 2 U.C. Jur. 162, at 193, and Parke v. Riley, 3 U.C. E. & A. Rep. 215, at 231-2).\nPer Hudson J.: Under said ss. 75 (2) (c) and 79 (1) (b), the assignment was invalid in respect of all advances subsequent to its making. Further, in so far as the purchaser's covenant for payment in the agreement of sale could be assignable at all, the assignee would take subject to all existing equities (authorities referred to, including Cockell v. Taylor, 15 Beav. 103, at 118, In re Morgan, 18 Ch. D. 93, at 103); the assignor was a trustee in respect of the land and of any proceeds of sale thereof, and the bank took subject to this trust, and there was nothing operating against respondent in the nature of an estoppel nor any rights acquired by the bank through a priority of registration; in this view the assignment was never a good assignment as against respondent's equitable right to the proceeds.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1] reversing the judgment of Fisher J. [2] answering in favour of the plain- tiff two questions (hereinafter set out) arising out of a special case stated, in the action, for the opinion of the court.\nOn March 8, 1928, one Nellie Grace Silk purchased, with funds forming part of her separate estate, certain land (in question) in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, for $19,000. The said land was registered in the land registry office at Vancouver in the names of said Nellie Grace Silk and her husband, George Baillie Silk, as joint tenants.\nOn October 20, 1928, said Nellie Grace Silk died, and on December 11, 1928, letters of administration to her estate were granted to said George Baillie Silk.\nOn March 22, 1929, Silk caused an application to be made in the land registry office to register the title to said land in himself as surviving joint tenant, and title was so registered.\n[Paragraph 5 of special case, referred to in question 2 infra]: On June 14, 1929, Silk entered into an agreement for sale of said land to Nanson, Rothwell & Co. Ltd. [hereinafter called the purchaser] for $30,000; and $7,665 became due and payable on July 1, 1936, together with one year's interest amounting to $229.75 under the terms of said agreement, as amended by an agreement dated April 28, 1933.\nOn June 26, 1929, Silk was notified by two of the next of kin of said Nellie Grace Silk, deceased, that they claimed that said land had been purchased with her funds and that the land and proceeds of sale thereof were the property of her estate, and were held by him in trust for said estate.\n[Paragraph 7 of special case, referred to in question 1 infra]: On July 23, 1929, Silk, being indebted to the plaintiff bank, and in anticipation of future loans, executed and delivered to it an assignment of the moneys owing under said agreement for sale, which assignment read as follows:\nAs security for all existing and future indebtedness and liability of the undersigned to The Canadian Bank of Commerce, all moneys now or hereafter payable to the undersigned under a certain Agreement for Sale, re Lot 18, Block 31, District Lot 541, Group 1, N.W.D., dated the 14th June, 1929, made between George Baillie Silk and Nanson, Rothwell & Co. Ltd. are hereby assigned to the said Bank, and the Bank is authorized to collect and give receipts therefor. Should any of the said moneys be received by or for the undersigned the same shall be received as trustee for the Bank and shall be paid over to or accounted for by the undersigned to the Bank. Dated at Vancouver, B.C., this 23rd day of July, 1929.\nOn July 24, 1929, notice of said assignment was given to the purchaser by the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff made no search at the land registry office to ascertain whether Silk was registered therein as owner of said property, and did not attempt to register its assignment of the moneys owing under said agreement for sale.\nAt the time of execution of said assignment, Silk was indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $500. Plaintiff made further loans to Silk after that date, and at the date of the commencement of this action the total amount of indebtedness of Silk to plaintiff was (including certain liabilities as endorser) $6,758.90.\nOn September 18, 1929, the purchaser paid to plaintiff $5,000, $3,500 of which was applied against the loans made by plaintiff to Silk and the balance, $1,500, was deposited in Silk's current account with plaintiff. On June 23, 1930, the purchaser paid to plaintiff $4,338.92, $4,000 of which was applied against the loans made by plaintiff to Silk and the balance, $338.92, was deposited in Silk's current account with plaintiff.\nOn August 22, 1929, an action was commenced by the said two of the next of kin of said Nellie Grace Silk, deceased, against Silk in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and on the same date a lis pendens in said action was filed in the land registry office on behalf of said two next of kin. On May 20, 1930, the latter obtained a judgment against Silk by which (inter alia) it was ordered and adjudged that said property was purchased with the moneys of said deceased and was the property of her estate and was held by Silk in trust for her estate.\nOn June 27, 1930, defendant (the present respondent) was appointed administrator of the estate of said deceased in the place and stead of Silk, and on October 21, 1930, the title to said property was registered in the name of defendant as administrator.\nOn December 1, 1930, plaintiff received actual notice of defendant's claim that the moneys due under said agreement for sale were the property of said deceased's estate, and on April 8, 1931, defendant received notice that said money was claimed by plaintiff under the said assignment, and it was agreed between the parties hereto that since the said dates their respective claims should be allowed to stand without prejudice to the rights of either party.\n[Paragraph 17 of special case, referred to in question 2 infra]: ,On June 19, 1935, defendant received the sum of $574.87 from the purchaser, being 2 1\/2 years' interest owing on said agreement for sale, which said money was paid to defendant without prejudice to plaintiff's position, and was to be held by defendant until the legal ownership of the said money had been determined.\nThe questions for the opinion of the court were:\n1. Is the assignment referred to in paragraph 7 hereof a good and valid assignment as against the defendant, as personal representative of the estate of Nellie Grace Silk, deceased, and\/or its predecessor in office?\n2. Should the sums of $7,665 and $229.95 referred to in paragraph 5 hereof and the sum of $574.87 referred to in paragraph 17 hereof be paid to the plaintiff, or should the sums of $7,665 and $229.95 referred to in paragraph 5 be paid to the defendant?\nFisher J.[3] answered the first question \"yes\" and, in answer to the second question, held that the sums therein mentioned should be paid to the plaintiff. His judgment was set aside by the Court of Appeal (McPhillips J.A. dissenting)[4], which held that the assignment in question was valid in respect of the sum of $500 advanced by plaintiff to Silk prior to the date of said assignment (but payment whereof was received by plaintiff in September, 1929), but that in respect of subsequent advances by plaintiff to Silk it was invalid; and that the sums of $7,665 and $229.95 mentioned in question 2 should be paid to defendant. Its judgment was based upon the ground that unless the assignment in question can be said to come within s. 79 (1) (b) of the Bank Act (Dom.,1934,c. 24) it is in contravention of s. 75 (2) (c) of that Act; that it does not come within s. 79 (1) (b) except with respect to the indebtedness of $500 for which debt the assignment was made and taken as additional security; that the bank may take an assignment of the rights of a vendor under an agreement for sale of property as additional security for debts contracted to the bank in the course of its business, but that the bank cannot take such an assignment as security for an anticipated future indebtedness. Said sections of the Bank Act read as follows:\nSec. 75 (2) (c):\n2. Except as authorized by this Act, the bank shall not either directly or indirectly,\n***\n(c) lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands, tenements, or immovable property, or of any ships or other vessels, or upon the security of any goods, wares and merchandise.\nSec. 79 (1) (b):\n79. The bank may take, hold and dispose of, by way of additional security for debts or liabilities contracted to the bank in the course of its business,\n***\n(b) the rights of vendors or purchasers under agreements for the sale or purchase of real and personal, immovable and movable property.\nThe plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nGordon R. Munnoch K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.V. Clyne and John W. H. Rowley for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with the view of Mr. Justice Sloan[5] that the assignment here in question cannot take effect in virtue of section 79[6] (b) of the Bank Act.\nThat enactment, in my opinion, is a special provision dealing with a particular case and declares the law with regard to that case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCrocket, J.\u2014I agree that the assignment which the appellant took from Silk as the vendor of the land in question was invalid under subs. 2 (c) of s. 75 of the Bank Act, the obligation of the purchaser to pay the purchase price under the agreement of sale being contingent upon and inseparable from the vendor's obligation to convey the land.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavis, J.\u2014The facts are fully set out in the special case settled by the parties.\nOn or about March 8th, 1928, real property in the city of Vancouver known as the Howe street property was purchased with the moneys of Nellie Grace Silk and conveyed to her and her husband, George Baillie Silk, as joint tenants. On October 20th, 1928, Nellie Grace Silk died and letters of administration were granted to her husband, George Baillie Silk, on December 11th, 1928. On March 22nd, 1929, the said George Baillie Silk caused the title to the said property to be registered in his name as surviving joint tenant. On June 14th, 1929, the said George Baillie Silk entered into an agreement for sale of the said property to Nanson, Rothwell & Company, Limited. On June 26th, 1929, the said George Baillie Silk was notified by two of the next of kin of his deceased wife that they claimed that the said property was held by him in trust for the heirs at law of Nellie Grace Silk, deceased, but no notice of this contention was then given to the appellant bank.\nOn July 23rd, 1929, the said George Baillie Silk, being indebted to the appellant bank in the sum of $500, executed and delivered an assignment to it of all moneys then or thereafter payable to him under the said agreement for sale, which assignment is as follows:\nAs security for all existing and future indebtedness and liability of the undersigned to The Canadian Bank of Commerce, all moneys now or hereafter payable to the undersigned under a certain Agreement for Sale, re Lot 18, Block 31, District Lot 541, Group 1, N.W.D, dated the 14th June day of 1929, made between George Baillie Silk and Nanson, Rothwell & Co. Ltd. are hereby assigned to the said Bank, and the Bank is authorized to collect and give receipts therefor. Should any of the said moneys be received by or for the undersigned the same shall be received as trustee for the Bank and shall be paid over to or accounted for by the undersigned to the Bank.\nDated at Vancouver, this 23rd day of July, 1929.\n\u201c G.B.Silk.\u201d\nNotice in writing of the said assignment was duly given to Nanson, Rothwell & Company Limited. Subsequently, the appellant bank substaintial advances to said George Baillie Silk relying upon the said assignment as security therefore and also relied upon the said assignment for money advanced to three other persons respectively upon their promissory notes endorsed by the said silk. When this action was commenced, the total liability of the said in respect if his said endorsements aggregated $6,758.90.\nBy a judgment delivered on may 20th 1930, in an action commenced by tow of the heirs at law of Nellie Grace silk, deceased, against the said George Baillie. Silk for a declaration, inter alia, that the Howe street property formed part of the estate of the said deceased and did not belong to the said George Baillie Silk by survivorship, it was determined that the Howe street property was held by the said George Baillie Silk in trust for the estate of Nellie Grace Silk, deceased. The parties hereto admit the validity of that judgment and further admit the findings of fact contained in the reasons for the judgment,\nOn June 27th, 1930, the respondent was appointed Administrator of the estate of the said Nellie Grace silk, deceased, in the place and stead of the said George Baillie Silk, and on October 21st, 1930, the title to the Howe street property was registered in the name of the respondent as Administrator.\nOn December 1st, 1930, the appellant bank was notified by the respondent that the moneys due under the said agreement for sale were claimed by it as Administrator of the estate of Nellie Grace Silk, deceased. The appellant bank had no prior notice of any claim adverse to its rights under the aforesaid assignment given to it by the said George Baillie Silk.\nOn July 1st, 1936, the sum of $7,665 became due and payable under the said agreement for sale by Nanson, Rothwell & Company Limited, together with interest amounting to $229.95. On June 19th, 1935, the respondent had received the sum of $574.87 from the said Nanson, Rothwell & Company Limited, which said money was paid to the respondent without prejudice to the appellant's rights, and pending the determination of this action.\nThe contest in this action between the appellant bank and the respondent trust company arises from their respective claims to the balance owing under the agreement for sale by Nanson, Rothwell & Company, Limited. The bank claims the fund by reason of the assignment; the trust company as Administrator resists this contention and raises two objections to the bank's claim. The first objection is that the assignment to the bank was not an absolute but an equitable assignment by way of charge only and is therefore postponed to the prior equity represented by the trust company as Administrator of the estate of Nellie Grace Silk. The second objection is that the assignment is contrary to The Bank Act and in consequence void. The learned trial judge found in favour of the Bank [7]. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [8] reversed that judgment, except as to the $500 advanced by the bank to George Baillie Silk on the 15th day of July, 1929, and ordered that the sums of $7,665 and $229.95 referred to in the special case should be paid to the trust company. The bank now appeals to this Court.\nMuch of the argument before us was directed to the question whether or not the assignment to the bank was an absolute assignment or an equitable assignment by way of charge only. The learned trial judge considered that question and discussed it at length in his reasons for judgment, coming to the conclusion that the instrument did not purport to be by way of charge only and was an absolute assignment of the debt. The Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to consider that question because that Court came to the conclusion, in its view of the relevant sections of The Bank Act, that a bank may take an assignment of the rights of a vendor under an agreement for sale of property as additional security for debts contracted to the bank in the course of its business but that a bank cannot take such an assignment as security for an anticipated future indebtedness. Upon that ground the Court of Appeal held that the assignment to the bank was valid in so far as it was taken as additional security for payment of the debt contracted at the time (i.e., the $500) but invalid in so far as it purported to be security for any future indebtedness. The bank having received payment of the $500 debt, it was held to have no claim now under the assignment upon any of the moneys still owing by Nanson, Rothwell & Company Limited under the agreement for sale.\nSection 75 (2) (c) of The Bank Act (ch. 24 of the Statutes of Canada, 1934) prohibits the bank, except as authorized by the Act, from either directly or indirectly lending money or making advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands, tenements or immovable property. By section 79 (1) (b) the bank may, however, take, hold, and dispose of by way of additional security for debts or liabilities contracted to the bank in the course of its business, the rights of vendors or purchasers under agreements for the sale or purchase of real and personal, immovable and movable property.\nThe only indebtedness of Silk to the bank at the date of the delivery of the assignment in question was the sum of $500. The assignment is now sought to be enforced by the bank in respect of subsequent advances.\nCounsel for the bank argues that-if it is to be implied that an assignment by a vendor of a debt for unpaid purchase money necessarily carries with it the vendor's interest in the lands, that intention is negatived in this case because of the statutory incapacity of the bank, by virtue of sec. 75 (2) (c), to lend money or make advances upon the security of land. Further, that by virtue of sec. 79 (1) (b), a bank may only take the rights of a vendor in an agreement for the sale of land by way of additional security for debts or liabilities contracted to the bank in the course of its business. Therefore, the submission on behalf of the bank is that the assignment in question is not affected by the provisions of either sec. 75 or sec. 79 of The Bank Act because the assignment was an assignment of moneys only\u2014separated from any right enforceable against any interest in the land\u2014and that it was competent to the bank to take and hold the said assignment as security for the debts and liabilities of Silk to the bank whether incurred before or after the assignment was taken.\nIn my opinion, the appeal can be disposed of upon one point. The obligation of a vendor upon payment is to convey the property to the purchaser; and the debt of a purchaser under an agreement for the sale of land cannot be separated from the equitable obligation of the vendor to convey upon payment. The bank did not put itself in the position of being able to convey upon payment of the debt; it did not acquire from its customer, the vendor, the title to the property which he was bound in equity to convey to his purchaser upon payment of the purchase money. The effect of the separation was to place the debt in the hands of the bank while the title to the property remained in the hands of the assignor. The legal chose in action which the bank sought to obtain by assignment could not in point of law be separated from the assignor's obligation to convey upon payment of the debt. A vendor does not in substance remain the owner of the land but only in form as a means of compelling payment of the debt secured upon it, which is the owner's only valuable interest in the land, to adopt and adapt the language of the Chief Justice of Upper Canada, Sir John Beverley Robinson, in Simpson v. Smyth [9], dealing with the rights of a mortgagee, which language was relied upon by Vice-Chancellor Mowat in his valuable judgment (though dissenting) in Parke v. Riley [10], where that great judge said:\nEvery word of this (that is, the language of Chief Justice Robinson) is as applicable to the case of a vendor who has not conveyed, as to a mortgagee. Like a mortgagee, he has a right to retain the legal estate so long only as the debt for the land remains unpaid. His real interest in it is the debt due\u2014nothing more; and the effect of the sale, if permitted, would not be to pass to the purchaser the right of suing at law for the debt, any more than in case of a formal mortgage. In a word, in whatever sense the language of the learned judge is correct in reference to the case to which he was alluding, it is equally correct as to the case here.\nThe instrument upon which the bank rests its claim is, in my opinion, an invalid assignment and for this reason the appeal must be dismissed with costs. There having been no cross appeal, that part of the order of the Court appealed from which declared that the assignment was valid in so far as the sum of $500 advanced by the bank to Silk on July 15th, 1929, was secured, cannot in this appeal be set aside but no harm will be done because the $500 was repaid as early as September, 1929.\nKerwin, J.\u2014Although the argument before us covered a wide field, in my opinion the appellant must fail because what it did was in violation of subsection 2, clause (c) of section 75 of The Bank Act. By this enactment a bank shall not either directly or indirectly lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands, tenements or immovable property.\nAfter having made a loan of five hundred dollars to one Silk (which loan was later paid off and no question arises as to it), the appellant took from him a document reading as follows:\nAs security for all existing and future indebtedness and liability of the undersigned to The Canadian Bank of Commerce, all moneys now or hereafter payable to the undersigned under a certain Agreement for Sale, re Lot 18, Block 31, District Lot 541, Group 1, N.W.D., dated the 14th June, 1929, made between George Baillie Silk and Nanson, Rothwell & Co. Ltd. are hereby assigned to the said Bank, and the Bank is authorized to collect and give receipts therefor. Should any of the said moneys be received by or for the undersigned the same shall be received as trustee for the Bank and shall be paid over to or accounted for by the undersigned to the Bank.\nDated at Vancouver, B.C., this 23rd day of July, 1929.\nThe only argument addressed to us on the point was that this document was a mere assignment of the moneys due under the agreement for sale of the lands mentioned and was not an assignment of all the rights of Silk as vendor under that agreement. It was urged that the vendor's right under the purchaser's covenant in the agreement, to receive the purchase moneys, was severable from the duty which the vendor was under to give title to the purchaser upon payment of the full consideration, but in my view that contention is not sound. The purchaser's covenant to pay cannot be divorced from his right to secure, and the vendor's duty to convey, the lands upon payment of the purchase price. The agreement bound the vendor to convey upon payment of the purchase price, and in accepting the assignment of the moneys due under the covenant for payment in the agreement the Bank certainly indirectly, if not directly, lent money, after the taking of the assignment, upon the security of lands.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nHudson, J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia [11], which allowed an appeal by the respondents from a judgment of Mr. Justice Fisher [12]. The controversy is in respect of the moneys payable by a purchaser under an agreement to purchase lands in the City of Vancouver. The appellant bank claims under an assignment from a man named Silk, in the following terms:\nAS SECURITY for all existing and future indebtedness and liability of the undersigned to THE CANADIAN BANK OF COMMERCE, all moneys now or hereafter payable to the undersigned, under a certain Agreement for Sale, re Lot 18, Block 31, District Lot 541, Group 1, N.W.D., dated the 14th June day of 1929, made between George Baillie Silk and Nanson, Rothwell & Co. Ltd. are hereby assigned to the said Bank, and the Bank is authorized to collect and give receipts therefor. Should any of the said moneys be received by or for the undersigned the same shall be received as trustee for the Bank and shall be paid over to or accounted for by the undersigned to the Bank.\nDATED at Vancouver, this 23rd day of July, 1929.\n\" G. B. Silk.\"\nAt the time when this assignment was given to the Bank, there was also given them by Silk a duplicate original of the agreement for sale. Silk was the registered owner of the land in question at the time he made the agreement of sale and remained so until after the assignment to the Bank. Silk was indebted to the Bank in the sum of $500 when he made the assignment; this amount was afterwards repaid but subsequent advances were made to him by the Bank, so that in the autumn of 1929 and at the time of the commencement of this action the amount of his indebtedness to the Bank was $5,477.67, in addition to certain liabilities as endorser in respect of loans to others aggregating $1,281.23.\nThe defendant is the administrator of the estate of Nellie Grace Silk, wife of the above mentioned Silk, who died in October, 1928. On the 26th of June, 1929, two of the next-of-kin of Mrs. Silk notified Silk that they claimed the property in question had been purchased with funds of the late Mrs. Silk and that the proceeds were the property of her estate. On the 22nd of August, 1929, they commenced an action against Silk to enforce this claim and they filed a lis pendens in the proper registry office. Subsequently, on the 20th of May, 1930, they obtained a judgment against Silk, declaring that the properties covered by this agreement of sale and other property\nwere purchased with the moneys of the above named Nellie Grace Silk, deceased, and are the property of her estate and in so far as any portions thereof are held in the name of the Defendant, they are so held by him in trust for the said estate together with any other properties or investments which were purchased by him with the moneys received by him from the said Nellie Grace Silk and which are held by him or by any one on his behalf.\nThen, on the 27th of June, 1930, the defendant company was appointed administrator and became the registered owner of the property in question.\nAlthough, as above mentioned, a lis pendens had been filed as early as August, 1929, the appellant Bank did not have actual notice of the claim set up by the next-of-kin, now represented by the respondent, until the 1st Decem- ber, 1930, before which date they had made the advances above referred to.\nIn this action, the appellant Bank asks for a declaration of ownership of the moneys owing by the purchasers under the agreement of sale, and for a declaration that the assignment to them is a good and valid assignment and for payment of a sum of $574.87.\nA special case setting out the facts was submitted and two questions left for the opinion of the Court:\n1. Is the assignment referred to in paragraph 7 hereof a good and valid assignment as against the Defendant, as personal representative of the Estate of Nellie Grace Silk, deceased and\/or its predecessor in office?\n2. Should the sums of $7,665 and $229.95 referred to in paragraph 5 hereof and the sum of $574.87 referred to in paragraph 17 hereof be paid to the Plaintiff, or should the sums of $7,665 and $229.95 referred to in paragraph 5 be paid to the Defendant?\nThe learned trial judge answered the first question in the affirmative and the second question, that the sums should be paid to the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal took another view and held that the assignment to the appellant was invalid under the provisions of the Bank Act, except as to the sum of $500 advanced prior to the assignment and subsequently repaid.\nThe assignment purports to assign all moneys now or hereafter payable to Silk under the agreement of sale mentioned, but the agreement of sale does more than create an obligation on the part of the purchasers. There is a corresponding obligation on the part of the vendor to give title at the time when the purchase money is paid, and the purchaser would be under no obligation to pay his purchase money until the vendor was in a position to give him title. In this instance the obligation was constant because under the terms of the agreement of sale the purchaser had the privilege of paying off the balance of the purchase price at any time. The Bank is here met with the formidable difficulty that the respondent now holds the legal title to the estate.\nThe reciprocal obligations of vendors and purchasers in this respect are succinctly stated in Dart on Vendors and Purchasers, 8th Edition, at page 265:\nFrom the time the owner of an estate enters into a binding agreement for its sale, he holds the same in trust for the purchaser, subject to payment of the purchase-money: but the relationship thus created does not entail all the obligations of an ordinary trusteeship. The vendor is not a mere dormant trustee; he is a trustee having a personal and substantial interest in the property, a right to protect, and an active right to assert that interest, if anything is done in derogation of it. The relation, therefore, of trustee and cestui que trust subsists, but subject to the paramount right of the vendor to protect his own interest as vendor of the property. When the title has been accepted and the purchase-money paid, this paramount right of the vendor ceases, and the trusteeship subsists without qualification; but, as from the date of the contract, the relationship is throughout that of trustee and cestui que trust.\nThis statement of Dart is supported in numerous decisions of the highest authority.\nIn Rose v. Watson [13], Lord Westbury says:\nWhen the owner of an estate contracts with a purchaser for the immediate sale of it, the ownership of the estate is, in equity, transferred by that contract. Where the contract undoubtedly is an executory contract, in this sense, namely, that the ownership of the estate is transferred, subject to the payment of the purchase money, every portion of the purchase money paid in pursuance of that contract is a part performance and execution of the contract, and, to the extent of the purchase money so paid, does, in equity, finally transfer to the purchaser the ownership of a corresponding portion of the estate.\nShaw v. Foster [14] and Peck v. Sun Life Assurance Company [15].\nIn Royal Trust Company v. Kennedy [16], it was stated by Mr. Justice Newcombe as follows:\nThe chief end of the agreement between the parties, and the reason for which it was called into being, was the sale and purchase of the lands described; and, while the purchaser had covenanted to pay the purchase money with interest as provided, the vendor had, in like manner agreed, on payment of the purchase money, to convey and assure the premises to the purchaser by good and sufficient deed in fee simple. The terms are therefore dependent.\nFor this reason the obligation of the purchaser cannot be treated in any sense as negotiable and the Bank could not get any better title than Silk himself had unless by way of estoppel or because of the registry laws. There was no registration of the Bank's assignment and, indeed if there had been, their position would have been even more vulnerable because of section 75 of the Bank Act. In the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Sloan, speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court, disposed of the matter there on the basis that the instrument in question was invalid under the provisions of sections 75 and 79 of the Bank Act, in respect of all advances subsequent to the making of the assignment, and that the Bank had no right to take such assignment as security for an anticipated future indebtedness.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Sloan in his interpretation of the provisions of the Bank Act in so far as they apply to this case, but I also think that there is a more fundamental difficulty in the way of the Bank's success. As has already been stated, the purchaser's covenant for payment in an agreement for sale such as this is not a negotiable security. It is a chose in action and, in so far as it is assignable at all, the assignee takes subject to all existing equities. The assignor had no right to assign something that he did not own.\nThe law in support of this position is clearly stated in numerous cases.\nIn Cockell v. Taylor [17], Sir John Romilly said :\nThe rule relative to the equities which attach on a chose in action has been discussed and established in many cases. It has not been disputed, nor can it be doubted, that the purchaser of a chose in action does not stand in the situation of a purchaser of real estate for valuable consideration without notice of any prior title, but that the purchaser of a chose in action takes the thing bought subject to all the prior claims upon it. If, therefore, the share of the Plaintiff Collett in the fund in Court had been charged with a sum to another person unknown to Taylor, Taylor would have taken this interest in the fund subject to that charge.\nIn re Morgan [18]. Where a lease was surrendered by an executor and a new lease, including additional property, was taken by him in his own name and at an increased rent and was deposited by him as security for money advanced to him, it was held that the cestuis que trust had priority over the equity mortgage. Jessel, M.R., said at p. 103:\nThis being the position of the matter, he was a trustee of the new lease. In 1879 he borrowed in his own name, for his own use in carrying on the business, a sum of money from the Appellant, and he deposited the lease with him. It is true that the Appellant had no notice that Pillgrem was not the lawful owner of the property comprised in the lease. If he had inquired into the landlord's title he would have got no notice. He was therefore a purchaser without notice, who did not get the legal title, therefore he must take the lease subject to prior equities, that is, to the trust on which it was held.\nIn White and Tudor's L.C. 9th Edition, Vol. I, page 138:\nWhere though the assignor purports to assign a right, no right is in fact vested in him at the date of the alleged assignment, manifestly the assignee can obtain no title though he gives value and has no notice of the invalidity of the right assigned. Thus if a satisfied bond or a bond void at law or in equity be assigned, the assignee can neither enforce the bond nor rely upon it as a defence. Further if the transaction out of which the right assigned arises is liable to be set aside as against the assignor by reason of fraud, misrepresentation, or other ground of relief, the assignee acquires only a defeasible title and the relief which could be obtained against the assignor can be obtained against the assignee.\nand at page 139:\nWhere a cestui que trust is indebted to the estate by reason of his having profited by a breach of trust, an assignee for value of his beneficial interest will take it, subject to the equity of making good the breach of trust by which the assignor has profited (Priddy v. Rose) (1).\nSee also Montreal Trust Company v. Richardson (2).\nIn the present case the assignor Silk was a trustee for his wife in respect of the land and in respect of any proceeds that might be derived from the sale thereof. He had no right to alienate these moneys to others. The Bank took subject to this trust and there is nothing operating against the respondent in the nature of an estoppel nor any rights acquired by the Bank through a priority of registration. If this view is correct, the assignment was never a good and valid assignment as against the respondent's equitable right to the proceeds and the declaration as contained in the judgment of the Court of Appeal to that effect should be struck out. This, however, does not affect the practical result and, therefore, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davis & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Macrae, Duncan & Clyne.\n[1] 52 B.C.R. 438 ; [1938] 1 W.W.R. 530; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 285.\n[2] 52 B.C.R. 16 ; [937] 2 W.W.R. 474.\n[3] 52 B.C.R. 16 ; [1937] 2 W.W.R. 474.\n[4] 52 B.C.R. 438; [1938] 1 W.W.R.530 ; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 285.\n[5] In the Court of Appeal : 52 B.C.R. 438 ; [1938] 1 W.W.R. 530 ; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 285.\n[6] In the Court of Appeal : 52 B.C.R. 438 ; [1938] 1 W.W.R. 530 ; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 285.\n[7] 52 B.C.R. 16 ; [1937] 2 W.W.R. 474.\n[8] 52 B.C.R. 438 ; [1938] 1 W.W.R. 530 ; [1938] 2 D.L.R. 285.\n[9] (1846) 2 U.C.
