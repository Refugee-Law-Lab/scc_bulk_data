Act\" exclusive legislative jurisdiction is conferred upon the legislature of each province in relation to\n(14) the administration of justice in the province, including the constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts both of civil and of criminal jurisdiction.\nBy s. 101 of the same Act it is enacted that\nthe Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from time to time provide for the constitution, maintenance and organization of a general Court of Appeal for Canada and for the establishment of any additional courts for the better administration of the laws of Canada.\nIn 1875, under the power thus conferred upon it, the Dominion Parliament established the Supreme Court of Canada as a Court of Common Law and Equity and a court of record, (38 V. c. 11). The Supreme Court continues to exist to-day as\na general court of appeal for Canada and as an additional Court for the better administration of the laws of Canada\n(\"Supreme Court Act,\" R.S.C. [1906] c. 139, s. 3). Both in its constitution and in its jurisdiction, the. Supreme Court is a purely statutory court. It\nhas, holds and exercises an appellate, civil and criminal jurisdiction throughout Canada\n(s. 35), subject to certain qualifications and restrictions specified in other sections of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Notwithstanding the comma after the word \"appellate\" in s. 35 (not found in the original s. 15 of the statute of 1875, c. 11), that section relates only to the appellate jurisdiction of the court. An attempt to confer on it general, original, civil and criminal jurisdiction would hopelessly transcend the power given by s. 101 of the \"B.N.A. Act,\" and would seriously impinge upon provincial legislative jurisdiction under s. 92 (14) of the \"B.N.A. Act.\" From the appellate jurisdiction are specially excluded, inter alia.\nproceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus * * * arising out of a criminal charge.\nAs to the purview of the term \"criminal charge,\" vide Mitchell v. Tracey[1]; Nat Bell Liquors v. The King[2].\nThe original jurisdiction of the court, in order to keep within the limits prescribed by s. 101 of the \"B.N.A. Act,\" is confined to \"the better administration of the laws of Canada.\" Hence the restriction imposed by s. 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" which confers on\nevery judge of the court, except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any treaty, concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in a criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe limitation imposed by the concluding words of this section is absolute. Re Sproule[3] ; Ex parte MacDonald[4] ; Re Potvin[5], and Re Dean[6]. Except for the pur- pose of inquiry into commitments in criminal cases under an Act of the Parliament of Canada, a judge of this court possesses none of the original powers and is subject to none of the duties in regard to habeas corpus of the ordinary courts of common law, whether arising under the common law itself or conferred by Imperial or by provincial statutes. \"For the better administration of the laws of Canada\" such powers are not requisite. Not only have they not been conferred on this statutory court either explicitly or by necessary implication, as would be necessary, but the implication from the terms of s. 62 negativing their existence is irresistible. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.\nThe applicant, Roberts, as appears by his petition, is held in custody at Quebec for an alleged offence against the privileges, honour and dignity of the provincial legislature of Quebec and under the authority of special legislation enacted by it. (13 Geo, V, c. 18). The cause of his commitment is that Act of the legislature. There is, in my opinion, no ground whatever for suggesting that it is\nin a criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nOn that simple ground I am satisfied that I am without jurisdiction to entertain the present application for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. Entertaining this opinion without any doubt, I think I should not exercise the discretionary power of referring this application to the court. Rule 72; In re Gray[7].\nIf advised that I am mistaken the applicant is not without redress. Section 62 gives him a special right to appeal to the court from my refusal of the writ.\nThe application will be dismissed, but, as is customary [Cameron, S.C. Prac.

Proctor for the appellant.\nTilley K.C. and Wentworth Greene K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I concur generally with the reasons stated by Sir Wm. Meredith, the Chief Justice of Ontario, when delivering the unanimous judgment of the First Divisional Court in favour of the respondents.\nI am also in full accord with the reasons for judgment of my brothers Anglin and Mignault and do not, therefore, deem it necessary or desirable to repeat these reasons. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant seeks herein to reverse four judgments of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, reversing the judgments of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board, which had reversed the judgments of the late County Judge of Carleton, who had allowed the appeals, respectively taken, by each of the respondents, or those whom they respectively represented, against their respective assessments under the Ontario Assessment Act, by those acting on behalf of appellant.\nEach of these appeals depends on the same essentially relevant facts and law, and hence are consolidated for the purposes of this appeal.\nThe respondents, or those they respectively represent, are pretended to be assessed in respect of income derivable from rights held by each, or those they respectively represent, as shareholders in a company incorporated as The Hawkesbury Lumber Company, by 52 Vict., c. 98, with a nominal capital of $200,000.\nThe power to assess is given by section 11 of the Assessment Act, c. 195 of R.S.C. [1914], which reads as follows:\u2014\n11. (1) Subject to the exemptions provided for in sections 5 and 10:\u2014\n(a) Every person not liable to business assessment under section 10 shall be assessed in respect of income;\n(b) Every person although liable to business assessment under section 10 shall also be assessed in respect of any income not derived from the business in respect of which he is assessable under that section, and\n(c) Every person liable to business assessment under clause (f) of subsection 1 of section 10 shall also be assessed in respect of the income derived by him from his business, profession or calling, to the extent to which such income exceeds the amount of such business assessment.\n(2) Where such income is not a salary or other fixed amount capable of being estimated for the current year, the income of such person for the purposes of assessment shall be taken to be not less than the amount of his income during the year ending on the 31st December then last past. 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 11.\nIncome is defined by section 2, subsection (e) of said Act, as follows:\u2014\n(e) \u201cIncome\u201d shall mean the annual profit or gain or gratuity whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profit from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be; and shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and also profit or gain from any other source.\nThe dominant member of this definition is that in the words \u201cthe annual profit or gain or gratuity\u201d derivable from either that ascertained and capable of computation or unascertained from various specified sources which may not be so.\nThe appellant\u2019s commissioner of assessment having discovered that in December, 1920, the said Hawkesbury Lumber Company had made a distribution amongst its shareholders out of some surplus assets accumulated over so long a period as fifteen years, or more, prior to the end of the year 1916, and called it a dividend, came to the conclusion, somewhat hastily, I respectfully submit, that it must be considered assessable income of that year, 1920, and acted accordingly, and directed the several parties receiving part thereof to be assessed in the assessment roll of 1921, prepared as the basis of taxation for 1922.\nI cannot understand how that which clearly was no part of \u201cthe annual profit or gain\u201d in the year 1920, can be taken as the measure of what was to determine the assessment for 1921 in default of other means of determining same.\nThe word \u201cdividend\u201d used in the latter part of the definition of income is clearly restricted to dividends or profits received from money at interest, or other form of such like character, and in no sense intended as a repetition of that found as the expression relative to manufacturing industries such as this lumbering industry or its like.\nAnd when one turns to the charter of the Hawkesbury Lumber Company which in express terms includes all the powers given by the Companies\u2019 Clauses Act (save and except section 18 and anything else inconsistent with said charter) as then in force and so recently enacted, and considers all so invoked, it seems, if possible, more obvious that dividends such as it was empowered thereby to declare might well include capital no longer needed as well as profits.\nThe dividend now in question might well have been of that character; especially so when we find that special provision was made for the private business concerns of several of those promoting the company\u2019s incorporation becoming the property of the company.\nIt might well be that the assets so acquired might turn out in the course of time to far exceed in value the modest capital stock of the company and produce more capital than needed and hence the basis of distribution by way of dividends such as the directors were given power to declare.\nThe rise in value of timber lands, held only by virtue of mere licence, may also have largely contributed to the value of the company\u2019s assets and have become a subject of distribution by way of dividend by the year 1916, or any of the fifteen preceding years. Such increase of value is not part of what is taxable as income.\nIn such an elastic and comprehensive charter as this company had there was ample room for the actual capitalization of even more profits as contended for by counsel for respondent.\nBut inasmuch as that may not have been declared in a formal way I may be permitted to suggest that the foregoing reasons I have assigned founded on the history of said company by virtue of its charter and all implied therein presents in a more cogent light the insuperable difficulty of maintaining appellant\u2019s pretensions herein.\nAll I am concerned with is that in any way one can look at the meaning of the word \u201cdividend\u201d relied upon by appellant, it does not justify the assumption that the dividend in December, 1920, was part of the income of the respondent for that year, and thus a basis within the meaning of subsection 11, subsection (2) above quoted from the Assessment Act.\nThere has been, at least ever since A.D. 1853, an income tax in force in Upper Canada later known as Ontario. It was included for many years under the term \u201cpersonal property\u201d as defined in the several Acts in the earlier years of said period.\nAnd when, as of necessity, the income of the previous year had to be taken as basis it was generally referred to as that for the past year, and in one of the Acts seemed to refer to it as fixed by the assessment of the past year. It was not until 1904 that income was defined as it is now, as above quoted. I suspect that before and even since the assessment of income under said Act when a previous year had to be used as a basis the actual fact was got from the previous year\u2019s assessment roll.\nAnd I respectfully submit that due insistence on the part of municipal officers would have brought forward the actual facts and an honest basis for assessment of respondents, or those they respectively represent, based on the previous year, quite within the limits of subsection 2 of section 11, instead of the adoption of a dividend which was the accumulation of fifteen years previous to a period three or four years anterior to the year now in question.\nIf, however, I am mistaken in my suggestion and the parties concerned should in face of such insistence as open to appellant\u2019s officers have taken the ground that they were not bound to submit to such taxation until the money had been got, then they might have been within their legal rights. And if a shareholder in an industrial concern is not liable until paid the part that is paid in and for the last year previous to the assessment is all that in any court should be acted upon.\nIt is a clear and express principle of law applicable to the construction of taxing statutes that express language in same is indispensable.\nI would refer to the language of Lord Cairns in Cox v. Rabbits[1], where he said that\na taxing Act must be construed strictly; you must find fixed words to impose the tax, and if words are not found which impose the tax it is not to be imposed.\nI think the application of this language of Lord Cairns, which expresses that which is undoubted law, to the facts presented by this appeal, should dispose of this appeal, and observance of which should have averted this appeal from the Appellate Division.\nCan distribution of capital or bequests or heirship inheritance which have come in during the year be taxed as income?\nIt is not that received but that earned or gained by industry that alone seems to be taxable, if those items are maintainable. There were many other objections submitted in argument and others again which occur to me as cogent in the way of appellant, which I have left aside lest the foregoing reasoning, presenting what seems to me insuperable, might be confused therewith and thereby be impaired.\nThe reference to English decisions on very differently framed Acts, as a glance at the Imperial Act of 1918 shews, is rather far fetched.\nI hold the appeal should be dismissed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014The principle of income assessment and taxation clearly expressed in the legislation which comes under consideration on this appeal is that it is the income for the current year which is assessable. That is impliedly declared in section 11, subsection 2, expressly declared in section 19 (b) as well as in the form of return prescribed under the authority of section 18, subsection 1 (a). In certain circumstances (where the income is not a \u201cfixed amount\u201d and where it is not \u201ccapable of being estimated for the current year\u201d) the income of the preceding year is made to furnish the standard or evidence for fixing the minimum income for the current year, but it is only as evidence (conclusive it is true up to a certain point) that the income of the preceding year becomes relevant to the question of assessment. Mr. Proctor\u2019s principal contention, which he presented with both force and candour, was that, according to the scheme of the legislation, incomes are divided into two classes, one class being incomes of \u201cfixed amount\u201d of which salaries and wages are to be taken as the type, while the other embraces all other descriptions of income. As regards the first class, the amount being \u201cfixed\u201d at the critical time, according to Mr. Proctor\u2019s suggestion, no difficulty could arise, but as regards all other descriptions of income the assessable amount is determined by the income of the previous year. The scheme of the legislation, as Mr. Proctor thus conceives it, is no doubt a more practicable and workable scheme than that which in my view the legislation does in fact embody, but there are fatal objections to that contention. In the first place the language of the sections already mentioned is too plain to admit of doubt that the income of the preceding year is, as I have already said, to be treated only as evidence for the purpose of fixing the minimum amount of the assessment; and in the next place this view of the legislation is quite incompatible with the language of section 19 (b) which contains not a word about salary or wages and directs a reference to the income of the previous year when the income for the current year cannot be estimated. Section 19 (b) was enacted as an amendment and must be taken, I think, to govern the construction of section 11, subsection 2.\nThe fundamental principle of the statute being that it is the income of the current year that is to be assessed and to be estimated, I concur with the view of the Chief Justice of Ontario that it is not an unreasonable implication that the assessing authority in determining the assessable amount in any given case is bound to proceed upon the facts known to it at the time the question comes up for determination.\nThe Ontario Municipal Board was therefore bound in giving judgment on the municipality\u2019s appeal to take into account the fact then known that no income had been received in respect of the shares in question in the year 1921.\nThis is of course conclusive of the appeal. I express no opinion upon the other questions argued.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Having regard to the definition of \u201cincome\u201d in section 2 (e) of the Assessment Act, to the provisions of sections 11 and 13, according to which the assessment roll in respect to income was directed to be prepared (s. 22 (3), col. 20), and to the declaration required from an income taxpayer (section 19a) and the note in the form (no. 2) of return prescribed by section 18, I agree with the unanimous opinion of the Divisional Court, as stated by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, that the assessment roll in question made in 1921 was an assessment roll for that calendar year and that the taxable income to be included in it was the income of that year.\nIt may have been legitimate for the assessor when preparing the roll for 1921 to have included in the assessable income of the several respondents in respect of prospective dividends from their holdings in the Hawkesbury Lumber Company amounts equal to the sums received by them from that source during the year 1920, if such latter sums should be regarded as income. Although the respondents, who had knowledge on the subject not available to the assessor, had made returns of income for 1921 which shewed no income to be received from the Hawkesbury Lumber Company, the assessor may have been within his right in declining to accept these returns (s. 20 (1)) and in applying the provisions of s. 11 (2) when preparing the roll. He did not, necessarily, then know that the respondents would not receive any income from the Hawkesbury Lumber Company during the entire year 1921. But, as is pointed out by the Chief Justice of Ontario, the object of the re-hearings of assessment appeals provided for by the statute by the Judge of the County Court, the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board and the Divisional Court, before each of which \u201cthe whole question of the assessment\u201d may be re-opened, is that\nthe accurate amount for which the assessment should be made * * * may be placed upon the roll by such Judge, Board or Court (s. 82).\nAs the learned Chief Justice says:\nWhen the appeal was before the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board the year 1921 had expired, it was demonstrable and was demonstrated that the income for which it is sought to assess the appellants was not received in 1921, and in my view it was the province of each tribunal to which an appeal has been made, to apply the test provided by section 11 (2), and when the appeal was before the Board, and as it is now before us, not only was the income of 1921 not incapable of being estimated but it was actually and definitely ascertained.\nI also respectfully agree that it is\nopen to an appellant at every stage until the final tribunal of appeal (the Divisional Court) is reached, and indeed before it, to show what the amount for which he is to be assessed is.\nAssuming, therefore, in the appellant\u2019s favour, but without so deciding, that the moneys received by the respondents in 1920 from the Hawkesbury Lumber Company were \u201cincome\u201d within the purview of the Assessment Act, they were income for 1920, not for the current year 1921, in and for which the roll in question was prepared. It having been conclusively shewn before the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board (which heard the appeal on the 23rd of January, 1922), that the respondents had in fact derived no income from that source during the year 1921, I agree that the assessment roll was properly \u201ccorrected\u201d by the Divisional Court and that \u201cthe accurate amounts\u201d of the assessable incomes of the respondents were properly inserted therein in lieu of the supposititious amounts which had been fixed by the assessor acting under s. 11 (2).\nIt may be that the omission from the Assessment Act of some provision for a special assessment in any year of income received after the roll for that year had been completed, similar to that made by (s. 9 (2)) for the case of transfer of exempted land, was purely accidental. But it is no part of the duty of a court to supply such deficiencies in legislation. What is sometimes called an equitable construction is not admissible in a taxing statute. In order to justify taxation upon it the subject of assessment must be brought clearly within the provisions of the Act. Partington v. Attorney General[2]; Tennant v. Smith[3]; Attorney General v. Milne[4].\nI would for these reasons dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The respondents are shareholders in the Hawkesbury Lumber Company. This company had a capitalization of $200,000. It was very successful and had accumulated large surpluses which, after paying some dividends, were appropriated to capital purposes. It was found however by the Dominion taxing officer that if the profits earned previously were not paid out to the shareholder before the end of 1920 he would have to make a special levy on these profits. Then the shareholders of the company decided to make, in December, 1920, the distribution suggested by this taxing officer. Such a distribution was called in the resolution of the company a \u201cdividend.\u201d\nIn the year 1921 the shareholders, respondents in this appeal, made their return to the municipal taxing officer and did not include therein any reference to the large \u201cdividend\u201d which they had received in the previous year.\nThe municipal assessor claims that such an amount should have been included in that return and that the respondents should be assessed accordingly. The respondents, on the other hand, contend that they cannot be assessed in 1921 for that alleged dividend received in 1920, and their contention was maintained by the Appellate Division.\nThe Assessment Act provides that every person not liable to business assessment shall be assessed in respect of his income; and the income is defined by the Act as meaning the annual profit or gain and includes the dividends or profits received (section 2, paragraph (e) and section 11, paragraph (a)).\nIt is also provided in subsection 2 of section 11 that when the income\nis not a salary or other fixed amount capable of being estimated for the current year, the income of such person for the purposes of assessment shall be taken to be not less than the amount of his income during the year ending on the 31st December then last past.\nIt is pretty evident under these different provisions of the law that what should be assessed would be the income of the current year. In the present case the assessment which is at issue is the assessment for the year 1921. The taxpayer, in making his return, and the assessor, in making his assessment roll, should insert therein the amount of the income which could be estimated.\nIf, however, the amount cannot be estimated then the income of the taxpayer for the previous year can be used as a basis for the fixing of the income.\nThe whole question is whether the amount of the income could be estimated or not.\nIt seems to me very clear that the large amount received in the year 1920 as a \u201cdividend\u201d from the Hawkesbury Lumber Company could not be estimated as being likely to be received during the year 1921. Nobody could suggest such a thing possible that the shareholders of this company were to receive in 1921 the same amount as was received by them the year previous. On the other hand, their income could easily be ascertained or estimated, and then there was no occasion to apply the provision of subsection 2 of section 11.\nFor these reasons, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs. MIGNAULT J.\u2014There are four appeals here from the Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario, the question being as to the validity of the assessment, under The Assessment Act (Ontario), of the four respondents for income for the year 1921, and against which assessment the respondents appealed.\nOn the 22nd December, 1920, each of the four respondents received a large sum of money from The Hawkesbury Lumber Co., being a dividend of 875 per cent. which, by resolution adopted at an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the company, held on the 15th December, 1920, was declared payable to the shareholders of record on that day out of an accumulated cash surplus in the hands of the company. In the return made to the appellant for purposes of assessment for 1921 the respondents, who had duly paid the tax on their assessed income for 1920, made no mention of this sum which was received by them in 1920 and not in 1921; but the assessing authorities of the city of Ottawa nevertheless included it in the income tax assessment for 1921. The respondents unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Revision, but succeeded in their appeal to the County Court, before the late Judge Gunn, where the amount thus added to the assessment was struck out. The city took an appeal to the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board which decided in its favour, this judgment however being reversed by the Appellate Divisional Court. The city of Ottawa now appeals to this court.\nIncome assessment under The Assessment Act is for the current calendar year, whereas the Dominion income tax is levied on the income received during the preceding year. No little of the difficulties of this case come from the very arduous problem which the legislature endeavoured to solve when it decided to levy the tax on income not already received but estimated for the year current at the time of the assessment.\nAs defined by section 2, subparagraph (e), \u201cincome\u201d is the annual profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling directly or indirectly received by the person subject to the tax, and it includes dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from stocks or from any other investment.\nSubsection 2 of section 11 states that where such income is not a salary or other fixed amount capable of being estimated for the current year, the income of such person for the purposes of assessment shall be taken to be not less than the amount of his income during the year ending on the 31st December then last past.\nSection 19a provides that in cities having a population of not less than 100,000 (which would comprise Ottawa), every person in receipt of an income liable to assessment shall within the time fixed by by-law of the council forward to the assessment commissioner a statutory declaration showing his total income from all sources during the current year and in ascertaining such income subsection 2 of section 11 shall apply. The respondents duly forwarded this declaration within the time prescribed by a by-law of the council.\nThe form of statutory declaration authorized by the Act contains a note which is to the same effect as subsection 2 of section 11, and it is on this form that the respondents\u2019 declarations were prepared.\nAssuming for the moment, but not deciding, that the amount received by the respondents in December, 1920, could properly be described as \u201cincome,\u201d the appellants\u2019 main contentions are based on this subsection. It must be observed however that it is only when the assessed\u2019s income is not a salary or other fixed amount \u201ccapable of being estimated for the current year,\u201d that his income is taken to be not less than the amount of his income during the previous calendar year. Inasmuch as the taxation is imposed upon an income to be received during the year of assessment, and which must be estimated before it is actually received, if this income can be estimated subsection 2 does not apply. And it does not follow that an income cannot be \u201cestimated\u201d because it consists in whole or in part of dividends paid periodically year after year, for these dividends may well be of a fixed amount which is paid at regular intervals, although, of course, on account of unforeseen events, they may vary or even fail to be paid. When the respondents made their declarations for 1920, these declarations no doubt contained an estimate of dividents to be received from stocks as do their returns for 1921. The 1920 declarations could not estimate extraordinary receipts like the dividend of 875 per cent. on the Hawkesbury Lumber Company\u2019s stock declared in December. The declarations for 1921 could however estimate the respondents\u2019 incomes to be received during that year, and no criticism is made by the appellant as to this estimate, the claim being that, under subsection 2 of section 11, the declaration should have included, as income for 1921, a sum which admittedly was received in 1920 and was not again received in 1921. The sufficiency of the 1921 declarations is now questioned and not the sufficiency of the declarations made for 1920, and so far as any income really received in 1921 is concerned the declarations for 1921 are not attacked.\nIt is not claimed that the respondents acted otherwise than in perfect good faith, or that the dividend of 875 per cent. was declared in December, 1920, with the view to enable the respondents to escape municipal taxation thereon. The Hawkesbury Lumber Company had consulted the commissioner of taxation under the Dominion income tax law, and was informed by him that if dividends were declared and paid out of surplus before the 31st December, 1920, such dividends would be considered to be non-taxable in the hands of the shareholders. No inference can be drawn from this that an attempt was made to evade taxation under the provincial Act. But the appellant objects that if this dividend cannot be included in the respondents\u2019 incomes for 1921, the respondents will escape taxation on the large amount which they received late in December, 1920. And in its factum it says:\u2014\nThe dividends could not have been charged to income tax upon the assessment rolls prepared in 1920, for the reason that certain of these rolls were finally revised prior to the date upon which the dividend was declared. Others were completed shortly afterwards. The rolls had been completed by the assessor and had been turned over by him prior to the 30th day of September, 1920.\nThe assessor had no knowledge which would have enabled him to enter these amounts upon the assessment rolls under preparation in 1920. In no way would he foresee that a dividend of 875 per cent. would be declared towards the end of December, 1920, long after his assessment rolls had gone before the court of revision.\nIt is not suggested that the respondents could have foreseen this dividend, when they made their statutory declarations in 1920, but really the criticism of the appellant points to a casus omissus in The Assessment Act, a case which neither the legislature nor these parties had foreseen, and it is impossible for the court to add to this taxation law in order to provide for it. And I also think that subsection 2 of section 11 cannot be extended to cover it.\nThe Assessment Act did not provide for the preparation of a supplementary roll to include income actually received after the preparation of the regular roll but not included therein. Nor did it require a supplementary declaration from persons receiving unforeseen income after the preparation of the roll. I have said that it is a very arduous problem to devise a complete scheme of taxation on income to be received during the year of assessment, and this case shews how difficult the problem really is. The legislature may well provide for such a contingency, but in my opinion it has not yet done so. I refer of course to the statute as it stood at the time of these proceedings.\nI may complete what I have to say on this branch of the case by referring to section 118 which provides for the remission or reduction of taxes by the court of revision on the petition of a person who has inter alia been overcharged by reason of a gross and manifest error in the roll, or who has been assessed for income but has not received such income. It does not go any further and does not authorize the making of a supplementary roll in a case like the one under consideration.\nIn my opinion therefore, the appellant\u2019s contention based on subsection 2 of section 11 is unfounded. This subsection can be applied to the case of persons having a fluctuating income which cannot be estimated in advance and to my mind this is its object and scope.\nIn view of what I have said it is unnecessary to determine whether the dividends received by the respondents are properly described as \u201cincome\u201d as defined by The Assessment Act. There is the further ground that under sections 82 and 83 of The Assessment Act, on an appeal upon any ground against an assessment, the County Court Judge or the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board or a divisional court may re-open the whole question of the assessment so that omissions from, or errors in, the roll may be corrected, and may determine the accurate amount for which the assessment should be made. The Appellate Court has exercised this power and I respectfully concur in the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario for exercising it.\nIn my opinion therefore the appeals fail and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Frank B.

Art. 2013 et seq.\u2014\"The Bankruptcy Act\" as amended by (D) 11-12 Geo. V, c. 17, s. 2 (g.g.), 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13 (15), 13a, 42, 45, 46, 51, 52.\nThe appellant company, being financially embarrassed, but before any assignment made, submitted to its unsecured creditors a proposal for an extension of credit of one year, pursuant to section 13 of the Bankruptcy Act. Such proposal was accepted by the majority of the unsecured creditors and duly approved by a judge in bankruptcy according to the provisions of the Act. The respondent, having a claim against the appellant for work done and materials supplied, caused to be registered a privilege, under articles 2013 et seq. C.C., upon the property on which work had been performed and, within the delay mentioned in the code, brought action to realize its security. The appellant then petitioned the court in bankruptcy for a stay of proceedings in such action until the expiry of the extension of credit.\nHeld that the judge in bankruptcy had no jurisdiction under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act to grant such stay.\nPer Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The court in bankruptcy had no inherent power to stay action.\nHeld, also, that the respondent company was a \"secured creditor\" within the meaning of section 2, subsection gg. of the Bankruptcy Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the court in bankruptcy, Maclennan J. and dismissing the petition made by the appellant for an order staying an action instituted by the respondent against the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Montgomery K.C. for the appellant. The judge in bankruptcy was competent to stay the action of the respondent, as the Bankruptcy Act does not entirely oust the jurisdiction of the court to restrain proceedings by a secured creditor, when such court is of the opinion that the interests of the creditors generally, secured and unsecured, would be seriously prejudiced by the continuance of the proceedings.\nThe respondent was not a \"secured creditor\" within the meaning of the relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Act.\nGeoffrion K.C. and De Witt K.C. for the respondent.\nLafleur K.C. and Montgomery K.C. for the appellant.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent having a claim against the appellant for work done and materials supplied in the erection of a mill owned by it, registered a lien or privilege in respect thereof under article 2013 and subsequent articles of the Civil Code of Quebec.\nThe appellant became insolvent in 1921 and before any receiving order or assignment under the Bankruptcy Act, or its amendments, had been made, applied under said Act and some of said amendments to its creditors for an extension of time to pay its debts and was, on the 1st December, 1921, granted same for a year, and after the said extension was granted the respondent instituted an action to enforce its said lien or privilege and realize the security thereby afforded it. That action was on the 2nd February, 1922, specifically ordered by a learned judge of the Superior Court to be stayed.\nThe question raised in this appeal is whether or not the respondent is, by virtue of said lien or privilege, a secured creditor within the meaning of the relevant section of said Bankruptcy Act and its amendments.\nThe learned judge who granted the order, thus staying respondent's action, recognized that secured creditors were expressly excepted from the operation of any such extension of credit but by a process of reasoning which seeks to distinguish between such a security as respondent enjoys under the code and that of other secured creditors, satisfied himself that the latter could be protected whilst the other should not be.\nThe said learned judge then founds his right to stay upon section 7, section 13, subsection 15, and subsection 13a (2). The Court of King's Bench reversed said judgment and set aside said stay with costs.\nThe notes of judgment by Mr. Justice Greenshields set forth in such complete and satisfactory manner the various aspects of the relevant law bearing upon the questions raised, that I need not repeat same here for I agree in all the essential features thereof as did the majority of his colleagues.\nI may, however, remark here concisely that, of the sections specifically relied upon by the learned judge granting the stay, section 7 must be read in connection with section 6; that subsections 15 and 13 cannot justifiably support the order, and that section 13a makes any such order as grants an extension of time subject to the rights of secured creditors to realize upon or otherwise deal with their securities.\nIn short, in my view, I respectfully submit that the only ground which can, at all plausibly, be presented (and that only at first blush) in support of the said staying order, is the distinction which the learned judge makes between the classes of securities business men had long been accustomed to refer to as such and those furnished by the respective statutes of the several provinces in favour of those doing work or supplying material for the purpose of improving the value of the debtor's property.\nWhy in reason and common sense those doing so should be excluded from the benefits given other classes of securities passes my understanding. They contract with the supposed owner of land on the faith of the legislation which aims at giving them a lien thereon, to the extent by which they thereby add to its value. And surely they are quite as worthy and in need of protection as a mortgagee or other creditor of that kind. All they get back in way of security is that which they gave on faith of being secured to the extent in value which the debtor got. They may have given much more but only get secured to the extent by which the debtor is enriched and his unsecured creditors suffer nothing of which they have a right to complain.\nBut this need not be elaborated for I submit that the express language of section 2, subsection (gg) of the Bankruptcy Act, which reads as follows: \"Secured creditor\" means a person holding a mortgage, hypothec, pledge, charge, lien or privilege on or against the property of the debtor, or any part thereof, as security for a debt due or accruing due to him from the debtor\nseems to answer the distinction made and all implied therein.\nClearly it is for the class of unsecured creditors, who are all on the same footing and by this legislation are given an opportunity of coercing a small minority of that class, and no other, to do what the majority may deem advisable in the interest of the entire class.\nThe scope of such legislation and its obvious purpose is what ought to be looked at and govern us, instead of ignoring all that by following methods akin to splitting hairs and guessing at the possible meaning of certain words and thereby doing a palpable injustice.\nWhy should those who chose to deal blindly, without security, be entitled to use the property of others to recover something for themselves?\nAnd, above all, why should they be permitted to impair and possibly destroy that property of others?\nThat given as security is pro tanto the property of others than the debtor or his unsecured creditors.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014In the fall of 1921 the appellant company became financially embarrassed; and on the 11th October of the same year the company requested Mr. Scott, an authorized trustee in bankruptcy, to call a meeting of its creditors to enable it to submit a proposal for an extension of credit, the proposal being that credit should be extended up to the 19th of November, 1922.\nThere was accordingly on the 17th of November, 1921, a meeting of the unsecured creditors of the appellant sufficient in number and as to the amount of their claims to satisfy the conditions of section 13 of the Bankruptcy Act, which accepted the proposal. On the 5th December, 1921, approval was given by a judgment of the Judge in Bankruptcy to this proposal.\nIt was before the year 1921 that the respondent company entered into its contract with the appellant company out of which the respondent company's claim arises. By that contract the respondent company undertook to construct works of a permanent nature on property belonging to the appellant company in the province of Quebec. Prior to the proceedings above mentioned the appellant under acticle 2013 (f) C.C. caused to be registered a statement by which it claimed a privilege upon the property in respect of the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, the contract price. Due notice of this claim having been given, an action was commenced within the period prescribed by the code against the appellant company, praying a condemnation in respect of the personal obligation of the company and a declaration of the validity of its privilege as registered and of its right to be paid by preference the amount of its judgment out of the sale of the property. The respondent company having disputed the appellant company's claim by its pleadings, the action was set down for trial on the 9th of February, 1922.\nOn the 31st January, 1922, the appellant company petitioned the court in bankruptcy asking for a stay of proceedings in this action until the 19th November, 1922; on the 2nd February of the same year the Judge in Bankruptcy granted the stay.\nOn appeal this order was set aside and the appellant company by leave given under the Bankruptcy Act now appeals to this court. There are two questions. The first of these in their natural order is whether the respondent company is a secured creditor within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. This is contested by the appellant company. It is not denied however that the respondent company would be entitled in liquidation proceedings to a preference out of the property of the company over and above creditors possessing no such security as that which the respondent company possesses, the argument presented on behalf of the appellant company being that the respondent company, while entitled to priority over the general body of creditors possessing neither security nor privilege in the distribution of the proceeds of liquidation, is not within the scope of the provisions of the Act giving special rights and a special status to creditors described as \"secured\" creditors but that its right is strictly limited to the right of preferential payment conceded. I may say at once that I am unable to accept this view for a number of reasons.\nFirst of all the rights of the appellant company under article 2013 C.C. and the subparagraphs of that article are rights which appear clearly enough to constitute a security within the ordinary meaning of the word. It is true that for the purpose of realizing this security the respondent company must first obtain judgment against the appellant company in respect of the appellant company's personal obligation to pay, but having done that it is entitled to bring the property subject to the privilege to sale and to rank upon the proceeds of the sale in priority over other claimants to the extent, at all events, to which the value of the property has been enhanced by the execution of the works giving rise to the obligation. Such rights, I repeat, seem to me to constitute a security and a creditor possessing such rights is, I think, in the ordinary meaning of the words a secured creditor. Then if we look at the definition of secured creditor, which is to be found in s. 2, s.s. (gg), we find that \"secured creditor\" is defined as meaning a person holding any of a number of things, among which is a\nprivilege on or against the property of the debtor or any part thereof\nas \"security for\" his debt. I concur with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Greenshields in the court below that \"hypothec\" and \"privilege\" have been brought within the scope of the definition for the purpose of including therein securities characteristic of the law of the province of Quebec; and prima facie at all events it seems to me that privilege in this definition must include every privilege given by the law of Quebec which is of such a character that it can properly be said to be held \"as security for\" a debt.\nThere seems to me to be great force also in Mr. Geoffrion's contention that there is no provision in the Act if the holder of such a privilege be not a \"secured creditor\" for the recognition of the security. Section 51 seems to provide for the distribution of the property of the bankrupt among his creditors pari passu, due provision having been made pursuant to the provisions of the Act for secured creditors. I have not failed to consider and weigh the arguments presented by Mr. Lafleur and Mr. Montgomery based upon the suggestion that a privilege of this character cannot be given effect to in a practical way under the provisions of the Act relating to secured creditors. One must admit that difficulties are likely to arise, but precisely the same difficulties would arise in dealing with a claim under the Mechanics Lien Act in force in the various provinces by which the holder of a mechanic's lien is entitled to priority over a prior mortgagee in respect of the plus value arising from the work or the materials supplied upon which the lien is founded. My conclusion is that on this point the appellants fail.\nThe next question is whether, assuming the respondent company to be a secured creditor within the meaning of the Act in respect of the privilege mentioned, the Judge in Bankruptcy had jurisdiction to make the order which he did make granting a stay of proceedings. The jurisdiction, if it existed, must have arisen from the express provision of s.s. (1) of sec. 13a or from the inherent powers of the Bankruptcy Court. As to s.s. (1) of s. 13a, that subsection appears very clearly (whatever may be said with regard to s. 7) to limit the express authority to grant a stay to the period during which the creditors are considering the proposal \"made or to be made.\" I must say it seems impossible to escape this construction of s.s. (1). At the expiration of that period, that is to say after an order has been made approving the proposal and the acceptance of it, then a stay automatically takes place except in the case of proceedings by secured creditors to assert their rights. Assuming there may be grounds for doubt as to the construction of s. 7, we are not concerned with that section, and I cannot think that any real doubt can exist that the jurisdiction given by s.s. (1) of s. 13a is limited in the manner I have stated.\nThe only remaining point is whether the jurisdiction to make the order can properly be ascribed to the inherent powers of the Bankruptcy Court. I think Mr. Geoffrion's contention on that point is sound, namely, that the Bankruptcy Judge was not professing to exercise any inherent power of the Court of Bankruptcy to control its proceedings but was professing to act under the powers explicitly conferred upon him by the statute, but there is another objection, and although it may be strictly unnecessary to deal with the point, I think it is better to do so. In my opinion the jurisdiction must be taken to be defined by s.s. (1) of s. 13a in respect of the subject matter with which that subsection deals and consequently the Court of Bankruptcy possesses no authority under the circumstances in which the subsection comes into play to grant a stay of proceedings which is not compatible with the exercise by secured creditors of their rights \"to realize or otherwise deal with their securities.\"\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014In this case no receiving order has been pronounced nor has any assignment been made or petition in bankruptcy presented. What has occurred is that the appellant company, desiring to make a proposal to its creditors for an extension of time for payment of its debts, had a meeting of such creditors convened by an authorized trustee; the proposal submitted was accepted by the prescribed majority of the creditors; and on the report of the authorized trustee, the extension so agreed to was approved by the Court in Bankruptcy. All this was done under the authority of s. 13 of the Bankruptcy Act.\nThe respondent is admittedly a privileged creditor under the provisions of articles 2013 C.C. et seq., and is proceeding by action to realize its security. Invoking as the authority for doing so ss. 7, 13 (15) and 13a (2), Mr. Justice Maclennan, sitting as Judge in Bankruptcy, on the application of the appellant made an order staying that action. The Court of King's Bench (Greenshields, Flynn, Tellier and Bernier JJ., Guerin J., dissenting), reversed that order, and from its judgment the present appeal is brought by leave under s. 74 (3) granted by my brother Duff.\nThe staying of proceedings by creditors for the purpose of facilitating, or aiding to make effective, an extension proposed or approved is dealt with specifically by section 13a enacted in 1921 (c. 17, s. 14). I am accordingly of the opinion that, notwithstanding the provisions of ss. 15 of s. 13, s. 7 cannot be invoked to support the order made by the learned Judge in Bankruptcy. Subsection (1) of s. 7 applies only \"after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition,\" and s.s. (2) only \"on the making of a receiving order.\"\nSubsection (1) of s. 13a, as the side note indicates, deals only with the staying of proceedings\npending consideration of proposal of a composition, extension or scheme of arrangement.\nIt provides for the case of intended efforts to effect an extension being imperilled and for a stay until action is taken by the court on the trustee's report. The learned Judge in Bankruptcy evidently realized the inapplicability of this subsection, as he invokes only subsection (2), which applies \"on the making * * * of an order approving a proposal of a composition, extension or scheme of arrangement.\" But ss. (2) does not provide for any action by the Bankruptcy Court. By it such proceedings as fall within its scope are automatically stayed upon the order approving of an extension being made. Moreover, the operation of the subsection is expressly declared to be \"subject to the rights of secured creditors to realize or otherwise deal with their securities.\"\nBy statutory definition, \"a person holding * * * a lien or privilege on or against the property of the debtor, or any part thereof, as security for a debt due or accruing due from the debtor\" is a \"secured creditor.\" The respondent is such a person. I am quite unable to appreciate the grounds on which it sought to restrict the term \"secured creditor\" thus defined to a person holding physical possession of the property which forms his security, or some estate in it, such as the mortgagee under the English system enjoys. The privileged creditor under the law of Quebec occupies much the same position as the lien-holder in the English law. Both are alike covered by the definition. On this aspect of the case I concur in the views expressed by Mr. Justice Greenshields. The respondent, in my opinion, is a \"secured creditor\" within the meaning of that term in ss. (2) of s. 13a of the Bankruptcy Act. On that ground, and also because it does not contemplate a stay by action of the court, that subsection does not support the order of the learned Judge in Bankruptcy.\nBut it is said the court must have inherent discretionary jurisdiction to stay this action. No doubt the Superior Court in which the action was brought has such a discretionary power under some circumstances, but I would question the existence of such inherent power in the Judge in Bankruptcy over the proceedings in any other court, or in the court of which he is a member which for this purpose may be regarded as another court, even if the explicit provisions of the Bankruptcy Act dealing with the subject of staying proceedings do not imply its exclusion. Moreover, no such inherent discretionary jurisdiction was exercised. If it exists for any purpose I am not satisfied that it would justify the making of the order which the appellant seeks against the respondent, who is merely exercising his legal right to realize on his security and is in nowise abusing the process of the court in seeking to enforce that right. The extension was sought on the footing that it should \"not bind or affect secured creditors,\" and the order of approval expressly provides that the extension\nis approved subject to the rights of secured creditors to deal with their securities according to law.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that the judgment appealed from was right and should be maintained.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with my brother Duff.\nMignault J.\u2014The question here is whether the court can stay an action by a creditor of an insolvent debtor who has obtained an extension of time under section 13 and 13a of The Bankruptcy Act, when such creditor asserts a privilege or lien against the whole or part of the debtor's property.\nThe respondent had taken an action against the appellant claiming $100,720.50, and alleging that it was entitled to a builder's privilege on the appellant's mill at Temiskaming, Que., for, we were informed, plumbing work and supplies. The appellant had obtained, under sections 13 and 13a of the Bankruptcy Act, an extension of time from its creditors and on its application the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy (Maclennan J.) stayed the respondent\u2019s action. This judgment was reversed by the Court of King's Bench, Mr. Justice Guerin dissenting, and the appellant now appeals with special leave to this court.\nThe question submitted is a most important one, and if the judgment appealed from is right the respondent's action could not be stayed even if a receiving order or an authorized assignment had been made, the provisions of the Act as to the staying of such an action being practically to the same effect in all these cases.\nIn reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, the Court of King's Bench refused to follow a previous decision of its own court, differently composed, in a case of La Compagnie du Boulevard Pie IX v. Damphousse[1]. Perhaps I may be permitted to say with great respect that the inconvenience of a court thus disregarding its own judgment in a previous case is too obvious for discussion. However, the Damphousse Case (1) is not binding on us and the effect of our judgment, if it be followed as it should be, will be to put an end to any confusion or uncertainty which may arise.\nThe respondent claims to be a \"secured creditor\" under subsection gg of section 2 of the Act which is as follows:\u2014\n(gg) \"secured creditor\" means a person holding a mortgage, hypothec, pledge, charge, lien or privilege on or against the property of the debtor, or any part thereof, as security for a debt due or accruing due to him, from the debtor.\nThe respondent contends that this definition is wide enough to include such a claim as it asserts on the appellant's mill for work done thereon. It has undoubtedly a privilege under Quebec law, but this privilege is only on the increased value given to the property by reason of the work done or materials supplied, to be established after a judicial sale of the property and a relative valuation of the property and the work done (Arts. 2013, 2013b C.C.). To give effect to this privilege the property will have to be sold.\nBefore dealing with the statutory definition of the term \"secured creditor,\" it will be useful to consider several other provisions of the Act.\nTo rank against the estate of an insolvent debtor claims must be proved, hence the term \"provable debts\" which is found in several sections of the Act. The mode of proving debts is described in section 45, and in section 46 there are elaborate provisions as to the proof of debts and valuation of securities by secured creditors. Briefly, the secured creditor may realize his security and prove for the balance due him, or he may surrender his security and prove for his whole debt, or he may in a statutory declaration place a value on his security, and the trustee then can redeem the security at its assessed value or require that the property comprised in the security be sold. The creditor may require the trustee to elect whether he will redeem the security or require it to be realized, failing which the equity of redemption or any other interest in the property comprised in the security vests in the creditor and his debt is reduced by the amount at which the security was valued. When the secured creditor does not comply with section 46, he is excluded from all share in any dividend.\nSection 51 deals with the priority of claims on the estate, the general order being: 1, the fees and expenses of the trustee; 2, the costs of the execution creditor, including sheriffs fees and disbursements; 3, wages, salaries, commissions or compensation of clerks, servants, travelling salesmen, labourers or workmen. Debts proved in bankruptcy or under any assignment are paid pari passu. Section 52 states that the right of the landlord to distrain or realize his rent shall cease after the receiving order or assignment, but the landlord has the right to be paid by preference an amount not exceeding the value of the distrainable assets and not exceeding three months' rent. I may add that, for the purpose of voting at meetings of creditors, a secured creditor, unless he surrenders his security, must state in his proof the particulars of his security, its date and its value, and can vote only in respect of the balance due him. He is not entitled to vote until he has proved his claim and valued his security (section 42).\nWe now come to sections 6 and 7, dealing with the effect of a receiving order, which are important in connection with the question at issue. Section 6, subsection 1, states that on the making of a receiving order the trustee is constituted receiver of the property of the debtor, and thereafter, except as directed by the Act, no creditor to whom the debtor is indebted in respect of a debt provable in bankruptcy has any remedy against the property and person of the debtor in respect of the debt, or shall commence any action or other legal proceeding without leave of the court. It adds this proviso:\u2014\nBut this section shall not affect the power of any secured creditor to realize or otherwise deal with his security in the same manner as he would have been entitled to realize or deal with it if this section had not been passed.\nSection 7 enacts that the court may, after presentation of a bankruptcy petition against a debtor, order that any action, execution or other proceeding against the person or property of the debtor, pending in any court other than the court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy, shall stand stayed until the last mentioned court shall otherwise order; and the court in which any such proceedings are pending may likewise, on proof that a bankruptcy petition has been presented against the debtor, stay such proceedings until the first mentioned court shall otherwise order.\nSubsection 2 of section 7 is as follows:\u2014\n(2) On the making of a receiving order, every such action, execution or other proceeding for the recovery of a debt provable in bankruptcy shall, subject to the provisions of the next preceding section as to the rights of secured creditors, stand stayed unless and until the court shall, on such terms as it may think just, otherwise order.\nSections 9 and 10 deal with the authorized assignment, the latter section stating that its effect is to vest in the trustee, subject to the rights of secured creditors, all the property of the assignor at the time of the assignment.\nSection 11 contains general provisions relating to receiving orders and authorized assignments and directs (subsection 1) that they shall take precedence over,\n(a) all attachments of debts by way of garnishment, unless the debt has been actually paid over; and\n(b) all other attachments, executions or other process against property, except such thereof as having been completely executed by payment to the execution or other creditor, and except also the rights of a secured creditor under section six of this Act.\n(This last exception was added by the 1921 amendment.) I may note briefly that subsection 3 of section 11 directs the sheriff or other officer of the court having seized property of the debtor under execution, attachment or other process, upon receiving a copy of an assignment or receiving order, to forthwith deliver to the trustee all the property of the execution debtor in his hands, upon payment of his fees and charges and the costs of the execution creditor. And subsection 10 states that after its registration the receiving order or the assignment shall have precedence over all certificates of judgment, judgments operating as hypothecs, executions and attachments against land, within the registration office or district or county, subject to a lien for the costs of registration and sheriff's fees.\nSection 13 deals with compositions, extensions of time and schemes of arrangement of the insolvent debtor's affairs, which when approved by the court are binding on all the creditors. Section 13a is important in view of this controversy, but is very unskilfully drafted. I will cite it in full:\u2014\n13a. (1) The court, at any time after a debtor has required an authorized trustee to convene a meeting of creditors to consider a proposal of a composition, extension or scheme of arrangement, may, on the ex parte application of the trustee and his affidavit disclosing the circumstances and stating his belief that the success of the intended efforts to bring into effect a composition, extension of time for payment, or scheme of arrangement of the debtor's affairs and obligations will be imperilled unless, pending consideration by the creditors of the proposal made or to be made the existing conditions as to litigation of claims against the debtor is preserved, order that any action, execution or other proceeding against the person or property of the debtor pending in any court other than the court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy shall stand stayed until the last-mentioned court, upon or before report made of the result of the dealings between the debtor and his creditors, shall otherwise order, whereupon such action, execution or other proceeding shall stand stayed accordingly; and the court in which any such proceedings are pending may likewise, on like application and proof, stay such proceedings until the court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy shall otherwise order.\n(2) On the making of an authorized assignment or an order approving a proposal of a composition, extension or scheme of arrangement every such action, execution or other proceeding for the recovery of a debt provable in authorized assignment or composition, extension or scheme of arrangement, proceedings under this Act shall, subject to the rights of secured creditors to realize or otherwise deal with their securities stand stayed unless and until the court shall, on such terms as it may think just, otherwise order. The reservation in subsection 2 of section 13a is practically in the same terms, as to the right or power of secured creditors to realize or otherwise deal with their securities, as the proviso of section 6, subsection 1.\nComing back now to the definition of \"secured creditor\" in section 2, subsection gg, it is certainly wide enough to comprise a builder who, under articles 2013 and 2013f C.C., has acquired, and has taken an action to enforce, a privilege on the immovable on which he performed work. The taking of such an action within six months is necessary for the preservation of the privilege.\nThe respondent being therefore a \"secured creditor,\" can his action be stayed?\nThe general scheme of the Bankruptcy Act appears to be that secured creditors are considered as creditors of the insolvent debtor, for all purposes such as proving claims, voting at meetings of creditors and receiving dividends, only after deducting the value of their security. They may keep their security and remain entirely outside the bankruptcy proceedings. Under section 46 they may surrender their security and prove their debt for the whole, or realize it and prove for the balance, if any, of their debt; they have the further option of valuing their security which the trustee may redeem at its valuation or require it to be offered for sale, and the secured creditors rank only for the balance. Where they have done none of these things they are excluded from all share in any dividend. The case of the landlord is a special one and is dealt with in section 52.\nWhile there may no doubt be difficulties caused by some provisions of the Act such as the offering for sale, under section 46, of a privilege like that asserted by the respondent, I think that it follows, from what I have described as the general scheme of the Act, that the secured creditor (I do not refer to the landlord) should not be impeded in his attempt to realize his security. Our Act appears even more emphatic in this respect than the English Act, for while the proviso of section 6 copies verbatim subsection 2 of section 7 of the latter Act, subsection 2 of section 7 of the Canadian Act is not found in section 9 of the English Act, and sections 13 and 13a of our Act are not in the English Bankruptcy Act, nor in the English Deeds of Arrangement Act, 1914.\nIt may be that by asserting certain general privileges under the Quebec law, which apply to the whole of the personal or real property of the debtor (arts. 1993, 1994, 2009 C.C.), creditors may cause some embarrassment in the administration of the Bankruptcy law, but these privileges are generally for small amounts and could be redeemed by the trustee. And, if necessary, Parliament can provide for the difficulty by an amendment of the Act.\nI would therefore not disturb the judgment appealed from and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lafleur, Macdougall, Macfarlane & Barclay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: De Witt & Howard.\n[1] 67 D.L.R. 385.\n"}

Malcolm Mackay Company (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe British America Assurance Company (Defendant) Respondent.\n1923: March 6, 7; 1923: April 3.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Bordeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPEAL DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK\nInsurance, fire\u2014Lumber\u2014Statutory conditions\u2014Variation\u2014condition or description\u2014Inspection of lumber\u2014Knowledge of insurer\u2014Estoppel.\nA policy insuring lumber against loss or damage by fire contained the following clause: \"Warranted by the insured that a clear space of 300 feet shall be maintained between the property hereby insured and any standing wood, brush or forest and any sawmill or other special hazard.\"\nHeld, that this clause was not merely descriptive of the property but was a condition of the contract of insurance and void as not being in the form required for an addition to, or variation of, the statutory conditions contained in the Fire Insurance Policies Act of New Brunswick (3 Geo. V, ch. 26.) Curtis's & Harvey v. North British and Mercantile Ins. Co. ([1921] 1 A.C. 303), and Guimond v. Fidelity-Phenix (47 Can. S.C.R. 216) dist.\nPrior to the issue of the policy an expert in that class of insurance in the insurer's employ examined the lumber and the locality in which it was piled and reported to the insurer that none of it was within 300 feet of standing wood, brush or forest. On the trial of the action on the policy the jury found that some of it was within that distance at the time of the inspection but none was so placed afterwards.\nHeld, that the policy was issued and accepted in the belief that the inspection truly represented the fact and the insurer was estopped from maintaining the contrary.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment on the trial in favour of the defendants.\nTwo questions for decision were presented on the appeal. The first was whether the clause in the policy set out in the head-note was a condition or merely descriptive of the property. The other depended on the following? facts.\nNo written application for the policy was presented. The insured applied to the head agents in St. John, who sent one Heine, considered an expert, to view the property. Heine reported to his employer that he had paced the distance between the lumber to be insured and the nearest woods and found it to be more than 300 feet; that some brush between the lumber and the woods had been burnt over and was not dangerous; and recommended the risk to the company. On the trial of the action the jury found that when Heine saw it the lumber was less than 300 feet from the brush and none had been placed within that distance after the inspection.\nThe Appeal Division held that the clause respecting the position of the lumber was not a condition and that the insurer could rely on the jury's findings as to such position. The second question was, therefore: Was the defendant estopped from claiming that there was a breach of the warranty?\nBaxter K.C. and F. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant. The clause warranting the continuance of the position of the lumber is a condition and void for want of proper form. See Wanless v. Lancashire Ins. Co.[1]. The Curtis's & Harvey Co. v. North British and Mercantile Ins. Co.[2] is clearly distinguishable.\nThe defendant company is affected with the knowledge and bound by the acts of its agent Heine. City of London Fire Ins. Co. v. Smith[3]. We rely on the rule laid down in Carr v. London and North Western Ry. Co.[4].\nTeed K.C. for the respondent. The warranty clause is not a condition but a description of the nature of the risk. See Great Northern Co. v. Alliance Ins. Co.[5].\nAs to estoppel see Guimond v. Fidelity Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co.[6], Lockharts v. Bernard Rosen & Co.[7].\nBaxter K.C. and F. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nTeed K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant brought this action against the respondent upon two policies of insurance dated 11th April, 1921, and on lumber piled at Burton, Sunbury County, New Brunswick.\nThe E. C. Atkinson Lumber Company having cut said lumber off lands owned by its said co-appellant which had also made advances to said operator the loss, if any, was made payable to said company so advancing.\nThe Atkinson Company carried on its business at Frederickton, N.B., and applied to an insurance agent there for the needed insurance but he was not able to fix the rate or rates of premium at the place where the lumber was piled; he, therefore, turned the business over to the general agents of the respondent at St. John, N.B. They in turn sent R. W. Heine, a regular salaried man engaged to see after their outside work, to inspect the risk and fix the premium to be paid. He did so and upon his report the respondent through its said general agents determined the whole business, issued the policies and were paid the rates so fixed.\nThe lumber having been consumed by fire in the following July the respondent on notice and inspection by someone else, set up as a pretext for non-payment, that in and by a term of each of the said policies the assured had warranted a clear space of 300 feet between the property so insured and any standing wood, brush or forest, etc.\nThe appellant, therefore, brought this action which was tried with a jury to whom were submitted several questions answered by them.\nThe learned trial judge thereupon directed a judgment to be entered dismissing said action. From that judgment an appeal was taken to the Appeal Division for New Brunswick and that court dismissed the said appeal.\nOf the several questions raised herein, the most important, in a general sense, is that which must turn upon the determination of whether or not the warranty above referred to was in law a condition which is required by the New Brunswick Fire Insurance Policies Act, 3 Geo. V, c. 26, to conform therewith. By section 3 thereof conditions set forth in the first schedule to the Act are made part of every contract of fire insurance, and required to\nbe printed on every such policy with the heading \"Statutory Conditions\" and no stipulation to the contrary, or providing for any variation, addition or omission, shall be binding on the assured, unless evidenced in the manner prescribed in this Act in that behalf.\nThat is followed by section 4, reading as follows:\u2014\n4. If the insurer desires to vary the said conditions or to omit any of them, or to add new conditions, there shall be added on the instrument of contract containing the printed statutory conditions, words to the effect set out in the second schedule, printed in conspicuous type, and in ink of a different colour, and with the heading, \"Variations in Conditions\";\nand section 5, reading as follows:\u2014\n5. No such variation, addition or omission shall, unless the same is distinctly indicated and set forth in the manner hereinbefore mentioned or to the like effect, be valid and binding on the assured ; and no questions shall be considered as to whether any such variation, addition or omission is, under the circumstances, just and reasonable; but on the contrary the policy shall, as against the insurer, be subject to the statutory conditions only, unless the variations, additions or omissions are distinctly indicated and set forth in the manner or to the effect aforesaid; provided, it shall be optional with the insurers to pay or allow claims which are void under the third, the fifth, or ninth statutory conditions, in case the said insurers think fit to waive the objections mentioned in the said conditions.\nThe warranty in question seems to have varied in one of the policies by reason of something which transpired between their date of 11th April, 1921, and the 1st June, 1921.\nThere was no stress laid in argument by either side on that circumstance.\nI therefore assume that the form of the condition now in question reads as it seems from the beginning to have read in policy no. 33704, and is as follows:\u2014\nWarranted by the assured that a continuous clear space of 300 feet shall hereafter be maintained between the property hereby insured and any standing wood, brush or forest and any saw-mill or other special hazard.\nwhich raises the next question argued as to its being a condition within the meaning of the said above quoted sections of the Act, and applies to both, policies though the word \"hereafter\" does not appear in the amended form of the other policy.\nThe Appeal Division below held that the said warranty was merely descriptive of the risk or, as it is put by the judgment of Mr. Justice Barry, speaking for that court, \"to speak more accurately descriptive of the location of the risk\" and hence not a condition within the meaning of the above quoted sections of the Act requiring such condition to be set forth in accordance therewith.\nThere is no pretence that if it is to be treated as such a condition that said requirements were complied with.\nIn the argument before us the case of The London Assurance Co. v. The Great Northern Transit Co.[8], was relied upon by respondent's counsel as maintaining the ground taken below as to the warranty being merely descriptive of the risk.\nI cannot see much resemblance between what was involved in that case and is in this.\nThat decision, of course, in a case exactly like what was presented therein, must bind us, but, I submit, is not to be extended to, or cover, what in fact seems to be a condition within the meaning of the sections now in question; nor are we bound by the mere dicta assigned as reasons, or beyond the exact point decided.\nIn that case judicial opinion seems to have been much divided in the Ontario courts. The learned trial judge (the late Mr. Justice Armour) seems to have held in favour of the plaintiff, and the Court of Appeal seems to have been equally divided.\nOf those in said Court of Appeal holding with the insurance company's contention, the late Chief Justice Burton spoke as follows:\u2014\nBut it is said that the clause \"whilst running on the inland lakes rivers and canals during the season of navigation,\" if of any force in limiting or restricting the general nature of the insurance, is of force only as a condition in respect of the user of the vessel, and is not binding, not having been indorsed upon the policy in compliance with the provisions of the Ontario Insurance Act, as being a variation of, or an addition to, the statutory conditions. I am unable to agree in that contention. I could well understand that if this had been an insurance on this vessel or on a house generally, and the insurers had afterwards relied on a condition to the effect that if the house should be unoccupied or vacant for a certain number of days the risk should cease, that being a variation of the statutory conditions could not be resorted to unless the requirements of the statute had been complied with. But that is not this case; the policy describes and defines accurately and distinctly the precise risk they are willing to undertake, and the locality and user or occupation of the vessel form part of the definition of this risk ; it is not the insurance of the vessel generally for a certain time, but it is for the insurance of her so long as she remains in a certain locality, and so long as during the summer she was in actual service and during the winter was tied up in a place of safety. The existence of these things formed part of the risk and was a condition precedent to the risk attaching or any liability on the part of the insurers.\nThe distinction that the learned judge so made applies here, I submit, and in effect presents us with a view of the case in hand as being almost identical in principle with what we have to deal with.\nI adopt that as distinguishing that case from this. Moreover there are a number of the statutory conditions such as appear in the 10th and 11th numbers thereof, which, to my mind, are very illuminative of the principles governing the action of the legislature in imposing these conditions as part of every fire insurance contract.\nFrom these I submit we must be guided as to the nature of the conditions which are to fall within the variations or additions or omissions which an insurance company is imperatively required to set forth as prescribed and in default are to be held null and void.\nClearly it is the measure of the hazard which is involved that must determine whether or not anything touching that can be by the insurer imposed unless by adopting the prescribed mode of doing so.\nCuriously enough the respondent by the adoption of its third variation in conditions, which reads as follows\n3. If any building herein described be or become vacant or unoccupied, and so remain for the space of thirty consecutive days, or being a manufactory, shall cease to be operated for that length of time, this policy shall be void, unless notice of such vacancy or non-occupation has been given to the insurer, and such vacancy or non-occupation has been consented to in writing by the insurer,\nseems to have observed that principle.\nI cannot, in principle, distinguish between the increase of hazard involved in these changes in mode of use or condition and thus provided for, and that provided for by the warranty in question herein. Nor can I do so as between either and any of the tenth and eleventh of the statutory conditions.\nIf respondent succeed in imposing such a warranty as in question herein without observing the statutory requirements for validating it, I submit it will have gone a long way towards repealing what has proved to be a most excellent piece of Ontario legislation whi\u20ach was the work of a highly qualified commission intended and destined to put the insurance business on a higher level of honest dealing than it had been some years previously to its adoption by the Ontario legislature where it originated.\nIndeed, I am forcibly reminded, by the respondent's contention herein of the undesirable conditions of the fire insurance business and its prolific source of litigation in that province for many years prior to said enactment. Turning to the continuation of the story of how this insurance here in question was brought about, the Mr. Heine, who inspected and reported as above related, in his evidence tells us that on that occasion he had not trusted to memory of what respondent required in such cases, but read from a book he had with him and measured accordingly by pacing from where part of the lumber to be insured was piled to the nearest trees or bushes, and found they were three hundred feet from the lumber then piled by appellant, the E. C. Atkinson Lumber Company.\nThe jury, however, on the evidence of other witnesses, found that of the lumber so piled some was within three hundred feet of standing wood, brush or forest.\nThe jury also found that none of it was so placed within three hundred feet of any standing wood, brush or forest after the said inspection by Heine, upon which, and his report thereof, the rate of insurance was fixed and the policies were issued accordingly to appellants.\nNo application in writing was made by the appellants or either of them.\nThey acted in paying the rates demanded upon such basis as was solely fixed by respondent or its general agents, and accepted the policies proffered in accordance therewith and pursuant thereto.\nThe explanation of the difference between Heine's finding and that of other witnesses would seem to be that the alleged wood or forest had in a previous year been overrun by fire and so burnt over that for at least the distance he paced, what remained after said fire could no longer be properly considered as a fire hazard within said warranty.\nNo one seems to impute dishonesty to Heine. At best he would, from respondent's point of view, seem to have made an error of judgment. It is, I submit, easy to conceive how different minds under such circumstances might arrive at a different judgment as to where the line ought to be drawn in such a case.\nThese facts supply additional strength to the argument in favour of the appellant's contention that the warranty in question should be held to be a condition within the meaning of the said section above cited of the statute requiring it to be set forth as a variation, addition or omission, in the manner prescribed and, default that having been done, treated as null.\nNeither the case above cited nor the case of Curtis's & Harvey, Limited, v. North British & Mercantile Ins. Co.[9], when closely examined, seems to me to help any one in this case. The facts there in question are entirely different from those here in question.\nI am so decidedly of the opinion, upon all the foregoing considerations, that this appeal should be allowed that I do not feel disposed to enter elaborately into the other grounds referred to in the course of the argument.\nThe case of Guimond v. Fidelity-Phenix Ins. Co.[10], so much relied upon below and cited here, does not seem to me worthy of much consideration herein. It was decided before the New Brunswick Legislature had passed the Act above referred to and as I thought, in course of taking part in deciding it, raised only one point necessary for consideration and that did not suggest any possibility of making its decision turn upon any such considerations as are arguable herein.\nThe appellants' counsel in argument stoutly contended that the policies sued upon were not only as usual liable to the application of the doctrine of contra proferentem but also under the peculiar circumstances above related so directly the product of its own efforts to induce through its agents the appellants to accept same, that the respondent is estopped from setting up the final determination of fact which in truth had nothing to do with the fire or the cause thereof and at best was a mere technical defence of which it in the last analysis was the sole creator.\nThe case of Carr v. London & South Western Ry. Co.[11] is relied upon by appellants' counsel as presenting, by Brett J., a correct statement of the doctrine of estoppel in the following quotation:\u2014\nAnd another proposition is that if a man, whatever his real meaning may be, so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take his conduct to mean a certain representation of facts, and that it was a true representation, and that the latter was intended to act upon it in a particular way, and he with such belief does act in that way to his damage the first is estopped from denying that the facts were as represented. And as to the misdescription they rely upon In re Universal Non-Tariff Fire Ins. Co.[12], which I am inclined to think is with numerous other cases cited in line therewith as to the relation of the party in question acting and causing the error being so far an agent of the company as to bind it under the peculiar circumstances and at all events estop it from setting up such error.\nI incline to think the appellants are entitled to succeed on one or other of those aspects of the case as well as the chief ground above dealt with as against the pretensions of respondent.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and direct judgment to be entered for the amount of damages assessed at $5,361.71 as of the date of the trial with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014Ss. 4 and 5 of the Fire Insurance Policies Act, New Brunswick (3 Geo. V, ch. 26), are in the following words:\u2014\n4. If the insurer desires to vary the said conditions or to omit any of them, or to add new conditions, there shall be added on the instrument of contract containing the printed statutory conditions, words to the effect set out in the second schedule, printed in conspicuous type, and in ink of a different colour, and with the heading, \"Variations in Conditions.\"\n5. No such variation, addition or omission shall, unless the same is distinctly indicated and set forth in the manner hereinbefore mentioned or to the like effect, be valid and binding on the assured.\nThe policies sued upon contain a clause requiring the maintenance of a space of 300 feet between the lumber insured and any standing wood, brush or forest. In policy no. 33704 the clause is as follows:\u2014\nWarranted by the assured that a clear space of 300 feet shall be maintained between the property hereby insured and any standing wood, brush or forest and any saw-mill or other special hazard.\nIn policy no. 33705 the word \"hereafter\" is found between \"shall\" and \"be\". In other respects the two clauses do not materially differ.\nIt does not seem to admit of a doubt that if this clause is a \"condition\" within the meaning of ss. 4 and 5, then the insertion of it is an attempt to add a \"new\" condition or to vary a statutory condition within the meaning of that section and consequently not \"binding upon the assured\" and not \"valid\", because it is not set out in the manner prescribed by the statute. It is convenient first to discuss the effect of the clause. The property insured is described as \"lumber, piled and lying along the line of the Canadian National Railway at Burton, Sunbury County, New Brunswick.\" The description embraces, I think, any lumber of the insured company so situated, and the clause in question cannot, I think, be read as importing merely a qualification of this description. I think it is a warranty against the presence of any of the lumber of the insured company within the prohibited space.\nThe warranty literally read seems to come into operation concurrently with the conclusion of the contract. There is an obvious difference between a warranty as to the existence of a state of facts, upon the faith of which a contract is concluded, and a warranty that such a state of facts shall exist from and after the conclusion of the contract. Here the meaning is that from the moment the contract is concluded the \"clear space of 300 feet\" shall be maintained. Such a clause introduced by the word \"warranted,\" is in the nature of a condition precedent of the company's liability, as has been decided in numerous cases. (Newcastle Fire Ins. Co. v. Macmorran[13]; Barnard v. Faber[14]; Ellinger v. Mutual Life Ins. Co.[15] ; Cantors v. Union Marine Ins. Co.[16]).\nThe warranty is therefore strictly a condition falling, prima facie, within the provisions of ss. 4 and 5 of the statute as being either an attempt to vary one of the statutory conditions or an attempt to add a \"new\" condition.\nThe circumstances of the case are clearly distinguishable from those of the case of Curtis & Harvey, which Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee had before them in 1921. (Curtis's & Harvey, Limited v. North British & Mercantile Ins. Co.[17]). That was a case which arose out of a claim made under a policy of insurance which, on the face of it, was an insurance against fire, but which contained two clauses dealing with the subject of the perils insured against. One was clause 11, a statutory condition, providing that the company should not be liable for explosions of any kind unless fire should ensue, and then for loss or damage by fire only; and the other a clause in these words: \"Warranted free of claim for loss or damage caused by explosion of any of the materials used on the premises.\" The Supreme Court of Canada had in Hobbs v. Guardian Fire and Life Ins. Co.[18] held that clause 11 did apply to explosions resulting from fire; in other words that, notwithstanding clause 11, the policy was a policy of insurance against loss caused by fire, including loss resulting from explosions due to fire. Their Lordships held that the warranty clause had, according to its terms, the effect of excluding explosions from the perils insured against, and Lord Dunedin, in delivering the judgment of Their Lordships at page 312, said that\nany other stipulation or covenant which may define or limit the risk can also receive effect in so far as it does not contradict the statutory conditions, which are paramount.\nIt must be remembered that Their Lordships were dealing with a clause defining and limiting the risk in the sense of limiting the perils insured against. One of the so-called conditions of the policy dealt with this same subject, and in so far as the clause was a variation of the condition (that is in so far as it dealt with explosions resulting from fire) the statute applied. In so far as it was not a variation of the condition but an independent stipulation defining and limiting the risk in that sense (that is in so far as it related to explosions not arising from fire) it was treated by Their Lordships as valid, obviously because it was not a \"condition\" to which the statute applied.\nThe clause now before us does not define or limit the risk in the view I take of it either as being merely a description of the property insured or in the sense of defining or limiting the perils insured against, as in the case of Curtis & Harvey. Strictly limiting its legal effect to the scope of its terms, it is not, in my judgment, other than a \"condition\" within the meaning of the statute.\nThe respondent company argues, however, that the warranty, and especially by force of the word \"maintained\" implies the affirmation of an existing state of facts corresponding to the state of facts warranted. It is clear enough, of course, that strict and literal compliance with the warranty would in a practical sense be impossible unless the state of facts which the policy warrants shall be maintained was in existence at the moment the policy came into force. But it does not follow at all, I think, that an affirmation of the existence of this state of facts as the basis of the contract is included within the scope of the warranty as defined by the terms in which it is expressed. To the argument that it is implied, there are, I think, two answers: First, if I am right in my conclusion that the condition imported by the warranty as expressed is inoperative by force of the provisions of the statute, then I do not think that you can consistently with the statute imply from it a condition or a term not expressed even though such an implication might be found there if the clause were truly a part of the contract.\nIn the next place, as I have already intimated, assuming the warranty by its express terms involved an affirmation as to the existing state of facts, it would still be something more than a description of the property and would import a condition precedent of the company's liability\u2014a \"condition\" to which the statute would apply.\nThere is another point. The policy on the contention raised by the respondent company, which succeeded in the courts below (as to the effect of the words \"standing wood, brush or forest\") was sterile from the commencement. The respondent company, through Heine, their agent, had full knowledge of the actual facts, and the acceptance of the construction of the words mentioned now advanced by them necessarily involves the proposition that they received a premium for and delivered a policy to the insured which, constructively at all events, they knew to be inoperative. It is impossible, I think, to ascribe to the parties an intention to deliver and to accept an inoperative policy, and I think it is a very arguable proposition that the case can be brought within the principle laid down in \"The Moorcock\"[19]; Hamlyn v. Wood[20]; and by Lord Watson in Dahl v. Nelson[21]. Certainly if the matter had been mentioned it is impossible to suppose the parties subscribing to a contract which in the existing state of facts which the parties contemplated as continuing to exist could impose no liability on the company, and I think, as I say, it could be argued with a great deal of force that a term should be implied by which the words mentioned should be read as excluding anything found within 300 feet of the lumber as situated at the time of Heine's inspection. Moreover, the respondent company\u2014being as to this matter spondentes peritiam artis\u2014were fully aware, through Heine, that the Atkinson company believed, as a consequence of Heine's conduct, the facts as they existed to constitute a sufficient compliance with the warranty as understood by the respondent company. It is open to question, I think, whether the respondent company is at liberty now to put forward another construction of the warranty with the effect of obliterating the only consideration which the insured company was receiving for the premium it paid.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiffs sue upon two policies to recover insurance for a quantity of lumber destroyed by fire. The sole defence to the claim is non-fulfilment of the following term of the policies:\u2014\nWarranted by the assured that a continuous clear space of 300 feet shall (hereafter) be maintained between the lumber hereby insured and any standing wood, brush or forest or any saw-mill or other special hazard.\nThis clause is found in a typewritten slip attached to each of the two policies, so placed that it is separated from the description of the property insured and of its location by intervening provisions. The word \"hereafter\" is omitted from one of the clauses. There is no suggestion of proximity to a saw-mill or special hazard other than standing wood, brush or forest.\nThe action was tried with a jury, which found that at the time of the fire and at the date of an inspection by one Heine, a salaried representative of the general agents of the defendant company, made immediately before the risk was taken, the lumber or some of it was within 300 feet of standing wood, brush or forest and that none of it had been so placed after the agent's inspection. These findings of fact are accepted. The material circumstances of the application for the insurance and of the inspection of the risk by Heine are stated by Mr. Justice Barry, who delivered the decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick confirming the judgment of the trial judge (Chandler J.), dismissing the action. The appellants have expressly accepted that statement of fact as accurate, and the respondent does not seriously challenge it. Its correctness should, I think, be assumed.\nIt is quite clear that when Heine visited Burton Station to inspect the risk he had abundant opportunity of ascertaining the precise surroundings of the lumber then piled and that he was fully satisfied that every part of it was more than 300 feet from the nearest standing wood, brush or forest. He so reported to the respondent company by letter, and highly recommended the risk. There is no suggestion of collusion between Heine and the assured or of any lack of good faith on the part of either. If the finding of the jury is right, as must now be assumed, Heine simply made a mistake, probably in his appreciation of a bush hazard. The insurer in issuing and the insured in accepting the policies both proceeded on the assumption that the surroundings of the lumber at that time were in fact as they appeared to, and were reported by, Heine, whose business it was to inspect proposed risks for the purpose of passing upon their desirability for, and fixing the rates to be charged for them by, the companies represented by his employers as general agents.\nFor the appellants it is contended that the clauses invoked against them are indirect attempts to add a condition to the terms of the policies and, as such, ineffectual for non-compliance with the requirement as to form prescribed for variations of, or additions to, the statutory conditions by the New Brunswick Insurance Act (3 Geo. V, c. 26) ; for the respondent it is urged that the clauses in question are descriptive or limitative of the risk assumed and not within the purview of the statutory provisions dealing with variations of, or additions to, statutory conditions. If so, urge the appellants, the respondent is estopped by what took place in regard to, and consequent upon, the inspection by Heine from relying upon the facts found by the jury as a defence.\nI find difficulty in regarding a provision warranting that a certain state of affairs, impliedly existing, \"shall be maintained\" as merely descriptive. The word \"warranty\" followed by the verb in the future tense seems inapt to express description of a risk presently assumed. While the present existence of the conditions to be maintained is no doubt implied, in the sense that unless they exist the warranty is incapable of literal fulfilment, there is no contractual guarantee of their present existence. It therefore seems more in accord with the language used to treat the warranty as affecting only the state of affairs to be maintained during the future continuance of the risk. So viewed it seems to me to be not descriptive, but in reality to import a condition that the assured shall so keep the insured lumber that no part of it will in the future and during the continuance of the risk, be within 300 feet of any standing wood, brush or forest.\nOn the other hand if, notwithstanding the use of the future tense, the clause is in se susceptible of a construction importing a guarantee of the present existence of the state of affairs warranted, as well as its continuance during the term of the policies, I should regard it as so equivocal that resort can properly be had to evidence of the circumstances under which the policies were issued to aid in determining the sense in which it should be taken to have been intended. To these circumstances I have already sufficiently adverted. Of the existing situs of the lumber and its surroundings the insurance company must be deemed, as between it and the insured, to have had, through Heine, full notice. Bawden v. London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Ins Co.[22]; Holdsworth v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Ins. Co.[23]. Heine, representing the general agents, was satisfied from his inspection that, if the conditions existing when the policies issued should be maintained, the warranty would be fulfilled. The application for the insurance proceeded on that footing. No guarantee as to the present existence of such condition was therefore required, and the insured had no reason to expect that it would be asked. Only a warranty against altering existing conditions so as to impinge upon the 300 feet clear space would be looked for. The bringing into the Burton Station piling ground of other lumber then piled elsewhere was immediately contemplated. Hence the importance of stipulating that the existing satisfactory state of affairs should not be prejudicially affected by the placing of such additional lumber when brought in\u2014that the \"clear space of 300 feet shall be maintained.\" That, and that alone, would, under the circumstances, appear to have been what might reasonably be expected to be made the subject of warranty by the insured against the proximity of such hazard. Giving due weight to the rule, contra proferentem, I am not at all certain that its scope should not be so restricted.\nBut the language used covers not only undue proximity owing to changes to be made in, or additions to, the piles of lumber, which the jury has clearly negatived, but also the maintaining of such undue proximity if it should already exist. In whichever way it is read, however, the clause in question involves a stipulation that the risk shall not attach if the warranty is not fulfilled, and it is in my opinion either a variation of statutory condition No. 3 or a new condition added to the statutory conditions, and in either view falls within the provision prescribing that it must be placed under a stated heading and in ink of a colour different from that in which the body of the policy is printed\u2014conditions admittedly not complied with.\nThe case is distinguishable from Curtis's & Harvey (Canada) Limited v. North British & Mercantile Ins. Co.[24], in that we have here a clause by which it is intended to impose a condition upon the risk attaching or continuing, whereas the clause under consideration in the Curtis's & Harvey Case (1) qualified and restricted, not the circumstances in which the risk should attach or continue, but the peril insured against. The latter clause, in so far as it was not in conflict therewith, was held not to be in the nature of a variation or addition to the statuory conditions, but \"another stipulation or covenant which defined or limited the risk\" (the word \"risk\" being obviously used here in the sense of \"peril\"), insured against. On the other hand if I should be wrong in regarding the clauses under consideration as attempts to vary or add to the statutory conditions\u2014if, as the respondent contends, they should be deemed merely descriptive of the risk assumed\u2014I am satisfied that, in view of the inspection made by Heine, of his report, on the faith of which both parties acted, and of the fact that the clauses relied upon were prepared by the company itself, for it, after loss, to dispute the existence, at the time the policies were issued, of the facts necessary to meet the requirements of those clauses, is inequitable and should not be tolerated by the court. The insured in accepting the policies with the warranty against proximity of bush hazard relied, as they were entitled to do (Joel v. Law Union and Crown Ins. Co.)[25], upon the skill and judgment of Heine as to what constituted \"standing wood, brush or forest\" within the meaning of the warranty clause, which he says he explained and interpreted to Atkinson (representing the insured) at the time of the inspection. He had been sent by the respondents' general agents to make the inspection for the very purpose of ascertaining to what hazard from the insurer's point of view the lumber was exposed. As put by Ritchie C.J., in Hastings Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Shannon[26],\nwho but the company is to be responsible for his (Heine's) not making a more accurate examination?\u2014\nI would add\u2014or for any lack of skill on his part in failing to recognize a bush hazard which he must have seen, if it in fact existed, as the jury has found. Ritchie C.J. further said in the Shannon Case26, at page 408:\u2014\nSo long ago as 1815 Lord Eldon, in the House of Lords, recognized that while it is a first principle of the law of insurance that, in the case of warranty, the thing must be exactly as it is represented to be, it would be an effectual answer, even in the case of a warranty, that the insured were misled by the insurers or their agents. Newcastle Fire Ins. Co. v. Macmoran[27].\nSee also Quinlan v. Union Fire Ins. Co.[28] ; Prairie City Oil Co. v. Standard Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[29] ; Mahomed v. Anchor Fire and Marine Ins. Co.[30] ; In re Universal Non-Tariff Fire Ins. Co.[31]; Benson v. Ottawa Agricultural Ins. Co.[32]\nIn Guimond v. Fidelity-Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co.[33], there was no inspection of the risk by any one on behalf of the insurers. The existence or non-existence of the thing warranted not to exist\u2014a railway passing within 200 feet of the insured lumber\u2014was in no wise a matter of opinion or a subject as to which reliance would be placed on inspection by an expert. There was no room for the suggestion that the insured had been misled by any person acting for the insurers.\nI would for these reasons, with respect, allow this appeal and direct that judgment be entered for the plaintiffs (appellants) for the amount of their claim with costs throughout.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I would allow this appeal on the ground that the insurance company knew through its agent Heine the exact location of the lumber insured.\nThe three hundred feet clause stipulated in the policy had been the subject of a special investigation on the part of the agent. An application had been made for insurance to the general New Brunswick agents of the respondent company. They sent up this man Heine to examine the locus and he was of opinion that there was no risk from small brush which had been burned about a year before, and he so advised the company before the policy was issued. All the facts and circumstances surrounding the risk were well known to the company, and it fixed the premium according to the view expressed by Heine. Whether or not there was a brush risk, the insurance company was willing to insure, as in fact was done with regard to some other lumber for the benefit of the appellant company which was in a brush risk. All the difference was in the percentage of premium asked for. After having had the ground thoroughly examined by the representative and after having had a report from the latter that in the case in question there was no brush risk and after having then charged a premium of 2\u00bd per cent instead of 5 per cent, can this insurance company be permitted now to claim that it is not liable if a loss subsequently occurs?\nThe courts below have relied on the case of Guimond v. Fidelity-Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co.[34]. When this latter case was decided, there was no statute in New Brunswick providing for statutory conditions while now there is such a statute which might oblige us to construe differently certain provisions of the policy now under consideration. We came to the conclusion in the Guimond Case (1) that the persons to whom the insured applied for insurance were not the agents of the insurer. In this case, there is not the least doubt that Heine was the representative and agent of the insurer.\nThe following cases are authority for the proposition that in the present case the insurance company should be declared liable. National Benefit Life Assur. Co. v. McCoy[35] ; Kline Brothers v. Dominion Fire Ins. Co.[36] ; In re Universal Non-Tariff Fire Ins. Co.[37]. I may also refer to Halsbury, vol. 17, age 534, where it is said:\u2014\nIf the agent of the insurance office takes upon himself the responsibility of surveying and describing the property, any misdescription by him of the property cannot be imputed to the assured and if the property is consequently misdescribed in the policy the instrument, if necessary, may be rectified.\nIn view of my conclusion on the above point, it is not necessary for me to consider whether the 300 feet clause was a condition to the terms of the policy in issue and whether the statutory conditions of the Fire Policies Act of New Brunswick should apply.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment should be rendered for the plaintiff for the amount of the loss which was fixed by agreement at the sum of $5,361.71.\nMignault J.\u2014I think that what has been termed the warranty clause is a condition of the policies and not a description of the risk insured against. Being a condition, it is governed by the New Brunswick Fire Insurance Policies Act (3 Geo. V, ch. 26). Section 4 of the statute contains an imperative rule, which must be observed by the insurer who desires to vary the statutory conditions, or to omit any of them, or to add new conditions, and requires that such conditions be printed in conspicuous type, and in ink of a different colour and with the heading \"Variations in Conditions.\" The sanction of this rule is that, unless the condition is distinctly indicated as above mentioned, or to the like effect, it is not valid and binding on the assured. The insurer here did not comply with this rule. My learned colleagues have to my mind successfully distinguished this case from the Curtis's & Harvey Case[38], and I need not repeat what they have said. On this point the judgment appealed from cannot be sustained.\nThe respondent's agent, Heine, having inspected this risk, measured the distance between the lumber and the nearest bush, and reported that there was a clear space of 300 feet between the lumber and any standing wood, brush or forest, and the so-called warranty clause having been inserted in the policies on Heine's representations, I would think that the respondent should not now be allowed to dispute liability on the ground that the facts so represented were not true. No change in the situation of the lumber was made by the appellant who throughout acted in good faith, relying on Heine's representations. There is, therefore, much more here than mere knowledge by the insured of the situation of the property, and this distinguishes this case from Guimond v. Fidelity-Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co.[39].\nThe first ground of appeal, however, suffices to dispose of the case in favour of the appellant.\nI would allow the appeal with costs and give judgment to the appellant for the amount of the verdict with interest and costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Fred R.

Co. v. Vandry ([1920] A.C. 662) and The City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott ([1922] 2 A.C. 555) followed; and in order to bring itself within the exculpatory clause of article 1054 C.C., it is not sufficient for the appellant to prove that the cause of the bursting is unknown.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 33 K.B. 458) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Lafontaine J. and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. and G. St. Pierre K.C. for the appellant. The appellant, to be relieved from liability, was not obliged to prove fortuitous event, vis major or fault of the respondent, but it was sufficient to prove that it had acted with reasonable care and had adopted reasonable means to prevent the accident. The cause of the accident cannot be explained; all possible causes were examined and discussed by expert witnesses who testified that the accident is not attributable to any of them.\nPaul Rainville K.C. for the respondent. Under article 1054 C.C., the appellant is responsible for the damages caused to the respondent by a thing which was under its care and control.\nChs. Laurendeau K.C. and G. St. Pierre K.C. for the appellant.\nPaul Rainville K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The respondent sued the appellant for damages to his buildings on the corner of Cadieux and De- Montigny streets in said city, on the 25th April, 1919, by reason of the water pipes used by appellant on DeMontigny street in front of respondent's said building having burst and through the rupture so produced poured millions of gallons of water upon said buildings or the ground adjacent to the foundation thereof.\nThe learned trial judge maintained the respondent's claim and assessed the damages at $3,000.\nThe Court of King's Bench unanimously upheld the said judgment. Each of the five members thereof who heard said appeal gave written reasons in support of their said judgment founding the action upon the obligations resting upon appellant by virtue of Art. 1054 of the Civil Code.\nThe appellant's counsel admitted in answer to a question I put to him that he did not deny that the burden of rebutting a presumption created by the relevant law and fact against the appellant rested upon it.\nI fail to see how that can be held to have been discharged by the evidence upon which he relied.\nI do not propose going into a detailed account thereof and of the evidence adduced by the respondent.\nI have considered same and the arguments adduced by counsel on each side resting respectively upon that class of evidence given on behalf of their respective clients.\nIf as the witnesses for appellant pretend that they cannot account for the repeated bursting of parts of said pipe and we are asked to allow this appeal because the appellant's employees cannot find anything to account for such bursting, I respectfully submit that they have not duly investigated the possible causes.\nOne of these witnesses admitted there had been water pipes in the city which lasted for forty years without bursting. No attempt was made to compare such enduring water pipes with those in question and to learn how it came about that the one set lasted so well and so long without bursting and this later structure had a dozen ruptures within ten years.\nIs it conceivable that such a state of things is to continue arid owners of property to suffer loss at such a rate because appellant's employees will not listen to what others say and are blind to what experience demonstrates?\nSuch a case as appellant sets up does not present anything upon which we should say that it had discharged the burden cast upon it by law.\nNor do I find any error in the law as presented by the several judges below.\nThe question of damages, concurrently agreed upon by both courts, is one with which we should not interfere in such a case.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Brodeur.\nAnglin J.\u2014The impression left on my mind by a study of the somewhat voluminous record in this case cannot be better expressed than in the sentence in which the lamented Chief Justice Lamothe stated his conclusion:\nLa preuve, telle que faite, ne nous permet pas de dire que le fait d\u00e9terminant des dommages, causa causans, n'aurait pu \u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9.\nHaving regard to the history of the conduit\u2014twelve breaks, many of them serious, within ten years in the other two sections\u2014I am not so clearly convinced that the defendants were unable by any reasonable means to prevent the act (le fait) which caused the damage to the plaintiff's property (City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott[2]), that I would feel justified in reversing the judgment of the Superior Court unanimously affirmed by the Court of King's Bench, notwithstanding the fact that a majority of the learned judges of the latter court appear to have proceeded on a view of the effect of the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Quebec Ry. L.H. & P. Co. v. Vandry[3], which must, in the light of the \"addition\" made to it in the later judgment in City of Montreal v. Watt and Scott2, now be deemed somewhat exaggerated.\nWhile proof of fault dans locum injuriae is certainly lacking, the burden thrown on the defendants by the Vandry decision (2) of bringing themselves within the exculpatory clause of article 1054 C.C., even as tempered by the \"addition\" made by their Lordships in the Watt and Scott Case (1), remains so onerous that I am not satisfied it has been discharged. That burden is, of course, enormously increased where, as here, the cause of the accident is unknown.\nIt would require a very strong case indeed to justify interference with the assessment of the plaintiff's damages, unanimously confirmed by the Court of King's Bench. Such a case has not been made out.\nThe appeal in my opinion fails.\nBrodeur J.\u2014L'article 1054 du Code Civil, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le principe qu'une personne est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par la faute de ceux dont elle a le contr\u00f4le, ajoute qu'elle est aussi responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 \"par les choses qu'elle a sous sa garde.\"\nL'article \u00e9num\u00e8re ensuite quels sont ceux qui sont sous contr\u00f4le au sens de cet article, et ajoute:\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 ci-dessus a lieu seulement lorsque la personne qui y est assujettie ne peut prouver qu'elle n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage.\nLe dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose n'a pas donn\u00e9 lieu d'abord dans notre jurisprudence \u00e0 l'application du principe que celui qui en avait la garde pouvait \u00e9carter la responsabilit\u00e9 en prouvant qu'il n'avait pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui avait caus\u00e9 ce dommage. Mais la th\u00e9orie du risque professionnel, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 favoris\u00e9 par certains auteurs, et surtout par Saleilles, \u00e0 la fin du si\u00e8cle dernier et au commencement de celui-ci, a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une certaine ind\u00e9cision dans la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise et dans la n\u00f4tre. Cette cour, dans cette c\u00e9l\u00e8bre cause de Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet[4], a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement divis\u00e9e sur la question de savoir s'il y avait pr\u00e9somption de faute contre le propri\u00e9taire dans le cas o\u00f9 le dommage \u00e9tait caus\u00e9 par sa chose. Cette opinion de la cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 savamment examin\u00e9e dans la Revue Trimestrielle du Droit Civil, Vol. 10 (1911), page 23.\nEn 1915, cette question de la responsibilit\u00e9 fut discut\u00e9e devant nous dans cette c\u00e9l\u00e8bre cause de Vandry v. Quebec Ry. L.H. & P. Co.[5], et l\u00e0 encore nous voyons une grande divergence d'opinion. En 1918, la m\u00eame question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e de nouveau devant nous dans une cause de Norcross v. Gohier[6], et nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose cr\u00e9e contre le propri\u00e9taire une pr\u00e9somption de faute qu'il est tenu de repousser.\nEn 1920, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a tranch\u00e9 cette question d'onus probandi en d\u00e9cidant dans la cause ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9 de Vandry v. Quebec Ry. L.H. & P.

La doctrine enseigne que la faute la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re suffirait pour faire rejeter l'excuse d'impossibilit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9e. La loi ne peut balancer entre celui qui a commis une faute m\u00eame l\u00e9g\u00e8re et celui qui a souffert sans en avoir commis aucune.

Watt & Scott[9], apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le d\u00e9biteur, pour s'exon\u00e9rer, doit montrer d'une mani\u00e8re raisonnable qu'il n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage, ajoute que le cas fortuit et la force majeure pourraient en cons\u00e9quence produire cette exon\u00e9ration.\nJe consid\u00e8re que si le d\u00e9biteur n'apporte pas une preuve formelle et d\u00e9cisive, s'il se contente de prouver qu'il ne conna\u00eet pas la cause de l'accident, il ne d\u00e9truit pas la pr\u00e9somption de faute \u00e9dict\u00e9e contre lui.\nDans le cas actuel, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a tent\u00e9 de prouver qu'elle ne connaissait pas la cause de l'accident. Mais en m\u00eame temps il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les conduites d'eau qui se sont bris\u00e9es et qui ont caus\u00e9 les dommages n'\u00e9taient pas plac\u00e9es assez profond\u00e9ment dans la terre et qu'elles \u00e9taient soumises \u00e0 l'action de la gel\u00e9e, pour partie du moins, la partie sup\u00e9rieure \u00e9tant en contact avec la terre gel\u00e9e pendant que la partie inf\u00e9rieure reposait sur une couche plus chaude. Il pouvait se produire alors une diff\u00e9rence de dilatation qui a pu affaiblir la conduite et occasionner la rupture. Cela est d'autant plus possible que plusieurs ruptures ont eu lieu dans ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es et qu'elles se sont toutes produites, \u00e0 l'exception d'une, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 la terre gelait ou d\u00e9gelait.\nDe plus, on n'a pas suivi les devis. Ces devis avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits avec beaucoup de soin par les officiers techniques de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Pourquoi ne pas avoir pourvu alors \u00e0 ce que ces sp\u00e9cifications soient en tous points observ\u00e9es?\nMaintenant plusieurs accidents semblables se sont produits et je ne vois pas que la cit\u00e9 ait pris des mesures \u00e9nergiques pour t\u00e2cher de pr\u00e9venir ces accidents dans l'avenir.\nIl para\u00eet \u00e9galement que des conduites avec un diam\u00e8tre aussi consid\u00e9rable que celui dont on s'est servi offrent une source de dangers plus consid\u00e9rables.\nPour ces raisons, je consid\u00e8re que la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al n'a pas \u00e9tabli qu'elle n'a pas pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence le jugement qui l'a condamn\u00e9e doit \u00eatre maintenu et l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014The Court of King's Bench in deciding this case followed the decision of the Privy Council in Quebec Railway, Light, Heat & Power Co. v. Vandry[10], the majority of the learned judges being of the opinion that under that decision, where damage is caused by a thing under the care of the defendant, the latter cannot claim the benefit of the exculpatory paragraph of Art. 1054 of the Quebec Civil Code unless he shews that the act (le fait) which caused the damage amounted to a cas fortuit or force majeure. Since the judgment of the Court of King's Bench was rendered, their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott, Limited[11], explained the meaning of their decision in the Vandry Case (1), and said at p. 563:\u2014\nThe only addition to the views expressed in Vandry's Case (1), which was not necessary there but is necessary here, is that in their Lordships' view \"unable to prevent the damage complained of\" means \"unable by reasonable means.\" It does not denote an absolute inability. If, therefore, the storm in question could be described as a cas fortuit or force majeure, and if the appellants had shewn that they had constructed the sewer of a size sufficient to meet all reasonable expectations there would, in their Lordships' view, have been a case where the exculpatory paragraph would have applied.\nWhile the reference to the storm there in question might appear to give some support to the opinion expressed in the court below that the defendant cannot claim the benefit of the exculpatory paragraph of article 1054 C.C. unless he shews that the act which caused the damage can be described as a cas fortuit or force majeure, it seems to me that the language of their Lordships should not be so construed. For were the defendant constrained to go the length of proving that the accident which caused the dam- age was a cas fortuit or the result of force majeure, he would be obliged to establish \"an absolute inability\" to prevent the damage complained of, and their Lordships are very careful to state that \"unable to prevent the damage\" does not denote such an inability, but means \"unable by reasonable means,\" which of course excludes the idea of irresistible force as a necessary element of exculpation. It follows that I cannot agree with the view expressed by the majority of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench that the defendant here was obliged to shew that the damage was caused by a cas fortuit or resulted from force majeure.\nNevertheless the question remains whether the city of Montreal has established that it could not, by reasonable means, prevent the bursting of the pipe which caused the damage complained of. It is certainly no defence to say that the cause of the bursting is unknown.\nUnder all the circumstances it can reasonably be inferred that there was a flaw in the pipe which burst, for of course the bursting was not without a cause. This pipe formed part of a water distribution system carrying the water by means of a thirty-inch main pipe which extended some 18,000 feet from Aqueduct street to DeLorimier avenue. It was manufactured by the Canada Iron Corporation, Limited, of Three Rivers, in 1910 and was laid down in that year. This distribution system had three distinct sections however, manufactured under separate contracts, and in the section where the accident occurred this was the first case of the bursting of a pipe. There were, it is true, blow-outs in the other sections, but as they may have happened through causes that are not disclosed I do not think that they should be considered here. So we have the mere fact of this accident, without any similar occurrence in this section to indicate a weakness in the pipes.\nThat the appellant was at considerable pains to secure proper pipes for its water distribution system is shewn by the following \"consid\u00e9rant\" of the learned trial judge:\nConsid\u00e9rant que si dans la confection des conduites dont la d\u00e9fenderesse s'est servie, et dans le choix des mat\u00e9riaux employ\u00e9s, ainsi que dans la confection des travaux d'installation et le posage des divers tuyaux servant \u00e0 conduire l'eau, dont l'un s'est bris\u00e9, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al para\u00eet, suivant la preuve, avoir mis tout le soin et pris toutes les pr\u00e9cautions que la science, l'art et l'exp\u00e9rience peuvent sugg\u00e9rer en semblable cas, et si avant de s'en servir, les divers tuyaux dont l'ensemble forme l'une des conduites principales du syst\u00e8me d'aqueduc de la d\u00e9fenderesse, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 de s\u00e9rieuses exp\u00e9riences qui ont demontr\u00e9 qu'ils pouvaient \u00eatre employ\u00e9s avec s\u00e9curit\u00e9, tout de m\u00eame la d\u00e9fenderesse n'en a pas moins pris un risque en employant des tuyaux qui \u00e0 cause de leur diam\u00e8tre consid\u00e9rable ou pour des causes inconnues pr\u00e9sentaient certain danger suivant la science et l'exp\u00e9rience.\nThe learned trial judge had in a preceding \"consid\u00e9rant,\" placed the liability of the appellant upon article 1054 C.C., but perhaps as to this \"considerant,\" I may say that in my opinion the mere use of a thirty-inch pipe, which was no doubt necessary to carry a sufficient supply of water in a city of the size of Montreal, does not appear to be a safe ground for a judgment condemning the city to pay damages when, as the learned trial judge finds, the civic authorities took all the precautions which science, art and experience could suggest, and when the pipes were submitted to serious tests showing that they could be used with safety. But the weakness of the appellant's case under article 1054 C.C. is that, in relation to the accident which caused the damage, its evidence, apart from proof of the precautions to which I have referred, is chiefly of a negative character, the attempt being to shew that the accident could not be explained. What was neccessary was to prove that the accident could not have been prevented by reasonable means. And to my mind, after carefully reading the appellant's evidence, one fact stands out as a possible cause of the bursting. The pipe in question was placed in a trench and was covered only by two feet four inches of earth and asphalt paving. Frost, it is shewn, extends much deeper than that, and in winter the top of the pipe was in frozen earth, while the bottom was probably below the line of frost, thus causing a tension which tended to weaken the pipes. Accidents did not take place for several years, but as time went on and the pipe was winter after winter exposed to these strains, its force of resistance was no doubt decreased. In cross-examination, Mr. Vanier, the appellant's principal expert witness, admits the possibility of an accident under these circumstances. I will quote a short passage from his testimony:\nQ. Mais est-ce que, sous l'influence du froid et sous l'influence de la chaleur, lors du d\u00e9gel, ce tuyau n'\u00e9tait pas soumis \u00e0 une dilatation, \u00e0 une contraction \u00e0 chaque changement de saison? R. C'est comme tous les tuyaux d'aqueduc, c'est justement ce point-l\u00e0 que je touchais tout \u00e0 l'heure, ces cas des diff\u00e9rences de temp\u00e9rature \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur et \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du tuyau, qui peuvent avoir une influence sur la fonte.\nQ. Et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que dans tous les tuyaux il y aurait ou peut y avoir des \"cooling strains,\" est-ce que ce ne serait pas de nature \u00e0 soumettre ces tuyaux \u00e0 une tension telle que le tuyau, \u00e0 un certain moment, devient trop faible pour r\u00e9sister \u00e0 la pression de l'eau int\u00e9rieure?\nR. C'est possible th\u00e9oriquement, c'est possible, mais ce n'est pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9.\nIt is not sufficient to say \"\u00e7a n'est pas demontr\u00e9,\" for the respondent did not have to explain the bursting, the burden being on the appellant to shew that it could not have prevented it. And here is an admitted possible cause of the accident which the appellant has not excluded by the evidence which it adduced, as the quotation from Mr. Vanier's testimony shews.\nThere is no doubt that article 1054 C.C. as now construed imposes a very serious responsibility on municipal corporations which in the interest of their citizens have installed public services. But this is really a question of policy for the consideration of the legislature, for the law, however rigorous it may seem, must be applied to public bodies as well as to private individuals. I therefore think that the evidence adduced by the appellant does not entitle it to claim the benefit of the exculpatory paragraph of article 1054.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Jarry, Damphouse, Butler & St. Pierre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rainville & Rainville.\n[1] [1922] Q.R. 33 K.B. 458.\n[2] [1922] 2 A.C. 555.\n[3] [1920] A.C. 662.\n2 [1922] 2 A.C. 555.\n[4] [1909] 42 Can.

I would restore the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent as owner of an automobile having had it insured by the appellant against\nbeing in accidental collision, during the period insured, with any other automobile, vehicle or object, excluding (1) loss or damage from fire or theft, however caused; (2) loss or damage to any tire due to puncture, cut, gash, blowout or other ordinary tire trouble; and excluding in any event loss or damage to any tire unless caused in an accidental collision which also causes other loss or damage to the insured automobile\nbrought this action thereon to recover damages for alleged losses within the meaning thereof.\nThe automobile in question was in charge of the respondent\u2019s son and driven by him when the accident in question took place, on the road from Odessa to Kingston early in the morning of 4th May, 1921.\nHe was accompanied by a single companion. They are the only witnesses having a direct personal knowledge of the accident.\nThe son, after telling the story of his drive, states the accident as follows:\u2014\nQ. You speak of there being a culvert?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Describe the culvert, please?\u2014A. The culvert was slightly raised off the road.\nQ. What is your idea of slightly?\u2014A. Up like that.\nQ. How high?\u2014A. I suppose it would be eighteen inches, twelve or eighteen inches.\nQ. Do you mean the ground or top would be eighteen inches from the level of the road?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Do you know how the road was approaching the culvert and just over it when you left it?\u2014A. All I know when I went over I struck and the wheel went out of my hand.\nQ. A hole?\u2014A. The wheel went out of my hand.\nQ. How do you mean?\u2014A. The wheel hit the hole and swerved out.\nQ. Is that what caused the car\u2014continue now as minutely as you can as to what happened; you say you went over the culvert and struck a hole?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Then what happened?\u2014A. The front wheel of the car left the road and went down in the ditch and I put on a little more speed to try and climb to the top of the road; I couldn\u2019t make it and she slid and went over upside down.\nQ. Do I understand one wheel of the car adhered to the surface or top of the road and the other wheel was down in the ditch?\u2014A. The front and back wheels were down in the ditch and the other two wheels were down on the road.\nQ. Would that be the right wheel down in the ditch?\u2014A. Yes, the right wheel was in the ditch and the left on the road. Q. You told me about doing something?\u2014A. I turned the wheel, put on a little more speed to try and climb to the level of the road.\nQ. Tried to get back on the road?\u2014A. The back wheel slewed and she turned over.\nIt is claimed that this incident which was followed as result of said effort at recovery by a turning over of the car to its left side and being pressed a bit further onward on that side, was a collision within the meaning of the above quoted insurance.\nThe learned trial judge held that this striking of the earth was not a collision within said insurance any more than, if the car had been struck by an aerolite or if someone fired a rifle ball through the tire, the car would be in a collision.\nThe Divisional Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed this finding and held it was a collision within the meaning of said insurance as above expressed.\nWe have had that question fully argued out. And less fully another I am presently about to refer to.\nIn this connection we have had pressed upon us as usual in such like cases, the application of the ejusdem generis rule.\nI prefer wherever possible in regard to the application of said rule to adopt the mode of thought given expression to by the late Lord Macnaghten in the case of Thames & Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. Hamilton, Fraser & Co.[5], as follows:\u2014\nYour Lordships were asked to draw the line and to give an exact and authoritative definition of the meaning of the expression \u201cperils of the sea\u201d in connection with the general words. For my part I decline to attempt any such task. I do not think it is possible to frame a definition which would include every case proper to be included, and no other. I think that each case must be considered with reference to its own circumstances and that the circumstances of each case must be looked at in a broad common sense view and not by the light of strained analogies and fanciful resemblances.\nApplying that to the facts in question as above related I fail to see herein how the rough treatment even a driver gets by running into a rut on the road, which was (save rate of speed and want of care) the sole originating cause of all else that happened and is herein in question, can be classed under the term collision as used in above quoted insurance.\nWith great respect I cannot see the necessity for elaborating further this branch of the case.\nThe clause read in the light of common sense should not, and I respectfully submit never was intended by the contracting parties to, indemnify an owner for damages flowing from such a cause.\nThe learned trial judge, besides holding that the case as presented did not fall within the meaning of the insurance clause relied upon, found as a fact that the appellant\u2019s son was, at the time in question, driving at a rate of speed which exceeded that of the twenty-five miles an hour limit allowed by the Motor Vehicles Act 9 Geo. V, c. 57, sec. 3.\nUpon that ground also he rested his judgment.\nA perusal of the entire evidence leads me to agree with this finding of the learned trial judge; and at all events in face of the peculiar nature of much of said evidence the finding of the learned trial judge I respectfully submit should not have been disturbed.\nAnd thereupon I am strongly of the impression that in law an insurance company cannot legally insure the owner of an automobile against anything arising out of driving at a prohibited rate of speed.\nThe cases cited by the learned trial judge and others cited by counsel do not (though some of them are illuminative of the law involved) by any means finally and conclusively dispose of this question in the way I should like to see it settled.\nTo illustrate my way of looking at it I would refer to the case of Webster v. De Tastet[6], and the remarks in regard thereto in Pollock on Contracts, page 306, and the reason given for the decision. Yet the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 had apparently eliminated the said reason.\nAlthough the said case seems to have been given due weight in the case of Cohen v. Kittell[7], many years after said Act, yet under the legislation here in question that may not help. In a somewhat analogous manner we are met with the peculiar provision which has resulted from the several amendments to section 19 of the Motor Vehicles Act which, before these amendments, read as follows:\u2014\n19. The owner of a motor vehicle shall be responsible for any violation of this Act or of any regulation prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nThe first two lines continue the same throughout all the amendments.\nWhat does this section mean? To whom is the owner responsible? Is he to indemnify him who has been penalized? Or him who has suffered injury? If not something like that is it to be interpreted as rendering the owner liable to be convicted? If so why is it not so expressed as plainly as in section 28 of the same Act?\nThe persistent observance of the same expression in the several amendments in later sessions, suggests something possibly different from the intention of imposing liability to a conviction for the like penalty imposed upon him actually committing the offence.\nIf the latter meaning it would not be as clear as the case of Coppen v. Moore[8], relied upon by the respondents, for the Act there in question expressly declared that the owner, subject to certain limitations, would be guilty of the offence there in question.\nI incline to the opinion that whichever of the two meanings I have suggested as applicable to the responsibility of the owner under said section may be the correct one, that it would be against public policy for the appellant to attempt to insure against the risk of speed, beyond the statutory limitations, and hence void if so interpreted.\nYet as there is a decided difference arguable and in the one view possibly the result I incline to not maintainable and the distinction was not grappled with in argument, I prefer resting my opinion on the merits of this appeal upon the first ground taken alone.\nIndeed there may, as happened in the Merchants Shipping Act, be some legislative amendment which has escaped my attention.\nI submit that the Act now in question may well be amended so as to render the question beyond dispute. I would allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nDUFF J.\u2014\nThe risk insured against is the risk of loss\nby being in accidental collision * * * with any other automobile, vehicle or object.\nThe respondent\u2019s automobile capsized and was damaged in consequence. The appeal turns upon the point (subject to another element in the case which I shall presently discuss) whether or not what happened falls within the words describing the risk. In other words, whether in the circumstances it can be fairly affirmed that the automobile was \u201cin accidental collision\u201d with an \u201cother automobile, vehicle or object,\u201d within the meaning of the policy.\nI am not disposed to agree that the word \u201cobject\u201d can be limited in deference to noscitur a sociis or to the principle of ejusdem generis to the degree for which Mr. Grant contends. I am inclined to think that the broader idea, that of \u201cconveyance,\u201d must be ascribed to \u201cvehicle\u201d in this connection, and that so read it would express everything falling within the word \u201cautomobile.\u201d In all the instances put, there is conveyance; in the case of the locomotive stone crusher, for example, there is conveyance of the mass of the locomotive. Nevertheless I am not disposed to disagree with the view of the learned trial judge that some significance must be attached to the words \u201cautomobile\u201d and \u201cvehicle,\u201d and that the presence of these words limits the scope of the word \u201cobject\u201d\u2014at least sufficiently to exclude from the class of perils insured against, impact of the body of the motor upon the earth resulting from collapse or capsize. I agree also with the learned trial judge that \u201ccollision\u201d is not a word which anybody would be likely to use in this context to describe impact upon the earth involved in collapse or capsize. I think, moreover, that it is not a meaning which anybody receiving a policy of insurance would on reading the policy be likely, without a good deal of reflection and analysis, to ascribe to the word \u201ccollision.\u201d I have considered carefully the judgment delivered in the Appellate Division, and while I agree that there are difficulties in drawing an abstract line between cases in respect of which good reasons might be given for bringing them within the language of the policy, and cases which ought to be excluded, I must say with the most unaffected respect that I think the cases mentioned, capsize and collapse and consequential impact upon the earth of the body of the car, very clearly fall on the other side of the line.\nIt appears that after the capsize of the car it came into violent contact with a boulder, and I was disposed to think on the argument that sufficient attention had not been paid to the question whether the damage to the car was in part due to this impact. The learned trial judge, however, has found, and I think not without good warrant on the evidence, that the damage was entirely due to what occurred before the collision with the boulder.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, but I cannot take leave of the appeal without expressing my opinion in concurrence with the view of the Appellate Division that there is nothing in the common law and nothing in the Ontario statute relied upon which disqualifies the owner of an automobile or other vehicle or the owner of a ship from contracting for indemnity for loss arising from accidents due to the negligence (in which he is not personally implicated) of his servants or his licensees. The principle invoked by the learned trial judge under which he held the plaintiff to be disqualified, was discussed in Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[9], and the following passage from the judgment of Kennedy J. in Burrows v. Rhodes[10], was approved by Lord Wrenbury at p. 998 and adopted by him as a correct statement of the law upon the point:\u2014\nIt has, I think long been settled law that if an act is manifestly unlawful, or the doer of it knows it to be unlawful, as constituting either a civil wrong or a criminal offence, he cannot maintain an action for contribution or for indemnity against the liability which results to him therefrom. An express promise of indemnity to him for the commission of such an act is void.\nI agree with the Appellate Division that the circumstances of this case do not bring it within that principle. ANGLIN J.\u2014The material facts of this case appear in the reports of it in the provincial courts, 52 Ont. L.R. 39; 22 Ont. W.N. 513.\nIn order to recover the plaintiff was obliged to establish that the damage sued for was sustained by his automobile\nby being in accidental collision with any (some) other automobile, vehicle or object.\nThe policy so limits the risk.\nThe insurance company was relieved of liability by the learned trial judge on three distinct grounds\u2014that no collision had taken place; that, if there had been a \u201ccollision\u201d it was not with an \u201cobject\u201d within the meaning of that word in the relevant clause of the policy; that the automobile was driven at an illegal rate of speed and liability under the policy therefore did not arise.\nThe Appellate Divisional Court held a contrary opinion on all three grounds.\nI am, with respect, unable to regard the impact of an overturned car with the highway on which it was being driven as a \u201cbeing in collision\u201d within the meaning of the clause of the policy above in part quoted. However comprehensive the meaning to be given to the word \u201cobject\u201d it is quite certain that the coming together of the automobile and the highway, due to the upsetting of the former, was not an event which anybody would dream of describing as a \u201ccollision.\u201d That word, in my opinion, is used in the policy in the sense in which it is ordinarily employed. Injury to the car sustained by its overturning owing to some defect in the road-bed was a risk which it was not intended to cover.\nBut a witness, Wilson, who saw the overturned automobile after the accident, deposes that, while sliding along the roadside ditch after overturning, it had come into contact with a large stone; and it is urged that that was a collision. Assuming the fact to be established, I very much doubt whether it was a collision within the meaning of the policy. But it is unnecessary to determine that question. The learned trial judge, expressly basing his finding on the credibility of the evidence, says:\u2014\nPractically all the damage was caused at once when the car landed on its right side, and nothing which took place subsequently was of any consequence. The only evidence in the record on the point is to that effect. It was given by the driver of the car. It has been urged that his physical condition immediately after the accident was such that he was incapable of forming any opinion on such a matter. However that may be and however likely it may seem that some appreciable part of the injury to the car is ascribable to its violent impact with the stone, there is no evidence to that effect such as might easily have been obtained from the witness, Wilson, or from others who examined the car after the accident, if its appearance warranted such an inference. It must not be forgotten that the burden of proving that the injuries for which he claims damages were caused by his automobile \u201cbeing in accidental collision\u201d rested on the plaintiff. That burden he has not discharged. Upon the record before us I find it impossible to say that the learned trial judge was clearly wrong in finding, as the plaintiff\u2019s son deposed, that\npractically all the damage was caused at once when the car landed on its right side.\nIt is not necessary to pass upon the effect on the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover of the illegal speed at which his car was being driven as disclosed by the evidence. I venture to suggest, however, that an explicit provision in the Motor Vehicles Act, barring the recovery by an automobile owner or driver of insurance for injury either to the car owned or driven by him or to the persons or property of others, to the causing of which the driving of the car at an illegal rate of speed while under the control of such owner or of any person in his service or with his privity had contributed, would not only be commendable on grounds of public policy, but would also be conducive to better observance of the speed laws, which are now so frequently and flagrantly violated.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the Appellate Divisional Court and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge dismissing the action.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The plaintiff Sowards had insured his automobile with the appellant company and it was stipulated in the policy that there would be indemnity for damage in an \u201caccidental collision * * * with any other automobile, vehicle or object.\u201d\nOn the 4th of May, 1921, this automobile struck a hole or rather a rut in the road and the machine was upset on its right side and went down in the ditch.\nWas this an accidental collision which entitled the insured to claim indemnity?\nCollision in such a policy means the act of two vehicles coming together or of the insured automobile running against or coming into violent contact with some other object. Lepman v. Employers\u2019 Liability[11]. The driving of an automobile into a hole is not such a collision with an object as is contemplated by the parties to an insurance policy containing a collision clause. Dougherty v. Ins. Co.[12]\nAccidental collision with the surface of the roadbed in being turned over was not and could not be contemplated by the policy. The collision with another automobile or object could not be considered as covering the case of a turning over. The upsetting and the collision present different aspects and the parties would not intend insurance against upsetting when they have provided collision insurance. Bell v. American Ins. Co.[13]\nIt is contended, however, by the plaintiff that when the automobile was upset, one of the wheels struck a stone which turned the automobile over to its left side. That would bring us to consider whether the collision with a stone in the highway would be covered by the policy. I would be inclined to think so, because policies of the nature of the one under consideration permit recovery for injuries occasioned by a collision with either a moving or a stationary body. Cantwell v. General Accident Insurance Corp.[14] But the trial judge, on conflicting evidence, has found that practically all the damage had been caused previously, when the car was upset for the first time. In view of this finding, it is not necessary then to decide the question whether a stone in a highway would be considered as one of the objects mentioned in the policy. I have come to the conclusion that the accident alleged by the plaintiff did not result in a collision, and it is, therefore, useless to consider the other questions raised on this appeal.\nI am of the opinion that the judgment of the Appellate Division, which maintained the action of the insured, is not well founded.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the plaintiff\u2019s action should be dismissed.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The collision clause in the insurance policy relied on by the respondent is in the following terms:\u2014\nIn consideration of ninety-eight dollars ($98.00) premium, this policy also covers, subject to its other conditions, damage to the automobile and or equipment herein described, in excess of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) (each accident being deemed a separate claim and said sum being deducted from the amount of each claim when determined) by being in accidental collision during the period insured with any other automobile, vehicle or object, excluding (1) loss or damage from fire or theft, however caused; (2) loss or damage to any tire due to puncture, cut, gash, blowout or other ordinary tire trouble, and excluding in any event loss or damage to any tire unless caused in an accidental collision which also causes other loss or damage to the insured automobile.\nThe learned trial judge found that\npractically all the damage was caused at once when the car landed on its right side and nothing which took place subsequently is of any consequence.\nMr. Justice Ferguson of the Appellate Division, with whom the other learned judges agreed, expressed the opinion that the collision was with the highway, and also that the surface of the highway was \u201can object\u201d within the meaning of the policy.\nEven granting that in the clause insuring the automobile against damage\nby being in accidental collision * * * with any other automobile, vehicle or object,\nthe words \u201cor object\u201d are not to be construed according to the rule noscitur a sociis, still I cannot bring myself to believe that what the parties meant was to treat as a collision the overturning of the car. The car was necessarily in contact with the highway all the time and if it overturned or upset, bringing its side, instead of its wheels, in contact with the roadway, that certainly was not a collision within the meaning of the policy. My opinion therefore is that the respondent is not entitled to recover from the appellant under the collision clause of its insurance policy the damages caused by the upsetting of the car.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Clarke, Swabey & McLean.\nSolicitor for the respondent: T.J.

An association, organized for the purpose of financing his candidature, received moneys which were deposited in a bank account under the control of its president and secretary. Certain election expenses were paid by cheques issued by the association without the knowledge of McR. The agent, with the approval of the appellant, declared in his return that he had authorized these payments. Two accounts, one of $20 for lunches supplied to the scrutineers and another for 168 for the services of a band on the night of the election day were sent to the agent and paid by him before his return was filed, but were not included in it. The appellant, pursuant to section 79 (3) of \"The Dominion Elections Act,\" transmitted to the returning officer a sworn declaration that to the best of his knowledge and belief the return of election expenses made by his agent was correct.\nHeld that the appellant and his official agent were guilty of corrupt and illegal practices within the meaning of \"The Dominion Elections Act,\" [1920] c. 46, section 78 (3) enacting that the payment of all election expenses should be made \"by\" or \"through\" the official agent and section 79 (1), (3), (9) declaring to be a \"corrupt practice\" any untrue return or false declaration knowingly made by a candidate or his agent. Consequently the election is void: \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act,\" R.S.C.

APPEAL from the judgment of Embury and Mackenzie JJ.[1], sitting as trial judges under the provisions of the \"Dominion Controverted Elections Act,\" R.S.C. [1906], chapter 7, in the matter of the controverted election of a member for the Electoral District of Moose Jaw in the House of Commons of Canada, rendered on the 6th of October, 1922, maintaining the respondents' petition with costs and declaring void the election of the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. B. Hudson K.C. for the appellant.\u2014The trial judges had no jurisdiction to hear and decide the petition, as they were judges of the Court of King's Bench, not of the Court of Appeal nor of the Supreme Court.\u2014The judgment is based solely on a finding that the appellant and his official agent were guilty of a corrupt practice in making a false return of election expenses, and a petition under \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act\" is not authorized in respect of such matter.\u2014The declaration of expenses was in fact true.\u2014The payment of accounts by the officers of the association were authorized by section 10 of \"The Dominion Elections Act.\"\u2014The payments made for lunches and band were not election expenses.\u2014The evidence is not sufficiently clear against the appellant and his agent to justify a finding of a lack of good faith, and relief should have been given under the provisions of section 56 (a) of the statute of Canada [1921] c. 7, in view of the very large majority of the appellant and the fact that no money was spent for corrupt purposes.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the respondent.\u2014The reprisement of \"The Dominion Elections Act\" with regard to the payment of election expenses through the official agent is absolute.\u2014The payment of the accounts for lunches and band should have been included in the return filed by the agent.\u2014The declarations transmitted by the appellant and his agent were false. The appellant and his agent having; been found guilty of acts amounting to \"corrupt practices,\" the election must be declared void.\nA. B. Hudson K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Anglin, which I have carefully read, and in which I fully concur, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMy learned brother has covered every point raised in this appeal so fully and satisfactorily that I cannot see any good reason for repeating his reasons.\nDuff J.\u2014The return of the appellant as member for Moose Jaw was impeached by allegations of illegal and corrupt practices within the meaning of sections 51 and 55 of \"The Controverted Elections Act\" under two heads. Under these heads it was alleged 1st, that the agents of the appellant were guilty of illegal practices in paying election expenses otherwise than through the official agent in violation of the prohibition enacted by section 78 subsection 3 of \"The Dominion Elections Act \", 2nd, that the appellant personally and his official agent were guilty of corrupt practices within the meaning of section 79 subsection 9 of the same statute in making a false return of election expenses.\nI shall deal with the findings upon these charges seriatim. As to the 1st charge, the trial judge found categorically that certain payments enumerated in the report were made by agents of the appellant otherwise than \"by\" nor \"through\" the official agent within the meaning of subsection 3 of section 78 of \"The Dominion Elections Act.\"\nThe funds on which the appellant was at liberty to draw for election expenses were in part in the hands of an association known as \"The New National Policy Political Association\"; an association organized in part at least for the purpose of financing the canvas of the Progressive Party under whose auspices the respondent was conducting his candidature. The association had a central committee in Regina and a local committee in each electoral district. The Moose Jaw local committee of which one Thomas Teare was president and one Devlin was secretary, received in due course from the central committee moneys for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the Moose Jaw election these moneys being deposited in a bank account under the control of Teare and Devlin. The official agent, McRitchie, had no authority in relation to this fund and none over Teare or Devlin. On the 28th of November, about a week after the official nomination day and a week before election day, there was a meeting of the local committee at Moose Jaw at which Teare and Devlin and one Salsbury were present with the appellant himself. Certain accounts were produced by Salsbury and approved by all present and cheques were accordingly drawn and signed by Teare and Devlin for the payment of them. Teare and Devlin acted without consulting the official agent and without his knowledge or authority direct or indirect. These bills were, the trial judges found, paid irregularly, that is to say otherwise than through the official agent and in violation of subsection 4 of section 78 of \"The Dominion Elections Act.\" It is not disputed that they were paid and paid by means of cheques drawn as just mentioned by Teare and Devlin; but it is argued by Mr. Hudson that the petitioners failed to prove that the cheques were not delivered to the payees \"by or through\" the agency of McRitchie.\nIt is undeniable, I think, that where a charge is made the proof of which may entail consequences of a penal nature under \"The Dominion Elections Act\" or \"The Controverted Elections Act,\" a finding in the affirmative should only ensue on the production of evidence which is conclusive. I think Mr. Hudson does not over-emphasize the point when he argues that the trial judges before finding that such a charge has been established ought to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.\nI am unable, however, to conclude that this general principle was disregarded by the trial judges. The evidence of Teare and Devlin touching the conversations with the appellant after the election upon the subject of these bills taken together with the respondent's declaration might, I think\u2014if the trial judges accepted, as apparently they did, the evidence of Teare and Devlin as truly relating the incidents of that conversation\u2014not improperly be considered by them to leave no substantial question that the cheques signed by Teare and Devlin had not passed through the hands of the official agent. I think, moreover, that the circumstance that McRitchie was not called by the appellant was a circumstance which they might properly regard as lending some weight in favour of this conclusion. The principle upon which the failure to call a witness may be considered to be a fact weighing in the scale against a party to litigation rests in the first place upon a presumption of that party's probable knowledge of what testimony the witness would be likely to give. I think in all the circumstances and especially having regard to the incidents placed in evidence connected with the redaction of the declaration of expenses that the trial judges did not err in acting upon the presumption that the appellant would probably know the nature of the testimony his official agent would give if he were called as a witness or in inferring that he refrained from calling him because he or his advisers did not think McRitchie's testimony would heighten the prospects of a favourable issue.\nUnder the second head the appellant and his official agent were charged with the corrupt practice of making false declarations respecting election expenses. The declaration of the official agent is said to be false in two particulars, (a) in alleging that certain sums were paid in liquidation of election expenses under the authority of the official agent which in fact were paid without such authority, and (b) in omitting from the statement of expenses set forth in the declaration two specified sums which should have been included therein.\nTo begin with (a). The declaration which was the joint production of the official agent and the appellant, acknowledges the disbursement of the sum of $1,351.05 described as a sum expended \"by paying bills authorized by myself and by cash direct.\" The list of bills making up this aggregate almost in its entirety consists of those sums paid by the cheques signed by Teare and Devlin already referred to. The charge is that the words just quoted necessarily imply an affirmation that these bills were either incurred by the authority of McRitchie or paid by his authority; and that affirmation is alleged to be contrary to the fact and to have been known to be so both by the appellant and by McRitchie. In respect of this charge the finding of the trial judges is against the appellant. The official agent, it appears, had long after the payment of these bills by Teare and Devlin and after the election indorsed them with his initials with the professed object of signifying his assent to them. This was done with the knowledge of the appellant but Mr. McRitchie's approval was not communicated to either Devlin or Teare or to the payees.\nSubsection 9 of section 79 comes into play, I think, when two conditions occur. There must first be a \"false declaration\" respecting election expenses and by that I think is meant a declaration contrary to the fact, and in the second place it must be known that the declaration is contrary to the fact. And the first question which arises at this point is, was there a false declaration\u2014was there an affirmation conveyed by these words which was contrary to the fact? The words do seem very clearly to convey an affirmation either that the bills paid had been authorized by the official agent or that the payment of them had been authorized by him. Now I do not think that such a statement would necessarily involve an affirmation of antecedent authority. In considering for our present purpose this question whether the affirmation was or was not contrary to the fact, we must, I think, do so without regard to any of the provisions of \"The Dominion Elections Act\" and I agree that \"authorized\" does not necessarily mean antecedently \"authorized.\" But it does nevertheless imply something at least amounting to an adoption of what was done, an adoption in the sense of making the act \"authorized\" the official agent's own act and the assumption of responsibility for it. It requires very little argument I think to demonstrate that the indorsement by the agent of his approval on the bills long after the business was closed, long after the bills had been not only incurred but paid and paid by people over whom the official agent had no authority and out of funds over which he had no control and without the knowledge of those who had paid them, could not without abuse of language be described as an act authorizing either the bills or the payment of them.\nThe words quoted then do involve an affirmation contrary to the fact. Is it shewn that the appellant knew it was contrary to the fact? The trial judges have taken the view that this form of language was deliberately adopted by the appellant and his official agent acting in concert, with the object of making it appear that the payments had been made \"by or through\" the official agent in conformity with the law; and that in doing this they both intended, to give a false colour to the transaction referred to and particularized in the declaration.\nThere is some evidence that in framing this part of the declaration the appellant consulted his solicitor and it appears from Devlin's evidence that he told Devlin that this part of the declaration received the form it did in consequence of his solicitor's advice. I do not doubt that if it had appeared to the trial judges that the appellant and his agent, being desirous of honestly complying with the law, had acted in this matter in conformity with legal advice given to them as to the requirements of the law they would under this head have acquitted the appellant of the charge of bad faith.\nBut the question of bad faith or its opposite was in the circumstances largely a question of credibility and I am unable to discover any ground upon which the finding of the learned trial judges could properly be reversed. There is nothing to indicate that they misconstrued the statute or misapprehended the evidence or that they misdirected themselves in any way; while on the other hand there is a circumstance which in considering this branch of the case they could not very well leave out of account, and that is the circumstance that the appellant's solicitor was not called as a witness to support the suggestion that this form of the declaration was prompted by legal advice. The gravity of the charge of bad faith must have been apparent from the outset to the appellant and to his legal advisers and, valuable no doubt as the services of the solicitor at the trial would appear to them to be, the trial judges would, I think, be justified in attaching in this connection no little importance to the circumstances that the testimony of the solicitor himself was not placed before them.\nThe charge founded upon alleged omissions from the declaration by the candidate and the official agent respecting election expenses was held to be established by the learned trial judges who rejected the plea of the appellant that the items to which this charge relates were omitted under the belief that they were not election expenses within the meaning of the Act. One of these payments was a payment for sandwiches provided for scrutineers on election day and the other for the services of the band of the Great War Veterans' Association for performing in celebration of the appellant's victory on the night of the election. If this charge had stood alone it may be that, having regard to the facts deposed to and in view of the absence of a visible motive for putting forward a misleading statement in respect of these payments, the learned trial judges would have been disposed to consider that these omissions had occurred innocently. But the trial judges would no doubt, as they were entitled to do, examine the question in light of the existing intention to mislead they held to be established respecting the statement already discussed touching the payments by Teare and Devlin. Here again I can discover no ground upon which this court would be justified in dissenting from the finding of the primary tribunal.\nAs respects this charge it must further be observed that these payments were made by the official agent, that they were not included in any statement of personal expenses sent to him by the candidate as required by subsection 14 of section 78; that, in the declaration of the official agent in relation to election expenses it is virtually affirmed that no personal expenses of the candidate were paid by the agent; and it is difficult therefore to accept the appellant's explanation of these items on the ground that he considered them to be personal expenses.\nI may add, however, that I can find no evidence in support of the finding that these payments were made in breach of the provisions of subsection 9 of section 78 requiring all expenses to be paid within 50 days after the day on which the candidate was declared elected.\nWith respect to the point raised touching the jurisdiction of the learned trial judges, I think it is sufficient to say that in my judgment, subsection 2 of section 14 of c. 25 of the statute of 1916 very clearly applies and that it is a complete answer to the objection. Such being my views as to the findings of the primary tribunal it becomes necessary to refer to two contentions touching the legal effect of these findings advanced by Mr. Hudson. The first concerns the effect of section 51 of \"The Controverted Elections Act\" (as amended by 11-12 Geo. V, c. 7, sec. 4), which is in these words:\u2014\n51. If it is found by the report of the trial judges that any corrupt practice has been committed by a candidate at an election, or by his agent, whether with or without the actual knowledge and consent of such candidate, or that any illegal practice has been committed by a candidate or by his official agent or by any other agent of the candidate with the actual knowledge and consent of the candidate, the election of such candidate, if he has been elected, shall be void.\nIt is argued that the corrupt practices found and reported by the trial judges both took effect with the making of the declarations of election expenses on February 15th, 1922, two months after the return of the appellant as elected (December 15th, 1921), and it is said to follow that they were not \"committed * * * at an election\" within the meaning of section 51 because by force of section 2 (d) the \"election\" must be considered to come to an end with the making of the last mentioned return. I assume the effect of the statutory provisions mentioned to be that the \"election\" must be considered to have terminated on the date mentioned.\nIt is clear, I think, that the words \"at an election\" are not adverbial words qualifying \"committed\" but that as Mr. Tilley contended the words \"candidate at an election\" together constitute a single substantive description of the candidate, and the condition under which section 51 becomes operative is that the corrupt practice or illegal practice shall have been committed by the candidate or agent as the case may be, as candidate or agent. The same observation applies to section 55. It is plain that the duty of making a declaration under section 79 is a duty imposed on the candidate and agent as such and that a false declaration within the meaning of subsection 9 is deemed to be a corrupt practice committed by the candidate or agent as such. Moreover the illegal practice found to have been committed by Teare and Devlin with the assent of the appellant was indubitably committed by them during election as the agents of the appellant who just as unquestion- ably gave his \"sanction\" to what they did. Subsection 11 of section 78 cannot therefore apply and the necessary consequence is that the learned trial judges rightly held the election to be void.\nThere is no formal declaration by the trial judges in their judgments or in their report as to the disqualification of the appellant or his official agent Their judgment does include the determination of issues raised by charges relating to corrupt practices and illegal practices and their report to the speaker declares the appellant and the official agent to have been guilty of corrupt practices in making false declarations respecting election expenses. The effect of their judgment and report as touching the disqualification of the persons whose conduct was in question is a matter which may be decided if and when the point arises by the application of the relevant statutory law to the facts as found. Mr. Hudson raises a question as to the effect of section 87 of the Dominion Elections Act and argues that, as regards the corrupt practices reported, since the declaration of election expenses was not made until long after the election had terminated, subsection 2 of section 87 does not come into operation, as it only applies where a corrupt practice or illegal practice is reported to the speaker as having been committed \"at an election\"; and since (such is the contention) subsection (c) of section 87 has no application to a finding or decision given upon the trial of an election petition.\nI will not say that there is not here a contention as to the construction and effect of section 87 which though technical is nevertheless legitimate and is at least susceptible of plausible statement. And it is quite clear that as regards the corrupt practices reported they did not occur \"during\" the \"election\" or \"at\" the \"election\" if these phrases are to receive an interpretation derived from section 2 subsection (d) of \"The Dominion Elections Act\" I express, however, no opinion whatever upon Mr. Hudson's argument. Neither the judgment of the trial judges nor the report to the speaker declares in terms that a corrupt practice was committed by the appellant or the official agent either \"at\" or \"during\" the \"election,\" and if and when any question arises as to the disqualification of the appellant by reason of the judgment and report he will have the benefit of the full weight (if any) which his argument may be found to possess.\nIn my opinion this is not a case in which any relief can be granted under section 56 (a) of \"The Controverted Elections Act.\"\nThe finding of the learned judges that the payments to the Paris Cafe and the Great War Veterans Association Band were made after the expiration of 50 days after the declaration of the result of the election should be set aside but subject to that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Robert Milton Johnson, returned as having been elected to the House of Commons for the electoral district of Moose Jaw at the general election held on the 6th of December, 1921, appeals from the decision of an Election Court (Embury and Mackenzie JJ.) finding that he and his official agent had both been guilty of illegal and corrupt practices and declaring his election consequently void. The grounds of appeal are:\n(a) that the Election Court as constituted was without jurisdiction;\n(b) that the corrupt practices found are not proper subjects of a petition under \"The Controverted Elections Act\";\n(c) that the evidence does not support the findings made; and\n(d) that the acts found, so far as the evidence supports them, are not valid grounds for avoiding the election.\n(a) The jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan by \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act\" (R.S.C., 1906, c. 7, s. 2 (viii)), as amended by the statutes of 1915, c. 13, s. 1, is transferred to the judges of the Court of Appeal and of the Court of the King's Bench for Saskatchewan by c. 25, s. 1, s.s. 2 of the statutes of 1916. The judges who constituted the Election Court were judges of the Court of King's Bench of Saskatchewan duly nominated under s. 4 of that statute, and as such had jurisdiction to try this election petition. (b) Section 11 of \"The Controverted Elections Act\" of 1906 (R.S.C., c. 7) was repealed and a section to replace it enacted by c. 13, s. 4, of the statutes of 1915. Under this substituted section the unlawful or corrupt acts charged may properly form the subject of an election petition.\n(c) The learned trial judges expressly avowed their confidence in the testimony of the two chief witnesses for the petitioners, Teare and Devlin, and quite as explicitly indicated their disbelief of that given by the appellant when in conflict with it. Upon that basis they have found and certified that the appellant was guilty of corrupt or illegal practices in authorizing the payment of certain of his election expenses otherwise than by or through his official agent in contravention of s. 78 (3) of \"The Dominion Elections Act\"; in causing an untrue return to be made by his official agent (importing the authorization by such agent of the payments so made) in contravention of s. 79 (1) of the said Act; in knowingly making a false declaration of the correctness of the said return in contravention of s. 79 (3) of the same statute; in causing the omission from his official agent's said return of two items of election expenses payment of which was made by him through such agent; and in knowingly making a false declaration that the total amount paid by him to his official agent was $677, whereas (including the said two items) he actually paid to his said agent the sum of $765. The learned judges also found and certified that the official agent, one Frank McRitchie, had been a party to, and was therefore likewise guilty of, the above corrupt or illegal practices.\nA study of the evidence does not enable me to say that the appreciation of the credibility of the respective witnesses by the learned trial judges should not be accepted; neither does it disclose any ground which would justify a reversal of the findings of fact set out in their certificate.\nCounsel for the appellant urged that one of the two items above mentioned as having been paid through the official agent and omitted from his return\u2014$68 for the services of a band on the evening of polling day\u2014should not properly be classed as an election expense. The statute (s. 79 (1) (a)) expressly requires that the official agent's return shall contain detailed statements of \"all payments made by the official agent.\" I can see no justification for omitting this item from the official agent's return of \"election expenses.\" The evidence rather indicates that it was so omitted deliberately and because in the opinion of the candidate and some of his friends it was thought advisable to conceal it.\nI am of the opinion that it is not possible upon the record before us to set aside any of the findings made by the learned trial judges except that contained in their \"determination,\" but not in their certificate, that the Paris Caf\u00e9 account and the Pearce Band account were paid more than fifty days after the respondent was declared elected contrary to s. 78 (9) of the statute. The evidence does not appear clearly to support that finding.\n(d) That the findings so made justified the \"determination\" that the election of the appellant was void I think admits of no doubt. The acts found to have been committed are declared to be, some of them illegal practices (\"Dominion Elections Act,\" s. 78 (4) (7)), and others corrupt practices (\"Dominion Elections Act,\" s. 79 (9) ; \"Controverted Elections Act,\" s. 2 (f). Those acts having been committed by \"a candidate at an election\" who has been declared elected, and also by his official agent, s. 51 of \"The Controverted Elections Act,\" (1921, c. 7, s. 4), clearly voids the election. Parliament in its wisdom and after long experience has attached that consequence to corrupt practices and illegal acts such as the appellant and his official agent are found to have committed. We have no discretion in the matter. Our plain duty is to administer the law as we find it.\nCounsel for the appellant pressed for a declaration that his client is not subject to the personal disqualification provided for by sections 39 (a) and 87 of the Elections Act. But that question is really not before us. The learned judges of the Election Court have not certified to such disqualification. They have found certain facts and have determined that upon the facts so found the appellant's election is void and they have certified these findings as required by the Controverted Elections Act, s. 68. On the present appeal from the judgment of the Election Court it is not part of our duty, as I understand it, and it would therefore be an impertinence, to express an opinion whether the findings so made and certified entail disqualification of the appellant. While that may follow as a consequence, it is not so held in the judgment of the Election Court. Upon the correctness of that judgment\u2014and upon that only\u2014are we called upon to pass.\nI would for these reasons dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The first question we have to decide is whether the judges of the Court of King's Bench of Saskatchewan have jurisdiction to try Dominion election petitions.\nBy virtue of the provisions of \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act,\" as amended in 1915, the court which had jurisdiction over such election petitions was the Supreme Court of the province.\nIn the same year, 1915, the legislature of the province passed an Act providing for the abolition upon proclamation of its Supreme Court and for the creation, also upon proclamation, of a new court of original jurisdiction to be called the Court of King's Bench,\nThe proclamation provided by the provincial Act having been issued the Supreme Court, which had jurisdiction over election petitions, was abolished, and the Court of King's Bench was established.\nThe judges who tried this case are judges of this Court of King's Bench, and it is contended by the appellant that they had no jurisdiction.\nI would have been inclined to agree with the appellant on this point if it were not for the Dominion statute passed in 1916 which declared (ch. 25, sect. 14, s.s. 2), that if under any statute of Canada jurisdiction is given to the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan this jurisdiction can be exercised by the Court of King's Bench.\nThis federal legislation of 1916 removes all doubts as to the question of jurisdiction. Under \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act,\" the judges of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan had exclusive jurisdiction to try petitions concerning elections held for the Dominion Parliament in that province. But this jurisdiction, by virtue of the Act of 1916, can now be exercised by the judges of the Court of King's Bench.\nThe most important point in this case is whether the appellant Johnson has been properly found guilty of a corrupt practice which rendered his election void.\nIt is alleged that he has made a false return of his election expenses.\nThe evidence shows that a Mr. McRitchie had been appointed by the candidate Johnson as his official agent, that on the 28th of November, 1921, between the nomination and the polling day, cheques were issued by the Moose Jaw Constituency Committee of the Progressive party for the payment of certain election expenses to the amount of $1,351.05 which had been incurred by Mr. Johnson; that the cheques were paid without the knowledge of the official agent; that the officers of the committee having discovered that they had acted illegally in not having these payments made by the official agent (as provided by sec. 78 (3), \"Dominion Elections Act\") notified Mr. Johnson of their mistake; and that the agent, on the advice of the candidate, declared in his return of expenses that these payments of $1,351.05 had been authorized by him.\nIt is in evidence also that two other bills were sent to the agent, one of $20 claimed by the Paris Caf\u00e9 for lunches supplied to the scrutineers of Mr. Johnson, and the other of $68 for the services of a band on the night of the election, and that these two bills, though received before the return of the election expenses, were not mentioned in it. It is contended by the appellant that these two bills were not election expenses.\nThese bills having been paid by the official agent, I cannot very easily follow the argument that they were not election expenses. These scrutineers, to whom lunches had been supplied, were doing some work for the benefit of the appellant's election. In fact, this item was not included because he feared that these lunches could not be considered as legitimate expenses. I would not say that they were or were not legitimate election expenses\u2014we are not called upon to decide that\u2014but they have been incurred in connection with the election and it was the imperative duty of the agent and of the candidate to mention them in the return (sect. 79 s.s. 1-3 of \"The Dominion Elections Act\".)\nIt cannot be disputed also that the services of a band on the night of an election are expenses incurred in connection with the election.\nThe failure of the agent and of the candidate to include in their return these two bills for the payment of which money had been supplied by the candidate himself render them guilty of corrupt practices under sect. 79, ss. 9, which says:\nIf a candidate or official agent knowingly makes a false declaration respecting election expenses, he is guilty of a corrupt practice.\nAs to the declaration in the return that the payment of $1,351.05 made by the Progressive Committee of Moose Jaw was made with the authorization of McRitchie, I am obliged to declare that it is not a true declaration.\nThe return of election expenses must give to the public a full and complete disclosure of all expenses and claims made by or to a candidate in connection with the election. Parliament requires by its legislation that the public should know exactly what has been received and expended in each constituency. The return should mirror the manner in which the electoral compaign has been conducted. If illegal acts have been committed so much the worse for the candidate. Of course, errors and omissions might occur, but then the courts are authorized to be lenient and not to condemn for trivial things (1921, ch. 7, s. 7.)\nIn this case I would have been for my part willing to exercise my discretion in favour of the appellant if he had declared the facts as they had occurred. It was evidently a mistake which was made by the officers of the Moose Jaw Committee when they issued cheques for these bills; but they were under the impression that being an incorporated association for political purposes they could pay legitimate election expenses (article 10, \"Dominion Elections Act\".) They had not thought of the fact that their powers were restricted to contributions for election purposes and that expenses incurred in a constituency should be paid by the official agent (section 78, subsection 3). If the agent or candidate had reported in his statement the facts as they really occurred, then the appellant could have invoked the application of the statute of 1921; but no, they tried to prove that these payments had been authorized by the official agent when the evidence shows that he knew of them only long after. I admit the law is very severe; but if the agents or the candidates are candid and truthful and if the election has been carried out honestly there is no I fear; the courts will not condemn for trivial things omitted.\nThese returns of expenses must be certified under oath and the agent and the candidate should always respect the sanctity of the oath.\nFor these reasons the finding of the trial judges that the appellant was guilty of corrupt practices is right and their report should be confirmed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The election petition of the respondents complaining of the return of the appellant as a member elected to represent the electoral district of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, in the House of Commons of Canada, was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice Embury and the Honourable Mr. Justice Mackenzie, two of the justices of the Court of King's Bench for the province of Saskatchewan. The question of their jurisdiction to try this petition was raised before them, but the objection was finally rejected and the trial proceeded to judgment.\nThe petition having been maintained the appellant now appeals to this court and again raises the question of the jurisdiction of the learned trial judges. In my opinion, whatever doubts may have been created by the language of the provincial statute under the terms of which the Court of King's Bench replaced the Supreme Court of the province, no possible question as to the jurisdiction of the learned judges to try this petition can arise in view of the unequivocal enactment of subsection 2 of section 14 of chapter 25 of the Statutes of Canada for 1916 \"The Judges Act.\" I would therefore dismiss this objection as unfounded.\nOn the merits I am of opinion that the judgment is well founded and that the appeal should be dismissed. Notwithstanding Mr. Hudson's very able argument I must hold that the appellant, as found by the learned trial judges, made a false declaration of expenses within the meaning of the \"Dominion Elections Act,\"\nMr. Hudson argued that the words contained in the declaration of expenses\nby paying bills authorized by myself and by cash directly\nwere not false because the appellant's official agent, McRitchie, authorized the payment of these accounts which were paid by cheques issued directly to the payees by Teare and Devlin. McRitchie was not called at the trial, so Mr. Hudson could not go further than to contend that the declaration of expenses shows that McRitchie had authorized these payments. However, when they issued their cheques Teare and Devlin, respectively the president and secretary-treasurer of the incorporated association which furnished funds for the appellant's election expenses, did not even know McRitchie. And what the statute requires is that election expenses be paid \"by and through\" the official agent. The payments here were made by and through an association whose cheques were issued and made payable directly to the creditors of the accounts, and not by and through the official agent. If the words I have quoted from the declaration of expenses imply that these payments were made by and through McRitchie, they are false, and if they mean that McRitchie merely authorized the payment made with these cheques they are equally untrue, for McRitchie was not present at the meeting of the 28th November, 1921, when the payments were authorized and the cheques signed. The appellant said that McRitchie initialled the vouchers on the 28th January, the day he prepared the return of expenses, but this does not show that he authorized the payments when they were made, much less that these payments were made by or through him. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the peculiar wording of the declaration was suggested by the desire to cover up something or to conceal the real truth. My opinion is that it was a false declaration.\nMoreover the payment of two accounts, those for the band on the night of the election and for the luncheons furnished to the scrutineers in the polling stations, is not mentioned in the declaration of expenses. As a matter of fact, these accounts, which were for election expenses, especially the account for luncheons, were paid after the preparation of the return of election expenses by the appellant and McRitchie, but before it was sworn to, and appear to have been paid with moneys furnished by the former to the latter. This payment, the trial judges say, was made more than fifty days after the day the appellant was declared elected, and they add that it was thus an illegal practice of the appellant and his official agent under subsection 9 of section 78 of \"The Dominion Elections Act.\" The evidence is not clear as to the date when the band account and the account for luncheons were paid. As to the former account, the appellant says it was paid by cheque dated January 31st and passed through the bank on February 7th. The account for luncheons was apparently paid in money, the appellant having furnished $10 on two different occasions to his official agent for that purpose.\nBy knowingly making a false declaration respecting election expenses, the appellant and McRitchie were guilty of a \"corrupt practice\" (\"Dominion Elections Act,\" section 79, subsection 9) and, under section 51 of \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act,\" the election is void. The commission of an illegal practice by the candidate or his official agent entails the same consequence. The appellant was certainly \"a candidate at an election\" within the meaning of section 51.\nThe appellant asked that he be given the benefit of section 56a of \"The Dominion Controverted Elections Act\" which permits the Court or the trial judges to relieve the candidate or the official agent from the consequence of an illegal practice, where the commission of the illegal practice did not arise from any want of good faith. This application was refused by the learned trial judges who in their reasons for judgment said:\u2014\nWe do not see that we can extend the benefit of this section to the respondent (now the appellant) in the present circumstances, primarily because we do not think that he has satisfied the onus cast upon him of proving his good faith.\nThis declaration of the learned trial judges places the appellant in a most disadvantageous position when he again before this court applies to be given the benefit of section 56a. And I cannot see my way to grant his application. The learned counsel of both the appellant and the respondents appeared to be of the opinion that the result of the judgment of the trial court would be the disqualification of the appellant and his official agent. Mr. Tilley for the respondents very chivalrously did not insist on this personal disqualification, being satisfied with the avoidance of the election. But if personal disqualification be the legal effect of finding the appellant and McRitchie guilty of a corrupt practice under \"The Dominion Elections Act,\" section 39, the court would be powerless to interfere. Disqualification is not declared in terms in the judgment appealed from, and I express no opinion on the question whether it was incurred. The matter rests on the proper construction and effect of section 39.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. E. Gregory.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J. W. Corman.\n[1] [1922] 3 W.W.R. 328.\n"}

Earl (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1923: February 7, 8; 1923: April 3.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA\nNegligence\u2014Railways\u2014Accident\u2014Level crossing\u2014Switching operations\u2014 Breach of order of Railway Commissioners\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014 Defence available. In an action for damages brought by a person struck by a moving train when using a level crossing on a highway, the trial judge found that the railway company, in causing one of its switching trains to pass over the crossing, had acted in contravention of an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners; but he also found the injured person guilty of contributory negligence.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the railway company was not liable; its disregard of the board's order did not preclude its setting up as a defence the contributory negligence of the respondent, and it was not proved that the railway company's servants by the exercise of ordinary care and caution could have avoided the consequences of the respondent's negligence.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1922] 3 W.W.R. 406) reversed, Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Harvey C. J.[2], and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nMaclean K.C. for the appellant. The train movement was not one impliedly prohibited by the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners. Even if the train had no right to cross the highway at the time, or if there should have been a watchman stationed on the crossing, the respondent, after knowing that the train did intend to cross, proceeded recklessly and carelessly into a dangerous place and should be held the author of his misfortune; and the judgment should have given effect to the respondent's negligence. Ford K.C. for the respondent. The respondent was not guilty of contributory negligence, and the railway company acted illegally and in contravention of the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow this appeal with costs throughout concurring in the reasons therefor stated by my brothers Anglin and Mignault.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appellate company was disobeying the enactments of the order of the Railway Commission as to the hours within which shunting might be carried on in the locality where the accident occurred, and in requiring the presence of a watchman. I do not think it follows, however, that the company's cars were such an unlawful (i.e. destitute of statutory authority) obstruction of the street traffic as to constitute what should be described as in point of law a nuisance, nor do I think the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher [3] comes into play; otherwise I should have thought it necessary to consider carefully the question whether the doctrine of contributory negligence applied. I think the charge against the company must be based upon the proposition that they were improperly and in violation of the order working their railway. Section 345 of the Railway Act has not been construed as enacting that a railway company should be responsible for all damages resulting in part through the negligence of the victim and in part through such disobedience. It is settled that in those provinces in which the doctrine of contributory negligence is part of the law, as a general rule it must be applied for the purpose of determining whether an injury arising wholly or in part from a contravention by a railway company of the provisions of The Railway Act or of an order made under the authority of the Act respecting the management of its trains is actionable. The Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. McAlpine[4]; Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Smith[5]. This is one of those cases that sometimes cause one to turn a rather wistful eye to jurisdictions in which where injury results from the combined negligence or misconduct of the plaintiff and the defendant, the burden of the loss can be equitably distributed. But where the English doctrine of contributory negligence reigns, a tribunal assessing damages in such circumstances must find the defendant responsible for the whole of the loss or for none.\nThe House of Lords unanimously affirmed the view expressed by the Lord Chancellor in Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute[6], that the question of contributory negligence should be dealt with somewhat broadly and upon common-sense principles, as a jury would probably deal with it. The general rule has usually been put in accordance with this sentence from the judgment of Lindley L.J., in \"The Bernina\"[7]:\nI take it to be settled that an action at common law by A against B for injury directly caused to A by the want of care of A and B will not lie.\n(Dowell v. General Steam Navigation Co.[8]; Walton v. The London, Brighton and South Coast Ry. Co.[9]; The Bernina (2) ). As Lord Sumner said, in his judgment in Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[10]:\nDirect cause excludes what is indirect, conveys the essential distinction, which causa causans and causa sine qua non rather cumbrously indicate, and is consistent with the possibility of the concurrence of more direct causes than one, operating at the same time and leading to a common result.\nThe rule thus broadly stated must be supplemented, of course, by the judgment of Lord Penzance in Radley v. London & North Western Ry. Co. [11] as interpreted in British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Loach[12]; but I cannot help thinking that there has been a tendency to over-refinement in the application of the law which has led to a good deal of confusion and uncertainty.\nWith the greatest respect for the courts below, my conclusion is that this case comes within the class of cases envisaged by Lord Cairns in Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[13]. I repeat the sentence, which has many times been approved and applied, e.g., in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. McAlpine[14], and Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Frechette[15], by the Judicial Committee; and in The Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Smith[16].\nIf a railway train, which ought to whistle when passing through a station, were to pass through without whistling and a man were, in broad daylight, without anything in the structure of the line or otherwise to obstruct his view, to cross in front of the advancing train and be killed, i should think the judge ought to tell the jury that it was the folly and recklessness of the man and not the carelessness of the company which caused his death.\nThe violation of the restriction as to hours may be left out of account, obviously. As to the watchman, I doubt very much indeed if the facts would justify a finding that the presence of a watchman would probably have saved the respondent. At all events I am quite clear that the object of having a watchman is to warn people that they are in presence of a railway and that the tracks are in use, to call their attention to the risks in order to give them an opportunity of exercising that prudence which people usually display in such circumstances; and not at all to protect people by forcible means from the consequences of their own folly and recklessness in refusing to take warning and observe the usual precautions in the presence of such risks.\nThe respondent's miscalculation (I assume there was a miscalculation) is, I think, of no importance. His fault was in his heedless inattention to the risks of a situation which would have awakened the attention and the care of any ordinarily careful person. Miscalculation was inexcusable in the circumstances.\nTo distinguish this case from the hypothetical case put by Lord Cairns or from the case of Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Smith (4), or, indeed, from a number of other authorities which could be named would, I think, with the greatest respect, be approaching perilously near to frittering away the substance of the doctrine which it is the duty of the court to apply; and unless the language of the rule that a plaintiff cannot recover when carelessness is in part the \"direct\" cause of the accident is to be interpreted with no regard whatever to the meaning of the words em- ployed, I cannot understand an affirmation that the respondent is not within it. The case is not at all like Slattery's Case[17] in the view Lord Cairns took of it (as well as Lord Penzance), namely, that notwithstanding the plaintiff's want of due care and attention in the presence of a railway, the blowing of a whistle might (in the opinion of the jury) have awakened his attention to the fact that a train was approaching; nor like the Ottawa Electric Ry. Co. v. Booth[18], where the driver of one street car, meeting and passing another which was stopping to enable passengers to alight, proceeded without sounding his bell in order to give warning to passengers who most probably would be passing around the rear of the other car, oblivious of the peril arising from the fact that they were about to encounter a car moving on another track. Nor is it like Long v. Toronto Ry. Co.[19], where the driver of the car saw a pedestrian, evidently in a state of abstraction, about to pass in front of his car and negligently failed to take in due time proper measures to avoid him; nor has it any resemblance to Loach's Case[20].\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant railway company appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta affirming the judgment of Harvey C. J. awarding the plaintiff $3,850 as damages for personal injuries sustained at a level crossing in the City of Edmonton.\nBy an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners the defendant company was required to carry out its switching movements over the crossing in question between the hours of 1 o'clock and 2.30 o'clock p.m., and the hours of 9 o'clock p.m. and 6 o'clock a.m., and to keep a watchman on duty to protect the crossing during the periods when switching operations should be carried on. The plaintiff was injured by an engine engaged in switching operations at 6.30 o'clock p.m. on the 5th July, 1921. No watchman was on duty at the time. I am satisfied that the defend- ant's train which injured the plaintiff was unlawfully passing over the crossing and that liability for the injury done him would therefore be clear if contributory negligence, of which he has been found guilty, had not deprived him of the right to recover.\nI cannot, however, accede to the suggestion that section 310 (1) of the Railway Act (1919, c. 68) required that a person should be stationed on the tender of the engine to warn persons crossing or about to cross the railway. That provision applies only to \"any train not headed by an engine.\" The train in question was so headed, although the engine was moving reversely.\nFor the plaintiff it is urged that he was not guilty of contributory negligence; that, if he was, the defendant could nevertheless by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the consequences of his negligence and that contributory negligence is not available as a defence to a claim for injury caused by a defendant when acting in violation of a statutory prohibition.\nThe learned judge found the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence in not taking reasonable care to avoid placing himself in the way of the train which he admitted he knew was about to pass over the crossing. After a careful study of the evidence I am satisfied that this finding must stand. The learned Chief Justice, however, held that the defendant was nevertheless liable on the ground that\na watchman standing to guard the track and warn approaching passengers, if properly performing his duties, would almost certainly have observed and warned the plaintiff in time to prevent the accident.\nWith very great respect I cannot accept that finding, notwithstanding the approval of it by the Appellate Division. It is, I fear, purely a conjecture that a watchman could have effected what the fireman shouting from the approaching engine failed to accomplish. The plaintiff was either so intent on guiding his bicycle or so absent-minded that he failed to heed the fireman's warning. It seems to me to be more than probable that a watchman's flagging or shouting would have been likewise unheeded.\nThe plaintiff's negligence continued up to the moment of the impact; so much so that at the trial he could not himself say whether the train hit him or he hit the train It is a fair conclusion from the evidence that, after the likelihood of his putting himself in danger was or should have been apparent to employees of the defendant, they could not have avoided the consequence of his rashness and that they had not incapacitated themselves from doing so by anything they had done or omitted to do, except engaging in the illegal switching operation. This case in my opinion does not fall within the principle of the decision in British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Loach[21].\nThe negligent running into danger of the unfortunate plaintiff, if not the sole proximate cause of his being injured, was at least a contributing cause quite as proximate and immediate as the breach of the order of the board by the defendants. Indeed I might, if necessary, require to consider carefully whether the unlawful conduct of the defendant was not merely a condition of the accident rather than a cause of it in the legal sense. The injury to the plaintiff can scarcely be attributed to the unlawful quality of the defendant's act in carrying on switching operations during prohibited hours. But see Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute[22]. If the unlawful switching should be regarded as a contributing cause, the accident was the result of the joint fault of the defendant and the plaintiff; without the negligence of the latter operating as a causa causans it could not have happened. There is therefore no cause of action. Wakelin v. London & South Western Ry. Co. [23] per Brett M.R.\nNor does the fact that the plaintiffs were using the highway crossing in violation of a statutory prohibition exclude the defence of contributory negligence. That question has been before the English and the Ontario courts several times and, with the possible exception of a dissenting judgment by Meredith C.J. C.P., in Godfrey v. Cooper[24], cited by Mr. Ford, judicial opinion has been uniform in this sense.\nIn the case referred to, Riddell J. and Middleton J., with whom Latchford J. concurred, cite with approval Walton v. Vanguard Motor Bus Co.[25], where Lord Alver- stone C.J., dealing with a case in which a lamp standard unlawfully placed on a footpath had been negligently run against and damaged by the defendants, said:\nThe defendants were not entitled to raise the point that the lamppost was an object they were entitled to knock down without being held liable for negligence.\nIn Deyo v. Kingston & Pembroke Ry. Co.[26], this question was squarely presented for decision. The defendants, in violation of a prohibitive section of the Railway Act, were using freight cars of a height which did not allow an open and clear headway of 7 feet between the top of the cars and the bottom of the lower beams of a bridge over the railway. A brakesman, who was on the top of a moving freight car contrary to a rule of the defendant company, was killed by coming in contact with this overhead bridge. An action brought by his representative failed. Osier J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:\nThere remains the question whether the violation of the statutory duty of the defendants under the other section was the proximate cause of the death of the deceased; or whether this must not be said to have been wholly owing to his own unfortunate neglect of the rules of the company. I feel compelled to say, that on this ground the defence has been made out and that the action must fail. Even to an action founded on the breach of a statutory duty contributory negligence may be a defence, as we constantly see in actions arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act or the Factory Act. Groves v. Wimborne[27]. A fortiori, it must be an answer to such an action that the injury was caused by the deceased's own act or omission; that it was caused by or could not have happened but for the servant's direct disobedience of some order or rule of his employers, intended though that may have been to prevent accidents arising from the continued failure of the latter to perform their statutory duty.\nIn Groves v. Wimborne 27 it was held that the defence of common employment is not available to a master where breach of an absolute duty imposed on him by statute has caused injury to his servant. Vaughan-Williams L.J., in his judgment in the Court of Appeal said, at p. 419:\nNo one would contend, if there were contributory negligence, that such negligence on the part of the plaintiff would not be an answer to a claim by him for damages in respect of an injury occasioned through the neglect of his master to perform the absolute statutory duty. It would be an answer for the reason that in fact the damage to the plaintiff would not be caused by the failure of the master to perform the absolute statutory duty, because it would not have happened but for that and something else, namely, the contributory negligence of the plaintiff. In Blenkinsop v. Ogden[28], Kennedy J., sitting in a Divisional Court, said that\nIn an action by an injured person for damages his own contributory negligence would be an answer upon the ground that the immediate and direct cause of the mischief would be his own conduct and not the occupier's neglect to fence.\nIles v. Abercarn Welsh Flannel Co. [29] was also a case of injury through a breach of statutory duty to fence off machinery. A Divisional Court (Mathew and A. L. Smith JJ.) dismissed an appeal by the defendants holding that there was no evidence of contributory negligence, but\nintimated that the holding of the county court judge, that the defendants, having been guilty of a breach of a statutory duty, could not set up a defence of contributory negligence by the plaintiff, was wrong.\nIn Britton v. Great Western Cotton Co.[30], another case of unfenced machinery, the unsuccessful defence was based on \"volenti non fit injuria.\" Channel B., in the course of his judgment, expressed his agreement with the distinction drawn between a statutory and common law liability,\nnot by any means questioning the proposition, however, that in either case contributory negligence on the part of the person injured would afford a defence;\nand Piggott B. said:\nIt seems that even although there may be a statutory duty, imposed on the employer, the workman must still be careful of his own safety. In this case there is nothing to shew that the deceased knowingly incurred the danger, or was guilty of any want of care, and the defendants, therefore, ought to bear the consequences of their own clear neglect of duty.\nIn Kelly v. Glebe Sugar Refining Co. [31] Lord Adam, in delivering the unanimous judgment of the First Division of the Court of Sessions, treated contributory negligence as a defence that would have been available if established.\nIn Caswell v. Worth[32], a plea admitting that a shaft, in which the plaintiff was injured, was not fenced as required by the Factory Act, but alleging as contributory negligence that the plaintiff had himself set the machinery in motion contrary to an express order, was sustained on demurrer by a court consisting of Lord Campbell C.J., Coleridge, Wightman and Crompton JJ. The weight of American authority is to the same effect. The cases will be found noted in 29 Cyc, p. 508, under the text:\nContributory negligence will defeat recovery, even though the negligent act consisted in the violation of a statute or ordinance, and though such violation is held to be negligence per se.\nA very recent American decision to that effect is, Ebling v. Nielsen et al[33].\nAlthough none of the cases I have cited is binding on this court, the weight of judicial opinion which they present cannot be disregarded. So long as we are governed by the English doctrine of contributory negligence no sound reason can in my opinion be advanced for holding that defence inadmissible where the defendant's fault consists in the violation of a statutory duty. On the other hand, the present case illustrates the harshness of the rule by which, where there is common fault contributing to cause injury to a plaintiff, he is deprived of all redress and the defendant entirely relieved, although the culpability of the former may be comparatively slight and that of the latter distinctly gross. The doctrine of the civil law that in such circumstances the damages should be divided in proportion to the degree of culpability commends itself to my judgment as much more equitable.\nThe appeal must in my opinion be allowed and the action dismissed. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout, should it see fit to exact them.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014This is a railway accident at a level crossing at Edmonton. There are no less than six tracks crossing the street; some are main tracks and some are used for switching operations. The latter should be used according to the order of the Railway Board during the night only and during one hour of day-time. However the appellant company disregarded this order of the Railway Board and during the prohibited time was having a reversed engine with a few cars passing on the switching tracks and had no flagman and nobody on the tender to give warning. Earl, who was on a bicycle, saw the train; but having the impression that it would continue across the street in the direction in which it was proceeding when he saw it, he tried to reach a track on which he did not expect that the car would pass; but he came into collision with it and was hurt.\nHis action is to recover damages resulting from his disability, which was estimated at 35 per cent.\nThe courts below maintained his action for $3,850. The railway company is appealing; and Earl asks by a cross-appeal that the damages be increased to $5,993.61,\nIt is pretty evident that this level crossing is a very dangerous one. It is at a place where there is a very heavy traffic and it is no wonder that the company, when it applied for a level crossing, was ordered by the Railway Board not to carry out any switching operations during the day, except for one hour and a half, and that a signal man be provided to watch the crossing.\nHowever the company completely disregarded this order and was carrying out shunting operations at a prohibited hour without having a flagman to give warning to the public. Besides, in the evidence given by the engineer of the train, it is admitted that a man on the front of the tender would have had a better chance of warning a victim than a man in the cab.\nThe finding on the facts was on the whole in favour of the plaintiff and is to the effect that he did not go on the track deliberately.\nBut, besides that, the defendant company had no right to be on this street at this hour of the day when the accident occurred. It deliberately violated the law as laid down by the Railway Board and it should not be entitled to avail itself of the error of judgment which might have been committed by a person who had a right to be there.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAs to the cross-appeal, we do not interfere in this court with the amount of damages granted by the courts below except in very exceptional circumstances which I do not see in the present case.\nThe cross-appeal should be also dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Questions involving the application of the rule of contributory negligence are of much nicety and con siderable difficulty and it is not easy to frame a satisfactory formula which can be applied in the almost infinite variety of circumstances where the rule is invoked. (See the article of Lord Justice O'Connor in The Quarterly Review, vol. 38, p. 17.) If I may say so, the doctrine of the civil law, in force in the province of Quebec and also adopted in admiralty matters, is much more equitable, for where there is common fault the liability of each party is measured by his degree of culpability. This prevents the negligent defendant from entirely escaping punishment because the plaintiff, in a greater or less degree, has contributed by his negligence to the accident. However this is a matter for the consideration of the law-maker, for the courts are obliged to apply the law however harsh it may seem.\nSave some statements by two or three witnesses to which apparently the learned trial judge gave no weight, there is no dispute as to the material facts. The respondent is a stenographer and book-keeper, and at half-past six of the evening of July 5, 1921, in bright daylight, was riding a bicycle north on 96th Street in the city of Edmonton, approaching the crossing of 105th Avenue, which runs east and west, while the direction of 96th Street is north and south. The centre portion only of 96th Street is paved. The tracks of the appellant's railway cross 96th Street on the level almost at its intersection with 105th Avenue and thence proceed in a northeasterly direction. To the west of 96th Street and at a distance of about one hundred yards are the freight sheds of the appellant. As the respondent approached the crossing, he saw a train of ten loaded freight cars headed by an engine placed reversely, that is to say tender in front, moving in an easterly direction from the freight sheds towards the crossing of 96th Street, and he says he assumed that it would cross the latter street and intended to wait until it had passed. He had all the more reason for waiting because he saw another train approaching the crossing from the east. He had been riding along the paved strip, but as he came near the crossing a motor car in front of him stopped at the tracks, and then backed a few feet, and the respondent left the paved strip and crossed diagonally and in a northeasterly direction over a somewhat muddy portion of the street, for it had been raining, no doubt intending to go on to the sidewalk and wait there. This brought him to the right and to the east of the motor car, which had its top up and may have obstructed his view of the freight train approaching from the west, the more so as the diagonal direction he was following towards the sidewalk possibly caused him to turn his back to the train. The muddy condition of the roadway he was thus crossing diagonally must have absorbed all his attention, for when he reached the sidewalk he was on the railway track and was struck while still on his bicycle by the tender of the engine and very seriously injured. The train that struck him was shunting and moving at about five miles an hour, the engine's bell constantly ringing. It was stopped within about forty feet.\nAn important point to be considered is that under an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners of June, 1914, the appellant was authorized to construct, maintain and operate ladder tracks across Kinistine Avenue (now 96th Street), but switching movements were authorized only between the hours of 1 and 2.30 p.m. and between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. and a watchman was ordered to be provided, at the expense of the appellant, to protect the crossing during the periods that switching operations were being carried on. There was no watchman at the crossing when the accident happened and the shunting itself was at an unauthorized and impliedly prohibited time.\nThe learned trial judge, speaking of the respondent's conduct, said:\u2014\nI can see no explanation of his conduct consistent with reasonable care and I think he was guilty of negligence in riding on to the track blindly in this way knowing as he did that a train was approaching the crossing.\nNotwithstanding this finding of contributory negligence on the part of the respondent, the learned trial judge nevertheless condemned the appellant on the ground that it should have had a watchman at the crossing, who, had he been there, might have warned the respondent of his danger. This reason, with deference, appears to me unsatisfactory, for the watchman, to be of any use, would have had to be stationed between the tracks to stop traffic on both sides of the crossing, and therefore at some distance from the point where the respondent was struck. It further seems entirely a matter of conjecture whether a warning from a watchman so placed would have prevented the respondent from going on to the track, for the fireman of the approaching engine, when not further away than the watchman would have been, loudly shouted to him to stop and the warning was unheard or unheeded by the respondent.\nIn the appellate court, Mr. Justice Stuart was of opinion that while the reasons of the learned trial judge were quite sufficient, they were not nearly as strong as they might have been. In his opinion, the appellant's train was crossing the highway illegally, and in so crossing struck the respondent who had the right to be there, and he felt great reluctance under these circumstances in going very far with any doctrine of contributory negligence. Mr. Justice Beck and Mr. Justice Clark adopted the reasons of the trial judge.\nA point urged by the respondent is that the appellant should have placed a man on the foremost part of the tender to warn persons on the highway. This turns on the proper construction of section 310 of The Railway Act of 1919, and inasmuch as the train was headed by an engine, although the engine was moving tender first, I do not think the section applies. Any possible warning that could have been given by a man so placed was in fact shouted to the respondent by the fireman of the engine, but to no effect.\nAs the failure to have a watchman at the crossing or a man on the foremost part of the tender does not afford a satisfactory basis for the judgment rendered against the appellant, there only remains the question whether, assuming the appellant violated a statutory prohibition in carrying on shunting operations at an unauthorized hour, it can escape liability by reason of the contributory negligence of the respondent. In other words, is the contributory negligence of the plaintiff a valid defence where the injury was caused by the defendant in the course of the performance of an illegal act?\nI do not think the defence of contributory negligence is excluded in a case like this one. It is true that proof of the breach of a statutory prohibition or of a statutory duty relieves the plaintiff from the necessity of alleging or proving negligence. But it is not enough to find that the defendant was negligent, for, if the plaintiff was himself guilty of negligence which caused the accident or which contributed thereto, he cannot recover damages from the defendant, unless, in the language of Lord Atkinson in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McAlpine[34],\nit be shewn that the defendant could by the exercise of ordinary care and caution on his part have avoided the consequences of the plaintiff's negligence.\nThere only remains the question whether the appellant's servants by the exercise of ordinary care and caution could have avoided the consequences of the respondent's negligence?\nThe fireman of the engine was riding on the south side or on that side which gave him a view of anything approaching the track from the south. He says he was looking to the east, that is to say in the direction the train was moving.\nAs I have stated, the respondent passed to the right of the motor car which had stopped on the paved portion of the street and which was between him and the train, his attention apparently being entirely directed towards the muddy road he was crossing in his effort to reach the sidewalk. I will quote from the fireman's testimony with whose evidence, as well as with that of the engineer, the learned trial judge stated he was particularly impressed:\u2014\nQ. If you can tell me, as near as possible, whereabouts was your cab when you first saw the plaintiff?\u2014A. Pretty nearly the west side of the crossing.\nQ. And where was the plaintiff when you first saw him?\u2014A. He came from around that first automobile. There were two automobiles; one was on the paved road a little way back from the track, and the other one was on the side, that is the west side of the street, but he came from this first one and tried to make across the tracks.\nQ. He was going north?\u2014A. He was going north.\nQ. And east of the far auto?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And you first saw him when?\u2014A. He was pretty close to the track.\nQ. About how far from the track?\u2014A. About ten feet.\nQ. What did you do?\u2014A. Well, my impression was he seemed to hesitate. I thought he was going to wait until the train went by and when I saw that he wasn't, he was going on the track, and then headed straight down the track between the rails, his bicycle was wobbling around, he seemed to me like he was nervous, and as soon as I saw that I hollered.\nQ. How far was he from the track when you hollered?\u2014A. He must have been about five feet. I knew he was going to head right on to the track, and I hollered and tried to attract his attention.\nQ. How loudly did you holler?\u2014A. Just about as loud as I could leaning out of the window and hollering.\nQ. And did you do anything about notifying the engineer?\u2014A. Yes, sir, I turned to the engineer and told him to hold her.\nQ. And did he hold her? Yes, and applied the emergency brake and reversed the engine.\nQ. And where did the engine stop?\u2014A. The engine moved to just over the east side of the crossing, the tender just over the east side of the crossing.\nI think the fireman was entitled to assume, when he first saw the respondent, that the latter would not attempt to cross the track which would have been an act of madness with the train so close. But when he realized that the respondent was not going to wait, he shouted out to him, and the engineer says the shout could be heard a block. Did this shout come too late to permit the respondent to stop his bicycle, or should the fireman have shouted a second or two sooner, for it was a matter of seconds? The respondent's act, in riding blindly on to the track, knowing that a train was approaching the crossing, had created a situation of great danger, and when the fireman realized the danger he shouted to respondent. The latter may have been then so close to the track that he could not stop, or he may have been unnerved by the sudden realization of the danger, at all events he became the victim of the situation his negligence had created. Even if the fireman did not do everything that could have been done in this emergency\u2014and it is easier to criticise after the event than to take the proper course during an emergency\u2014still the respondent's own act was the cause of his misfortune. I think the language of Lord Birkenhead in the recent case of Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute[35], a marine collision case and therefore one for contribution, may very properly be cited here as descriptive of the situation created by the respondent's negligence:\nI think that the question of contributory negligence must be dealt with somewhat broadly and upon common sense principles as a jury would probably deal with it. And while no doubt, where a clear line can be irawn, the subsequent negligence is the only one to look to, there are cases in which the two acts come so closely together, and the second act of negligence is so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act, that the party secondly negligent, while not held free from blame under the Bywell Castle rule, might, on the other hand, invoke the prior negligence as being part of the cause of the collision so as to make it a case of contribution.\nUnfortunately for the respondent, this is not a case of contribution, and his negligence disentitled him to succeed in his action against the appellant. It is with regret that I come to this conclusion, but after the most serious and anxious consideration I can see no help for it.\nWith great respect therefore I differ from the judgments below and would allow the appeal and dismiss the respondent's action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1922] 3 W.W.R. 406.\n[2] [1922] 3 W.W.R. 27.\n[3] [1868] L.R. 3 H.L. 330.\n[4] [1913] A.C. 838.\n[5] [1921] 62 Can.

The post was in charge of one Wilson as manager, with two other employees of the appellant under his control, the respondent as general helper and his mother as housekeeper, all three living together. One morning, at 6.30, Wilson came out of his room half naked and drunk, to inquire about some noise heard in the upper part of the building. The respondent, coming down, saw Wilson and, knowing his mother was near, told him to kindly go back to his room and get dressed. A few minutes later, the respondent being in the kitchen, Wilson went there and shot at him, injuring his leg so severely that it had to be amputated.\nHeld, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the appellant company was liable under article 1054 C.C., as the damages were caused by Wilson \"in the performance of the work for which (he) was employed.\"\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Upon the evidence, the appellant company is also responsible under article 1053 C.C.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 34 K.B. 207) affirmed, Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Sir F. Lemieux C. J.[2], and maintaining the respondent's action for $13,000.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in this judgment now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Holden K.C. for the appellant. The act of Wilson was not done in the performance of the work for which he was employed (article 1054 C.C.) ; the wrong done was merely a wicked act; the master is not responsible even if that act had been done while the servant who did the act was occupied in work for his master. The respondent's injury was not caused by any act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill on the part of the appellant, under article 1053 C.C.\u2014Central Vermont Ry. Co. v. Bain [3]; Curley v. Latreille[4]; Halparin v. Bulling[5]; Sheehan v. Bank of Ottawa[6]; Roth v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[7]; Fiol v. Lombard[8]\nAlleyn Taschereau K.C. for the respondent. The appellant company is liable under articles 1053 and 1054 C.C.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree entirely with the appreciation of Mr. Justice Guerin, presiding in the court appealed from, of the learned trial judge's opinion judgment in regard to the facts and the relevant law.\nThe like view of the law and facts has been taken by four out of five of those who heard the case in appeal. I concur with the majority. I cannot see anything useful to be served by repeating any of said arguments.\nI may be permitted, however, to ask if a local trader had come into the appellant's shop and, in course of dealing with the agent Wilson when drunk, had been shot down by him because they disagreed as to prices, could it be held that the appellant would not be liable? I, of course, do not include in this illustration the consequences of an accepted challenge to go outside and fight it out.\nI cannot distinguish such a case as I put from the mode of discipline the drunken agent in charge of the premises and all therein, including respondent, sought to apply to his subordinate.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014The first question we have to consider turns upon the effect of a clause of Article 1054 of the Civil Code, which is in the following words:\u2014\nLes ma\u00eetres et les commettants sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers, dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s.\nMasters and employers are responsible for the damage caused by their servants and workmen in the performance of the work for which they are employed. There does not appear to be any necessary inconsistency between the French text and the English text. They are to be read together, and (if interpretation be necessary) each as explanatory of the other. City of Montreal v. Watt & Scott Ltd.[9] I doubt myself if exposition could make the meaning of the language used in either text plainer than it is. Le fait dommageable must be something done in the execution of the servant's functions as servant or in the performance of his work as servant. If the thing done belongs to the kind of work which the servant is employed to perform or the class of things falling within l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions, then by the plain words of the text responsibility rests upon the employer. Whether that is so or not in a particular case must, I think, always be in substance a question of fact, and although in cases lying near the border line decisions on analogous states of fact may be valuable as illustrations, it is not, I think, the rule itself being clear, a proper use of authority to refer to such decisions for the purpose of narrowing or enlarging the limits of the rule.\nI am emphasizing this because in cases arising under these paragraphs, as in other cases under Article 1054 C.C., counsel are accustomed to fortify their arguments by copious references to decisions of the French courts, many of which appear to be of little value either as illustrations of the application of the text or otherwise. In France the doctrine has been widely accepted and has more than once been affirmed by the highest tribunal that the employer is responsible for acts done by his employee \u00e0 l'occasion of his service. It cannot be insisted upon too strongly that an act done by an employee \u00e0 l'occasion of his service may or may not be one for which the employer is responsible under Article 1054 C.C., depending in every case upon the answer to the question: \"Was the act done in the execution of the employee's service or in the performance of the work for which he was employed?\" An illustration of cases requiring an affirmative answer is one decided in 1847, Dalloz 4. 423, in which a builder's workman, smoking while at work, set fire to a building. Precisely the same case, that is to say the same in all its essential elements, was decided in the opposite sense in Williams v. Jones[10] But in Williams v. Jones 10Blackburn J., dissented on the ground that in the circumstances the act of smoking by the employee while engaged in the duties of his employment, the circumstances being such that by smoking when so engaged the property where he was working was exposed to the risk of fire, constituted negligence in the performance of his duties. Blackburn J.'s difference with his colleagues \"was as to the proper inference as from the facts\" and his is the view which in a similar ease would probably now be accepted. Jefferson v. Derbyshire[11]. On the other hand, if the act of the servant causing the injury complained of is an act having no relation to the duties of his employment as, for example, where two servants momentarily discontinue their work to engage in some sort of a frolic, then, although it might not improperly be said that the injurious act is something done \u00e0 l'occasion of their employment, it would appear to be an abuse of language to describe it as done dans l'ex\u00e9cution des jonctions or in the performance of the work for which they were employed.\nSuch cases are no doubt near the line, and the nearer the line one gets the greater the room of course for difference of opinion as to the application of the words of the text. But in substance the solution of the point involves nothing more than an accurate appreciation of the facts in their relation to the rule. There seems to be an increasing tendency in France (see Planiol, Revue Critique de Legislation, vol. 38, pp. 298, 301) to refer the paragraph under discussion as well as the opening paragraph of Article 1384 C.N. to a doctrine of social responsibility, according to which the risk of injury arising from the prosecution of an enterprise, whether through the negligence of servants or caused by things employed in the enterprise, should fall upon the entrepreneur or proprietor because he enjoys the profits arising from it. I do not think considerations derived from this mode of reasoning can legitimately be applied in controlling the interpretation or the application of the text now under consideration. With great respect for those from whom I have the misfortune to differ in opinion as to the result of this appeal, I cannot persuade myself that the circumstances in this case bring it anywhere near the boundary line which limits the application of the text. It is quite true that where a general authority is confided to a manager to be exercised in a rather remote region with which communication is somewhat infrequent, and resources are placed at his disposal such as those of which Wilson had command, considerable latitude may be permissible in the interpretation of the authority vested in him. But making full allowance for this, I can find no fact pointing to the existence of an authority vested in Wilson to exercise discipline over his subordinates by the administration of corporal punishment. There is no trace of such authority, either absolute or conditional. Treating, therefore, Wilson's expressions while engaged in beating the respondent, as serious evidence of the existence of a belief that he was invested with authority to do what he was doing in the name of the company and in the company's interest, the existence of such a belief is wholly irrelevant in the absence of some fact to show that it was founded on some action of the company naturally calculated to give rise to it.\nBut in truth the evidence makes it abundantly clear, as it seems to me, that Wilson's act was the act of a man crazed by drink, prompted merely by drunken frenzy\u2014an act which, I repeat, with the greatest possible respect, cannot in my judgment be brought within the rule of the text under the most liberal interpretation possible.\nMr. Lafleur did not dispute that a case might conceivably be made out under Article 1053 C.C. if it could be shewn that the appellant company in selecting Wilson or in supervising his activities had failed to exercise due care with regard to the safety of the subordinates placed under his control. It is not necessary, in the view I take of this case, to attempt to indicate what ought to be regarded as a test of due care in this connection. It is sufficient to say that in order to establish a case under this head it would be necessary to produce some fact either actually known to the company or which the company ought to have known at least suggesting that by the employment of Wilson the personal safety of his fellow employees, subject to his orders, might be exposed to some extraordinary risk. I think the evidence does not disclose any such fact.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014It is quite unnecessary to repeat the facts of this case already detailed in the very carefully prepared judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court [12], the judgments delivered in the Court of King's Bench [13], and the opinions prepared by other members of this court.\nWith very great respect for the learned judges who hold the contrary view, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nIt is sought to hold the defendant company responsible either under Article 1054 C.C. or under Article 1053 C.C.\nIn so far as the claim rests on the relationship of master and servant existing between the defendant company and Wilson, who shot the plaintiff, the liability imposed by the last paragraph of Article 1054 C.C. is, I think, as exclusive as it is, within the limits which it prescribes, absolute. Mass\u00e9 et Verge sur Zachariae, par. 62813; 20 Laurent, no. 583; 31 Dem. 611-2; Sourdat, Resp. 4 \u00e9d.t.12, no. 888). That liability arises from fault of the servant causing damage quite independently of any fault on the part of the master. In dealing with this aspect of the case we must therefore put aside as irrelevant and immaterial alleged lack of care in the choice of the servant or in the exercise of control or supervision of his activities. Those considerations have to do only with fault of the master and, while they might import liability under Article 1053 C.C., they are entirely foreign to the case so far as it rests on Article 1054 C.C. The only qualification or condition which the law attaches to the vicarious responsibility of the master is that the damages for which it is sought to hold him liable shall have been caused by the servant \"in the performance of the work for which he is employed.\" But the fulfilment of that condition is de rigueur, this vicarious responsibility being de droit \u00e9troit. (Dem. no.\n(1)\n(2) 617). In determining whether there is liability under Article 1054 C.C., I agree with Mr. Justice Tellier:\u2014\nIl faut r\u00e9pondre oui, si ces dommages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s, dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles le dit Wilson \u00e9tait employ\u00e9; dans le cas contraire, il faut r\u00e9pondre non.\nBut I cannot assent to the view of that learned judge, shared by the other members of the Court of King's Bench (except Mr. Justice Howard) and by the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court, that the damage for which the plaintiff claims was caused by Wilson \"dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9.\" I had occasion to consider carefully the scope and import of that much-discussed phrase (S. 92.1.569, n. 1 & 2) in Curley v. Latreille, [14]and I have had no reason to change the views there expressed.\nI fully agree that the duties of Wilson at Weymontachingue included the upkeep and management of the residence and the control of the plaintiff as a servant, as well as the conduct of the defendant company's business. His authority over the plaintiff would probably have warranted reprimand and possibly dismissal for insubordination or insolence.\nThere can be no doubt also that although the particular act which causes damage may be unauthorized or even a distinctly forbidden or criminal act, if it be done in the performance of the work for which the servant is employed it will render the master liable for resultant injury. But when he took his gun and went to the kitchen and shot the plaintiff, Wilson was not performing any work or discharging any function within the scope of his employment as post-manager. He was not doing anything appertaining to the work for which he was employed. Under no circumstances could a sane man believe that his duty or his authority would extend to the doing of such a purely wanton act. And it is by the view which a reasonable man should take that what is included in the work or functions for which a servant is employed and the scope of the authority which his duties carry must be determined, and not by any crazy notion that may enter the servant's mind if mentally deranged or crazed with drink. The reasonable inference from the circumstances in evidence in my opinion is that Wilson was actuated by resentment for what, in his drunken frenzy, he imagined to be an insult at the hands of the plaintiff. Temporarily insane though he was, the belief that he conceived that when he shot the plaintiff he was engaged in discharging his duty to the company or in exercising any authority given him for the management of the household or the control of the servants, if material, is, in my opinion, not warranted. Wholly disconnected with any work for which he was employed by the defendant company, not committed by him \"comme tel en sa qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9,\" Wilson's act was not merely un abus de son autorit\u00e9, it was something wholly en dehors de ses fonctions. Fiol v Lombard[15]; Central Vermont Ry. Co. v. Bain[16]; Antoine v. Goudal[17]; Mignault, Droit Civil, p. 337; 31 Dem. no. 617; 20 Laurent no. 582; 11 Toullier no. 282.\nAs to liability under Article 1053 C.C., the evidence does not satisfy me that a case of actionable fault on the part of Youngman (whom I regard as the alter ego of the defendant company) either in the selection or in the supervision of Wilson as post manager has been shown, or that causative connection between any such alleged fault and the shooting of the plaintiff was sufficiently direct to entail liability of the company. Youngman seems to have taken reasonable care in the selection of Wilson and I am not satisfied that a case of negligence in his supervision has been made out. The fact that although the plaintiff and his mother, who now denounce Wilson's conduct and habits so vigorously, lived for two years and a half with him at the company's post, yet made no complaint to Youngman or to the company about him, I regard as most significant. But though Youngman should be found to have been somewhat remiss in his supervision, I am not satisfied that it can be said that an attempt by Wilson to commit murder was a consequence which he should have anticipated might ensue as the result of leaving the latter in control of the post. In lege causa proxima, non remota, spectatur. Brodeur J.\u2014Je ne pourrais mieux faire que de concourir dans l'opinion si admirable de l'honorable juge-en-chef Lemieux[18]. Il a exprim\u00e9 dans une forme impeccable les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation du demandeur Vaillaincourt et les principes de droit qu'il a invoqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de son jugement sont absolument inattaquables. Ils sont en tout conformes \u00e0 ce que nous enseignent la doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aises.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour d'appel.\nLa question qui se pr\u00e9sente est de savoir si la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse est responsable des blessures inflig\u00e9es par son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 Wilson au demandeur Vaillancourt.\nJe suis d'opinion que la compagnie a engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9\n1. par la faute et l'imprudence qu'elle a commises en mettant ce nomm\u00e9 Wilson en charge du poste de Weymontachingue (art. 1053 C.C.)\n2. par le fait que ce dommage aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par son mandataire dans l'exercice de ses fonctions (art. 1054 C.C. et art. 1731 C.C.)\nD'abord la compagnie est-elle en faute et a-t-elle engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 sous les dispositions de l'article 1053 C.C.?\nSur ce point il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je discute la preuve. Il s'agit, apr\u00e8s tout, d'une question de fait. Et comme les cours inf\u00e9rieures ont toutes deux d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la faute de la compagnie \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9e, je ne crois pas qu'il soit utile d'ajouter quoi que ce soit \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 si bien dit par l'honorable juge-en-chef Lemieux en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Il a eu l'avantage de voir et d'entendre les t\u00e9moins, et il est \u00e9vident qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 favorablement impressionn\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moignages de la d\u00e9fense sur ce point.\nJe suis \u00e9galement d'opinion que la compagnie a engag\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 parce que le dommage dont se plaint Vaillancourt a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par Wilson, le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse, dans l'exercice de ses fonctions.\nQuelles \u00e9taient les fonctions de Wilson?\nLa compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson avait originairement des pouvoirs bien \u00e9tendus dans les r\u00e9gions du nord pour y faire le commerce des pelleteries. Elle y exercait des fonctions judiciaires et administratives et m\u00eame l\u00e9gislatives (Encyclopedia Britannica, vo. Hudson's Bay Company). Elle jouissait naturellement d'un tr\u00e8s grand prestige aupr\u00e8s des tribus indiennes de ces r\u00e9gions. Lorsqu'en 1869, elle a abandonn\u00e9 une partie de ses privil\u00e8ges au gouvernement du Canada, elle a cependant stipul\u00e9 la conservation de ses postes. Elle poss\u00e8de dans les r\u00e9gions du nord de Qu\u00e9bec un de ces postes, app\u00e9l\u00e9 Weymontachingue, qui \u00e9tait sous la g\u00e9rance du nomm\u00e9 Wilson qui en avait le supr\u00eame commandement et qui avait sous son contr\u00f4le le demandeur Vaillancourt comme homme de peine, et sa m\u00e8re, comme cuisini\u00e8re.\nCe contr\u00f4le qu'il avait sur Vaillancourt et sa m\u00e8re \u00e9tait de tous les instants. Il vivait sous le m\u00eame toit qu'eux, dans une maison appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie. Un matin. Vaillancourt, apr\u00e8s avoir soign\u00e9 les animaux du poste, \u00e9tait all\u00e9 \u00e0 sa chambre, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage sup\u00e9rieur du poste, pour s'habiller plus chaudement et aller travailler ensuite dans la for\u00eat quand il s'entendit interpeller par Wilson. Il descendit alors et constata que Wilson \u00e9tait en boisson et presque compl\u00e8tement nu. M\u00fb par des notions \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de vertu et de d\u00e9cence, Vaillancourt lui mit tranquillement la main sur l'\u00e9paule et lui conseilla d'aller s'habiller. Wilson, croyant \u00e9videmment que ces conseils de son subalterne constituaient un m\u00e9pris de son autorit\u00e9 et de son prestige, prend un fusil qui se trouvait \u00e0 sa port\u00e9e et tire sur Vaillancourt \u00e0 bout portant et le blesse gravement \u00e0 la jambe. De peine et de mis\u00e8re, Vaillancourt a pu se tra\u00eener dehors sur son autre jambe et aller se coucher sur l'herbe. Sa m\u00e8re et les sauvages qui \u00e9taient dans le voisinage se sont port\u00e9s \u00e0 son secours. Cela n'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 Wilson de le frapper \u00e0 coups de canne et de dire alors:\nLes officiers de la Baie d'Hudson ont le droit de tuer, et puis ils sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\nVoil\u00e0 comment Wilson voulait affirmer son prestige et celui de la compagnie en pr\u00e9sence des pauvres sauvages et de ceux qui l'entouraient.\nCes paroles de Wilson d\u00e9montrent bien qu'en tentant de tuer Vaillancourt il faisait un acte qu'il croyait n\u00e9cessaire pour la paix et la tranquillit\u00e9 de ces r\u00e9gions. C'\u00e9tait \u00e9videmment pour lui un acte d'autorit\u00e9 devenu d\u00e9sirable pour le prestige de la compagnie qu'il repr\u00e9sentait. Il s'est \u00e9videmment m\u00e9pris sur le caract\u00e8re de ses fonctions en ayant recours \u00e0 la force brutale pour r\u00e9primer tout abus qui aurait pu se produire. S'il y avait quelque doute au sujet de l'importance qu'il attachait \u00e0 ses fonctions et sur la mani\u00e8re dont elles devaient \u00eatre remplies, on pourrait r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 cet incident d\u00e9voil\u00e9 par la preuve o\u00f9 un commer\u00e7ant aurait tent\u00e9 un jour d'acheter des pelleteries de la tribu sauvage qu'il y avait l\u00e0 et de faire concurrence par l\u00e0 m\u00eame \u00e0 la compagnie de la baie d'Hudson. Wilson le chassa de l\u00e0 en essayant de d\u00e9charger son fusil sur lui. Dans une autre occasion, il aurait fait feu sur un jeune sauvage. Ces circonstances d\u00e9montrent \u00e9videmment que Wilson se croyait oblig\u00e9 dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la compagnie qu'il repr\u00e9sentait d'user d'armes \u00e0 feu pour affirmer son autorit\u00e9.\nC'est ce que les cours inf\u00e9rieures ont trouv\u00e9 comme question de fait. Devons-nous rejeter cette d\u00e9cision? Je ne le crois pas.\nNous n'avons qu'\u00e0 consulter la doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aises pour nous convaincre qu'au point de vue l\u00e9gal la conduite de Wilson a engag\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 de la compagnie.\nVoici, par exemple, ce que disent Mass\u00e9 et Verge sur Zachariae qui sont cit\u00e9s dans la Bibioth\u00e8que du Code Civil de DeLorimier sous l'article 1054 C.C.:\u2014\nEn principe (disent-ils) la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et des commettants \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du dommage caus\u00e9 par les domestiques ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s n'est pas limit\u00e9e au cas o\u00f9 les actes dommageables rentraient dans les termes du mandat ou de la fonction: pour que le ma\u00eetre ou le commettant soient responsables, il suffit que les actes dommageables du domestique ou du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 se rattachent \u00e0 l'objet de leur mandat et qu'ils aient lieu \u00e0 l'occasion de son ex\u00e9cution * * * La responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants est tellement \u00e9tendue qu'elle s'applique m\u00eame aux d\u00e9lits et aux crimes commis par les domestiques ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, d\u00e9lits ou crimes pour lesquels ils n'auraient pu recevoir aucun mandat.\nCette responsabilit\u00e9 est \u00e9videmment bien \u00e9tendue, mais elle vient de cette consid\u00e9ration que les ma\u00eetres ou les commettants ont \u00e0 se reprocher d'avoir donn\u00e9 leur confiance \u00e0 des hommes m\u00e9chants, maladroits ou imprudents.\nPothier nous enseigne (Obligations, no. 121) que les ma\u00eetres sont responsables des d\u00e9lits de leurs serviteurs m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en leur pouvoir d'emp\u00eacher le d\u00e9lit * * * ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli pour rendre les ma\u00eetres attentifs \u00e0 ne se servir que de bons domestiques.\nVoil\u00e0 o\u00f9 nos codificateurs se sont inspir\u00e9s pour \u00e9crire l'article 1054 C.C.\nLes termes de l'article 1054 C.C. sont g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre qu'ils \u00e9dictent ne souffre d'exception que dans le cas o\u00f9 le fait reproch\u00e9 ne se rattache pas au contrat de louage de services. Le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 qui accomplit mal les instructions de son ma\u00eetre ou qui accompagne l'accomplissement de son mandat d'agissements inutiles ou \u00e9trangers donne lieu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de son ma\u00eetre. La loi veut que le ma\u00eetre subisse la cons\u00e9quence du choix et de l'emploi d'un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 incapable et coupable.\nLes expressions que nous retrouvons dans l'article 1054 \"dans les fonctions auxquelles ils sont employ\u00e9s\" ne signifient pas que les faits \u00e0 raison desquels les ma\u00eetres et commetants peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9s civilement responsables doivent constituer l'exercice m\u00eame des fonctions des domestiques ou des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. La condition exig\u00e9e par la loi se rencontre lorsque les faits dommageables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplis soit dans l'exercice de ces fonctions, soit m\u00eame \u00e0 l'occasion de cet exercice et alors m\u00eame que le dommage r\u00e9sulte d'un abus des dites fonctions.

(Dalloz 1919.1.8.)\nCette solution est absolument analogue \u00e0 celle donn\u00e9e sous la loi des accidents du travail par la chambre civile o\u00f9 l'on a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme survenu \u00e0 l'occasion du travail tout accident arriv\u00e9 au temps et au lieu du travail.

Lombard jug\u00e9e en 1875 et rapport\u00e9e dans le Journal du Palais, p. 210.\nJe ne crois pas que cette d\u00e9cision puisse s'appliquer aux faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause. Le tribunal, dans cette cause de Fiol, a trouv\u00e9 comme question de fait que le fait dommageable ne s'\u00e9tait pas produit dans les fonctions auxquelles leurs domestiques \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s. L'accident serait survenu \u00e0 la suite de dissentiments entre eux. Il n'y avait pas, comme dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le fait que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 a cru n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir recours \u00e0 la force brutale pour accomplir les fonctions qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es.\nD'ailleurs cette d\u00e9cision de Fiol a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en 1875 et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 virtuellement ignor\u00e9e dans les d\u00e9cisions plus r\u00e9centes que j'ai cit\u00e9es plus haut.\nPour toutes ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Dans cette cause tr\u00e8s difficile on a invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois l'article 1053 et l'article 1054 du code civil pour rendre l'appelante responsable de l'acte de son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 Wilson, qui en \u00e9tat d'ivresse, a bless\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 d'un coup de fusil n\u00e9cessitant l'amputation de sa jambe.\nLa port\u00e9e de l'article 1053 C.C. est tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La faute la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re engage la responsabilit\u00e9 de toute personne capable de discerner le bien du mal, mais \u00e0 une condition essentielle cependant, c'est que cette faute ait caus\u00e9 le dommage dont on se plaint. Si cette relation directe entre la faute et le dommage manque, l'article 1053 C.C. est sans application possible. Cet article me para\u00eet donc hors de cause ici car la faute qui a occasionn\u00e9 le dommage n'est pas la faute de l'appelante, mais celle de son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 Wilson.\nSauf en ce qui concerne le dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose dont r\u00e9pond celui qui a cette chose sous sa garde, l'article 1054 C.C. s'occupe des cas o\u00f9 on est responsable de la faute d'autrui, comme le sont les ma\u00eetres et commettants du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s. Comme l'\u00e9nonciation d'une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et abstraction faite de quelques lois particuli\u00e8res qui peuvent \u00e9tendre cette responsabilit\u00e9, je suis d'avis que l'article 1054 C.C. pose les seuls cas o\u00f9 l'on soit civilement responsable de la faute d'autrui. C'est donc le seul article qui puisse s'appliquer dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\nDans Curley v. Latreille[19], apr\u00e8s avoir rapport\u00e9 certaines solutions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise et fait observer que la responsabilit\u00e9 de la faute d'autrui est de droit strict, je me suis exprim\u00e9 comme suit sur la port\u00e9e de l'article 1054 C.C., avec le plein concours de mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin:\u2014\nEtant donn\u00e9 que l'interpr\u00e9tation stricte s'impose en cette mati\u00e8re, je ne puis me convaincre que le texte de notre article nous autorise \u00e0 accueillir toutes les solutions que je viens d'indiquer. Ainsi, dans la province de Quebec le ma\u00eetre et le commettant sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l'ex\u00e9cution des jonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s, ou, pour citer la version anglaise de l'article 1054 C.C. \"in the performance of the work for which they are employed\" Ceci me para\u00eet clairement exclure la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre pour un fait accompli par le domestique ou ouvrier \u00e0 l'occasion seulement de ses fonctions, si on ne peut dire que ce fait s'est produit dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions. Il peut souvent \u00eatre difficile de d\u00e9terminer si le fait dommageable est accompli dans l'exercice des fonctions ou seulement \u00e0 leur occasion, mais, s'il appert r\u00e9ellement que ce fait n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accompli dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions du domestique ou ouvrier, nous nous trouvons en dehors de notre texte. L'abus des fonctions, si le fait incrimin\u00e9 s'est produit dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ces fonctions, entre au contraire dans ce texte et entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 du ma\u00eetre.\nJe suis encore du m\u00eame avis, et il ne me semble pas inutile de le dire encore \u00e0 raison de certaines solutions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise qu'on a invoqu\u00e9es pour donner \u00e0 l'article 1054 C.C., quant \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants, une interpr\u00e9tation extensive qu'il ne comporte pas dans mon opinion. Il faut bien reconna\u00eetre que la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise a pris depuis quelques ann\u00e9es une orientation qui l'\u00e9carte de plus en plus de la doctrine traditionnelle. Elle admet de nouvelles th\u00e9ories en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 civile, comme l'abus du droit, l'enrichissement sans cause et la responsabilit\u00e9 des irresponsables, enfants en bas \u00e2ge et insens\u00e9s (Planiol t.2, no. 878). On peut m\u00eame dire qu'elle tend \u00e0 faire abstraction de la faute et \u00e0 la remplacer par la conception du risque. Mais n'oublions pas que nous avons un code dont le texte doit nous servir de r\u00e8gle, et que si les opinions des auteurs et les d\u00e9cisions de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise ne peuvent se concilier avec ce texte, c'est le texte et non pas ces opinions et ces d\u00e9cisions que nous devons suivre. Je ne serais certainement pas partisan d'une interpr\u00e9tation de notre code qui en ferait pr\u00e9valoir la lettre sur l'esprit, mais quand le texte est clair et sans \u00e9quivoque on n'a pas besoin de chercher ailleurs.\nLes faits de la cause peuvent \u00eatre relat\u00e9s bri\u00e8vement. Wilson, depuis 1916, \u00e9tait g\u00e9rant du poste de traite de l'appelante \u00e0 Weymonttachingue et l'intim\u00e9 y \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 comme homme de peine. Le matin du 11 octobre 1920, vers 6 h. 15, l'intim\u00e9 qui occupait une chambre au deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tage, descendit pour soigner le cheval et les volailles, et remonta ensuite \u00e0 sa chambre. Wilson \u00e9tait au premier \u00e9tage et, entendant du bruit en haut, il demanda qui \u00e9tait l\u00e0. L'intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pondit que c'\u00e9tait lui et ensuite descendit l'escalier. En passant devant la chambre de Wilson, il rencontra celui-ci v\u00eatu seulement d'une chemise et visiblement sous l'influence de la boisson. Wilson lui dit: \"Je suis saoul encore ce matin.\" L'intim\u00e9 lui posa la main sur l'\u00e9paule en lui disant: \"M. Wilson, si vous \u00eates saoul, entrez dans votre chambre et mettez vos v\u00eatements; il n'est pas convenable de sortir comme vous \u00eates.\" L'intim\u00e9 se rendit alors \u00e0 la cuisine et chaussait ses bottes de travail, lorsque Wilson est arriv\u00e9 avec une carabine et a tir\u00e9 presqu'\u00e0 bout portant sur l'intim\u00e9 qu'il atteignit \u00e0 la jambe. L'intim\u00e9 s'enfuit au dehors o\u00f9 Wilson le rejoignit et le frappa plusieurs fois avec une canne, lui disant que les officiers de la compagnie de la Baie d'Hudson avaient le droit de tuer et qu'ils \u00e9taient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Comme r\u00e9sultat de cet assaut, l'intim\u00e9 eut la jambe cass\u00e9e et on dut plus tard la lui amputer. Il tient l'appelante civilement responsable du d\u00e9lit de Wilson.\nWilson, je l'ai dit, \u00e9tait g\u00e9rant du poste et \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d'y faire pour l'appelante la traite des pelleteries avec les chasseurs et trappeurs qui \u00e9taient surtout des sauvages. Il y tenait \u00e9galement un magasin g\u00e9n\u00e9ral o\u00f9 les sauvages et les chasseurs achetaient les provisions et autres marchandises dont ils avaient besoin. Le personnel du poste se composait de l'intim\u00e9, homme de peine, et de sa m\u00e8re, servante, nomm\u00e9s par Wilson mais pay\u00e9s par rappelante, tous les deux soumis \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 de Wilson.\nIl s'agit de d\u00e9terminer dans ces circonstances si Wilson \u00e9tait dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions quand il a bless\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9. Il est \u00e9vident que Wilson ne conduisait pas alors le commerce que lui avait confi\u00e9 l'appelante, et de ce chef le d\u00e9lit commis par lui \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement en dehors de ses fonctions comme g\u00e9rant de ce commerce. Mais en rapport avec cette g\u00e9rance il avait, je l'ai dit, autorit\u00e9 sur l'intim\u00e9 et sa m\u00e8re, \u00e9galement employ\u00e9s de l'appelante, qui \u00e9taient tenus d'ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 ses ordres l\u00e9gitimes. Et la question est de savoir s'il exer\u00e7ait cette autorit\u00e9, tout en l'exer\u00e7ant mal, lorsqu'il a bless\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9. L'honorable juge Tellier, en cour d'appel, pose la question de responsabilit\u00e9 uniquement sous l'article 1054 C.C., et il dit, parlant de Wilson:\u2014\nS'il traitait bien les clients au comptoir, et le demandeur \u00e0 sa r\u00e9sidence, il remplissait convenablement ses fonctions; s'il les maltraitait, il manquait \u00e0 ses devoirs, il abusait de son autorit\u00e9. Dans un cas comme dans l'autre, il \u00e9tait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions.\nIl ne me para\u00eet pas douteux que le ma\u00eetre ne peut se soustraire \u00e0 sa responsabilit\u00e9 pour les actes de son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 sous pr\u00e9texte que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 s'est rendu coupable d'un crime pour lequel aucun mandat ne lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, s'il est constat\u00e9 que ce crime a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans l'exercice des fonctions du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. Il s'agit ici, en effet, de la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant des d\u00e9lits comme des quasi-d\u00e9lits des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Cela ne souffre aucun doute en doctrine et en jurisprudence. Comp. Pothier, Obligations no. 121, et la note sous Paris, 15 mai 1851, Dalloz, 1852.2.241.\nMais il est \u00e9galement certain que le ma\u00eetre n'est pas responsable du d\u00e9lit ou crime dont son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 s'est rendu coupable en dehors de ses fonctions. Il y un assez grand nombre de d\u00e9cisions dans ce sens. Voy. Cassation, 5 juin 1861; Dalloz, 1861.1.439; Cassation, 3 mars 1884; Sirey, 1885.1.21; Paris, 19 mai 1874; Dalloz, 1874.2.214; Douai, 14 f\u00e9vrier 1894; Sirey, 1894.1.161; Douai, 24 f\u00e9vrier 1902 et 12 janvier 1903; Sirey, 1904.2.298.\nDans ces esp\u00e8ces, on ne trouve pas la particularit\u00e9 que pr\u00e9sente la cause qui nous est soumise, c'est-\u00e0-dire la subordination entre la victime et le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 qui a commis le d\u00e9lit, le ma\u00eetre commun ayant plac\u00e9 cette victime sous les ordres de ce pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. Le poste confi\u00e9 \u00e0 Wilson se trouvait dans un endroit d\u00e9sert, et Wilson avait le contr\u00f4le du personnel du poste un peu comme le capitaine d'un navire a le contr\u00f4le de l'\u00e9quipage. Or il ne manque pas d'arr\u00eats o\u00f9 on a condamn\u00e9 l'armateur \u00e0 raison de mauvais traitements inflig\u00e9s aux matelots par les officiers du navire dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions.\nAinsi on a rendu le propri\u00e9taire d'un navire responsable du d\u00e9lit de coups et blessures commis sur la personne d'un matelot par le ma\u00eetre d'\u00e9quipage dans l'exercice de ses fonctions (Sirey, 1864.2.99); ou d'un crime dont le capitaine s'\u00e9tait rendu coupable au pr\u00e9judice d'un des hommes de l'\u00e9quipage (Fuzier-Herman, vo. Armateur, no. 109) ou encore des suites des punitions ill\u00e9gales et des mauvais traitements inflig\u00e9s ou des blessures occasionn\u00e9es \u00e0 un mousse ou \u00e0 tout autre homme de l'\u00e9quipage par un officier du bord dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, (idem, ib. no. 110.)\nSi Wilson maltraitait le personnel du poste qui \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 ses ordres, il est indiscutable qu'il abusait de l'autorit\u00e9 que l'appelante lui avait confi\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ce personnel, et cet abus donnerait lieu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par l'article 1054 C.C. Jusqu'ici il n'y a pas de difficult\u00e9 car l'abus de la fonction, bien que ce soit un abus du mandat que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 tient de son commettant, engage cependant la responsibilit\u00e9 de ce dernier.\nIl est assez difficile d'expliquer l'assaut brutal et meurtrier commis par Wilson sur la personne de l'intim\u00e9, \u00e0 moins d'y avoir un abus d'autorit\u00e9. La preuve constate que jusqu'au jour de l'assaut les rapports entre Wilson et l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient excellents et qu'il n'y a jamais eu de querelle entre eux. Wilson ne pouvait donc avoir un motif de vengeance particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 satisfaire contre l'intim\u00e9. Cependant ce matin-l\u00e0 Wilson \u00e9tait ivre et l'intim\u00e9, son homme de peine, s'\u00e9tait permis de lui faire la remarque que j'ai rapport\u00e9e plus haut. Wilson voulait-il le punir du manque de respect que comportait cette remarque et surtout du fait qu'il lui avait mis la main sur l'\u00e9paule pour le faire rentrer dans sa chambre et s'habiller? En l'absence de tout autre explication, possible, on peut bien le croire. Mais il est \u00e9vident que dans ce cas il y a eu abus de l'autorit\u00e9 qu'avait Wilson sur l'intim\u00e9, car alors qu'il pouvait r\u00e9primer l'injure ou le manque de respect par des r\u00e9montrances ou autres moyens raisonnables, il ne pouvait se porter \u00e0 des voies de fait sur la personne de son serviteur. L'assaut qu'il a commis \u00e9tait donc un flagrant abus de son autorit\u00e9.\nSi je croyais qu'il n'y avait eu dans l'esp\u00e8ce qu'une querelle ou une vengeance particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 raison de dissentiments ant\u00e9rieurs entre ces deux hommes, j'h\u00e9siterais beaucoup \u00e0 dire que Wilson agissait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions comme chef du personnel du poste de traite quand il a assailli l'intim\u00e9. Mais cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment, ou cette explication de la conduite de Wilson, manque absolument. Il ne reste que l'explication que Wilson a voulu punir un manque de respect de son serviteur \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, et alors il exer\u00e7ait, mais il exer\u00e7ait abusivement, l'autorit\u00e9 qu'il tenait de l'appelante sur son serviteur. L'\u00e9tat d'esprit de Wilson, surtout ivre comme il \u00e9tait, peut n'\u00eatre pas un indice bien s\u00fbr pour d\u00e9terminer s'il exer\u00e7ait ses fonctions de ma\u00eetre de l'intim\u00e9, mais l'ivresse ne peut certainement excuser les mauvais traitements qu'un ma\u00eetre inflige \u00e0 son serviteur, et dans toutes les circonstances de la cause, m\u00eame en ne tenant pas compte de ce que Wilson, dans son \u00e9tat d'ivresse, a pu s'imaginer, l'acte lui-m\u00eame, tout d\u00e9raisonnable et criminel qu'il \u00e9tait, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'autre explication possible, \u00e9tait un acte d'autorit\u00e9, et les paroles de Wilson que l'intim\u00e9 rapporte le d\u00e9montrent.\nApr\u00e8s une longue et s\u00e9rieuse \u00e9tude de la cause, je suis donc d'avis que Wilson a abus\u00e9 de son autorit\u00e9 sur l'intim\u00e9 et partant que l'article 1054 C.C., s'applique. Je crois que cette conclusion est conforme \u00e0 la justice, et j'aurais beaucoup regrett\u00e9 d'avoir \u00e0 dire, dans les circonstances que l'intim\u00e9 n'a d'autre rem\u00e8de qu'un recours illusoire contre un g\u00e9rant insolvable. Il a fid\u00e8lement servi l'appelante et son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 Wilson, et la brutalit\u00e9 de ce dernier, dans l'exercice de l'autorit\u00e9 que l'appelante lui avait confi\u00e9e, a rendu l'intim\u00e9 infirme pour la vie. D'ailleurs l'appelante n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sans avertissements quant au caract\u00e8re dangereux de Wilson, comme le d\u00e9montra le t\u00e9moignage du nomm\u00e9 Potts. Elle devait choisir ses g\u00e9rants avec soin et les surveiller efficacement, et c'est \u00e0 raison de ce devoir du ma\u00eetre que l'article 1054 C.C. le rend responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions, sans qu'il puisse se disculper en pr\u00e9tendant qu'il ne pouvait emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. Cette responsabilit\u00e9, dit Pothier (Obligations No. 121), a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie\npour rendre les ma\u00eetres attentifs \u00e0 ne se servir que de bons domestiques.\nLe r\u00e9sultat de ce proc\u00e8s ne peut donc manquer de produire de bons effets.\nJe renverrais rappel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith, Holden, Hague, Shaughnessy & Reward.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Alleyn Taschereau.\n[1] [1922] Q.R. 34 K.B. 207.\n[2] [1922] Q.R. 60, S.C. 457.\n[3] [1918] Q.R. 28 K.B. 40, at p. 47.\n[4] [1920] 60 Can.

W. had previously made a contract with M. who agreed to deliver 4,000 cords to be cut on the limits of the Paper Co. at six dollars. M. was informed of the first-mentioned contract though not of all its terms. At the end of the season M. was more than 1,400 cords short of the quantity he agreed to deliver.\nHeld affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (32 Man. R. 383) that as no default by W. was proved he is entitled to recover from M. damages for non-performance by the latter of his contract to deliver 4,000 cords and the measure of those damages is the profit he would have made under his contract with the paper company.\nHeld also, Brodeur J. dissenting, that W. can recover the drawback from the price of the wood actually delivered withheld by the paper company because of failure to deliver the whole 3,000 cords contracted for.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nHolland for the appellants.\nHudson K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014At the close of the argument in this case I entertained a great deal of doubt and have since then given the judgments below and the evidence much consideration. I am unable to reach the conclusion that the judgments appealed from are so clearly wrong that the appeal should be allowed. Although I still entertain some doubts, I would concur in dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed. I concur with the judgment of Mr. Justice Cameron and have very little indeed to add to it. It is made clear, I think, to a demonstration that the appellants realized that they were taking a subcontract from the respondent to \"cut, haul and deliver\" pulpwood from the timber concessions of the Dryden Paper Mill which the respondents as principal contractors had already contracted to, or were about to contract to \"cut, haul and deliver\" for the Dryden Paper Mill. The Court of Appeal rightly took the view that in these circumstances the appellants must have realized that failure on their part to perform their subcontract would probably involve the respondents in consequential disadvantages by way of penalties or liability to pay damages for breach of their contract as well as occasioning loss of profits whatever the amount of them might be which they would naturally expect to arise from the performance of their contract. It seems rather naive to appeal to a court of justice to act upon the assumption that the appellants believed the respondents to have undertaken responsibility towards the Dryden Paper Mill in respect of the cut of this pulpwood gratuitously with no expectation of making a profit.\nThe responsibility of the appellants for the damages claimed seems to follow very clearly. If authority be needed it will be found in Cory v. Thames Iron Works Co.[2].\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellants failed to satisfy me that they had made out a case entitling them to damages from the defendants for breach of an undertaking to furnish assistance in carrying out their contract. The clause on which they relied is far from being definite; the construction of the word \"otherwise\" in it is by no means certain; whether it covered the procuring of men for the lumber camps I regard as at least debatable. But, if it did, the evidence of refusal or neglect by the defendants to render such assistance as could reasonably be expected from them is not at all convincing. The appeal on this branch of the case in my opinion cannot succeed.\nThe question raised as to the measure of damages on the counterclaim requires more consideration. Two items of damage have been allowed, $2 per cord profit lost to defendants on 1,405.6 cords of pulpwood which the plaintiffs failed to deliver at C.P.R. Spur Mile 24.4 for the Dryden Paper Company, Limited, as contracted for, and twenty cents per cord on 2,594.4 cords of pulpwood so delivered by the plaintiffs. For pulpwood\u2014not less than 3,000 cords and up to 5,000\u2014to be delivered to the Dryden Paper Company, Limited, at the spur, the defendants were entitled under their contract with it to receive $8 per cord, and they were to pay to the plaintiffs for pulpwood so delivered by them as subcontractors $6 per cord, the latter having agreed to take out and deliver at C.P.R. Spur Mile 24.4 for the Dryden Paper Company on the defendants' account 4,000 cords. Each of the contracts contained a provision in these terms:\nPayment will be made on the 15th of each month for all wood thus received before the first of the month. Ten per cent of the value of the wood received will be retained by the parties of the first part until this contract has been completed.\nTwenty cents per cord was the difference in the drawbacks under these stipulations in the respective contracts.\nThe case appears to have been treated in the Manitoba courts as one of breach of contract for the sale and delivery of goods. With great respect, the contracts were rather for work and labour to be performed. The limits from which, and from which only, the pulpwood was to be cut belonged to the Dryden Paper Company. That company was providing for the cutting of pulpwood\u2014its property\u2014on its own limits, and for the transfer of it, when cut, to cars on which it would be taken to its mills. The defendants having contracted to perform these services employed the plaintiffs to do the work for them.\nThe evidence leaves no room for doubt that the plaintiffs knew that they were subcontractors for the defendants and that the defendants would make a profit on the work they undertook to do. It is also, I think, a fair inference that they were aware that, except in regard to the price to be paid, the defendants' contract with the Dryden Company was in terms similar to those in their own subcontract, including the provision for drawback. Contracts and subcontracts in terms identical, except as to price, are such a common feature of the timber-cutting industry in Canada that it is reasonable to infer that knowledge of the fact that they were subcontractors carried to the plaintiffs the information that, except as to price, the terms of the defendants' contract with the Dryden Paper Company were the same as the terms which they had accepted.\nOn that basis the plaintiffs are, in my opinion, liable to the defendants for whatever loss they, as reasonable men, should have expected the latter would sustain as a result of their failure to cut and deliver a substantial part of the 4,000 cords of pulpwood for which they had contracted. The loss of profit of $2 per cord on 1,405 cords not delivered, clearly was of that character. In that respect, while the case is one of breach of contract for services to be rendered, I agree that the measure of damages is similar to that for breach of contract for the sale and delivery of goods not procurable in the market (Borries v, Hutchinson[3]), where a resale had been communicated to the original vendor when he made his contract.\nElbinger Actien-Gesellchaft v. Armstrong[4], and Gr\u00e9bert-Borgnis v. Nugent[5], cited by Mr. Justice Cameron, seem to shew that knowledge by the plaintiffs of the existence of the principal contract with the defendants, though its precise provisions as to price and drawback had not been communicated, would suffice to support the claim for damages based on loss of profits and of drawback which could not be recovered. As in the case of goods not procurable in the market, the respondents could earn the money payable under their contract with the Paper Company only by delivering the very pulpwood they had contracted to cut and deliver. They could not require the Dryden Paper Company to take any other pulpwood in substitution therefor; neither was that company obliged upon non-delivery to go into the market for other pulpwood in order to mitigate any damages for which the defendants might be liable to it. Its only obligation was to accept and pay for the delivery of its own pulpwood cut on its own limits.\nThe plaintiffs, however, contest their liability to compensate the defendants for the drawback withheld from them by the Dryden Paper Company asserting that, under the terms of its contract with the defendants, that company is not entitled to keep such retention money. They contend that this money was held by the Paper Company merely as a guarantee fund to protect it against damages by reason of the non-fulfilment of the defendants' contract, and that only to the extent to which such damages can be established is it entitled to withhold payment of that fund from the defendants. No evidence of damages sustained by the Dryden Paper Company having been given, the plaintiffs maintain that, for aught that is shewn to the contrary, the defendants could recover the whole sum retained and that they (the plaintiffs) are therefore not chargeable with any part of it.\nI respectfully agree with the view taken by the majority of the learned judges of the Manitoba Court of Appeal that on a proper construction of the clause of the contract between the Dryden Paper Company and the defendants, which has been quoted above, payment of the ten per cent withheld could be enforced by the latter only on the complete performance of its contract to deliver at least 3,000 cords of pulpwood. The contract does not provide merely for retention money to serve as a fund to be drawn upon either to complete the contractors' work left unfinished, or to compensate for damages occasioned by their default. Completion of the contract is, I think, made a condition precedent to any right on the part of the contractors to receive the ten per cent retained. The contractors must fulfil that condition before they are entitled to any part of that sum. The contract in effect was that, if at least 3,000 cords of pulpwood should be delivered, the price payable to the defendants should be $8.00 per cord; if only part of that quantity should be delivered, the price should be $7.20 per cord. Such was the bargain the parties chose to make, and it was competent for them to make it. I see nothing in the contract to warrant treating the eighty cents a cord withheld as merely a guarantee fund against possible loss to the Dryden Company\u2014nothing to entitle the defendants to payment of any part of the money so retained until the condition under which the Dryden Company had agreed to pay it, viz., completion of delivery to it of 3,000 cords of pulpwood\u2014had been fulfilled.\nThe defendants have voluntarily given the plaintiffs credit for the ten per cent drawback likewise retained by them under the corresponding provision of their contract with the plaintiffs. We are not called upon to express an opinion upon the question whether they were obliged to do so.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This case turns mostly upon the amount of damages to which the respondents would be entitled.\nThe facts having a bearing on the issue are the following:\u2014\nIn the fall of 1920, the respondent Willits entered into negotiations with the Dryden Paper Company and he offered to cut, during the ensuing winter 2,000 to 4,000 cords of pulpwood on the timber limits of the company, at a price of $8 per cord. The company would not at first accept his offer unless he would make it 4,000 cords. But Willets having declared that he did not feel in a position to cut such a large quantity his offer was accepted and it was agreed that a formal contract would be prepared and signed.\nOn the 23rd of December, the contract was signed and by it Willits agreed specifically to cut and deliver 3,000 cords before the end of the logging season, with a proviso that he could deliver a larger quantity. It was stipulated that the payment would be made each month for the quantity then delivered and that 10 per cent should be retained by the company until completion of the contract.\nAt the same time Willits was negotiating with the appellants, Mondor et al., and induced them to enter into an independent contract with him to cut and deliver 4,000 cords of the same pulpwood, at $6 per cord, on the Dryden Paper limits. The appellants were made aware that Willits had a contract with the Dryden Company to cut pulpwood, but they were not informed as to its quantity, its price and its conditions.\nMondor and his associates went to work and did their best to carry out their contract and they cut 2,594 cords in spite of the fact, as found by the trial judge, that the snow in the forest, while of sufficient depth, was soft and wet, that their workmen could not be induced to remain long at their unpleasant task, that they had to work under adverse conditions, and that they did all they could to carry out the contract in full.\nThe appellants having sued Willits for a balance of $3,119.40 claimed to be due under their contract with him, the defendant Willits made a counter claim in damages for $2,811.20, representing a profit of $2 per cord on the cords not delivered, and for $518.80 representing the loss of the sum retained by the Dryden Company, being the 10 per cent above mentioned.\nThe counter claim was dismissed in the Superior Court but it was maintained in the Court of Appeal. Mr. Justice Prendergast dissented in the Court of Appeal as to the damages for retention money paid by Willits. I am disposed to agree with him.\nSome other questions were discussed by the appellants which of course we have to consider.\nIt is contended first by the appellants that the respondents were bound to assist the appellants in the securing of men, and they rely in that respect on the clause of the contract which stipulated that\nevery possible assistance will be given to the parties of the second part (Mondor, Coutur and Leonard) in locating roads, procuring and removing cars and otherwise to enable them to carry out the terms of this agreement.\nIt seems to me that the clause would not justify such a construction, though Willits in his evidence states that he was willing to assist the appellants in the procuring of axemen. But there is no doubt that Willits was bound to assist in the location of roads, and he has not proved that he has done anything to carry out this obligation. This work of locating the roads seems to have been done exclusively by the appellants. This failure on the part of the respondents to fulfil their obligation of giving assistance must have, however, a bearing on the amount of the damages claimed from the appellants for their own breach.\nA question has been raised also by the appellants as to the quantity of pulp wood that Willits was bound to deliver to the Dryden Company. The quantity contracted for by Willits was 3,000 cords with an option to increase it. But in that regard I am led to inquire how it is that on the 23rd December Willits wanted to take a firm contract with the Dryden Company for 3,000 cords only, when ten days before he was inducing Mondor and his associates to deliver 4,000 cords. He had a great deal of experience with those contracts and he must have felt that a contract of four thousand cords could not be fulfilled during the time specified and that is the reason why he would not oblige himself to deliver that quantity to the Dryden Company, though he bound others less experienced.\nThis circumstance also should not be forgotten when we come to assess the damages for breach.\nThe measure of damages, as laid down in the leading case of Hadley v. Baxendale[6], should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either as arising naturally, according to the usual course of things, from a breach of contract or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach.\nWhen Willits made his contract with Mondor et al., he should have disclosed to them (if he wanted to have the right to claim all the damages which he now claims) the whole nature and the extent of his own contract with the Dryden Company.\nThe fact that the appellants, Mondor et al, knew of the existence of the Dryden contract is not sufficient to withdraw the case from the application of the rule laid down in Hadley v. Baxendale6. This special circumstance of a main contract with the Dryden Company is a fact of course which should be considered in assessing the damages, but it does not alter the rule that the damages which the party ought to receive in respect of the breach should be such as may be fairly and reasonably considered or may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made their contract.\nWe have no right to assume in assessing the damages that a profit as large as two dollars per cord was in the contemplation of both parties. It looks to me pretty evident that Mondor et al would not have made this contract if they had been apprised by Willits of the price he was going to receive. We should then consider what would be a reasonable assessment of damages in these circumstances.\nThe court below has given the full profits which Willits would have made not only on 3,000 cords but on 4,000 cords; and besides they have granted the damages which the Dryden Company claimed from Willits.\nI hesitate a great deal in confirming the part of this judgment concerning the profits Willits was to make, because he should have disclosed his exorbitant profit.\nHalsbury, vol. 10, page 315, no. 581, says:\nIf a buyer or consignee has at the date of the contract entered into a subcontract, its terms, so far as they affect the principal contract, are special circumstances of which notice must be given in order that damages may be recovered in respect thereof. In order to fix the seller or carrier who has delayed or refused delivery with liability for damages incurred by the buyer or consignee by reason of his inability to fulfil the subsidiary contract, it is not enough that it is made known that the goods are intended for resale, neither, on the other hand, is it necessary that the terms of the subcontract should be completely disclosed. Liability is incurred in respect of so much of the terms of the subcontract as is communicated.\nI cannot concur however in the judgment below concerning the damages which Willits had to pay to the Dryden Company for retention money, and I rely in that respect on Borries v. Hutchinson[7] decided in 1865, which presents facts almost similar to this case. The defendant Hutchison had contracted to sell to Borries a commodity not ordinarily procurable on the market. At the time of entering into the contract Hutchison was aware that Borries was purchasing this commodity for a foreign correspondent. Later on he learned that the goods were designed for St. Petersburg and had been sold at an advanced price. The goods were not delivered at the time stipulated to the St. Petersburg merchant. It was conceded that Borries was entitled to recover the profit which he would have made on the transaction and that he could also recover the excess of freight and insurance resulting from a rise in the freight rates between the time of the contract and the time of the delivery; but the court held that the original vendor was not chargeable with the damages that Borries had paid to his purchaser, these damages being too remote.\nApplying the principle of the decision to the present case, I say that it may be conceded, though with a great deal of doubt, that Willits is entitled to his loss of profit of $2 per cord but that he could not be entitled to recover the damages which he paid to the Dryden Paper Co.\nI am fortified in this conclusion by the fact that Willits himself was to help in the locating of the roads and that he has done nothing to fulfil this obligation and also by the fact that he induced the appellants to contract for 4,000 cords of wood when he knew himself that they were unable to cut as much and when he would not himself contract with the Dryden Company for such a quantity.\nThe damages to which the respondents are entitled on their counterclaim are $2,811.20 being $2 per cord on the quantity not delivered. They have already in their hands a sum of $1,556.64 of retention money. The latter should be deducted from the $2,811.20.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment on the counter claim should be reduced to $1,254.56.\nMignault J.\u2014Had the appellants fulfilled their contract with the respondents to cut, haul and deliver 4,000 cords of pulpwood at $6 per cord, the respondent\u2014who had contracted to cut, haul and deliver at least 3,000 cords, and had received permission to increase this amount to 5,000 cords, as found by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, for the Dryden Paper Company, Limited, at $8 per cord\u2014would have made a profit of $2 per cord, or in all $8,000. The appellants cut and delivered only 2,594.4 cords, leaving a deficiency of 1,405.6 cords. They sue the respondents for the April and last deliveries, to wit 532 cords (comprised in the 2,594.4 cords) at $6 per cord, deducting however 10 per cent (or sixty cents per cord) under the following clause of their contract.\nPayments will be made on the 15th of each month for all wood thus received before the first of the month. Ten per cent of the value of the wood received will be retained by the parties of the first part (the respondents) until this contract has been completed. The respondents admit that this amount is due, but by their counterclaim demand $3,330 for loss of profits and other damages. Their contract with the Dryden company had an identical clause as to the retention of ten per cent (or eighty cents per cord) from payments until completion of the contract, and the amount of their counterclaim is calculated as follows:\u2014\nLoss of profits on the deficiency of 1405.6 cords $2,811 20\nLoss of 20 cents per cord, being the difference between 80 cents retained by the Dryden Co. and 60 cents retained by the respondents, on the quantity delivered, 2594.4 cords 518 80\nTotal $3,330 00\nThe counterclaim alone is in question on this appeal.\nI will test the respondents' claim against the appellants by another mode of calculation. Total profit had the appellants' contract\nbeen fulfilled $8,000 00\nCr.\nReceived from the Dryden Company on the portion of the price representing the respondents' profit of $2 per cord, after deduction of 80 cents per cord, on the quantity delivered, 2,594.4 cords, to wit: $1.20 per cord $3,113 28\nRetained from the appellants and also deducted by the latter in their claim for the 532 cords unpaid, 60 cents per cord, on 2,594.4 cords 1,556 64 4,669 92\nNet loss of profits $3,330 08\nThere is a difference of eight cents between this net loss of profits and the respondents' figures, which is explained by the fact that the respondents neglected the decimal 4 in calculating the 20 cents per cord on the quantity delivered, 2,594.4 cords.\nThe learned trial judge stated that a settlement in full was made between the respondents and the Dryden Company on the basis of the retention by the latter of the 80 cents per cord deducted by it under the clause of its contract to which I have referred. Not having completed their contract I cannot see how the respondents could have recovered this retention money from the Dryden Company and I look on it as a loss occasioned by the breach of the appellants' contract. The appellants knew that the respondents had a contract for this wood with the Dryden Company and the retention clause is not an unusual clause in contracts of this kind.\nI cannot appreciate for what reason Mr. Justice Prendergast, at the end of his dissenting judgment, stated that the respondents were allowed on their counterclaim $1,237.44 in addition to the $3,330 granted to them. In their factum, the appellants state that this is an error of the learned judge, and that the figure intended is $1,556.64 instead of $1,237.44, being the 60 cents per cord retained from the appellant on their contract price. The calculation I have made shews that this full amount is credited to the appellants and the $3,330.08 is the net balance.\nIn my opinion the contention of the appellants under the clause obliging the respondents to render them assistance is unfounded. This was the opinion of all the judges of the Court of Appeal.\nThe respondents occupy the rather fortunate position of middlemen who get their full profit on a contract the execution of which they had passed on to the appellants, while the latter were charged with the entire risk and must bear the whole loss incurred by reason of the non-fulfilment of this contract. The liability of the respondents towards the Dryden Company would have been fully discharged had the appellants delivered to the company 3,000 cords, the minimum quantity which the appellants contracted to cut for the latter, and then the only claim of the respondents would have been for loss of profits on 1,000 cords, which they had the privilege of cutting for the company, but which they had not bound themselves to deliver. The misfortune of the appellants is that they fell materially short of the minimum quantity which the Dryden Company was entitled to demand from the respondents, thus giving the former the right to keep the retention money. And for this reason there is no escape from the conclusion that the respondents' counterclaim is well founded.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bonnar, Hollands & Philp.\nSolicitor for the respondents: William Manahan.\n[1] 32 Man.

R. 108) that the situs of the notes was in Massachusetts they being transferable by acts done solely there, and the administrator or his transferee alone could sue on them.\nHeld also, that the administrator could maintain an action against the maker in the Manitoba courts without taking out ancillary administration in that province.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] reversing the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the defendant.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the head-note. The only question for decision on the appeal is whether or not the administrator with the will annexed, appointed by a Probate Court in Massachusetts, must take out administration in Manitoba also to enable him to sue the maker there of promissory notes in his possession as administrator.\nThe trial judge held that the action could not be maintained but his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHudson K.C. for the appellants. The foreign administrator cannot maintain this action. Williams on Executors (11 ed.) 264; Enohin v. Wiley[3]. Simple contract debts are assets where the debtor is found. A promissory note is merely evidence of title and does not change the character of the debt. Attorney General v. Bouwens[4]; Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[5].\nBrowns v.

Ancillary administration from the Surrogate Court of Manitoba was, under the circumstances, unnecessary to enable the plaintiff to maintain his action.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The action which has given rise to this appeal was brought upon three promissory notes made by the appellant, payable to the order of Marie Louise Crosby. The appellant, at the time the notes were given, resided in Manitoba, and the payee in Massachusetts. Mrs. Crosby died in 1918 in Massachusetts, and the respondent, Prescott, became in due course, by a grant of letters of administration with will annexed in Massachusetts, administrator there of her estate. As in my opinion the claim of the administrator is the only one requiring consideration, I shall make no reference to the circumstances upon which the alternative claim of the respondent Campbell is based. The promissory notes sued upon, being then past due and unpaid, came into the possession of the respondent Prescott as such administrator in the ordinary course of administration in Massachusetts. No grant of letters of administration, ancillary or otherwise, was ever received by the respondent from Manitoba.\nThe appellant contends that in the absence of such a grant the respondent has no status to maintain an action in Manitoba upon debts due by a person residing therein to the testator. The point is an important one, and it is impossible, I think, to say that there is any actual decision which concludes the matter. I have come to the conclusion, however, that the facts of the case bring it within the principle upon which the Court of Appeal based its judgment. It is, of course, a perfectly well settled doctrine of English law that simple contract obligations due to the deceased by a debtor residing in England are deemed for the purposes of administration and collection to have a situs within the jurisdiction where the debtor resides, and consequently no action can be maintained in England to enforce such obligations against a debtor residing there by a foreign administrator who is not clothed with authority to administer the assets of the deceased in England by an English grant. Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[7]. The old form of declaration in debt was debit et debinet (2 Saund. 117b.); and the presumption was not an unnatural one that the assets to satisfy the debt would be found in the jurisdiction where the debtor had his domicile.\nThe Court of Appeal in Manitoba has held, rightly as I think, that there is an exception to this rule in the case of negotiable instruments; and that, as regards these, if they are reduced into possession by a foreign administrator within the territory from which he has received his grant and where they were at the time of the death of the creditor, it is competent to him to enforce them by action in the English courts, even in the absence of an English grant. This exception is said to be based upon the circumstance that the debt evidenced by such an instrument being transferable by delivery, is capable of being reduced into possession by means of acquiring possession of the instrument itself, and that such an instrument having been reduced into possession by the administrator in the lawful execution of his authority as such in the jurisdiction from which he derived his grant, his title to the debt due upon it is as good as his title to corporeal chattels reduced into possession in similar circumstances.\nIt is not open to doubt that a debt due to a deceased foreign creditor by an English debtor may be subject to be reduced into possession by the administrator of the foreign creditor within the foreign jurisdiction in such a way as to entitle him to enforce it in England without an English grant. Mr. Westlake gives an example of such\na debt having been so reduced into possession by the recovery of judgment for it in a foreign jurisdiction, and the authorities referred to by him on page 127, Vanquelin v. Bouard[8]; Re Macnichol[9]; support his proposition that in such a case the judgment creditor may enforce his judgment by action in England without obtaining an English grant. It is beyond question also that the debts due upon negotiable instruments held in England at the time of his death by a creditor dying abroad are English assets in respect of which probate duty is payable; Attorney General v. Bouwens[10] ; Winans v. Attorney General[11] ; and this on the ground that such instruments are of a chattel nature capable of being transferred in England and \"sold for money\" in England. In like manner the foreign administrator may transfer and give a good title to the debt due by an English debtor upon a negotiable instrument coming into his hands as such administrator, and the transferee could, of course, maintain an action upon the debt so transferred to him. I think Story's proposition (Conflict of Laws, par. 517) follows from this, viz., that a foreign administrator who reduces such a negotiable security into possession is entitled to sue the debtor upon it in any other jurisdiction where he may be found, without obtaining a grant from that jurisdiction. Mr. Westlake sums up the matter in a passage at page 126, Private International Law, which in my opinion states the true rule. It is in the following words:\u2014\n96. But to the rule in par. 95a the debts due on negotiable instruments are an exception, because they can be sufficiently reduced into possession by means of the paper which represents them. They are in fact in the nature of corporeal chattels. Hence the negotiable instruments of a deceased person, and his bonds or certificates payable to bearer, belong to the heir or administrator who first obtains possession of them within the territory from the law or jurisdiction of which he derives his title or his grant. He can indorse them if they were payable to the deceased's order, and he or his indorsee can sue on them in any other jurisdiction without any other grant. There are two points, however, raised by Mr. Hudson in his argument, which require special consideration. The first is based upon the fact that the promissory notes sued upon, being payable to the order of the testator, were not indorsed by the respondent, and consequently they never were in a state in which they were transferable by delivery alone. Therefore it is said that the administration never acquired a title to these negotiable instruments which enabled him to sue in any character other than that of administrator of the testator's estate, and that this character he does not bear outside the jurisdiction from which he received his grant.\nThe passage in Story no doubt contemplates instruments transferable by delivery; that is to say, instruments payable to bearer or instruments which, if payable to order, have been indorsed by the payee; and no case has been referred to, I think, in which the foreign administrator was suing in his own name upon a non-indorsed instrument payable to his testator's order.\nIn principle, however, the right of the foreign administrator to sue appears to depend upon the fact that the instrument has been reduced into possession, and through it the debt due under it. The debt due under a promissory note payable to the testator's order is sufficiently reduced into the administrator's possession for the relevant purpose if the administrator, within the jurisdiction from which he receives his grant, gets possession of it and indorses it in blank, for the reason that his power of disposition of the debt by delivery of the instrument is as complete as if it were a movable chattel. Can it then be said that the administrator, having the note in his possession and having power by the manual act of putting his name on the back of it to put it into a state for immediate transfer by delivery, has not by the fact itself of acquiring such control, sufficiently taken possession of the instrument, and with it the debt, within the meaning of the rule? His power over the instrument and over the debt is complete and this, I think, does constitute such possession. To hold otherwise would appear to involve the introduction of a distinction based upon form and technicality rather than upon principle or substance. The other point requiring notice is that the promissory notes now in question having been overdue at the testator's death are not within the rule enunciated by Story : and Mr. Westlake. It is true that overdue promissory notes are not instruments fully negotiable in the sense in which notes still current are; that is to say, they are not part of the currency of the country to which title may be acquired by a bona fide taker for value from a person who has no title. Nevertheless such instruments, though overdue, are transferable by delivery, and such delivery has the effect of transferring not only the document, but the debt as well, and in that respect the resemblance to corporeal movables is complete ; and accordingly I think the circumstance of their being overdue does not take them out of the rule.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff, Prescott, though described as an executor and administrator of the estate of Mary Louise Crosby (he is in fact administrator cum test, annex.), in reality brings this action in his own right and personal capacity as the holder of the notes sued upon. His title to them was perfected under the law of Massachusetts and the letters of administration granted him by the Probate Court of the county of Middlesex in that State, where the testatrix resided and the notes were at the time of her death. In my opinion he did not require ancillary administration from the Manitoba Surrogate Court having jurisdiction where the defendant resided in order to maintain this action. I cannot usefully add to the reasons for so holding assigned by the Chief Justice of Manitoba and the late Mr. Justice Cameron.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nMignault J.\u2014The action of the respondent Prescott is on three promissory notes dated and signed by the appellant at Elkhorn, Manitoba, and payable to the order of Miss Mary Louise Crosby, a resident of the state of Massachusetts. Two of these notes, for $2,700 and $686.44, respectively, indicate no place of payment; the third, for $289, was made payable at Westford, Mass. Mary Louise Crosby died in Massachusetts not having indorsed the notes, and left a will bequeathing her entire estate to her sisters, Annie (Mrs. Campbell) and Lavinia (Mrs. Wightman). These two sisters however predeceased Miss Crosby, the former leaving a will devising a house and contents to her two sisters and bequeathing all her money to her sons, George Campbell and Llewellyn Campbell. The latter died in Saskatchewan and left a will which gave a legacy of $1,000 to a Mrs. Labossi\u00e8re, and the rest of his estate to his brother George Campbell. Miss Crosby had confided these notes to the respondent Prescott for safekeeping, in Westford, Massachusetts, where she lived with Prescott and his mother as their housekeeper, and after her death Prescott was named, by the Massachusetts court, administrator with will annexed of her estate. In this action the respondent Prescott described himself as executor and administrator of the estate of Mary Louise Crosby. George Campbell was joined as plaintiff and alleged that an equitable assignment of the notes had been made to him, and also claimed that under his mother's and his brother's wills he was entitled thereto. The notes had merely been sent to him unindorsed and I will dispose at once of his contention that an equitable assignment of the notes was made to him by saying that in my opinion it is not borne out by the facts. Nor do I think he can assert his claim, if he has one, to Miss Crosby's estate in this action. The action must therefore be dealt with on the basis that Prescott is the only competent plaintiff.\nThe question raised by the plea of the appellant, who has always resided in Manitoba, is whether the Massachusetts administrator can take this action against him without obtaining letters of administration in Manitoba.\nPerhaps the point would be better stated thus:\u2014\nWas the situs of these notes in Massachusetts at Miss Crosby's death, and if so, could the Massachusetts administrator, on the strength of his nomination as such by the local court, sue the appellant on the notes without being appointed administrator in Manitoba?\nWas the situs of these notes in Massachusetts at the time of Miss Crosby's death?\nThe question of the situation of property usually does not admit of much discussion. If the property consists of real estate or corporeal movables, it has a local situation which is apparent to any one. And if under certain statutes, by reason of the language used, a fictional situation is given to property notwithstanding its real situation, it is obvious that these fictions cannot be extended to any case other than the one provided for. There is no necessity to refer here to the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, which is by.no means of general application, except to observe that the deceased was domiciled where these notes were locally situate when she died.\nBut there is a real difficulty when the property consists of debts or generally of choses in action. As to this species of property, the general rule is that it must be held to be situate where resides the debtor or other person against whom the claim exists. (Dicey, Conflict of Laws, 3rd ed., p. 342.) In other words, simple contract debts (which expression excludes debts created by deed or judgment debts) have no local situation other than the residence of the debtor where the assets to satisfy them would probably be. Rex v. Lovitt[12].\nDoes this rule apply to negotiable instruments such as bills of exchange, promissory notes, etc., which are locally situate at the place where the deceased resided at his death? In Attorney General v. Bouwens[13], which has been since recognized as a leading authority and on which reliance was placed by both the majority and the minority judges in the court below, it was held that the English probate duty was payable in respect of bonds of foreign governments, of which a testator dying in England was the holder at the time of his death, and which had come to the hands of his executor in England, such bonds being marketable securities within the kingdom, saleable and transferable by delivery only, and it not being necessary to do any act out of the kingdom in order to render the transfer of them valid.\nIn this case, the bonds or securities had been issued respectively by the Russian, the Danish and the Dutch Governments, dividends on the two former being paid by an agent in London, and on the latter in Amsterdam. Lord Abinger, speaking for the court, distinguished the case from two prior decisions, Attorney General v. Dimond[14], and Attorney General v. Hope[15], dealing with French rentes and American stock, which could only be transferred in France and the United States, respectively.\nThe question in the Bouwens Case[16] was whether the defendant was liable for probate duty in respect of these securities, and it thus involved the question of the situs of the securities. This situs was to be determined according to the practice, so far as it has not been changed, of the ecclesiastical tribunals which formerly had jurisdiction in these matters, and Lord Abinger, after citing the rules that had been thus laid down, said (page 192):\u2014\nThese distinctions being well established, it seems to follow that no ordinary in England could perform any act of administration within his diocese, with respect to debts due from persons resident abroad, or with respect to shares or interests in foreign funds payable abroad, and incapable of being transferred here; and therefore no duty would be payable on the probate or letters of administration in respect of such effects. But, on the other hand, it is clear that the ordinary could administer all chattels within his jurisdiction; and if an instrument is created of a chattel nature, capable of being transferred by acts done here, and sold for money here, there is no reason why the ordinary or his appointee should not administer that species of property. Such an instrument is in effect a saleable chattel, and follows the nature of other chattels as to the jurisdiction to grant probate.\nFurther Lord Abinger said (pages 192, 193):\u2014\nLet us suppose the case of a person dying abroad, all whose property in England consists of foreign bills of exchange, payable to order, which bills of exchange are well known to be the subject of commerce, and to be usually sold on the Royal Exchange. The only act of administration which his administrator could perform here would be to sell the bills and apply the money to the payment of his debts. In order to make titles to the bills to the vendee, he must have letters of administration; in order to sue in trover for them, if they, are improperly withheld from him, he must have letters of administration (for even if there were a foreign administration, it is an established rule that an administration is necessary in the country where the suit is instituted (Story on Conflict of Laws, 421) : and that these letters of administration must be stamped with a duty according to the saleable value of the bills, the case of Hunt v. Stevens[17], is an express authority.\nThe importance of this decision is that it considers as situate (and therefore subject to probate duty) within England, foreign securities capable of being transferred or sold in England, without it being necessary to do any act out of the kingdom to render the transfer valid. And the converse of the case supposed by Lord Abinger\u2014a testator dying in England possessed of foreign securities capable of being sold and transferred there\u2014is equally a case where the English probate duty would be payable, for it is the precise case passed upon by the Exchequer of Pleas in the Bouwens Case[18]. See also Winans v. The Attorney General[19].\nI may refer again to Dicey, at page 344, who states as follows the effect of the Bouwens Case18.\nWhen bonds, again, or other securities, e.g., bills of exchange, forming part of the property of a deceased person, are in fact in England and are marketable securities in England, saleable and transferable there by delivery only, without its being necessary to do any act out of England in order to render the transfer valid, not only the bonds or bills themselves, but also, what is a different matter, the debts or money due upon such bonds or bills, are to be held situate in England, and this though the debts or money are owing from foreigners out of England.\nThe following species of property have been held to be subject to probate duty in England, because they were considered to be situate there:\u2014\nCertificates of shares in a foreign company made out in the name of the shareholder, having indorsed thereon a form of transfer and power of attorney in blank, Stern v. The Queen[20] ; it would appear that on some of these certificates the form of transfer had been signed by the person named as owner of the shares, and in others it had not:\u2014\nCertificates of shares in foreign railway companies, Goods of Agnese[21] :\u2014\nShares of mining companies in South Africa, when there was in London a duplicate register where the shares could be transferred. In re Clark, McKecknie v. Clark[22].\nReturning to the Bouwens Case18 each of the parties here rely on it as an authority which supports his contentions. I think it may be taken to establish that inasmuch as notes such as Miss Crosby possessed in Massachusetts were marketable securities there and could be sold and transferred without it being necessary to do any act outside of Massachusetts to render the transfer valid, these notes are to be held situate in Massachusetts, although the monies thereunder were payable by a person domiciled elsewhere. At least one of the notes was payable in Massachusetts.\nThe only difficulty is that these notes had not been indorsed by Miss Crosby. But this difficulty is apparent only, for the respondent as administrator could indorse these notes in blank and then transfer them by delivery. He could also sue on the notes himself without indorsing them. As far as any act was required in order to sell or transfer these notes, such act could be performed in Massachusetts.\nI think, therefore, that the situs of these notes, which are negotiable securities, was, under the authorities I have referred to, in Massachusetts at Miss Crosby's death.\nThis point being determined, it is difficult to appreciate why letters of administration should be taken out in Manitoba in respect of personal property situate in Massachusetts and in the possession there of the Massachusetts administrator.\nIndeed it appears clear that the court in Manitoba would not have jurisdiction to make a grant of administration when no property of the deceased is situate in that province. Tucker, in Goods of[23], and Williams on Executors, 11th ed. vol. 1, p. 340. See also Manitoba Surrogate Court Act (R.S.M. ch. 47, sec. 19). And on the question whether in such a case the foreign administrator can sue before the courts of the country where the debtor is domiciled, in recovery of debts situate in the country where the deceased was domiciled, I may refer to Westlake, Private International Law, 5th ed., at page 13.2, who says that debts due on negotiable securities are an exception to the rule governing simple contract debts, because they can be sufficiently reduced into possession by means of the paper which represents them. And he adds, basing his opinion on Attorney General v. Bouwens[24] : They are in fact in the nature of corporeal chattels. Hence the negotiable instruments of a deceased person, and his bonds or certificates payable to bearer, belong to the heir or administrator who first obtains possession of them within the territory from the law or jurisdiction of which he derives his title or his grant. He can indorse them if they were payable to the deceased's order, and he or his indorsee can sue on them in any other jurisdiction without any other grant.\nWestlake further refers to Story, Conflict of Laws, 8th ed., par. 517, page 736, who supports his view in these terms:\u2014\nThe like principle will apply where an executor or administrator, in virtue of an administration abroad, becomes there possessed of negotiable notes belonging to the deceased, which are payable to bearer; for then he becomes the legal owner and bearer by virtue of his administration, and may sue thereon in his own name; and he need not take out letters of administration in the state where the debtor resides, in order to maintain a suit against him. And for a like reason it would seem that negotiable paper of the deceased, payable to order, actually held and indorsed by a foreign executor or administrator in the foreign country, who is capable there of passing the legal title by such indorsement, would confer a complete legal title on the indorsee, so that he ought to be treated in every other country as the legal indorsee, and allowed to sue thereon accordingly, in the same manner that he would be if it were a transfer of any personal goods or merchandise of the deceased, situate in such foreign country.\nI think these authorities shew that no grant of letters of administration in the state or country where the debtor is sued is necessary, when the foreign administrator became legal owner and holder of negotiable securities by virtue of his appointment as administrator of the deceased's estate in the state or country where the deceased was domiciled, and when the negotiable securities were in the deceased's possession at his death. It does not seem to me to matter whether notes or bills to order had or had not been indorsed by the deceased, for if they had not, the administrator could indorse them, and inasmuch as he himself sues on them indorsation is unnecessary. The respondent here describes himself as \"executor and administrator of the estate of Mary Louise Crosby.\" He was not executor, but only administrator with will annexed. I regard, however, these words as being merely descriptive and not as precluding the contention that the respondent is the legal owner and holder of the notes.\nI may add that I am generally in accord with the opinions expressed by Chief Justice Perdue and the late Mr. Justice\n45.8\nCameron in this case. See also the judgment of Chief Justice Harvey of Alberta in Browns v. Browns[25]. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hudson, Ormond, Spice & Symington.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bonnar, Hollands & Philp.\n[1] 32 Man.

Beaudoin (Defendant) Respondent.\n1923: February 19, 20; 1923: May 1.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nContract\u2014Sale\u2014Maple sugar\u2014Warranty as to quality\u2014Delivery\u2014Payment by sight draft attached to bill of lading\u2014Part of shipment not of quality specified\u2014Right to recover price of sale\u2014Articles 1048, 1063, 1473, 1492, 1526 C.C.\nOn the 27th May, 1920, the appellants agreed to buy from the respondent \"30,000 pounds of pure maple sugar * * * guaranteed free of burnt and soft sugar * * * to be packed in good clean bags.\" On the 8th of June, the appellants ordered and received a shipment of 10,066 pounds and paid for it by accepting a sight draft attached to the bill of lading. Fifty-four pounds having been found below the guaranteed quality, the respondent on being notified reimbursed a sum representing their value. On the 31st of July, the appellants sent another order for 10,000 pounds and paid for them in like manner without having had the opportunity to inspect the goods. On the 16th August, they transferred the sugar to their warehouse in Montreal and then began to empty the bags. Out of the first 24 bags, the appellants found that between 30 and 40 per cent of the shipment were not of the quality guaranteed and complained to the respondent. The latter arrived in Montreal on the 20th of August, did not agree with appellants' finding and offered to replace any small quantity of sugar which according to him might be burnt or soft. The parties not being able to effect a settlement, the appellants on the 23rd of August took an action to resiliate the whole contract and to be reimbursed the amount of the draft paid for the second shipment, not having then received a letter sent on the same day by the respondent, in which he offered to replace any part found unsatisfactory in the 70 bags left unemptied. The respondent, with his defence, made a tender of $80 representing the value of the sugar which was not, according to him, of standard quality.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the appellants had the right to reject the second shipment of sugar and to recover the price paid for it.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014As the words \"guaranteed free of burnt and soft sugar\" are words describing the sugar sold, the goods contracted for have not been delivered. (Articles 1063, 1473 C.C.)\nPer Mignault J.\u2014Since these words constitute a warranty of quality relief must be given to the appellants under article 1526 C.C., as the defect in the goods was latent for the appellants who were obliged to make payment before it could be discerned by inspection. Duff and Brodeur JJ. contra.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Whether the words \"guaranteed free of burnt and soft sugar\" should be regarded as words of description or as a warranty of quality, the appellants are entitled to recover the price paid for the second shipment. Per Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014Relief under article 1526 C.C. is not confined to cases of legal warranty, but it extends to breaches of conventional warranty.\nPer Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The appellants' action can also be maintained under the provisions of article 1048 C.C., as they paid the price of sale believing themselves by error to be debtors.\nPer Idington J. dissenting\u2014The appellants' action was premature as, the time of delivery having been extended by mutual agreement, the respondent under the circumstances of this case had the right to have an opportunity of replacing the goods not up to the standard in the same method adopted on the first shipment.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the appellants' action.\nMonty K.C. for the appellants.\nDorais K.C. and Beaudoin for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellants and respondent entered into the following contract:\u2014\nMontreal, May 27, 1920.\nI, T. Beaudoin, of Broughton Station, Quebec, party of the first part, hereby sell and agree to deliver to Canada Produce Company, 171 St. Paul Street, East, Montreal, Quebec, party of the second part, thirty thousand pounds (30,000 lbs.) of pure maple sugar, made during the year 1920, and guaranteed free of burnt and soft sugar, sugar to be packed in good clean bags, about 100 lbs. to be placed in each bag. Delivery to be made by the seller within ten days (10) from this date. Seller to place the sugar on board car free of expense to the buyer. Buyer to pay the seller twenty-six cents (26c.) per pound f.o.b. car, bags free, and it is further understood that the buyer will have a representative on the ground at the time the car is loaded and will pay cash or accepted check on completion of loading of goods on car,\nT. Beaudoin,\nCanada Produce Company,\nPer W. H. Lamer.\nThe market price was thereafter in a falling condition for said class of goods.\nInstead of calling for delivery thereof within the ten days from said date the appellants waited until reminded of their obligation by respondent and, nearly a month later, requested the latter to send a shipment of almost a third of the quantity named, and he did so.\nUpon that occasion the respondent called the appellants' attention to the condition of the contract requiring them to have a representative present at the shipment and their reply was that they would not, but trusted to the integrity of the respondent to see that the quality of the goods was all right.\nThe required shipment was made by respondent accordingly and he made a draft for the price therefor which was duly honoured.\nBut on the inspection at Montreal the appellants rejected and set aside for respondent a small quantity, as not up to the mark, in regard to quality and notified the respondent thereof, and sent him the rejected parcel for which he, later on, sent in return the amount of the price therefor and the expenses.\nA continued reminder from time to time by the respondent as to the need of arranging for shipment of the balance induced the appellants to send an order for shipment of about another third of the whole quantity bought but not until the 31st of July, 1920.\nOn this occasion both parties seemed to assume that the same method would be observed as on the previous occasion and no representative was sent by appellants to inspect at the point of shipment.\nThe respondent therefore on getting the order therefor shipped according to the order and drew at sight on appellant for the price thereof, and they accepted and paid the draft and proceeded to unload the goods which were packed in bags. They emptied then twenty-four of the ninety-four bags in the consignment into barrels in which they intended shipping same to a customer in the United States and then, pretending that the goods were not up to the required standard, phoned respondent of their complaint.\nHe came to Montreal and, on the 20th of August, 1920, discussed the matter with appellants but they could not agree.\nThe respondent then proposed that they follow out the same course of dealing as on the previous occasion and set aside such part as found below the standard, and he would make good any such deficiency.\nThe appellants would not assent to continue said mode of dealing unless the respondent would also agree to abandon the balance of the contract, which he declined to do. He returned home and wrote fully and clearly his proposition apparently to put beyond doubt or dispute that he was acting in accord with the method adopted on the first shipment as a substitution for the inspection at place of shipment as provided in the contract.\nThe appellants were apparently so determined to get rid of the contract that they instituted this action, on the 23rd of August, 1920, to annul the whole contract and to be reimbursed the amount of the draft they had paid for the second shipment.\nThe learned trial judge refused to annul the contract but allowed a recovery for the amount of the said draft.\nOn appeal by respondent therefrom the Court of King's Bench unanimously reversed said judgment with costs.\nI agree so entirely in the main with the reasons of the several learned judges writing same that I do not require to set them forth afresh herein, but desire in addition thereto, to express as clearly as I can a few considerations arising out of the foregoing facts.\nThe time for delivery had clearly been so, extended, by mutual agreement, evidenced by the conduct of the parties, that even if by mistake some of the goods were not up to the standard, that did not entitle the appellants to act in the abrupt manner they did in bringing this action as if all right to rectify said mistake, if any, had ended.\nI respectfully submit that the utmost they would be entitled to, under such circumstances, would be either to follow out the method adopted on the first shipment and, by mutual courtesy, assented to, of rejecting and setting aside all these goods not up to the standard, notifying the vendor thereof, and accepting those up to the required standard, and giving a reasonable time for due rectification thereof.\nOr they might, if that method is not to be accepted as a complete substitution of the provision in the contract, insist upon being notified at once of the time when a shipment would be made and be ready to inspect at the place of shipment as provided therein.\nThe evidence shews the respondent had at his place of business where that would have taken place, if insisted upon, an ample supply of such goods of the required quality, so as to meet effectually the most rigid inspection if that course had been adopted.\nI am not to be understood as implying that such was the proper course to have been adopted but it clearly was the only thing open to appellants if they cannot be held as having assented in a binding manner to the course of dealing pursued on the first shipment.\nIn my opinion that substituted mode of dealing had become binding upon both parties by their course of conduct and was that which should have been followed as the respondent proposed.\nIt is idle to argue as done herein, that the respondent would only abide by such rejection as he approved of.\nThere is no foundation for it in fact, unless the insinuation of one of the appellants in his evidence.\nThe proper thing to have done was to follow that course as part of the bargain thus mutually amended and then, if respondent set up any such pretension on the rejected goods being set aside, the true position in regard to the facts would have been disclosed. And if unjustifiable rejections made or dispute anent same have risen, that issue of fact could have been tried out.\nJust a word or two as to the actual quality of the goods. I am quite satisfied that there was no thirty or forty per cent of inferior quality. How did respondent, on the resale of the goods, after he had bought them in at the auction directed by the court, manage in such a depressed market to get twenty-two cents a pound for goods sold in a high market at only twenty-six cents a pound?\nThe fact is that the examination by all the alleged experts was of the most casual character of less than half. And all seem to have taken no. 1 sugar as the test whereas the contract does not specify any such standard but merely made in 1920, free from burnt and soft sugar. One if not two of them never saw a single one of the twenty-four bags passed into barrels before the appellants found any to reject, and the presumption that they were up to the mark is strengthened. How can appellants pretend to reject them?\nThe appellants argue the case as if the bargain was made to fit a special client of theirs, or a special market. It is nothing of that sort, but the open market in Montreal, or in Beauce, that has to be considered. I think the former where the contract was made.\nComing to that phase of the matter there is only about four hundred dollars involved herein if the results had been looked at, as in the last analysis they may have to be.\nAnd thus costs, many times that, have to be squandered in wretched litigation, purely begotten of an attempt by appellants unfairly trying to get rid of a contract instead of to get justice done.\nI think the judgment appealed from is right and that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with my brother Brodeur.\nAnglin J.\u2014The material facts in this case are fully stated in the opinion of my brother Mignault.\nI agree with him that having regard to the acts and conduct of the parties the August delivery of 10,061 pounds of maple sugar may be treated as a separate and distinct transaction. I understand that my brother Brodeur is of the same opinion.\nThe sugar was sold as\npure maple sugar * * * guaranteed free of burnt and soft sugar.\nThe evidence is that the shipment did not answer that description. It contained from thirty to forty per cent of soft or burnt sugar hopelessly mixed in with the remaining sixty to seventy per cent of sugar of the quality contracted for.\nThe plaintiffs paid for the whole shipment $2,679.84 by accepting a sight draft attached to the bill of lading before they had an opportunity to inspect the goods. Although inspection at the place of shipment (Broughton Station) had been originally contemplated, I agree that this term of the contract had been varied and inspection at the plaintiffs' warehouse in Montreal, necessarily after payment, substituted by tacit consent of the parties, acceptance of the sugar as fulfilling the requirements of the contract being postponed until after such inspection.\nThat the plaintiffs had the right to reject this shipment and to demand recoupment of the money paid for it, with respect, I think admits of no doubt. If the words \"guaranteed free of burnt and soft sugar\" are regarded as words of description, as my brother Brodeur seems to think they should be, the goods contracted for have not been delivered. If, on the other hand, as my brother Mignault seems to think the more correct view, those words should be regarded as a warranty of quality, I see no good reason why relief under article 1526 C.C. or relief analogous thereto should not be given. It is true that that article is found under the heading \"Warranty against latent defects.\" But the defect in the goods was latent for the purchasers when they were obliged to make payment. It could be discerned only on inspection. Appreciation of its full extent required the opening and examination of many bags\u201424 out of 94 were in fact emptied and examined before the purchasers became fully convinced of the impracticability of handling the sugar in their business. The defect was not apparent and was not something which the buyers might have known for themselves (article 1523 C.C.) when they were obliged to make payment. Although the term \"latent\" is usually applied to defects not discoverable by ordinary inspection, where, as here, opportunity for inspection and the consequent right of rejection are postponed until after payment, I would place the buyers in the same position for the purpose of the remedy afforded by article 1526 C.C. as if the defects discovered on inspection made in due season had been latent defects in the ordinary sense. They were in fact not discernible by any inspection which the purchasers could have made before payment. I do not assent to the view that relief under article 1526 C.C. is confined to cases of legal warranty. It extends in my opinion likewise to breaches of conventional warranties.\nBut whether viewed as a case of non-delivery of goods contracted for, or as one of breach of warranty rendering the goods unfit for the use for which they were intended or so diminishing their usefulness that the buyers would not have bought them if they had known their quality, the right to return the goods and recover the price paid for them is the same.\nFor the reasons indicated by my brothers Brodeur and Mignault, I agree that the measure of relief that should now be accorded to the plaintiffs must be restricted to the recovery of the $2,679.74 paid the defendant for the August shipment.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Le d\u00e9fendeur Beaudoin aurait le 27 mai 1920 vendu aux appelants 30,000 livres de sucre d'\u00e9rable pur \"guaranteed free of burnt and soft sugar\". Ce sucre devait \u00eatre livr\u00e9 franco \u00e0 bord dans dix jours \u00e0 la gare de Broughton, et les acheteurs devaient y avoir un repr\u00e9sentant pour en recevoir livraison et y faire le paiement.\nLe 8 juin les acheteurs ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Beaudoin de leur envoyer \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al 10,000 livres de sucre seulement. Ce dernier s'est rendu \u00e0 leur demande; et comme ils n'avaient personne \u00e0 la gare \u00e0 Broughton pour recevoir ces dix mille livres de sucre et pour les payer, il fit sur eux une traite \u00e0 vue qu'il attacha au connaissement.\nLes marchandises furent re\u00e7ues et accept\u00e9es et la traite pay\u00e9e.\nA plusieurs reprises apr\u00e8s ce premier envoi, Beaudoin, le vendeur, demanda aux appelants, ses acheteurs, de prendre livraison de la balance de sucre mentionn\u00e9 au contrat; mais ils n'\u00e9taient \u00e9videmment pas anxieux de prendre livraison. La preuve \u00e9tablit qu'un fl\u00e9chissement dans le prix s'\u00e9tait produit; et alors il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que ces acheteurs ne fussent pas empress\u00e9s de prendre livraison d'une marchandise qui ne pourrait pas \u00eatre revendue avec le profit qu'ils esp\u00e9raient. Cependant le 16 ao\u00fbt les appelants demandaient livraison de dix mille livres. Beaudoin s'est encore rendu \u00e0 leur demande; et comme ses acheteurs n'avaient pas de repr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 la gare de chargement, il tira une traite sur eux pour la quantit\u00e9 livr\u00e9e, soit $2,615.-86, qu'il attacha au connaissement. Les acheteurs ne pouvaient donc pas prendre possession du sucre sans payer cette traite et ils firent le paiement de la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\nMais, apr\u00e8s l'avoir transport\u00e9 dans leur magasin et apr\u00e8s l'avoir examin\u00e9, ils trouv\u00e8rent que le sucre n'\u00e9tait pas conforme au contrat, qu'il y en avait du br\u00fble et du mou. Alors ils avertirent imm\u00e9diatement l'acheteur qui se rendit \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al pour discuter cette question avec eux. Il y eut alors des n\u00e9gociations qui ne produisirent aucun r\u00e9sultat. De fait, les acheteurs auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eats \u00e0 garder tout le sucre ni mou ni br\u00fbl\u00e9 si le vendeur voulait les lib\u00e9rer de l'obligation de prendre livraison des 10,000 livres qui restaient sur le contrat. Mais on parut incapable de s'entendre m\u00eame sur la quantit\u00e9 qui n'\u00e9tait pas conforme au contrat.\nAlors les acheteurs, Lamer et al., ont institu\u00e9 peu de jours apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sente action pour se faire rembourser de la somme de $2,615.86 et des frais de transport qu'ils avaient pay\u00e9s; et ils ont demand\u00e9, en outre, l'annulation du contrat du 27 mai 1920.\nBeaudoin a reconnu qu'il y avait une petite quantit\u00e9 de sucre de la valeur de $30.00 qui n'\u00e9tait pas conforme au contrat, et il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en cour cette somme. Il maintient que le reste de son sucre est conforme \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e au contrat et il offre aussi par son plaidoyer de remplacer le mauvais sucre par une marchandise de bonne qualit\u00e9.\nLe point principal qui para\u00eet avoir fait l'objet de l'enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 de savoir si la marchandise livr\u00e9e \u00e9tait de la qualit\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e au contrat.\nLa preuve a constat\u00e9 qu'il y avait de 30 \u00e0 40% de mauvais sucre et que le bon \u00e9tait m\u00e9lang\u00e9 avec le mauvais.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a condamn\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 rembourser la somme pay\u00e9e, mais il n'est nullement question dans le jugement de la demande en r\u00e9siliation du contrat du 27 mai 1920. Dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des plaidoiries fait par le juge il n'en est pas fait mention, et le dispositif du jugement ne contient qu'une condamnation de payer la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e. Dans l'un des consid\u00e9rants le juge a cependant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'action \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e. Voil\u00e0 tout ce qu'il y a qui pourrait porter sur cette demande r\u00e9solutoire.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a renvers\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et a maintenu le plaidoyer et a renvoy\u00e9 l'action.\nLa v\u00e9ritable question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, suivant moi, est de savoir si ce sucre est conforme au contrat.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les t\u00e9moins sur une preuve contradictoire, a trouv\u00e9 que ce sucre \u00e9tait dans une tr\u00e8s forte proportion, soit 30 \u00e0 40%, inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 convenue. Ce point n'est pas formellement confirm\u00e9 dans le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi; mais les honorables juges qui ont \u00e9crit pour conclure au maintien de l'appel reconnaissent que la marchandise n'\u00e9tait pas toute de la qualit\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e au contrat.\nOn para\u00eet se baser en appel sur les n\u00e9gociations qui ont eu lieu entre les parties apr\u00e8s l'arriv\u00e9e des marchandises \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et on donne m\u00eame dans Tun des consid\u00e9rants un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des offres qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites de part et d'autres. On peut difficilement baser un jugement sur des propositions qui n'ont pas pris la forme d'une convention entre les parties, et nous avons alors \u00e0 examiner les droits des parties suivant la convention qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite entre eux le 27 mai 1920.\nPar cette convention le d\u00e9fendeur Beaudoin devait livrer du sucre dur et non br\u00fbl\u00e9. A-t-il rempli son obligation? Evidemment non. Alors a-t-il l\u00e9 droit de garder l'argent que les demandeurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de lui payer pour prendre possession des marchandises, et ce avant de pouvoir les examiner? Certainement non. Il offre par son plaidoyer de rembourser $30.00 pour le mauvais sucre. Ces offres sont certainement insuffisantes lorsque la preuve constate qu'une quantit\u00e9 de 30 \u00e0 40%, soit une valeur de plus de mille dollars, n'est pas de la qualit\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi aurait d\u00fb, m\u00eame si ses pr\u00e9misses \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es, donner au moins jugement aux demandeurs pour ces $1,000.00 et plus. Le d\u00e9fendeur Beaudoin n'avait pas le droit de garder cette somme qui repr\u00e9sentait une marchandise absolument inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e. Mais les acheteurs ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre tenus de garder les 60 ou 70% de bonnes marchandises parce qu'elles \u00e9taient toutes m\u00eal\u00e9es avec les mauvaises et que le triage devenait une op\u00e9ration dispendieuse et difficile.\nDans les circonstances, les offres faites par le d\u00e9fendeur sont insuffisantes et doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es. Il aurait d\u00fb simplement rembourser \u00e0 ses vendeurs la somme qu'il avait eue ill\u00e9galement d'eux et reprendre tout son sucre.\nMais malheureusement pour lui il n'a pas pris cette position. Il a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 suivre les demandeurs sur le terrain o\u00f9 ils avaient plac\u00e9 le litige. Il a voulu \u00e9tablir que le sucre \u00e9tait de la qualit\u00e9 voulue. Et comme il n'a pas pu r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que cette pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e, son plaidoyer devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9.\nOn a invoqu\u00e9 en Cour du Banc du Roi et devant cette cour les articles 1517, 1526 et 1530 C.C. comme d\u00e9terminant le droit que les parties pouvaient invoquer. Je ne crois pas, pour ma part, que ces articles s'appliquent au pr\u00e9sent litige, vu qu'ils ont trait \u00e0 la garantie contre l'\u00e9viction et contre les d\u00e9fauts cach\u00e9s, et il n'y a pas d'\u00e9viction ici, et les d\u00e9fauts dont on se plaint ne sont pas cach\u00e9s. Fuzier Herman, vo. Vices Redhibitoires, n\u00b0 1; Pothier, Vente n\u00b0 202; Merlin, R\u00e9pertoire, vo. R\u00e9hibitoire, p. 287. Lachute Shuttle Co. v. Frothingham & Workman, Ltd.[1].\nOn s'est demand\u00e9 si le vendeur qui a livr\u00e9 une marchandise inf\u00e9rieure au contrat pouvait valablement offrir de la remplacer. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider ce point dans la pr\u00e9sente cause; mais on peut consulter sur cette question Guillouard, Vente, n\u00b0 41.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur avait vendu du sucre d'\u00e9rable dur et non br\u00fbl\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 en vertu des articles 1063, 1473 et 1492 CC. de d\u00e9livrer \u00e0 ses acheteurs l'article qu'il avait vendu. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en France que:\nLa d\u00e9livrance de la chose vendue doit avoir pour objet la chose m\u00eame qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue, le vendeur ne peut substituer \u00e0 ce qui a fait la mati\u00e8re du contrat une autre chose qui lui ressemble. Cette obligation de la part du vendeur s'entend des choses de quantit\u00e9 telles que denr\u00e9es ou marchandises, et l'acqu\u00e9reur a le droit de refuser la livraison si la qualit\u00e9 des choses livr\u00e9es ou des conditions d'ex\u00e9cution ne sont pas conformes \u00e0 la convention.\nBeaudoin a livr\u00e9 un autre article que celui vendu et a forc\u00e9 l'acheteur cependant de payer avant de pouvoir l'examiner. Alors le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sans cause; et, comme dit Pothier, Vente, n\u00b0 186:\nL'acheteur ne s'\u00e9tant oblig\u00e9 de payer et n'ayant effectivement pay\u00e9 ce prix qu'en cons\u00e9quence de ce que le vendeur promettait de lui faire avoir la chose vendue, le vendeur n'ayant pas accompli sa promesse la cause pour laquelle l'acheteur a pay\u00e9 le prix ne subsiste plus.\nLe contrat sans consid\u00e9ration, dit l'article 989 C.C., est sans effet.\nOu encore, on peut dire que le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par les acheteurs dans la conviction que les marchandises livr\u00e9es \u00e9taient conformes au contrat. Il y a eu erreur de leur part \u00e0 ce sujet. Alors on pourrait \u00e9galement invoquer l'article 1048 C.C. qui donne droit de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition \u00e0 celui qui paie une dette s'en croyant erron\u00e9ment d\u00e9biteur.\nLes demandeurs avaient-ils le droit de demander la r\u00e9siliation du contrat du 27 mai 1920; et s'ils avaient ce droit, est-ce qu'ils peuvent maintenant le r\u00e9clamer devant cette cour, quand en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure il ne leur a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement accord\u00e9 et qu'ils n'ont pas fait appel de ce jugement.\nIl me para\u00eet certain que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'accorder cette partie de la demande. La r\u00e9solution d'un contrat ne peut se faire que par un jugement du tribunal. Il est de jurisprudence, ainsi que l'a jug\u00e9 la Cour de Revision dans la cause de Kaine v. Michaud,[2] que les termes suivants de l'article 1065 C.C. \"dans les cas qui le permettent\" indiquent que la r\u00e9solution ne sera prononc\u00e9e que dans certaines circonstances et pour des motifs qui para\u00eetront justes et raisonnables aux tribunaux.\nLa m\u00eame cour, dans une cause de Marleau v. Shapiro,[3] a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'on doit exercer ce droit de r\u00e9solution avec une extr\u00eame prudence. En supposant donc que les demandeurs auraient eu le droit de demander la r\u00e9solution de tout le contrat du 27 mai 1920, ce qui dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de cette cause n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre accord\u00e9, je suis d'opinion que les demandeurs ont virtuellement abandonn\u00e9 cette partie de leur demande en acceptant le jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nPour ces raisons la vente du 27 mai 1920 ne devrait pas \u00eatre r\u00e9solue, mais l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la Cour du Banc du Roi, et les demandeurs devraient avoir jugement pour $2,679.74.\nMignault J.\u2014Le 27 mai 1920 les parties ont fait le contrat suivant:\nMontreal, May 27, 1920.\nI, T. Beaudoin, of Broughton Station, Quebec, party of the first part, hereby sell and agree to deliver to Canada Produce Company, 171 St. Paul Street, East, Montreal, Quebec, party of the second part, thirty thousand pounds (30,000 lbs.) of pure maple sugar, made during the year 1920, and guaranteed free of burnt and soft sugar, sugar to be packed in good clean bags, about 100 lbs. to be placed in each bag. Delivery to be made by the seller within ten days (10) from this date. Seller to place the sugar on board car free of expense to the buyer. Buyer to pay the seller twenty-six cents (26c.) per pound f.o.b. car, bags free, and it is further understood that the buyer will have a representative on the ground at the time the car is loaded and will pay cash or accepted check on completion of loading of goods on car.\nT. Beaudoin,\nCanada Produce Company,\nPer W. H. Lamer.\nLes agissements des parties ont apport\u00e9 quelques modifications \u00e0 ce contrat. La livraison du sucre n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans les dix jours, et l'intim\u00e9 alla \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al au commencement de juin s'enqu\u00e9rir pourquoi les appellants ne se mettaient pas en mesure d'en prendre d\u00e9livrance, et on lui r\u00e9pondit qu'il recevrait sous peu un ordre d'exp\u00e9dition. Effectivement les appelants lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e8rent d'envoyer le tiers du sucre et l'intim\u00e9 leur en envoya 10,066 livres le 8 juin avec une trait\u00e9 \u00e0 vue que les appelants pay\u00e8rent. Il se trouva que 54 livres sur les 10,066 ne r\u00e9pondaient pas \u00e0 la garantie, et l'intim\u00e9 en ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 averti remboursa aux appelants le prix du sucre rejet\u00e9, $14.04. Lors de cette exp\u00e9dition, les appelants ne se firent pas repr\u00e9senter au lieu du chargement comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu et l'intim\u00e9 envoya sa traite \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al avec le connaissement. La non-pr\u00e9sence d'un repr\u00e9sentant des acheteurs au lieu du chargement, le paiement \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 l'arriv\u00e9e des marchandises, et la livraison des 30,000 livres par parties au lieu de la faire en une fois, sont des modifications que le vendeur et les acheteurs, d'un accord au moins tacite, paraissent avoir faites au contrat.\nLes instructions des appelants pour l'envoi du restant du sucre se firent attendre. L'intim\u00e9 leur \u00e9crivit le 7 juillet, les pressant de prendre livraison du sucre, et ceux-ci, en r\u00e9ponse, promirent de lui envoyer une commande sous peu, ce qu'ils ne firent que le 31 juillet, et cette fois encore ils ne demand\u00e8rent que 10,000 livres. Ce sucre, 10,061 livres, fut exp\u00e9di\u00e9 le 8 ao\u00fbt avec un traite \u00e0 vue, et encore une fois les appelants ne se firent pas repr\u00e9senter au chargement. Ce fut un malheur pour l'intim\u00e9 de n'avoir pas insist\u00e9 sur cette stipulation du contrat, car alors la qualit\u00e9 du sucre aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 contr\u00f4l\u00e9e au moment qu'on le chargeait sur les wagons, tout le sucre aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que ce chargement e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9, et les difficult\u00e9s qui sont survenues auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vit\u00e9es. Mais \u00e0 ce changement des conventions l'intim\u00e9 ne fit dans le temps aucune objection.\nA l'arriv\u00e9e du chargement \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al les appellants pay\u00e8rent la traite qui l'accompagnait, soit $2,615.86, prirent livraison du sucre le 16 ao\u00fbt et le transport\u00e8rent \u00e0 leur entrep\u00f4t. Le sucre devait \u00eatre envoy\u00e9 par eux \u00e0 des clients des Etats-Unis auxquels ils l'avaient vendu, et les appelants commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 vider les sacs et \u00e0 charger le sucre dans des barils. C'est alors qu'ils trouv\u00e8rent, m\u00eal\u00e9e au sucre de qualit\u00e9 acceptable, une forte proportion de sucre mou ou br\u00fbl\u00e9. Ils ont ainsi vid\u00e9 vingt-quatre sacs, et voyant que le bon sucre \u00e9tait m\u00e9lang\u00e9 avec le mauvais dans les sacs qu'ils avaient vid\u00e9s, ils s'en sont plaints imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Celui-ci promit de venir \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al examiner le sucre et n'y arriva que le 20 ao\u00fbt. Les parties ne s'entendirent pas sur la quantit\u00e9 de sucre br\u00fbl\u00e9 ou mou, l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendant que cette quantit\u00e9 \u00e9tait peu consid\u00e9rable, les appelants qu'elle \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 35 \u00e0 40 pour cent du total. Il y eut propositions et contre-propositions; les appelants voulaient faire annuler le reste du contrat; l'intim\u00e9 consentait \u00e0 remplacer le sucre qu'il estimerait \u00eatre d\u00e9fectueux, et encore \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate il disait que c'\u00e9tait peu de chose. Bref on ne s'entendit pas. Le 23 ao\u00fbt les appelants prirent cette action, et le m\u00eame jour l'intim\u00e9 leur \u00e9crivit de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le sucre inf\u00e9rieur, promettant de le remplacer par du bon. L'honorable juge Guerin a trouv\u00e9 que les appelants ont agi avec trop de pr\u00e9cipitation en prenant leur action du 23 ao\u00fbt, mais, comme cette action \u00e9tait r\u00e9dhibitoire, il e\u00fbt probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 p\u00e9rilleux de trop attendre.\nC'est sur cette pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 qu'il avait le droit de remplacer le sucre d\u00e9fectueux que le d\u00e9bat s'est engag\u00e9 devant les tribunaux. Les appelants concluaient \u00e0 l'annulation de tout le contrat, ce qui \u00e9tait impossible, car une partie du contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e d'un commun accord, et il restait encore pr\u00e8s de 10,000 livres \u00e0 exp\u00e9dier. Les pr\u00e9tentions des parties sont donc en pr\u00e9sence et il faut trancher le d\u00e9bat entre elles. J'ajoute qu'en admettant que les appelants ont trop demand\u00e9 en concluant \u00e0 l'annulation du contrat entier, rien n'emp\u00eache, s'ils ont de s\u00e9rieux motifs de se plaindre du deuxi\u00e8me envoi, de leur accorder une partie seulement des conclusions de leur action.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a trouv\u00e9 qu'il y avait dans ce sucre, au dire d'experts comp\u00e9tents et d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s, de trente \u00e0 quarante pour cent de sucre mou ou br\u00fbl\u00e9. J'accepte cette constatation de fait qui para\u00eet \u00e9galement avoir eu l'assentiment de l'honorable juge Guerin en cour du Banc du Roi.\nIl ne reste qu'\u00e0 appliquer \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce les principes du droit. Les parties ayant consenti \u00e0 faire des livraisons distinctes et s\u00e9par\u00e9es de ce qui d'apr\u00e8s le contrat devait \u00eatre livr\u00e9 en bloc, je crois qu'on peut, dans la d\u00e9cision de cette cause, envisager la deuxi\u00e8me exp\u00e9dition du sucre, en tout 10,061 livres, comme si elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 une vente distincte. Vu ce consentement des parties, cette deuxi\u00e8me exp\u00e9dition est certainement une chose ind\u00e9pendante du premier envoi qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 et de l'envoi qui restait \u00e0 faire. Voy. Baudry-Lacantinerie, Vente, n\u00b0 440, dernier alin\u00e9a et renvois. Voy. aussi Sirey, 1870. 1. 265, et la note o\u00f9 il est dit que chaque livraison de marchandises vendues au poids, au compte ou \u00e0 la mesure constitue en quelque sorte une vente distincte, et que l'acheteur doit pouvoir demander la r\u00e9siliation de l'une sans demander celle de l'autre.\nCela \u00e9tant, comme il y a eu violation de la garantie stipul\u00e9e au contrat, l'appelant peut invoquer l'article 1526 C.C. qui dit:\nL'acheteur a le choix de rendre la chose et de se faire restituer le prix, ou de garder la chose et se faire rendre une partie du prix suivant \u00e9valuation.\nN'oublions pas que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence ici d'une garantie conventionnelle. Il n'est pas seulement question de la description de la chose vendue, mais de la garantie que le sucre vendu serait exempt de sucre mou ou br\u00fbl\u00e9. La pr\u00e9sence de sucre mou ou br\u00fbl\u00e9 dans la proportion consid\u00e9rable que constate la preuve est un vice r\u00e9dhibitoire, et les acheteurs, en vertu de l'article 1526 C.C., qui s'applique \u00e0 la garantie conventionnelle comme \u00e0 la garantie l\u00e9gale, avaient le choix ou bien de rendre le sucre qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9 par ce deuxi\u00e8me envoi, et de se faire restituer le prix qu'ils avaient pay\u00e9, ou bien de le garder et de se faire rendre une partie du prix suivant \u00e9valuation. Ils ont choisi le premier parti, et ont exerc\u00e9 l'action r\u00e9dhibitoire au lieu de l'action quanti minoris. C'\u00e9tait leur droit, et il ne reste qu'\u00e0 appliquer l'article 1526 C.C. dans la mesure qu'il peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 dans l'esp\u00e8ce.\nLe vendeur pouvait-il emp\u00eacher cette action en offrant de remplacer le sucre d\u00e9fectueux? A plusieurs reprises, j'ai demand\u00e9 aux avocats de l'intim\u00e9 de me citer des autorit\u00e9s reconnaissant ce droit au vendeur. Ils n'ont pu le faire. Dans mon opinion, le vendeur n'a pas ce droit qui, s'il pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9, rendrait le plus souvent l'article 1526 C.C. sans application possible. Du reste, l'existence du vice r\u00e9dhibitoire donne \u00e0 l'acheteur le droit de rejeter la marchandise et de se faire restituer le prix, et il n'aurait pas ce droit si le vendeur pouvait, sans le consentement de l'acheteur, remplacer la marchandise affect\u00e9e de ce vice. Je ne crois pas qu'on puisse invoquer \u00e0 l'encontre de cette solution les articles 1517 et 1518 C.C. que l'honorable juge Guerin cite. Ces articles, du reste, s'appliquent \u00e0 la garantie contre l'\u00e9viction et non \u00e0 la garantie contre les vices de la chose vendue. Le code traite s\u00e9par\u00e9ment de ces deux garanties.\nJ'accepte sans r\u00e9serve les consid\u00e9rants suivants du jugement de la cour du Banc du Roi.\nConsid\u00e9rant que ce premier envoi \u00e9tant accept\u00e9 et pay\u00e9, le contrat en son entier ne pouvait plus \u00eatre annul\u00e9 ;\nConsid\u00e9rant que quant au premier envoi de 10,066 livres, les parties se sont fait justice \u00e0 elles-m\u00eames, et que quant aux 10,000 livres qui n'ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9es, cette cour n'a aucun ordre \u00e0 donner, et qu'il ne s'agit que de d\u00e9cider quant aux 10,000 livres comprises dans le deuxi\u00e8me envoi.\nIl est clair que tout le contrat ne peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 et qu'on ne peut en rien affecter les droits et obligations des parties quant au sucre qui restait \u00e0 livrer pour compl\u00e9ter le contrat.\nMais il n'en reste pas moins vrai qu'on peut, dans les circonstances, envisager le deuxi\u00e8me envoi s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, et c'est bien ce que la cour du Banc du Roi para\u00eet avoir fait elle-m\u00eame.\nAvec beaucoup de respect, il me semble que la conclusion qui d\u00e9coulait logiquement des consid\u00e9rants dans leur ensemble du jugement a quo, c'est que les acheteurs avaient le droit de rejeter le deuxi\u00e8me envoi et de se faire remettre le prix qu'ils avaient pay\u00e9.\nC'est tout ce que je leur accorderais. Je ne r\u00e9tablirais pas le premier jugement tel que rendu, car il peut pr\u00eater \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation qu'il annule implicitement le contrat, car il d\u00e9clare l'action des appelants bien fond\u00e9e. Je donnerais jugement aux appelants contre l'intim\u00e9 pour $2,-679.74, chiffre accord\u00e9 par le premier juge, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter de la demande en justice, d\u00e9clarant que le deuxi\u00e8me envoi du sucre n'\u00e9tait pas conforme \u00e0 la garantie conventionnelle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e aux appelants et que ceux-ci \u00e9taient bien fond\u00e9s \u00e0 le refuser. Je r\u00e9serverais aux parties tous les droits que comporte le contrat, surtout pour le sucre qui restait \u00e0 livrer pour compl\u00e9ter la quantit\u00e9 vendue.\nPendant l'instance, le sucre a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la cour et on nous informe que le prix est consign\u00e9 en cour. L'intim\u00e9 en payant le montant du jugement de cette cour aura le droit de retirer cette somme.\nJe maintiendrais donc l'appel avec les d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours en faveur des appelants contre l'intim\u00e9.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Monty, Durauleau, Ross & Angers.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1923: February 21, 22; 1923: April 11.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nWorkmen's Compensation Act\u2014Claim by ascendant\u2014\"Principal support\" Interpretation\u2014Art. 1053 et seq. C.C.\u2014R.S.Q. (1909), s. 7323, as amended by 8 Geo. V, c. 71, s. 3 and 9 Geo. V, c. 69, s. 1.\nSection 7323, R.S.Q. (1909) \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" as amended by 9 Geo. V, c. 69, s. 1, provides that \"when the accident causes death, the compensation (mentioned in the section) shall be payable * * * (c) to ascendants of whom the deceased was the principal support (principal soutien) at the time of the accident.\"\nHeld that, in order to determine whether the victim was in fact the principal support of the ascendant, the personal earnings or other income of the latter must be taken into consideration. It must be found that more than fifty per cent of the total subsistence of the ascendant came from the victim. It is not sufficient for the ascendant merely to show that the contribution made by the victim to the ascendant's support exceeded that received from other members of the family.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, district of Three Rivers and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe appellants brought action under the Workmen's Compensation Act on account of the death of their unmarried son by reason of and in the course of his work for the respondent.\nA. Chase-Casgrain K.C. and Robichon for the appellants.\nDe Witt K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellants sued respondent claiming that, under the provisions of the article 7321 and subsequent articles of the Revised Statutes of Quebec as amended especially in respect of article 7323, first by 8 Geo. V, cap. 71, sec. 3, and then by 9 Geo. V, cap. 69, sec. 1, they were entitled to recover damages from respondent in whose services one of their sons had accidentally met his death.\nThe learned trial judge allowed the claim holding that as said deceased son had been at the time of his death contributing more substantially than any of his numerous brothers and sisters to the support of the appellants, his and their father and mother, living upon a farm upon which they had brought up a large family, they were entitled to recover on the basis furnished by the Act for the case of loss of their principal support.\nThe Court of King's Bench reversed this judgment holding that as the evidence did not demonstrate that the contributions by deceased to the support of the appellants, his father and mother, were more than they derived from the said farm, it could not be said that his annual contributions were, in the language of the said amendment, their \"principal support.\"\nThe whole difficulty turns upon the peculiar language of the said amendments, and others, which result in the article reading as follows:\u2014\nWhen the accident causes death, the compensation shall consist of a sum equal to four times the average yearly wages of the deceased at the time of the accident, and shall in no case, except in the case mentioned in article 7325, be less than fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) or more than three thousand dollars ($3,000.)\nThere shall further be paid a sum of not more than fifty dollars ($50) for medical and funeral expenses.\nThe compensation shall be payable as follows:\u2014\n(a) To the surviving consort not divorced nor separated from bed and board at the time of his death, provided the accident took place after the marriage;\n(b) To the legitimate children, or to the illegitimate children acknowledged before the accident, to assist them to provide for themselves until they reach the full age of sixteen years, or more if they are invalids;\n(c) To ascendants to whom the deceased was the principal support at the time of the accident.\nThe article as it first stood used the words \"only support\" and by the last amendment substituted therefor the words \"principal support.\"\nI think the construction of the Court of King's Bench is correct. Indeed I am quite unable to follow the over refinement which produces the result of ignoring entirely the support which the resources of the father or mother, or both, may produce so long as the deceased has contributed more than any others of their family.\nTo follow out such a construction logically, there could be nothing recovered in the case of death of a son who contributed equally with others of the family, or less than any other surviving member. Such arid many other peculiar results might flow from our reversal of the judgment appealed from.\nNor do I think this a case for a new trial.\nI respectfully submit an amendment by the legislature seems possibly desirable.\nI would dismiss the appeal but, in view of the conflicting decisions preceding this litigation relevant to the correct interpretation and construction of such a peculiar Act, without costs of this appeal here.\nDuff J.\u2014The question is whether the condition that the deceased shall have been (within the meaning of article 7232 (c) as amended by 9 Geo. V, cap. 69, s. 1) the \"principal support\" of the appellants at the time of the accident, has been fulfilled. The only question of law involved is the question whether in passing upon the right of the appellants to claim compensation under paragraph (c) as amended one is entitled to exclude from consideration all measure of support due to the exertions of the appellants themselves.\nThis question should in my opinion be answered in the negative. An answer in the affirmative would necessarily, as it seems to me, rest upon some modification of the language which the legislature has selected to express its meaning.\nThe appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I entirely agree with the construction placed by Mr. Justice Rivard, speaking for the Court of King's Bench, on the words \"principal support\" (principal soutien) in clause (c) of article 3 of the Workmen's Compensation Act as amended (9 George V, c. 69). With great respect for the learned judges who have expressed a contrary view, I can find no justification for excluding the personal earnings or other income of the ascendant when considering what constitutes his support. Where his subsistence and that of his dependents is chiefly derived from that source it cannot, in my opinion, properly be said that assistance from a descendant, though substantial and in excess of any other contribution from an outside source, forms his \"principal support.\" In order to bring a case within clause (c), other requirements being met, more than fifty per cent, of the s\u00b5bsistence of the claimant must have come from the deceased workman.\nCounsel for the appellant urged that the evidence warrants such a finding of fact, or, if not, that a new trial should be granted to permit of further proof on that issue, inasmuch as counsel at the trial, relying on the decision of the Court of Review in Lake Megantic Pulp Company v. Martin[2], since confirmed on appeal, proceeded on the assumption that he was obliged only to show that the contribution made by the deceased workman to the plaintiff's support exceeded what he received from any other outside source. A very recent decision of the Court of King's Bench (Greenshields, Allard and Letourneau JJ.) in Fraser-Brace Shipyard Limited v. Mercier, not yet reported, fully supports that view.\nThe evidence sufficiently establishes the value of the contribution made by the deceased towards the support of his parents. In my opinion, however, it also makes it reasonably certain that that contribution fell considerably short of fifty per cent of the total cost of their subsistence. I am accordingly of the opinion that a new trial should not be granted.\nHaving regard to the marked conflict of judicial opinion in Quebec and to the fact that we are overruling the most recent pronouncement of the Court of King's Bench on the meaning of \"principal support\" in the Fraser-Brace Case above noted, we shall, I think, be justified, notwithstanding our general rule to the contrary, in relieving the appellant from payment of the respondent's costs of this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause une question qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 beaucoup de divergence d'opinion dans la jurisprudence. Il s'agit de savoir la port\u00e9e des mots \"principal soutien\" que nous trouvons dans la loi des accidents du travail, \u00e0 l'article 7323 tel qu'amend\u00e9 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec.\nNous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re qui ont des moyens personnels et qui en retirent la plus grande partie de leur subsistance ont droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 si leur fils qui les aidait tout particuli\u00e8rement est victime d'un accident qui a caus\u00e9 sa mort.\nLes appelants soutiennent l'affirmative et citent au soutien de leur opinion : Lake Megantic Pulp Co. v. Martel[3]; Fraser-Brace Shipyards v. Mercier, jug\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre dernier par la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nL'intim\u00e9e soutient la n\u00e9gative et nous r\u00e9f\u00e8re aux causes suivantes: Lamontagne v. Quebec Railway Co.[4] ; Thomson v. Kearney[5] ; Price Bros. v. St. Louis[6] ; Montreal Public Service Corporation v. Picard[7].\nIl est assez important de noter que la cour de Banc du Roi, \u00e0 quelques semaines de distance, ait rendu des d\u00e9cisions absolument contraires. Il est vrai qu'elle \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rement constitu\u00e9e; mais tout de m\u00eame cette divergence d'opinion constitue pour le justiciable un \u00e9tat d'incertitude peu enviable.\nAinsi dans la pr\u00e9sente cause la cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec et compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Martin, Dorion et Rivard d\u00e9cidait que l'on devait prendre en consid\u00e9ration les ressources des ascendants pour d\u00e9terminer si leur fils qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e9tait leur principal soutien.\nDans la cause de Fraser-Brace Shipyards v. Mercier la m\u00eame cour du Banc du Roi si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Greenshields, Allard et L\u00e9tourneau d\u00e9cidait absolument le contraire quelques semaines plus tard.\nCes d\u00e9cisions absolument contradictoires devront n\u00e9cessairement inciter tous ceux qui s'int\u00e9ressent \u00e0 la bonne administration de la justice, \u00e0 \u00e9tudier les rem\u00e8des qui doivent \u00eatre apport\u00e9s pour pr\u00e9venir la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition d'un tel \u00e9tat de choses.\nIl est bon tout d'abord de remarquer que cette loi des accidents du travail est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans les statuts refondus comme \u00e9tant une mati\u00e8re en rapport avec le code civil; et on y indique formellement dans l'en-t\u00eate qu'elle a trait aux \"dommages \u00e0 la personne\" qui se retrouvent dans les articles 1053 et suivants du code. Il est par cons\u00e9quent d\u00e9sirable, en \u00e9tudiant cette loi des accidents du travail, de ne pas perdre cela de vue.\nCes articles 1053 et suivants du code civil \u00e9noncent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que toute personne est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute, et \u00e0 l'article 1056 on donne au p\u00e8re et \u00e0 la m\u00e8re un droit d'action en dommages contre celui qui aurait caus\u00e9 le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de leur fils.\nPour r\u00e9ussir dans leur r\u00e9clamation, le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re devaient prouver la faute de celui qu'ils poursuivaient, et le tribunal leur accordait les dommages que le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la victime leur causait.\nMais cette faute \u00e9tait d'ordinaire bien difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir et dans bien de cas le dommage caus\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9par\u00e9, vu l'impossibilit\u00e9 o\u00f9 se trouvaient les demandeurs de prouver la faute ou la n\u00e9gligence du d\u00e9fendeur. Par contre si la faute \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9e, le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer des dommages tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9s.\nAlors, apr\u00e8s de longues et patientes recherches et apr\u00e8s la nomination de commissions d'\u00e9tudes, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er ce que j'appellerai le risque professionnel en adoptant, en 1909, la loi des accidents du travail qui se trouve maintenant aux articles 7321 et suivants des statuts refondus. La responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait cr\u00e9\u00e9e dans certains cas sans que la victime f\u00fbt oblig\u00e9e de prouver n\u00e9gligence. Mais, par contre, l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e9tait fix\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avance suivant le salaire gagn\u00e9. C'\u00e9tait un compromis bien d\u00e9sirable pour tous.\nDans cette loi, on a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que la femme et les enfants auraient droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 le mari ou le p\u00e8re mourrait \u00e0 la suite de l'accident et on les a d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s dans les m\u00eames termes que ceux port\u00e9s dans l'article 1056 du code civil. Mais pour les ascendants on a agi un peu diff\u00e9remment. L'article 1056 les d\u00e9signait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. Ainsi l'article disait:\u2014\nDans les cas o\u00f9 la partie contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou le quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction, son conjoint, ses p\u00e8re, m\u00e8re, et enfants * * * ont droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l'auteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nD'apr\u00e8s les dispositions de cet article il avait d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le conjoint, le p\u00e8re, la m\u00e8re et les enfants avaient le droit d'obtenir une certaine somme d'argent par voie de consolation et de soulagement (solatium) Labette v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[8]; mais cette opinion fut plus tard renvers\u00e9e par la cour supr\u00eame; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[9]; Jeannotte v. Couillard[10]. Les dommages que pouvaient alors r\u00e9clamer le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re devaient repr\u00e9senter la perte morale ou mat\u00e9rielle qu'ils \u00e9prouvaient par la mort de leur fils. Tellier v. Cit\u00e9 de St. Henri[11].\nTel \u00e9tait l'\u00e9tat de la jurisprudence lorsque la l\u00e9gislature est intervenue et a adopt\u00e9 la loi des accidents du travail, et elle a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que le p\u00e8re et la m\u00e8re ne pourraient r\u00e9clamer en vertu de cette loi que lorsque le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait leur unique soutien.\nEn 1919, \u00e9videmment par suite des jugements qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus en 1917 dans les causes de Montreal Public Service Corporation v. Picard[12] et de Price Brothers v. St. Louis[13], la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec a remplac\u00e9 les mots \"unique soutien\" par \"principal soutien.\"\nLa l\u00e9gislature n'a pas voulu maintenir la responsabilit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui existait en vertu de l'article 1056 du code; mais elle a simplement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les ascendants auraient droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 leur fils serait leur principal soutien. S'il n'\u00e9tait pas leur principal soutien, alors les ascendants retombaient sous les dispositions de la loi commune qui leur permettaient de r\u00e9clamer s'il y avait eu n\u00e9gligence de la part des d\u00e9fendeurs et s'ils avaient \u00e9prouv\u00e9 des dommages. Lamontagne v. Qu\u00e9bec Railway[14].\nCette diff\u00e9rence dans le texte entre les dispositions du code civil et la loi des accidents du travail au sujet de la r\u00e9clamation du p\u00e8re et de la m\u00e8re d\u00e9montre d'une mani\u00e8re bien claire l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur. Il ne voulait donner \u00e9videmment un droit d'action au p\u00e8re et \u00e0 la m\u00e8re que dans le cas o\u00f9 leur fils serait leur unique ou leur principal soutien. Si toutefois le fils ne r\u00e9unissait pas cette qualit\u00e9, si les parents avaient des ressources en dehors du support que pouvait leur donner leur fils, je consid\u00e8re que dans ce cas le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les ascendants n'avaient pas le droit d'action sous la loi des accidents du travail.\nM. Robichon, dans son excellent plaidoyer, a insist\u00e9 beaucoup sur le fait que cette interpr\u00e9tation allait priver les ascendants de tout recours s'ils se trouvaient dans le besoin.\nC'est l\u00e0 une erreur. Les ascendants ont toujours leur recours en vertu de la loi commune, c'est \u00e0 dire que s'ils peuvent \u00e9tablir la faute de la d\u00e9fenderesse et s'ils peuvent \u00e9tablir en m\u00eame temps, comme ils l'ont fait d'ailleurs, que la perte de leur fils repr\u00e9sente pour eux des dommages assez consid\u00e9rables, ils ne sont pas jet\u00e9s sur le pav\u00e9, mais leur droit d'action en vertu de l'article 1056 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli mais subsiste encore.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d'opinion que, les ressources personnelles que poss\u00e9dait l'ascendant \u00e9tant suffisamment \u00e9lev\u00e9es pour constituer son principal revenu, il n'a pas droit de prendre une action sous la loi des accidents du travail.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9, mais vu les d\u00e9cisions diff\u00e9rentes en cour du Banc du Roi et vu qu'il \u00e9tait dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de faire d\u00e9terminer d\u00e9finitivement par cette cour l'interpr\u00e9tation de cette loi, je ne pourrai consid\u00e9rer l'appelant comme un plaideur t\u00e9m\u00e9raire et je ne le condamnerais pas aux frais.\nMignault J.\u2014Sous la loi des accidents du travail de Qu\u00e9bec (art. 7321 et suiv. S.R.Q.) lorsque l'accident cause la mort de la victime, l'indemnit\u00e9 est payable aux personnes suivantes (art. 7323) :\n(a) au conjoint survivant, non divorc\u00e9 ni s\u00e9par\u00e9 de corps au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, pourvu que l'accident ait eu lieu apr\u00e8s le marriage.\n(b) Aux enfants l\u00e9gitimes ou aux enfants naturels reconnus avant l'accident, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 aider \u00e0 pourvoir \u00e0 leurs besoins jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de seize ans r\u00e9volus ou plus s'ils sont invalides.\n(c) Aux ascendants dont le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait le principal soutien au moment de l'accident.\nIl s'agit d'interpr\u00e9ter le paragraphe (c) qui, avant 1919, donnait une part d'indemnit\u00e9 aux ascendants dont le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait l'unique soutien. L'amendement de 1919 (9 Geo. V, ch. 69) rempla\u00e7a l'expression \"l'unique\" par les mots \"le principal\" am\u00e9liorant ainsi la condition de l'ascendant qui, avant 1919, n'avait droit \u00e0 partager dans l'indemnit\u00e9 que lorsqu'il avait perdu, dans le d\u00e9funt, son unique soutien.\nLa question d'interpr\u00e9tation des mots \"le principal soutien,\" qui pour la premi\u00e8re fois se pose devant cette cour, a divis\u00e9 jusqu'ici les juges de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure dans cette cause a adopt\u00e9 l'interpr\u00e9tation de la cour de revision, dans Lake Megantic Pulp Co. Ltd. v. Martel[15], dont l'arr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc du Roi o\u00f9 si\u00e9geaient les honorables juges Guerin, Allard et Howard, ce dernier dissident. Et la m\u00eame cour du Banc du Roi (Greenshields, Allard et L\u00e9tourneau JJ.) a tout r\u00e9cemment interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens l'expression \"le principal soutien\" dans la cause de Fraser-Brace Shipyards Ltd. v. Mercier, non encore rapport\u00e9e. Cela n'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 la cour du Banc du Roi, compos\u00e9e cette fois des honorables juges Martin, Dorion et Rivard, d'adopter la solution contraire dans la cause qui nous est maintenant d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e. Cette contrari\u00e9t\u00e9 de jugements et surtout la circonstance assez extraordinaire qu'une m\u00eame cour en arrive \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es d\u00e9montrent bien l'importance de cette question d'interpr\u00e9tation et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'il y a de mettre un terme aux incertitudes de la jurisprudence par une d\u00e9cision qui ne donnera lieu \u00e0 aucune \u00e9quivoque. Et pour que notre jugement ait ce caract\u00e8re d\u00e9cisif, j'ajoute qu'apr\u00e8s une s\u00e9rieuse \u00e9tude de la question je concours pleinement dans le jugement que l'honorable juge Rivard a prononc\u00e9 au nom de la cour d'appel dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nSi j'ajoute quelques observations \u00e0 ce que je viens de dire c'est parce que je trouve, dans les jugements des honorables juges qui ont si\u00e9g\u00e9 dans la cause de Fraser-Brace Shipyards v. Mercier, et dont copie a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite devant nous lors de l'audition de cette cause, une expression concise du raisonnement sur lequel s'appuie l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 7323 que je me trouve oblig\u00e9 de rejeter.\nAinsi l'honorable juge Greenshields dit:\u2014\nThere were other descendants who contributed to respondents' support. The proof establishes that the deceased was able and did, as a matter of fact, contribute himself to supply the existing need of respondent. As is stated in the proof, he acted as the father of the family. Apart entirely from his monetary contributions, he aided in many ways of equal, if not greater, importance. Of all those who might be called upon to contribute to the support of respondent, he was the principal or chief. For that reason I have no hesitation in holding that he was respondent's principal support, within the meaning of the statute.\nI wish to make my holding upon the point as clear as possible. In interpreting the meaning of the words \"principal support\" under the Act, we have not to make a comparison between the earnings of the ascendant claiming and the contribution made, in his lifetime, by a deceased. When it is established that the ascendant claiming is in need, the determination as to who is the \"principal support\" must be made among those who are supporting or supplying that need, and in doing so the ascendant claiming is excluded from the number.\nAt the risk of repetition, I again say that if there are several who aid in supplying the need of an ascendant, the one who is best able to and does supply the greatest part or affords the greatest aid is, within the true construction of the statute, the \"principal support.\"\nL'honorable juge Allard se contente de renvoyer pour ses motifs \u00e0 son jugement dans Lake Megantic Pulp Co., Ltd. v. Martel[16].\nDe son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l'honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau exprime son opinion avec une grande pr\u00e9cision dans le passage suivant:\nQuand une fois il est admis qu'un ascendant est dans le besoin, et que, dans ce besoin, il est effectivement aid\u00e9 par son fils, il faut dire que ce fils est un soutien; il sera le principal, si, de plusieurs qui aident alors, il est celui qui contribue le plus. En parlant de ces soutiens qui peuvent ainsi et \u00e0 d\u00e9gr\u00e9s diff\u00e9rents aider un ascendant, la loi n'a pu vouloir, sous ce titre, comprendre l'ascendant lui-m\u00eame. Cette disposition de la loi suppose deux parties et la relation qui doit s'\u00e9tablir entre ces deux parties ; l'ascendant pour recevoir, parce qu'il ascendant; les descendants pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme les soutiens, et l'un deux, le \"principal soutien.\"\nInterpr\u00e9ter la loi comme le sugg\u00e8re l'appelante \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 dire que le \"principal soutien\" est celui qui fournit \u00e0 l'ascendant la majeure partie de ses ressources. Je ne puis croire que si le l\u00e9gislateur e\u00fbt ainsi voulu \u00e9veiller l'id\u00e9e de la chose, au lieu de l'id\u00e9e de quelqu'un qui devait la fournir, il n'e\u00fbt pas trouv\u00e9 une expression autre que celle qu'il a employ\u00e9e. Les mots \"principal soutien\" d\u00e9signent quelqu'un plut\u00f4t que quelque chose, et s\u00fbrement, dans tous les cas, plut\u00f4t ceux qui donnent que ceux qui re\u00e7oivent.\nAvec beaucoup de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, il m'est impossible d'adopter l'interpr\u00e9tation des honorables juges dont je viens de citer l'opinion. On remarquera que des trois cat\u00e9gories de personnes qu'\u00e9num\u00e8re l'article 7323, le droit des deux premi\u00e8res, le conjoint survivant et les enfants de moins de seize ans ou invalides, est absolu, tandis que le droit des ascendants est conditionnel. Avant l'amendement de cet article la condition \u00e9tait que le d\u00e9funt e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 l'unique soutien de l'ascendant, ce qui supposait que l'ascendant d\u00e9pendait enti\u00e8rement des secours qu'il recevait du d\u00e9funt. Depuis l'amendement, il suffit, et c'est la condition du droit de l'ascendant \u00e0 une part de l'indemnit\u00e9, que le d\u00e9funt ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le principal soutien de l'ascendant. Les honorable juges qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la cause de Fraser-Brace Shipyards, Ltd, v. Mercier supposent que plusieurs personnes, y compris le d\u00e9funt, ont contribu\u00e9 au soutien de l'ascendant et que la contribution du d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait plus forte que celle des autres. Si telle \u00e9tait la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur, comment appliquerait-on l'article 7323 au cas o\u00f9 l'ascendant n'aurait eu qu'un seul descendant ou contributaire ou un seul soutien? Car alors aucun concours de contributaires n'aurait exist\u00e9 et on ne pourrait dire, si on n'envisageait que celui qui apportait des secours \u00e0 l'ascendant, que le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait son principal soutien. Mais si le l\u00e9gislateur, comme je le crois, \u00e0 \u00e9gard aux moyens de subsistance de l'ascendant\u2014et il est naturel de s'occuper de ces moyens ou de la chose, pour employer l'expression de l'honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau, afin que l'ascendant ne soit pas laiss\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9n\u00fbment\u2014le d\u00e9funt aura \u00e9t\u00e9 le principal soutien de l'ascendant s'il lui avait fourni la majeure partie de ses moyens de subsistance. Avec cette interpr\u00e9tation on peut dire que la pens\u00e9e du l\u00e9gislateur porte tant sur la chose que sur les personnes qui fournissent cette chose, et notre article s'applique que l'ascendant ait eu un seul ou plusieurs soutiens. Dire donc que le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait le principal soutien de l'ascendant c'est dire que celui-ci \u00e9tait principalement soutenu par le d\u00e9funt. Pour cette raison, il me para\u00eet impossible de faire abstraction des ressources de l'ascendant, et toute la question est de savoir si le d\u00e9funt fournissait \u00e0 l'ascendant la principale partie de ces ressources, et si oui, il en aura \u00e9t\u00e9 le principal soutien.\nJe crois donc que la d\u00e9cision dans Fraser-Brace Shipyards v. Mercier n'a pas donn\u00e9 aux mots \"le principal soutien\" leur v\u00e9ritable sens. Pour la m\u00eame raison, tant sur le fait que le droit, je suis d'avis que le jugement dont est appel est bien fond\u00e9.\nJe renverrais l'appel, mais vu l'incertitude qui a r\u00e9gn\u00e9 sur cette question d'interpr\u00e9tation, je ne voudrais pas punir l'appelant d'avoir port\u00e9 cette cause devant nous, ce qui d'ailleurs \u00e9tait d'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour mettre un terme \u00e0 un conflit de jurisprudence. Je n'accorderais donc aucuns frais \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 contre l'appelant devant cette cour.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Robichon & Methot.\nSolicitors for the respondent: De Witt & Howard.\n[1] [1923] Q.R. 34 K.B. 461.\n[2] [1921] Q.R. 50 S.C. 281.\n[3] Q.R. 60 S.C. 281.\n[4] [1914] 50 Can.

L.R. 387) Duff and Brodeur JJ. dissenting as to the first-mentioned cause of action, that whether or not the proceedings of the company are open to attack no fraud was proved and the plaintiffs are debarred, by laches and acquiescence in all that was done for several years, from maintaining the action.\nPer Duff J.\u2014It is clear that the 500 shares were alloted to the vendors of the assets at a discount and the allotment was ultra vires. The agreement should, therefore, be set aside.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The appellants, suing as individuals, cannot have such allotment set aside. Fullerton v. Crawford (50 Can.

Manchester[3].\nMcClemont for the respondents. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014On the ground solely that the plaintiffs in this case had by their laches and acquiescence debarred themselves from the relief prayed for in this action, as found by the trial judge and confirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed, but without costs of appeal here, or in the trial court, or in the Divisional Court of Appeal, as on the merits apart from the acquiescence I would have allowed the appeal. In his judgment the trial judge stated that in his opinion the action was not one in which costs should be allowed.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I concur in the view of Mr. Justice Ferguson that the agreement of the 8th March, 1912, by which the company professed to purchase the good will and assets of the Caldwell Company for five hundred fully paid-up shares, was ultra vires. I concur in his view that under the Ontario Act it is beyond the power of a company to allot fully paid-up shares at a discount. This, of course, does not necessarily mean that shares must be paid for to the amount of their nominal value in actual cash. It was long ago settled that shares might validly be paid for in \u201cmeal or malt,\u201d and where there is a real agreement by which the company agrees to accept in exchange for shares property which is treated as having a value equivalent to the amount of the shares, and where this agreement is made in circumstances in which the transaction itself is presumptive evidence of the value of the consideration, then the court will not inquire into that value, and the transaction is unimpeachable on the ground solely that the consideration appears to be inadequate.\nBut it does not follow that in no case will the court set aside an agreement on the ground that it is a virtual attempt to sell its shares at a discount. If it is established by the circumstances that the agreement is a mere sham\u2014a mere fa\u00e7ade to hide the real object of the donee of the shares and of the persons representing the company to do an ultra vires act, namely, to allot shares as fully paid-up which have not been paid for at all, or only paid for in part\u2014then the court will treat the transaction in law as being what it is in fact. In In re Wragge[4] Vaughan Williams L.J. points out that in such circumstances the court will not limit itself to the question whether or not there is \u201cno consideration whatever,\u201d but with regard either to the whole of the consideration or to any part of it will give effect to its conclusion that the whole or the part is a sham; that in respect to the whole or part \u201cthe transaction is a colourable one.\u201d As Lord Watson said, in Ooregum v. Roper[5]:\nThe court would doubtless refuse effect to a colourable transaction entered into for the purpose or with the obvious result of enabling the company to issue its shares at a discount.\nThe judgment of Lindley L.J. in In re Wragge4 at pages 830-2, is to the same effect.\nNow the case under consideration was one of those cases which have often been before the courts, such, for example, as Erlanger v. New Sombrero[6], in which promoters who own property get up a company to take the property and allot qualifying shares to themselves and nominees who are entirely under their control and appoint a board of directors entirely under their control, and then go through the form of an agreement between themselves and the company, taking the share capital of the company in consideration of the transfer of the property. In the economic sense, such a transaction is not a sale. It is not a transaction having any significance whatever as to the value of the property transferred. The price is fixed by the fiat of the vendors, and therefore the considerations which have led the courts to hold that where there is a real sale entered into between promoters and persons acting independently of them for the company, the price paid in shares is presumptive evidence of the value of the property which, in the absence of fraud or some kind of unfair dealing, the courts will not go behind, have no sort of application whatever. If in such circumstances it is made plain that the so-called consideration is merely nominal or patently derisory, I think the court should not be slow to draw the proper conclusion and to press that conclusion to its logical result. I will not review the facts which have been fully reviewed in the judgments below, but I have no hesitation in concluding that the agreement had to use Lord Watson\u2019s language,\nthe obvious result of enabling the company to issue its shares at a discount;\nand moreover that it was entered into for that purpose and that it comes within the class of \u201ccolourable transactions\u201d to which the court ought not to give effect.\nWhat, then, should be the result? The agreement is one to which effect should not be given, and I agree with Ferguson J., that in the circumstances the allotment must be set aside, subject, however, to this qualification; the persons who acquired these shares subsequently, whether by purchase from Caldwell and Nicholson or as bonus shares, may have acquired them in such circumstances that the company, on the principle of Burkinshaw v. Nicolls[7]; Parberry\u2019s Case[8]; Bloomenthal v. Ford[9]; is estopped from denying that the shares were fully paid-up and consequently that the allotment was lawful.\nThe next question which arises concerns the moneys received by Caldwell under his agreement of the 4th May, 1915. The general principle of law is that directors being trustees of their powers for the shareholders are incapacitated from retaining as against the company any profit arising from a contract made between themselves and the body of directors of which they are members, unless the company knows and assents. Imperial Mercantile Credit Association v. Coleman[10]; James v. Eve[11], Gluckstein v. Barnes[12]; Boston Deep Sea Fishing Company v. Ansell[13]; Fullerton v. Crawford[14]. The only provision of the Ontario Companies Act which appear in any way to affect this principle is section 92, which provides that no by\u2011law for the payment of the president or any director shall be valid or acted upon unless passed at a general meeting or, if passed by the directors, until the same has been confirmed at a general meeting. This provision is negatively expressed, but it no doubt implies authority in the shareholders and directors to pass a by-law having the object and effect indicated, provided the prescribed procedure is followed. It may be open to question, I think, whether or not this enactment does authorize such a by-law as by-law 15, which extends to profits made by any director in connection with any contracts made between him and the company. Assuming the arrangements of the 4th May, 1915, to come within section 92, then my conclusion is that the conditions of that section have not been fulfilled. By-law 15 professes to delegate to the directors the duty of exercising the authority reposed in the shareholders by section 92. I mean that by-law 15 does not in itself authorize the payment of the president or any director. It is not a \u201cby-law for\u201d such payment. In passing it the shareholders cannot be held either to have passed such a by-law or to have confirmed such a by-law; they have merely professed to delegate to the directors the authority to act in a certain way.\nOn the other hand if the arrangement falls outside of section 92, the question arises whether this by-law constitutes a sufficient assent by the company to the retention by a director of profits received from a contract made between himself and the company through the agency of the directors alone. That is a point which would, I think, require a somewhat careful examination of the provisions of the Ontario Companies Act respecting the authority of shareholders in ordinary general meetings; and without suggesting that the by-law was not competently enacted at the meeting of the 8th April, 1912, I prefer to express no opinion upon the point, in the absence of any argument upon it.\nIt is unnecessary to say more as to the validity of the arrangement of the 4th of May, 1915, because I am convinced that the view which was taken by the learned trial judge and by the majority of the judges of the Court of Appeal that there was, in fact, such acquiescence in the arrangement made by the directors with Caldwell as to amount to an assent by the company to that arrangement, is a view which has so much support in the evidence that it would be quite out of the question for this court to decline to act upon it.\nAn observation is necessary upon the head-note in Fullerton v. Crawford[15]. It is made to appear thereby that the court held that the payment to Doran in respect of commission was a lawful payment, and it is made also to appear that this court affirmed certain Ontario decisions as concerns section 92 of the Ontario Companies Act. In point of fact, of the three members of the court who expressed an opinion as to the legality of the payment to Doran, two, the Chief Justice and myself, held it to be wrongful and recoverable back. Two members of the court, Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Brodeur, held that Crawford was disentitled by his conduct to impeach the validity of the arrangement with Doran and expressed no opinion upon the point aforementioned, upon which the head-note represents the court as giving a decision.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Two distinct claims are made in this action, first, the setting aside of an agreement whereby the defendants Caldwell and Nicholson (The Caldwell Orchard Company) sold their business to their co-defendant, The Wentworth Orchard Company, of which they were promoters, for the entire common stock of that company, having a par value of $50,000, and secondly, the repayment by the defendant Caldwell to the Wentworth Orchard Company of $18,700, paid to him as compensation for services as its manager.\nOn both branches of the case the learned trial judge found the plaintiffs debarred from relief by laches and acquiescence, and in that conclusion, affirmed by a majority of the learned Appellate judges, I agree, and would consequently dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAs to the claim for repayment by Caldwell, the trial judge, in my opinion, properly found that the resolution providing for his remuneration as manager was passed by the directors. I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, and Magee and Ferguson JJ.A. that the by-law of the 8th April, 1912, confirmed by the shareholders, was a sufficient compliance with section 92 of the Ontario Com- panies\u2019 Act, if indeed that provision applies to services not rendered qua president or director and usually performed by a salaried employee. I had occasion to discuss this aspect of the matter in Fullerton v. Crawford[16]. I also agree that a repetition of the directors\u2019 resolution in each subsequent year was not necessary. The company would appear to have had in the increased volume of its business and the maintenance of its profit-earning character, at least a fair return for this expenditure. There is no suggestion of fraud or impropriety connected with it. This branch of the appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nI am disposed to agree with most of what has been said by Mr. Justice Hodgins and Mr. Justice Ferguson in criticising the inadequacy of the consideration for the allotment to the defendants Caldwell and Nicholson of the 500 shares of common stock received by them. But whether or not the company or its creditors may be entitled to some other relief in respect of the allotment of this $50,000 of stock, rescission in this action of the agreement under which Caldwell and Nicholson acquired that stock is, I think, not possible. There is no suggestion that the business taken over should be restored to its vendors. On the contrary, the plaintiffs, who are at present a minority of the shareholders of the company, seek to have Caldwell\u2019s and Nicholson\u2019s holdings wiped out so that as holders of the preference stock thus left in a majority they may themselves control the company and the business which it acquired from Caldwell and Nicholson. They offer to relinquish a small amount of common stock received by them from Caldwell and Nicholson as a bonus on the acquisition of their preference shares, but they make no offer to repay dividends received on that stock. They sue as individual shareholders. They do not claim on behalf of the company or of all its shareholders other than the two individual defendants.\nThe appeal on this branch, in my opinion, also fails.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014The present action is instituted by the shareholders of a company for the purpose of setting aside the purchase of the business of Caldwell & Nicholson, and for the repayment by Caldwell of $18,700 given to him as manager without the sanction of the shareholders. It was dismissed by the courts below.\nIt is pretty evident to me that Caldwell & Nicholson conceived the idea of forming a joint stock company to take over a dying business which had no value, to keep the control of this company without putting in money and to induce some inexperienced people to subscribe stock in that enterprise. It is a fraudulent venture which was ultra vires.\nCaldwell and Nicholson, who were in control of the new company, voted to themselves 50,000 of common stock for the price of a few barrels and ladders which had practically no value.\nI entirely agree with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Ferguson in the dissenting opinion which he gave in the Appellate Division, and I could not add anything to what he said. For the reasons he gave, I would allow this appeal with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014For the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, in which I express my respectful concurrence, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bruce & Counsell.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McClemont & Dynes.\n[1] 50 Ont.

The bonds were made redeemable and payable in annual instalments on the 1st September from 1919 to 1927, the first to be $12,000 and the others $11,000 each, bearing interest payable semi-annually. They were so described in the by-law. By clause 8 of the trust deed, it was stipulated that the total amount of the bond issue then remaining unpaid and interest thereon would become immediately exigible, at the option of the trustee, upon default by the Three Rivers Shipyards Company to pay the bonds or the interest coupons at their respective dates of maturity (\"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives \"). Such default also gave the right to the trustee, under clause 9, to enter into possession of the properties, rights, revenues and franchises of the company and it was further stipulated that the city might prevent the operation of that clause by itself paying the bonds or interest coupons due. By clause 18, which contained the terms of the guarantee given by the city, upon failure by the company to perform the conditions, charges and obligations imposed on it by the trust deed, the city obliged itself to pay the bonds and the interest coupons at their respective dates of maturity (\"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives\"). Clause 19 also created in favour of the city a hypothec upon the lands and a charge upon the movables of the company for the total amount of the debenture issue, which were made exigible upon default of payment of interest. The first instalment of $12,000 and the interest due on the 1st of March, 1920, was paid by the Three Rivers Shipyards, Limited, but the company made default in the instalment of $11,000 due on the 1st of September, 1920, and also in the interest then due on the unredeemed bonds. The respondent then sued the city for the whole amount of the unredeemed bonds and the interest due.\nHeld, Anglin and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that the respondent, in view of the default of the Three Rivers Shipyards, Limited, had the right to claim from the city immediate payment of the whole capital amount outstanding of the bond issue, with the interest then due, as the acceleration clause 8, stipulated against the company as principal debtor, was binding also on the city, its surety.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ. dissenting.\u2014The obligation of the city was merely to pay the bonds and interest coupons at their respective dates of maturity (\" \u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives \").\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 34 K.B. 351) affirmed, Anglin and Mignault JJ. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1] affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, district of Three Rivers, Duplessis J. and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant.\u2014Under article 1935 C.C., suretyship is not presumed; it must be expressed and cannot be extended beyond the limits within which it is contracted. The extent of the guarantee given by the city is clearly set forth in the terms of clause 18 of the trust deed taken in conjunction with the terms of the by-law.\nThe words \"respective due dates\" can only be applied to each date in so far as the city is concerned. This interpretation is made still clearer by the terms of clause 9 of the trust deed.\nFortin K.C. and Perron K.C. for the respondent.\u2014The city appellant is bound toward the respondent in exactly the same manner as the Three Rivers Shipyards, Limited.\nThe appellant is more than a surety or guarantor, it is an indorser.\nThe meaning of the words \"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives\" is when the bonds become due and exigible for any cause whatsoever.\nLafleur K.C. for the appellant.\nFortin K.C. and Perron K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014For the several reasons assigned by the learned trial judge and respectively assigned by the majority of the learned judges in the Court of King's Bench in support of the judgment herein appealed from I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I have reached the same conclusion as the Court of King's Bench. The obligation under article 18 is\n\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par la compagnie d'accomplir les conditions, charges et obligations auxquelles elle est tenue vis-\u00e0-vis d'eux (d\u00e9tenteurs des obligations) et tel que convenu dans le pr\u00e9sent acte de fiducie, \u00e0 effectuer le paiement des obligations et des coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives.\nArticles 8 and 19 set forth some of the most important of these conditions, article 8 being the ordinary acceleration clause making the principal exigible on non-payment of interest; and article 19 among other things creates in favour of the municipality a hypotheque upon the lands and a charge upon the movables of the debtor for the total amount of the debenture issue ($100,000), which is also made exigible upon such default.\nThe natural reading of the words \"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives\" construed in the light of these cognate provisions seems to me to be that which the court below has given them. It is upon failure of the debtor to fulfil the conditions of the agreement, that the municipality guarantees payment of principal and interest at \"leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives\"; and on the default which happened, which brought the guarantee into operation, the principal by the terms of article 8 was not only to become due, and did become due to the creditor, but under article 19 the payment of it was to become and did become enforceable at the instance of the guarantor. The instrument provides for acceleration not only in favour of the creditor, but in favour of the guarantor also.\nConsider the effect of the construction advanced by the appellants. The guarantor may, on default in respect of interest, enforce his hypothec for the principal in the usual way by obtaining judgment and proceeding to execution while under that construction he all the while is under no personal obligation to pay until the date of maturity named in the debentures. It seems a more convincing reading of the instrument to regard the right of the surety under the conditions making the municipality's hypothec enforceable upon default in respect of interest as the natural correlative of its responsibility for payment of the principal in accordance with the terms of article 8.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014Although the weight of modern French opinion may be to the contrary (vide 13 Baudry-Lacantinerie, 1040; 2 Planiol, 2339), on the authority of Pothier (Obligations, nos. 371 and 404) I shall assume that, unless relieved by the terms of the contractual provision evidencing its character and extent (clause 18), the obligation of the appellant would be, upon default of the principal debtor, to meet whatever liability it had undertaken, including that of payment in full before maturity, consequent upon such default. I therefore proceed at once to consider the meaning and effect of clause 18 of the contract, having in mind that, while the obligation of a surety cannot exceed, it may fall short of, and be subject to conditions less onerous than, that of the principal debtor. Article 1933 C.C.\nUnder clause 18 the liability of the surety arises only upon the principal debtor making default in carrying out the terms of its contract. Clause 8 of the contract upon such default occurring renders the whole debt then remaining unpaid and interest thereon immediately exigible from the principal debtor, if the trustee should deem it advisable to demand it. Yet, although the debt should thus become payable by the principal debtor in one sum and immediately, the consequent liability undertaken by the surety is expressed in clause 18 as follows:\n\u00e0 effectuer le paiement des obligations et des coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives.\nIn other words, although the principal debtor (inter alia) on his making default in payment, is penalized by losing the privilege of deferring payment of the bonds and interest coupons until their respective dates of maturity (the term), the surety contracts that on such default occurring it will make payment of the bonds and interest coupons, not at once and en bloc, but only at the respective dates on which they fall due (\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives). I cannot reconcile this explicit provision of the contract with an obligation of the surety to pay in one sum and immediately on demand of the trustee, the whole debt, both principal and interest; nor does it seem proper to give to the phrase, \"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives,\" one meaning in clauses 8 and 9 and another and a different meaning in clause 18, especially if to do so might extend the burden of the surety \"beyond the limits within which it was contracted.\" (Article 1935 C.C.)\nThe contractual acceleration clause, applying as it does to breach of any condition or obligation to which the principal debtor is subject under the terms of the trust deed, is much more onerous than the stipulation for forfeiture of term (acceleration) which article 1092 C.C. would import. Indeed it would seem that the obligation of the surety was explicitly restricted as it is by clause 18 to payment of the bonds and interest coupons at their respective due dates, notwithstanding the consequence of acceleration which the contract provided that default should entail upon the principal debtor, in order to make it clear that the surety should not be subject either to the forfeiture of term imposed by article 1092 C.C. or to the more onerous provision for the like forfeiture accepted by the principal debtor in clause 8 of the contract and to which, as surety in omnem causant, a general or indefinite guarantee might have exposed it. Pothier, Obligations, no. 404.\nNothing in the indorsement of the bonds imposes any greater obligation than that evidenced by clause 18 of the trust deed, since by the indorsement itself the trust deed is declared to be the governing instrument.\nOn the other hand measuring the obligation of the city by the terms of the by-law no. 335\u2014the sole authority for its assumption\u2014its liability is restricted to guaranteeing payment of debentures,\ndont le terme de remboursement sera par s\u00e9ries de deux \u00e0 dix ans de la date o\u00f9 la cit\u00e9 donnera cette garantie,\nwith interest payable semi-annually. There is nothing whatever in the by-law to authorize subjecting the city to the penalty of the acceleration clause which the plaintiffs seek to impose upon it as surety because the debtor accepted it for itself. The contract evidenced by clause 18 of the trust deed should be construed in the light of the by-law under the authority of which it was executed by the civic officials. Whatever might be said of their right to commit the city as surety to an obligation or guarantee of an indebtedness left subject to the application of article 1092 C.C., there could be no justification for their committing it to an undertaking involving the wider acceleration provision embodied in clause 8 of the trust deed. It is a reasonable inference from the terms of clause 18 that it was inserted to preclude any contention that the city was so bound. The terms of the by-law therefore afford a strong argument for giving to clause 18 the construction above indicated. I would for these reasons allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and would reduce the judgment against the defendant to a sum equal to the amount of the bonds and interest coupons which had, according to their respective dates of maturity, fallen due before this action was begun, with interest thereon up to that time. The plaintiff should have its costs down to and inclusive of judgment in the Superior Court.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La principale question qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise est de savoir si la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du terme qui a frapp\u00e9 le d\u00e9biteur principal s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 la caution.\nLa compagnie \"The Three Rivers Shipyards, Limited,\" a, en vertu d'un acte de fiducie en date du 22 septembre 1917, \u00e9mis des obligations au montant de $100,000 qui \u00e9taient payables comme suit: $12,000 en 1919 et ensuite $11,000 par ann\u00e9e jusqu'en 1927 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nIl \u00e9tait en outre stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'articl\u00e9 8 de cet acte que, si la fiduciaire, la compagnie Sun Trust, le jugeait convenable, le montant total de l'\u00e9mission ou telle partie d'icelle restant alors due deviendrait exigible dans aucun des cas suivants :\n(a) Si la compagnie ne paie pas les obligations ou les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives.\n(b) Si la garantie pr\u00e9sentement donn\u00e9e est diminu\u00e9e pour aucune cause ou raison quelconque.\n(c) Si aucune des conditions et obligations auxquelles la compagnie peut \u00eatre tenue par les pr\u00e9sentes ne sont pas rigoureusement remplies.\nLa cit\u00e9 de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res a dans le m\u00eame acte, par la clause 18, cautionn\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\n18. Et pour assurer plus amplement le paiement des dites obligations et de leurs coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eats, la ville d\u00e9clare par les pr\u00e9sentes garantir le paiement des obligations \u00e9mises par la compagnie comme susdit jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de la somme globale de cent mille piastres ($100,000) en principal avec en plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats, la ville s'obligeant vis-\u00e0-vis du fiduciaire pour le compte et le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des d\u00e9tenteurs de ces obligations et de ces coupons, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par la compagnie d'accomplir les conditions, charges et obligations auxquelles elle est tenue vis-\u00e0-vis d'eux et tel que convenu dans le pr\u00e9sent acte de fiducie, \u00e0 effectuer le paiement des obligations et des coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives.\nLa compagnie \"The Three Rivers Shipyards, Limited,\" n'a pu en 1920 payer les int\u00e9r\u00eats et le capital alors dus et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en liquidation.\nLa fiduciaire, la compagnie intim\u00e9e The Sun Trust, poursuit la cit\u00e9 de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res pour r\u00e9clamer le paiement de la somme totale qui est due en vertu des obligations. La cit\u00e9 plaide que la fiduciaire est incomp\u00e9tente pour exercer cette action et que la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du terme que le d\u00e9biteur principal a encourue ne saurait l'affecter comme caution.\nNous allons d'abord examiner ce dernier point.\nQu'est-ce qu'un cautionnement? C'est un contrat par lequel quelqu'un s'oblige pour un d\u00e9biteur envers le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 lui payer ce que ce d\u00e9biteur lui doit en acc\u00e9dant \u00e0 son obligation.\nDans le cas actuel, la compagnie Three Rivers Shipyards s'est oblig\u00e9e de payer $100,000 par versements annuels de 1919 \u00e0 1927; mais il est stipul\u00e9 dans l'acte que si elle fait d\u00e9faut d'effectuer ces versements ou si elle diminue ses garanties, alors le cr\u00e9ancier a droit de se faire payer en entier et le d\u00e9biteur principal perd le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du terme qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9.\nLa cit\u00e9 de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res cautionne les obligations du d\u00e9biteur principal. Quelle est l'\u00e9tendue de ce cautionnement? Pothier, qui est toujours un guide bien s\u00fbr dans l'\u00e9tude de questions comme celle-ci, nous dit au n\u00b0 371 de son admirable Trait\u00e9 des Obligations que\nsi le cautionnement n'exprime rien, on y doit sous-entendre le terme ou la condition exprim\u00e9es dans l'obligation principale.\nIl exprime la m\u00eame opinion avec encore plus de force au no. 404 du m\u00eame trait\u00e9 quand il dit:\nLorsque les termes du cautionnement sont g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et ind\u00e9finis, le fid\u00e9jusseur est cens\u00e9 s'\u00eatre oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les obligations du principal d\u00e9biteur r\u00e9sultantes du contrat auquel il a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 ; il est cens\u00e9 l'avoir cautionn\u00e9 in omnem causant.\nVoil\u00e0 qui est clair et bien pr\u00e9cis; la caution doit remplir toutes les obligations du d\u00e9biteur principal in omnem causam, suivant les termes et les conditions du contrat originaire.\nTout le monde admet que la Three Rivers Shipyards, Limited, doit maintenant la balance de ses obligations sous les dispositions de la clause 8\u00e8me du contrat. En est-il de m\u00eame de sa caution, la cit\u00e9 de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res? En principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il n'y a pas de doute, car la caution assume toutes les obligations du d\u00e9biteur principal. Mais on dit; \"La cit\u00e9 ne s'est pas oblig\u00e9e au m\u00eame d\u00e9gr\u00e9 que le d\u00e9biteur principal et la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du terme originairement stipul\u00e9 que le d\u00e9biteur principal avait accept\u00e9e ne frappe pas la caution.\" La caution aurait certainement pu formellement d\u00e9clarer que cette d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance ne la lierait pas. Mais elle ne l'a pas fait. Les mots \"\u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives\" sur lesquels elle se base \u00e0 l'appui de sa pr\u00e9tention couvrent non-seulement les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances originairement stipul\u00e9es, mais aussi l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance globale et conditionnelle qui est mentionn\u00e9e dans le contrat, si le d\u00e9biteur principal fait d\u00e9faut dans l'ex\u00e9cution de ses obligation.\nPour soustraire la caution \u00e0 l'accomplissement de toutes les stipulations de la convention principale, il aurait fallu une disposition plus formelle et plus explicite que celle qui est invoqu\u00e9e.\nOn a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet l'opinion d'auteurs modernes, comme Demolombe, Guillouard, Planiol, Duranton et Pardessus, et un jugement de la cour de Cassation, 1891-1-5, \u00e0 l'appui de la th\u00e8se soutenue par l'appelante que si le d\u00e9biteur principal est en faillite et qu'il soit \u00e0 cause de cela d\u00e9chu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du terme, cette d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance ne rejaillit pas sur la caution.\nMais il ne faut pas oublier que ces auteurs ont \u00e9crit sous un syst\u00e8me de droit contenant une disposition sp\u00e9ciale dans le Code de Commerce qui a n\u00e9cessairement influ\u00e9 sur leur d\u00e9cision. Cette opinion est d'ailleurs combattue et victorieusement suivant moi, par d'autres auteurs modernes dont les \u00e9crits font grande autorit\u00e9, savoir: Aubry & Rau, tome 4, art. 303, note 18; Laurent, vol. 17, n\u00b0 213; Huc, vol. 7, n\u00b0 289; Larombi\u00e8re, art. 1188.\nNe vaut-il pas mieux suivre l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par Pothier et que j'ai cit\u00e9e plus haut? Il \u00e9crivait sous le droit coutumier. Il n'y avait pas alors dans le droit fran\u00e7ais cette disposition du Code de Commerce. Pothier \u00e9tait sous ce rapport dans la m\u00eame position que nous sommes dans Qu\u00e9bec.\nIl est bon de remarquer aussi que ce point ne para\u00eet n'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 qu'en Cour du Banc du Roi.\nPour toutes ces raisons, le jugement qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la cit\u00e9 de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de payer maintenant le montant global des obligations est bien fond\u00e9.\nOn a aussi pr\u00e9tendu que la fiduciaire n'avait pas droit de poursuite. Les cours inf\u00e9rieures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimes sur ce point, et il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9 devant cette cour. Je vois d'ailleurs que la cause de Porteous v. Reynar[2], a formellement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'article du code qu'on a invoqu\u00e9 ne s'applique pas aux fiduciaires\nin whom the subject of the trust has been vested in property and possession for the benefit of third parties and who have duties to perform in the protection or realization of the trust estate.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J. (dissenting).\u2014The whole question here is whether under the contract whereby the appellant guaranteed in favour of the respondent the ten-year bond issue of The Three Rivers Shipyards Limited, the respondent can, in view of the default of the latter company, claim from the appellant the immediate payment of the whole capital amount outstanding of the said bond issue? In other words, is the acceleration clause stipulated by the respondent against The Three Rivers Shipyards, Limited, in case of the default of the latter, binding on the appellant, its surety?\nThis acceleration clause (clause 8 of the contract) is as follows:\nNonobstant le terme accord\u00e9 pour le paiement de chacune des obligations, le montant total de la dite \u00e9mission de cent mille piastres ($100,000) ou telle partie d'icelle restant alors due, deviendra exigible, si le fiduciaire le juge convenable, dans aucun des cas suivants, savoir:\n(a) Si la compagnie ne paie pas les obligations ou les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives.\n(b) Si la garantie pr\u00e9sentement donn\u00e9e est diminu\u00e9e par aucune cause ou raison quelconque.\n(c) Si aucune des conditions et obligations auxquelles la compagnie peut \u00eatre tenue par les pr\u00e9sentes ne sont pas rigoureusement remplies.\nThe default of the company to pay the bonds and interest coupons \"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives\" also gives the right to the trustee (respondent), under clause 9 of the contract, to enter into possession of the properties, rights, revenues and franchises of the company, after 30 days' notice to the company and to the city, and it is stipulated that the city\npourra alors \u00e9viter l'effet de cette clause en effectuant le paiement des obligations ou coupons \u00e9chus.\nI desire to note, before going further, that the words \"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives\" which are found in clauses 8 and 9, undoubtedly refer to the date of maturity mentioned in each bond and in each interest coupon, and not to any acceleration of such date of maturity. And it is significant that the city can prevent the entry into possession of the trustee on the default of the company by paying only the overdue bonds or interest coupons.\nThe obligation of the city appellant to guarantee the 1 bond issue is expressed as follows in clause 18 of the contract :\nEt pour assurer plus amplement le paiement des dites obligations et de leurs coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eats, la ville d\u00e9clare par les pr\u00e9sentes garantir le paiement des obligations \u00e9mises par la compagnie comme susdit jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de la somme globale de cent mille piastres ($100,000) en principal avec en plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats, la ville s'obligeant vis-\u00e0-vis du fiduciaire pour le compte et le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des d\u00e9tenteurs de ces obligations et de ces coupons, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par la compagnie d'accomplir les conditions, charges et obligations auxquelles elle est tenue vis-\u00e0-vis d'eux et tel que convenu dans le pr\u00e9sent acte de fiducie, \u00e0 effectuer le paiement des obligations et des coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives.\nThis obligation of the appellant is subsidiary to that of the company, arising only on the default of the latter to fulfil the conditions, charges and obligations to which it is held towards the bondholders, and is to pay the bonds and interest coupons \"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives.\"\nHere again, as in clauses 8 and 9, the words \"\u00e0 leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances respectives\" refer in my opinion to the date of maturity mentioned in each bond and in each interest coupon, and not to any accelerated maturity of the same. It is very important to note that the parties in clause 18 contemplate the default of the company referred to in clause 8, and that in that event the obligation of the city, on the contract of suretyship, is only to pay the bonds and coupons at their respective dates of maturity.\nI merely mention clause 21 relied on by the respondent to show that I have not overlooked it. It declares the obligation of the city absolute towards the bondholders, notwithstanding certain conditions stipulated by it with regard to the company, but this obligation of the city is that created by clause 18 which I have cited.\nOn the construction of the contract, my opinion is therefore that the default of the company to pay the bonds and interest coupons at their maturity, while it renders the whole capital amount due as regards the company, only makes the city liable to pay the bonds and interest coupons as they respectively mature. Mr. Fortin on behalf of the respondent cited Pothier, Obligations, no. 371, paragraph 2, where he says:\u2014\nObservez que si le cautionnement n'exprime rien, on y doit sous-entendre le terme ou la condition exprim\u00e9e dans l'obligation principale, de m\u00eame qu'il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en la loi, 61 ff. eod. tit. que le lieu du paiement exprim\u00e9 dans l'obligation principale, est sous-entendu dans le cautionnement.\nAnd the contention was that if the suretyship deed be silent or even equivocal as to the term within which the surety must pay, this term must be held to be the same as that applicable to the principal debtor.\nThe argument would be well worthy of consideration were the contract in question silent or even equivocal as to the term of payment applicable to the surety, or in Pothier's words, si le cautionnement n'exprimait rien. But, on the contrary, clause 18 is very clear, and I do not see how the intention of the city to be liable for the bonds and coupons only when they respectively mature, could be better expressed.\nI have referred only to the contract, for I regard the question at issue as involving merely the proper construction of the instrument signed by the parties. It is therefore useless to mention any article of the civil code, such as Art. 1092, which, according to weighty modern French authorities, and some decisions of our courts (see Beau-champ, Code Civil Annot\u00e9, article 1092, no. 12), does not apply to the surety. The parties here have made their own contract and determined the effect of the debtor's default on the obligation of the surety. There remains nothing to do but to give effect to their expressed intention.\nI would allow the appeal with costs against the respondent here and in the appellate court. There should be judgment for the respondent against the appellant only for the bonds and coupons which had reached their respective dates of maturity when this action was taken. The appellant should pay the respondents' costs in the Superior Court, for it wrongly asked for the entire dismissal of the respondent's action.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: George M\u00e9thot.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e & Genest.\n[1] [1922] Q.R. 34 K.B. 351.\n[2] [1887] 13 App. Cas. 120.\n"}

The Maplehurst was not equipped for towing as she did not have the regulation towing lights required by article 3 of the \"Regulations for preventing collisions.\" The barge Brookdale had the regulation red and green side lights. While the Maplehurst was proceeding down the channel through Lake St. Peter, a collision occurred between the Brookdale and the tug Margaret Hackett upbound with a barge in tow, both the property of the George Hall Coal Company of Canada. As a result of the collision, the tug foundered and the barge Brookdale sustained damages. The plaintiffs, as their respective owners, sued for damages, each imputing fault and blame to the other. The trial judge held that the officers of the Maplehurst had been guilty of negligence which was a direct and efficient cause of the collision; and he also found that the accident could have been avoided by the exercise of skill and promptitude on the part of those in charge of the tug Margaret Hackett.

The failure of the Maplehurst to carry regulation towing lights (if so found upon the evidence) has not primarily led or caused or contributed to the collision. The fault of the mate of the Margaret Hackett was the sole effective cause of the collision, as, by the exercise of reasonable care, he could have avoided the consequences of the negligent act of the Maplehurst,\nHolden K.C. for the respondents. If any fault was committed by those in charge of the Margaret Hackett, it was not the direct cause of the accident, but followed upon and was the result of the much greater fault committed by the steamer Maplehurst.\nTowers K.C. for the appellants.\nHolden K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014Notwithstanding the able argument at bar of Mr. Towers K.C., for the appellant, I, after careful consideration of all the evidence in this case, have reached the firm conclusion that this appeal fails and that the judgment appealed from should be confirmed.\nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Anglin and I find that he has lucidly expressed the conclusions I myself had reached. It is unnecessary for me to repeat these reasons in which I fully concur.\nI would only add that it is of the greatest importance, in my opinion, that the courts should not minimize or seek to excuse the necessity of vessels traversing Canada's great waterway between Montreal and the gulf strictly obeying the regulations prescribed in that behalf. In this case it appears clearly to me that the Maplehurst failed to comply with the regulation as to lights to be carried by a steamer with a tow in the waters in question, and that this failure was a direct and efficient cause of the collision between the Hackett and the Maplehurst's tow, the Brookdale. The absence of regulation lights resulted, as my brother Anglin says, in leading the Margaret Hackett \"into a veritable trap.\" The latter's mate who was also steersman at the time, was no doubt also to blame in not acting with sufficient promptitude by starboarding his helm as he possibly should have done immediately he discovered that he had been misled by the Maplehurst's lights into the trap in which he found himself.\nBut I cannot think that his failure then to act with sufficient promptitude should be held to have been the sole and effective cause of the collision.\nBoth vessels were to blame, the Maplehurst chiefly, and I do not think the apportionment of the damages between them made by the trial judge should be interfered with.\nIdington J.\u2014The deliberate violation of article 3 of the relevant regulations which should have governed those in charge of the Maplehurst and which required two lights to be used, in the way specified by any steam vessel when towing another vessel, as a means of warning others concerned, was the primary negligence leading to what ensued and is now complained of.\nTo my mind it was a most gross defiance of the law to put up a coal oil lamp as the mate, so to speak, of an electric light when the article required that \"each of these lights shall be of the same construction and character,\" etc.\nThis defiance of the law was deliberate when ample time could be got for consideration and proper action.\nIt seems to me that complaint of another who had only a few minutes to rectify the mistake into which those in charge of her were led, comes with a bad grace from appellant under such circumstances. But the court below has properly dealt therewith by its distribution of the damages.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014A question arises on this appeal which is by no means free from difficulty but on the whole I think the balance inclines in favour of the view at which the learned trial judge arrived. The facts are dealt with by the learned judge in a manner which leaves nothing to be desired There is ample evidence to support his finding that the lights carried by the Maplehurst were not those prescribed by the regulations for a steamer engaged in a towage service and that these lights were misleading and calculated to throw the navigators of other craft off their guard and to lead them to govern themselves on the assumption that the Maplehurst had not another vessel in tow. On the other hand the learned trial judge in effect finds, with ample warrant, I think, from the evidence, that, on the assumption upon which the mate of the Margaret Hackett says he acted, namely, that the Brookdale was a vessel under sail, it was a negligent thing for him with another craft in tow to attempt to cross in front of the Brookdale and moreover there seems to be ample evidence to warrant the finding that at the last moment the collision could have been avoided if the mate of the Margaret Hackett realizing that the Brookdale was a tow attached to the Maplehurst had signalled his tow and passed the Brookdale starboard to starboard.\nThis being the state of facts the question raised by the appeal is the question whether the Margaret Hackett was solely to blame for the collision or whether the negligence of the Maplehurst in displaying misleading lights was negligence so contributing to the collision as to cast upon her a share of the loss.\nThe question can be put in another form, thus: Was the negligence of the Maplehurst in part the direct cause of the collision? The question is sometimes a very difficult one and where, as in this case, the negligence of the plaintiff and the negligence of the defendant are in sequence then the question arises whether the collision could \"have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary care and skill on the part of the defendant\" to quote from the judgment of Lord Campbell in Dowell v. General Steam Navigation Co.[2] in a passage cited with approval by the Lord Chancellor in Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Volute[3]. What is \"ordinary care and skill\" depends, I think, upon the circumstances and the conduct of the plaintiff may have been such in its bearing and effect upon the conduct of the defendant as to form a very important element in the determination of that question. Here the learned trial judge has found that the negligence of the Maplehurst threw the Margaret Hackett off her guard and was one of the determining factors in inducing her mate to take the course he did take, perhaps the predominant factor. It is quite true that a time did arrive before the collision when the mate of the Margaret Hackett realized his mistake and realized that the Brookdale instead of being a sailing vessel was a tow attached to the Maplehurst and the learned trial judge has found that by exercise of proper skill at the moment the accident could have been avoided. On the other hand the officer of the Margaret Hackett was placed in a somewhat difficult position and his failure to act with promptitude and clearsightedness was probably due to the fact that he found himself suddenly confronted with an unexpected state of affairs involving a present obvious danger. The precise point for consideration is indicated by the judgment of the Lord Chancellor already mentioned and especially in the following passage at p. 144:\u2014\nUpon the whole I think that the question of contributory negligence must be dealt with somewhat broadly and upon common-sense principles as a jury would probably deal with it. And while, no doubt, where a clear line can be drawn, the subsequent negligence is the only one to look to, there are cases in which the two acts come so closely together, and the second act of negligence is so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act, that the party secondly negligent, while not held free from blame under the Bywell Castle rule, might, on the other hand, invoke the prior negligence as being part of the cause of the collision so as to make it a case of contribution.\nI am not prepared to dissent from the conclusion that \"in the ordinary plain common sense of this business\" the Maplehurst did by her negligence contribute to the collision in the sense which required the learned trial judge to pronounce her to be partly to blame.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014As I read the opinion of the learned trial judge, apart from any question of burden of proof, he found that it was established by the evidence that the officers of the Maplehurst had been guilty of negligence which was a direct and efficient cause of the collision between her tow, the Brookdale, and the tug Margaret Hackett. The negligence consisted in not carrying the towing light prescribed by article 3 of the \"Regulations for preventing collisions.\" The mate in charge of the Margaret Hackett was led into a veritable trap. Nevertheless he was held blameworthy for having attempted to cross the channel between the Maplehurst and her tow, even on the assumption that the latter was a sailing vessel not in tow, and also because when he realized this mistake, while at a distance of about one hundred feet from the Brookdale, he could still have averted the collision by a proper manoeuvre. There being no cross-appeal this condemnation of the owners of the Margaret Hackett must stand.\nThe appellant contends, however, that the fault of the mate of the Margaret Hackett was the sole effective cause of the collision\u2014that by the exercise of reasonable care he could have avoided the consequences of the negligent omission to exhibit a proper towing light on the Maplehurst.\nConsideration of the evidence has convinced me that the conclusion of the learned trial judge was right\u2014that the fault of the officers of the Maplehurst continued operative until the collision was, if not inevitable, only to be avoided by great skill and extraordinary alertness on the part of those in charge of the Margaret Hackett. For their failure to exercise the requisite skill and to act with the necessary promptitude, the owners of the Margaret Hackett have been held answerable for one-quarter of the damages sustained by the Brookdale, in addition to bearing one-quarter of their own loss. The Maplehurst on the other hand has been condemned to pay three-quarters of the loss suffered by the owners of the Margaret Hackett.\nAgreeing, as I do, with the view of the learned trial judge that the officers of the Maplehurst were gravely to blame and the owners of the Margaret Hackett not having appealed, I should be loath to interfere with the apportionment of the damages even if I regarded it as not quite satisfactory. But, with Mr. Justice Maclennan, I consider the officers of the Maplehurst as much more blameworthy for the collision than those in charge of the Margaret Hackett.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The evidence shews that the collision in question in this case is due largely, if not entirely, to the negligence of the appellants for not having a proper tow light on the mast head of the Maplehurst.\nIf such a light had been shewn, the pilot of the respondents would never have tried to cross to the north side of the channel in front of the barge in tow. The trial judge has found that the two vessels were at fault and there is no appeal on the part of the respondents against this part of the judgment which found them guilty of contributory negligence.\nIt has been contended before us by the appellants that the tug, in acting with reasonable care, could have avoided the accident even if the Maplehurst had not the proper tow light.\nI am unable to agree with this contention. When the pilot of the tug Margaret Hackett saw the light of the boat in tow, he thought it was a sailing vessel because he never expected to find there a boat in tow, and he was certainly well advised, under the impression that he had, to go on and to cross on the north side of the channel. When he discovered that the boat was not a sailing vessel and was in tow, it was too late to avoid the collision.\nFor these reasons, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014I find myself in much doubt whether the collision in question in these two appeals was not solely caused by the imprudence of the mate, who was navigating the Margaret Hackett at the time of the accident, in attempting with his tow to cross between the Maplehurst and the latter's tow. The excuse given by the mate was that not having seen proper towing lights on the Maplehurst, he thought her tow was a sailing vessel, and judged that he could get safely by, although his own towing line was 500 feet long. The learned trial judge did not hear the witnesses himself but the evidence taken before the wreck commissioner was by consent of the parties tendered as evidence in the two cases. This is unsatisfactory, and I cannot entirely escape from the suspicion that the mate of the Margaret Hackett, when he says he thought the Maplehurst's tow was a sailing vessel, was testifying as to the state of his mind at the time of the accident with the advantage of subsequent reflection. I would not suggest for a moment that he was not in perfect good faith but evidence of this character is not very reliable, for persons who have contributed to an accident are apt, often unconsciously, to offer excuses or explanations which really were not present in their minds at the time when the accident was brought about, especially where their imprudence, as here, was admittedly one of the causes of the accident. I will not, however, dissent from the judgment about to be rendered, but my concurrence therein is not without considerable doubt.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Barnard & McKeown.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Meredith, Holden, Hague, Shaughnessy & Heward.\n[1] To be reported in [1923] Ex.

To the face of a policy of fire insurance on sawn lumber there was attached a sheet of paper typewritten in black and containing the following provision: \"It is understood and agreed that this insurance also covers loss or damage arising from or traceable to prairie fires, It being warranted by the assured that the several locations named herein on which lumber is piled shall be entirely surrounded by ploughed ground and in no way exposed to bush hazard.\" The policy was indorsed with the statutory conditions in compliance with \"The Alberta Insurance Act.\" In an action on the policy,\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that, as against the appellant, the warranty as to the character of the surroundings of the property insured is restricted in its application to the risk from prairie fires and cannot be regarded as part of the description of that property for the general purposes of the policy.\nHeld also, Davies C.J. dissenting, that upon the evidence no misrepresentation by the assured, or by any one in a position to bind him, had been shewn and that he or his representative had disclosed all material facts of which they had knowledge bearing on the risk.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division ([1922] 1 W.W.R. 1048) reversed, Davies C.J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta [1]reversing the judgment of Walsh J. and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nWoods K.C. for the appellant.\nSavary K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I concur in the reasons for the judgment of the Appellate Division delivered by Mr. Justice Hyndman and concurred in by Chief Justice Scott, which clearly express my own views. DUFF J.\u2014After a careful consideration of the judgments delivered in the Appellate Division I am still of the opinion that the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh was right and that the reasons assigned by him for the conclusion at which he arrived are sound reasons.\nI agree with him that the typewritten warranty relates only to \"loss or damage arising from or traceable to prairie fires.\"\nI agree that Lebel was not the agent of the appellants and that the appellant company merely took over the application made to the London & Lancashire Company and acted upon it as if it had been made to themselves through Lebel and the inspector Hahn. As to non-disclosure, I think the view of the learned trial judge is the reasonable practical view and that it would be putting the obligation of the applicants for insurance on too high a level to hold that Meunier was under a duty to disclose as a circumstance material to the risk the fact that in the river-bed below the bench on which the lumber was piled there were some willow bushes which at the time of the application were largely immersed in the waters of the river.\nThe appeal should, I think, be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh restored.\nUpon the question of construction I am satisfied that as against the appellant the warranty as to the character of the surroundings of the property insured is restricted in its application to the risk from prairie fire and cannot be regarded as part of the description of that property for the general purposes of the policy. The reasons for so holding are stated by Mr. Justice Walsh.\nNo misrepresentation by the assured or by any one in position to bind him has been shown.\nNeither was there any concealment of, or failure on the part of the assured to communicate, circumstances material to the risk such as would avoid the policy under the first statutory condition. Upon the evidence it has not been established that Lebel acted as agent for the insured and there is nothing to warrant the suggestion that Hahn, the inspector of the London & Lancashire Ins. Co., occupied that position. The insured appears to have made full disclosure to Lebel when he applied to him orally as local agent for the London & Lancashire, from which he then sought insurance. The transfer of the appellant's oral application from that company to the respondent company, which eventually took the risk, was arranged by Mr. Hahn without any participation by the appellant,\u2014indeed, so far as appears, without his knowledge. Any mistake made by Mr. Hahn in describing the situs of the property when arranging such transfer, does not, in my opinion, suffice to avoid the policy as against the appellant.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal concerning a fire insurance policy on cut timber. The insurers, after having described in the policy three lots of timber situated at different places, added the following provision which was typewritten:\nIt is understood and agreed that this insurance also covers loss or damage arising from or traceable to prairie fires, It being warranted by the assured that the several locations named herein on which lumber is piled shall be entirely surrounded by ploughed ground and in no way exposed to bush hazard.\nThe case turns largely on the construction of this provision. The insurance company contends that it is a condition precedent and that the facts not being as warranted the policy never attached. On the other hand, the insured claims that such a clause would extend only to damage traceable to prairie fire.\nThe judges in the courts below are equally divided on this point. The appellate division, by a majority of one, reversed the decision of the trial judge and came to the conclusion that this clause should be considered as a description of the property insured.\nThis policy is issued under the statutory conditions of the province of Alberta.\nThe clause in question is not artistically drawn but it means, according to my mind, that the risk covers also a loss arising out of a prairie fire, but provided that in such a case the pile of lumber should be surrounded by ploughed ground. If there were a serious doubt as to the construction of this clause, it should be interpreted against the insurance company, since it was drafted, inserted in the policy and stipulated by the company itself.\nIt is contended also by the insurance company that no liability attaches because a circumstance which was material was not disclosed, such circumstance being that the lumber was situate in a clearing in the bush and exposed to bush hazard.\nA great deal has been said in connection with this about some willow brush that had grown in the river on the bank of which was piled the lumber insured.\nThis willow brush being at some period of the year entirely covered by the waters of the river its green and moist condition for the part which emerged from the water during the balance of the year could not constitute a serious source of danger. The brush or bush to which reference is made in a correspondence and about which inquiries were made had reference to the slashings or underbrush resulting from the cutting of the timber. This had been removed and the pile of lumber was on clear ground and was not exposed to risk arising out of this heavy underbrush which might be a great source of danger.\nIt was suggested also that this bush would include the standing timber.\nI think that the circumstances disclosed show that a bush of heavy timber could not be considered as constituting a material fact to be disclosed and that the parties fully understood that the validity of the policy would not be affected by the fact that there was in the vicinity some standing timber.\nI have then come to the conclusion that the plaintiff company has a right to recover under the policy of insurance in question.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The action of the appellant is to recover on an insurance policy issued by the respondent covering, inter alia, 150,000 feet of sawn lumber piled on bank of river on section 3, township 63, range 10, west of the 4th meridian, province of Alberta.\nIt is contested on three grounds:\u2014\n1. There was in the policy a special warranty that the several locations therein named on which lumber was piled, should be entirely surrounded by ploughed ground and in no way exposed to bush hazard, and the lumber destroyed did not conform to this warranty.\n2. It was represented by the insured and his agents that the lumber would be under some kind of supervision, ploughed around and in no way exposed to bush hazard.\n3. By the conditions of the policy it was the duty of the insured to disclose any circumstance material to enable the insurer to judge of the risk it undertook, and the insured did not disclose the fact that the lumber in question was entirely surrounded by bush and underbrush and was exposed to the risk of bush fire.\nThe first point involves the construction of the following typewritten clause contained in the policy:\u2014\nIt is understood and agreed that this insurance also covers loss or damage arising from or traceable to prairie fires, It being warranted by the assured that the several locations named herein, on which lumber is piled shall be entirely surrounded by ploughed ground and in no way exposed to bush hazard.\nIn my opinion, the warranty here is restricted to the insurance against loss or damage arising from or traceable to prairie fires. It is not a general warranty. I think the words \"It being warranted,\" etc, cannot be severed from the words which precede. The punctuation shews that although the word \"It\" begins with a capital \"I,\" the warranty is really a part of the whole clause. If severed, it would not form a complete sentence, while, if taken with the preceding words, the sentence is a perfect one, and the idea expressed is quite conceivable, for a strip of ploughed ground around the lumber would be a great protection in case of a prairie fire. The insurer, when stipulating a warranty applicable, as he now contends, to the whole risk, should have made it perfectly clear that it did so apply, and I would not detach the warranty clause from its context to give it a greater effect than it has when read in this context. On this point, for the fire here did not arise from a prairie fire, I am in full agreement with the learned trial judge. On the second point, the contention is that the appellant is bound by the statement of Mr. Hahn, the inspector of the London & Lancashire Fire Insurance Co. (which company found itself unable to insure the lumber and passed on the risk to the respondent), who in his letter to Mr. Dunham, the agent for the respondent company, said that he had arranged with Mr. Lebel that\nall this lumber was to be under some kind of supervision, ploughed around, and in no way exposed to bush hazard.\nThis involves a question of agency, and the claim of the respondent is that Mr. Lebel was the appellant's agent for this insurance. Mr. Lebel is a solicitor and incidentally an agent of the London & Lancashire Fire Insurance Co., Mr. Hahn's company. He explains that he never acted as solicitor for the appellant. He had written to Mr. Meunier of the appellant company claiming from the latter a certain amount for a client of his, and as Meunier could not pay he then suggested to him that the lumber should be insured in order to protect his client, to which suggestion Meunier acquiesced. This certainly does not make Lebel the appellant's agent, the more so as, to Meunier's knowledge, in addition to being a solicitor he was an insurance agent. And in his letter to Mr. Hahn, with reference to the insurance of the lumber in question, Lebel merely said that it was piled on the bank of a river, on the timber limit of the owner. Without questioning the sincerity of Mr. Hahn's statement to Mr. Dunham, I do not think that the appellant is bound by its terms. The respondent could have incorporated this statement in its policy, and not having done so the appellant cannot be bound by Mr. Hahn's representations.\nOn the third point, I think that Mr. Meunier fairly disclosed all the circumstances connected with the risk. The lumber was on the bank of a river, this bank being some ten feet above a flat through which the river flowed, and the lumber was about fifty feet from the river, on a clearing made by the appellant. There was timber around the clearing and on the flat there were willows which, when seen after the fire, were ten or fifteen feet high. But the insurance was effected in the early spring when the water was high and the willows, much smaller then, were covered by water. I do not think that the appellant's representatives failed to disclose any material fact of which they had knowledge bearing on the risk. On the contrary, they appear to have acted in good faith and to have described the situation of the lumber as it then was. The willows certainly grew during the summer, but even if the risk thereby became greater I do not think that the appellant can be taxed with misrepresentation or failure to disclose material facts. On this point also I am against the respondent.\nWith great deference therefore, I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs here and in the Appellate Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1922] 1 W.W.R. 1048.\n"}

Town of Glace Bay, [1923] S.C.R. 524\nDate: 1923-12-31\nThe Royal Bank of Canada Appellant;\nand\nThe Town of Glace Bay Respondent.\n1923:\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA\nAssessment and taxes\u2014Bank\u2014Net annual income or profit\u2014Municipal assessment\u2014Business done in municipality\u2014Assessment Act, 3-9 Geo, V, c. 5\u2014Validating Act\u2014Pending cases\u2014Right of appeal.\nBy the Nova Scotia Assessment Act a bank doing business in any municipality may be taxed on the \"net annual income or profit\" derived from such business. In 1921 the branch of the Royal Bank at Glace Bay received a large sum on deposit by its customers which was remitted to the head office of the bank in Montreal and merged in the general funds there. Without regard to any use made of this money by the head office the branch was credited with interest at four per cent on the amount.\nHeld, per Idington, Anglin and Mignault JJ., Davies C.J. and Duff and Brodeur JJ. contra, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (56 N.S. Rep. 120), that the sum so credited, less the amount of any loss incurred in the other operations of the branch, constitutes the \"net annual income or profit\" of the bank derived from its business in Glace Bay which was liable to taxation.\nHeld, per Idington and Brodeur JJ., Anglin J. contra, that an Act of the legislature validating the assessment roll for 1921 and omitting the provision in former Acts of the kind that it would not apply to pending cases, takes away the bank's right to appeal in this case which was pending when the Act came into force.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment of the County Court Judge in favour of the appellant in proceedings to set aside an assessment on the net income or profit of the bank derived from its business in Glace Bay in the year 1921.\nThe essential facts of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nJenks K.C. and J McG. Stewart for the appellant. The bank earned no income or profit in its business at Glace Bay during the year 1921. Such profit, if any, was earned in Montreal. See Sulley v. Attorney General[2] ; Grainger v. Gough[3].\nCommissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[4] can be distinguished. In that case it was proved that profit was made from business partly done in New South Wales. Here no such profit has been or could be proved.\nC. B. Smith K.C. and McArthur for the respondent. The legislation, by omitting from the Act validating the assessment roll of 1922 the usual provision that it would not apply to cases pending intended that it should so apply and the right of appeal in this case is taken away. See Reg. v. Price[5] per Cockburn C.J. at page 416.\nThe earnings from the deposits is derived from the business done in Glace Bay; Commissioner of Taxes v. Kirk[6] ; and the four per cent credited to the bank represents the profit.\nJenks K.C. and J McG. Stewart for the appellant.\nC. B. Smith K.C. and McArthur for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The substantial question to be determined in this appeal is the proper construction of section 4 of the First Schedule of the Assessment Act, 1918 (chapter 5, Acts of 1918) of Nova Scotia which reads as follows :\nAll banks and public or private banking companies and agencies of such banks and banking companies doing business within any incorporated town or municipality shall each be rated as holding one hundred dollars of personal property for every twenty dollars of net annual income or profit derived from the business done by them in the town or municipality where the same is assessed; provided, however, that the amount payable on account of such rating shall not be less than one hundred and fifty dollars.\nThe facts as I gather them from the case in appeal and the argument of counsel at bar are that the Royal Bank of Canada, having its head office at Montreal, maintains a branch in the town of Glace Bay, an incorporated town under the provisions of the \"Town Incorporation Act\" (1918 Acts of Nova Scotia, c. 4). This bank receives deposits, lends money and carries on the usual business of a branch bank. In the year 1921 the average daily excess of deposits over loans amounted to $727,000. The surplus of moneys so deposited and not required for the branch's purposes in Glace Bay were remitted to the head office of the bank in Montreal and there merged with similar remittances from other branches and with the general assets of the bank, and the fund so formed was lent or invested or otherwise dealt with by the head office of the bank in various places at varying rates of interest. No part of this fund was lent or invested in the town of Glace Bay during the year; nor had the Glace Bay branch any record or information as to the lending or other dealing with this fund. Leaving out of account the interest or income earned on the said central fund or on the monies remitted by the Glace Bay branch to head office there was a deficit of approximately $26,000 on the operations of the Glace Bay branch for the year 1921.\nWhen preparing the assessment rates for the year 1922 the assessors of the town of Glace Bay assessed the bank in respect of \"income\" for $12,000. On appeal by the bank to the Assessment Appeal Court for the town of Glace Bay this assessment was confirmed. On appeal to the County Court for the district the appeal of the bank was allowed. From this decision the town of Glace Bay appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, and the latter court allowed the appeal.\nThe appellants here contend that the judgment below is wrong because the agency of the Royal Bank of Canada at Glace Bay did not derive any \"net income or profit\" from its business done in the town of Glace Bay; and because the income or profit, if any, in respect of deposits made in the town of Glace Bay and remitted by the Glace Bay branch to head office was derived where the monies were loaned or invested. (Such income or profit, if made at places in Nova Scotia where the Royal Bank maintained branches would be assessed there by the local municipalities.)\nMy construction of the above quoted section 4, is that such section authorizes the assessment of banks and agencies doing business in any incorporated town or municipality of Nova Scotia only, as expressed, on the \"net annual income or profit\" derived by them from the business done by them in the town or municipality making the assessment. The mere receipt of deposits in Glace Bay and their transmission to a head office for investment elsewhere than in Glace Bay would not of itself make the bank liable to the local municipality. Such liability could only arise under the section quoted in towns and municipalities in Nova Scotia where a bank had loaned or invested its money and derived income or profit therefrom.\nIn other words the mere taking in and remitting of deposits by a branch to a head office, which is only an incidental step toward realizing income or profit, is not of itself sufficient to authorize an assessment under the section quoted. The intention of that section is, I think, simply and solely to authorize assessment upon income or profits derived by a bank from the business done by it in the town or municipality. Such income or profits cannot be said to be so derived except from loans or investments made in the town or municipality. If it were otherwise a bank might be taxed at its branch which received the deposits and also at each branch in the province through which loans or investments were made and income or profit derived therefrom. I cannot think the latter is the proper construction of this section.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs for the reason that the income of the appellant at its Glace Bay agency is exactly what the appellant has quite properly determined is the proper measure of its profits derived by carrying on the agency at Glace Bay.\nThe head office, in the language of its accountant at Glace Bay, is a borrower from that agency, as shewn by the following extract from his evidence:\nQ. What did you do with it?\u2014A. We had it in Glace Bay on deposit and it was controlled by our head office.\nQ. What did you do with it?\u2014A. It was transferred to head office.\nQ. Any entry in the books about that?\u2014A. No, there is no actual entry, they borrow the money from us.\nQ. What do they pay?\u2014A. The head office records only would show.\nQ. You say they borrow that money from you, what do they pay?\u2014A. They don't pay anything direct.\nQ. In this statement where you showed a loss of $25,000 you showed no earnings for this $727,000?\u2014A. No.\nQ. You lent that to your head office for nothing?\u2014A. Yes, the records are all kept at head office, that is in regard to loans of money.\nQ. In other words you took $727,200 of the savings of the people in Glace Bay and transferred it to head office and lent it to them for nothing and then you say that you operated at a loss?\u2014A. We did.\nQ. Who pays your salaries?\u2014A. Head office, at the end of the year it is debited to head office. Q. But don't they in any way give you credit for that $727,200?\u2014A At the head office in Montreal at the end of every year they make up a general balance sheet for every branch.\nQ. Have you got that?\u2014A. They don't furnish us with a statement. We figure it up roughly.\nAll the arguments dependent on the ultimate result of such borrowing are beside the question.\nIf the appellant keeps track properly of such borrowings it will only be chargeable elsewhere with the earnings made on due allowance being made for the interest it has to pay depositors at Glace Bay. And on that basis its losses will be chargeable also and thus things be evened up. If what the banks have long estimated as profits from carrying on agencies as the business basis reason for carrying them on is adhered to and observed everywhere as it should be, justice will be done all around and no evil results arise. The admissions made seem to cover the whole ground if we have regard to what the parties concerned have to deal with and mean by the language used. I do not think we should attempt to impose upon business men our ideas of what income may mean; they clearly have another well founded in long practice. The mode of arriving at the basis for taxing personal property is certainly novel.\nI do not think any reference should have been directed and that the $12,000 result arrived at by the respondent's Court of Revision is correct.\nThe confirming legislation by the legislature, according to my view, should have been held effective unless there is a blunder therein, as Mr. Jenks submits, by using the term municipalities in one Act cited.\nBut there is another Act, passed in April, 1922, which seems to fit the case.\nThe judgment appealed from should be modified by striking out the reference and restoring the assessment.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the appellant bank's contention should be sustained.\nIt is, perhaps, convenient to consider the enactment from the point of view of its application to the case of a branch deriving profit directly through lending the funds of the bank. It seems a reasonable application of the enactment to hold that the profits derived from such loans made by the branch and received by the branch are profits derived directly from the business of the branch and assessable accordingly.\nIt is argued, however, that such a profit is the result of a series of operations beginning with the deposit or other borrowing and ending with the payment by the person to whom the loan has been made, and it is said that in order to ascertain the profits derived from the business of the branch it is necessary to decompose this profit derived from the whole series of operations, ascribing to each operation which forms a term in the series that part of the profit which ought justly to be apportioned to it. It is conceivable, no doubt, that a legislature might embark upon the design of taxing branch banks upon such a system. The probability, however, of such a plan commending itself to practical legislators seems to be rather remote and a consideration of the practical difficulties in the way of putting such a system into operation, coupled with the absence of any provision in this statute for machinery by which the necessary information could be collected, convinces me that a construction of the statute which would necessitate the ascertainment of the assessable profit by such a process would not give effect to the intention of the legislature.\nStress was naturally placed upon the circumstance that a book-keeping credit is allowed to the branch by the head office in respect of loans. This, it was argued, constitutes sufficient evidence that to the extent of this credit at least the bank is receiving profit from the business of the branch in question.\nBut the real question is not a question to be solved by evidence of that character. The Act applies not only to the appellant bank and to the particular banks mentioned in the evidence, but to all banks and banking corporations doing business in Nova Scotia, and the primary question is whether the statute contemplates a process of dividing the whole ultimate profit received by a given branch by ascertaining parts of it which should be considered to be severally derived from the different operations in the whole profit-earning series; and for the determination of that question the credits relied upon do not assist us. The respondents relied largely upon Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[7]. That case, in my opinion, has no bearing upon the present question. There the real point was whether the ore was income derived or arising or accruing from mines held under lease from the Crown or from \"some other source\" in New South Wales. There was no difficulty in ascertaining the value of the merchantable ore shipped from the colony to the smelter, and no practical reason such as exists in this case forbidding the adoption of the construction which their Lordships of the Judicial Committee ascribed to the statute they were called upon to apply.\nI should like to express my appreciation of the ability with which the appeal was argued on both sides.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the County Court judge restored.\nAnglin J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, allowing an appeal, from the judgment of the judge of the County Court for District No. 7, whereby he set aside an assessment of the appellant for the year 1922 for $12,000 of personal property made under section 4 of the first schedule of the Nova Scotia Assessment Act of 1918, c. 5. That section reads as follows:\u2014\nAll banks and public or private banking companies, and agencies of such banks and banking companies, \"doing business within any incorporated town or municipality, shall each be rated as holding one hundred dollars of personal property for every twenty dollars of net annual income or profit derived from the business done by them in the town or municipality where same is assessed; provided, however, that the amount payable on account of such rating shall not be less than one hundred and fifty dollars.\nThe assessment of $12,000 is based on a net income or profit of $2,400 derived during the year 1921 by the bank from business done by its branch agency in the town of Glace Bay. The principal question on the appeal is whether the bank has shown that it did not derive such an income from its business done at Glace Bay, a subsidiary question being whether legislation, passed in 1922 (c. 35, s. 2) after the assessment had been upheld by the Assessment Appeal Court, and after notice but before hearing of the further appeal by the bank to the County Court judge, validating and confirming the assessment roll for 1922, precluded further prosecution of such pending appeal.\nDuring the year 1921 the average daily excess of deposits with the Glace Bay branch over loans made through it was approximately $727,000. That amount was transmitted to the head office at Montreal to be used in the appellant's banking business. It is admitted that, including as an item of expense interest payable to depositors, the cost of operating the branch at Glace Bay for 1921 exceeded profits received by it during that year by the sum of $25,938.86. In arriving at this figure no account is taken of any part of the bank's earnings from the $727,000 deposits transmitted from the Glace Bay branch. It is also admitted that in preparing an annual return made to head office, known as \"The Value of the Branch Return,\" the bank officials in charge of the Glace Bay branch took credit for a sum equal to 4 per cent on the $727,000 average excess of deposits transmitted by it during 1921 to head office, amounting approximately to $29,000. This was estimated to be the value to the bank of the work done by the Glace Bay branch office in getting in and forwarding the deposits. It is in evidence that a branch with large deposits and small loans is a very valuable branch. There is no evidence in the record that the getting in and forwarding of $727,000 of deposits for use in the general banking business of the bank was worth less to it than the $29,000 for which credit was so claimed in \"The Value of the Branch Return.\"\nAssuming therefore, as I think we may as against the bank, that the $29,000 for which credit was thus taken represents the proportion of the earnings made by the bank in 1921 through the use of the $727,000 fairly attributable to the business of getting in the deposits making up that sum and of transmitting them to head office\u2014processes which formed a material part of what had to be done by the bank in earning whatever profits it made by the handling of the $727,000\u2014it would seem to be a legitimate conclusion that the net income or profits derived from business done by the appellant in the town of Glace Bay in 1921 was at least $3,000\u2014$29,000 less $25,938.86.\nThe learned County Court judge was of the opinion that it was not possible upon the evidence to find that any net profit or income had been derived by the bank from the business done by it at Glace Bay, since the particular money transmitted from that branch could not be traced so as to ascertain whether the use made of it by the bank had resulted in its earning any definite amount of profit. He accordingly reduced the assessment of $12,000 so that the amount payable on account of the rating under the first schedule of section 4 (c. 5, 1918) would not exceed the sum of $150, as prescribed by the statute. Mr. Justice Russell in the court in banco expressed a similar view. Mr. Justice Mellish, however, with whom Mr. Justice Chisholm concurred, thought that profits derived or losses suffered from deposits having been made at Glace Bay which were transmitted to head office must be taken into account in determining the annual profits of the business done there by the appellant bank and then an accounting would be necessary to ascertain the amount of such profits, if any. The case was accordingly remitted to the judge of the County Court for that purpose.\nI agree with the learned County Court judge and the majority of the learned judges in the Supreme Court in banco that the passing of the statute validating and confirming the assessment rolls for 1922 did not prevent the prosecution of the appeal then pending. I should require a very clear expression of intention to determine rights presently pending before the courts\u2014to supersede the provision conferring a right of appeal which the appellant was actually in the course of exercising.\nOn the merits I regard this case as not distinguishable in principle from that before the Judicial Committee in Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[8]. Here, as there, part of the processes by which the income or profit made (out of the $727,000) was earned\u2014part of the business from which that income or profit was derived\u2014was carried on within the territory for which the assessment was levied. Adapting the language of Lord Davey in Kirk's Case[9] (p. 592):\nAt first sight it seems startling that the ultimate result in the form of profit of business carried on in the municipality is not to some extent taxable * * * So far as relates to the processes of getting the deposits and forwarding them to head office the income was earned and the profits were arising and accruing in Glace Bay.\nIn Kirk's Case9 ore was extracted and treated in New South Wales. It was then shipped abroad and sold abroad, the profits, of course, coming from the price obtained on such foreign sale. The question before the court was whether the respondent had any income taxable in New South Wales under the Land and Income Tax Assessment Act of 1895. By section 15 of that Act a tax was imposed on all incomes (1) arising or accruing to any person from any profession, trade, employment or vocation carried on in New South Wales; (3) derived from lands of the Crown held under lease or license; (4) arising or accruing to any person from any kind of property (except certain land), or from any other source whatever. Section 27 provided for the deduction of losses, outgoings and expenses. It was held that the respondent had some income taxable in New South Wales, (a) in respect to the process of extracting the ore as a step in the production of income arising from Crown lands held under lease (s. 3); (b) in respect of the treating or manufacturing process as a step likewise so productive and, if not within the meaning of the word \"trade\" in subsection 1, as certainly included in the words \"any other source whatever\" in subsection 4. Here the processes of getting in the deposits and forwarding them to head office similarly conduced to the earning of the income or profit ultimately resulting to the bank from the use of the money.\nBut it is urged that the $727,000 having been blended with other moneys of the bank to form a common loaning fund it is not possible to tell what part of the earnings of that fund were derived from the use made of that particular money. It is doubtless true that the precise money sent in from Glace Bay cannot be followed and the particular investments of it traced. But the bank's annual earnings from its loaning fund are known and what proportion of them was fairly attributable to the use of the Glace Bay deposits as part of that fund is readily determinable. The bank is in a position to say what the taking in on deposit and the handing over of the $727,000 by the Glace Bay branch was worth to it by ascertaining to what percentage of the total loaning fund employed by it (of which the $727,000 formed part) its profits therefrom for the year amounted and apportioning, as its experience enables it to do, the percentage so earned between the branch obtaining and forwarding the money and the branches which subsequently dealt with it. On that basis it was apparently satisfied to allow what in current commercial language is termed a \"spread\" of 1 per cent over the cost of the money, i.e., the 3 per cent interest paid to depositors, and therefore to credit the branch bank with 4 per cent on the total average daily balance in hand representing deposits received from it.\nIt is further urged, however, that it is not possible to apportion the earnings of the $727,000 so as to know with any degree of certainty what proportion of them should be ascribed to the business done at Glace Bay. A sufficient answer seems to be that the bank has not found that obstacle insuperable. It has been able to estimate the proportion which would be so allowed and has fixed the amount at $29,000. It cannot reasonably complain if its estimate is adopted by the municipal assessor. The evidence as a whole does not impeach the accuracy of this estimate; on the contrary, it rather upholds its fairness and moderation. Expert bankers must be able to ascertain with at least approximate precision what the collection and forwarding of deposits by a branch is worth to a bank. They must, and they do, arrive at a conclusion on these matters, satisfactory to themselves at least, in order to determine as a matter of practical business the value of a branch office at which the deposits largely exceed the amounts loaned. As already stated, upon the evidence such branches are very valuable to the banks operating them. In the present instance on the basis of $29,000 credit taken by the Glace Bay branch in respect of $727,000 deposits \"loaned\" by it to head office, the net earnings, income or profits of the branch for 1921 exceeded $3,000. The impeached assessment is based on an income or profit of $2,400. This margin of over 25 per cent would seem to be sufficient to cover any possible adverse inaccuracy in the bank's estimate.\nWith respect, therefore, I think a reference back to the County Court judge for the purpose of an accounting is unnecessary. The assessment should simply be restored to the figure at which it stood before the appeal to the County Court judge. With this modification the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This appeal is concerning the assessment of the income or business of the appellant, the Royal Bank. The law of Nova Scotia as passed in 1918 provides that the banks doing business in a town shall\nbe rated as holding one hundred dollars of personal property for every twenty dollars of net annual income or profit derived from the business done by them in the town or municipality where same is assessed.\nThe question which has been raised is whether the deposits which have not been utilized in the branch of the Royal Bank at Glace Bay but which have been transferred at the head office at Montreal should be considered in determining the profit made in the town of Glace Bay.\nBy virtue of the legislation of 1918, the bank was assessed upon the assessment roll for the year 1922 at a rate of $12,000 for its income and business. An appeal from that assessment was made to the assessment appeal court on the 28th of February, 1922, and was dismissed. On the 21st of March, 1922, an appeal was made to the County Court by the bank from the decision of the Assessment Appeal Court, and on the 23rd of June, 1922, the County Court judge heard the parties, and he rendered his decision on the 12th of October, 1922, allowing the appeal and quashing the assessment.\nIt should be here mentioned that when this assessment was before the County Court, viz., on the 13th of April, 1922, the legislature of Nova Scotia passed chapter 5 of the acts of 1922 declaring in section 2 that\nthe assessment rolls for the present year and the revisers' lists of electors completed this year are hereby legalized and confirmed.\nIt is now contended by the town of Glace Bay that the assessment complained of by the Royal Bank cannot be disturbed and has been legalized and confirmed.\nA similar statute has been passed for years by the legislature of Nova Scotia. It is evidently intended to prevent actions instituted against the assessment rolls from being a serious obstacle to the good administration of the municipality.\nIt is certainly a very wise provision and permits the municipalities to carry on their business in a regular way. They can with such legislation go on with the fixing of the rate of local taxation and with the collection of their taxes.\nIt has been argued that this confirming statute covered only the irregularities of procedure in making the assessment roll and would not confirm some substantial injustice. If some provisions of the Assessment Act, viz., sections 61 and 171 did not already declare that all defects and errors or irregularities on the part of the municipal authorities are cured, this contention that the law did not refer to illegalities or substantial injustices would have a great deal of strength. But if the legislature has thought fit, as it has done, to pass the confirming legislation in question, we must give it some meaning and some effect, as the Interpretation Act of Nova Scotia says that every enactment shall be deemed remedial (ch. 1, R.S.N.S. [1900] s. 23, s.s. 2).\nIn former enactments of this legislation by the legislature a provision was inserted in order to exempt pending cases from the application of the law. But in this year, 1922, which is under consideration, no such reservation was made and we must then read the statute as having a general application.\nThe assessment roll having been declared valid by the legislature, I am bound with regret (for I am convinced that the assessment of the bank was not legal) to maintain the decision of the Supreme Court en banc with costs throughout and to declare that the assessment roll has been legalized and confirmed.\nMignault J.\u2014This is an appeal by special leave of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against a judgment of that court reversing the judgment of the County Court for District No. 7, which had set aside the respondent's assessment of the branch of the appellant bank at Glace Bay, N.S., at $12,000 for net income during 1921.\nThe assessment was made under the Nova Scotia Assessment Act (ch. 5 of 1918), section 4 of which reads as follows:\n4. All banks and public or private banking companies, and agencies of such banks and banking companies, doing business within any incorporated town or municipality, shall each be rated as holding one hundred dollars of personal property for every twenty dollars of net annual income or profit derived from the business done by them in the town or municipality where same is assessed; provided, however, that the amount payable on account of such rating shall not be less than one hundred and fifty dollars.\nAs shown here, the bank is rated as holding $100 of personal property for every $20 of net annual profit or income derived from its business in the assessing municipality, so that a rating of $12,000 is based on an annual net income of $2,400.\nThe contention of the appellant is that in 1921 its business at Glace Bay was conducted at a loss. The accountant states that its total deficit was $25,938.86, but although he charges to expenses interest on deposits amounting to $22,206.63, he admits of no revenue from a sum exceeding $700,000 deposited with the bank and which he says was used and controlled by the head office.\nIn the admissions signed by the solicitors of both parties it is however stated that the average daily deposits of the bank at Glace Bay during 1921, exceeded the average daily loans and money required for operating expenses by approximately $726,200 and that this surplus of deposits was transferred to the head office of the bank at Montreal; that the head office credited the Glace Bay branch in its annual return known as \"the value of the branch return\" with interest at 4 per cent on the sum so transferred, viz., approximately $29,000 for the year 1921. The accountant of the branch in his testimony said that the head office borrowed this surplus of deposits from the branch office.\nIt appears to me that when the branch bank charged in its expenses $22,206.63 for interest on deposits it should have treated as revenue the 4 per cent credited to it by the head office. The latter invested, no doubt at profit, the amount it thus borrowed from the branch office, and its credit of 4 per cent shews that it considered that this percentage represented the share of the branch in this profit. Adding $29,000 to the receipts of the branch office would more than justify the rating of $12,000 complained of.\nIn view of the admissions of the parties I think the cases cited by Mr. Jenks are without application. It is also unnecessary to determine under these circumstances whether the confirmation by the legislature, by chapter 5 of the Acts of 1922 of the assessment rolls of the year took away the appellant's right to complain of the assessment.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs, but would modify the judgment appealed from by striking out the provision for a reference back to the County Court judge. I find in the record all the evidence necessary to sustain the assessment which should therefore be confirmed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Colin Mackenzie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

Act s. 92 (2)\u201412 Geo. V, c. 3 (N.B.), Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act.\nBy section 3 of the Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act of New Brunswick (12 Geo. V, c. 3), every person who has liquor for export from the province shall pay to the Crown a tax thereon at a specified rate and, by section 4, within a specified time ; by section 6 in default of payment the amount of the tax may be levied by distress under a warrant signed by the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer, or (section 7) the Secretary-Treasurer may bring an action to recover it; and section 9 authorizes the Lieutenant-Governor in. Council to make regulations for, inter alia, \"the fixing and determining of the amount of the said tax.\" In a case of distress under these provisions it was not shown how the amount had been determined.\nHeld, Anglin and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that the act of the Secretary-Treasurer in signing the warrant is judicial and not ministerial merely and that certiorari will lie to bring the proceedings before the Supreme Court of the province for review.\nHeld also, Anglin and Mignault JJ. expressing no opinion, that the imposition of a tax on liquor kept for export is indirect taxation and ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick quashing a writ of certiorari obtained by the appellant to have the proceedings on distress of its goods reviewed.\nTwo questions were raised on the appeal, namely, whether or not certiorari lies under the circumstances set out in the head-note and secondly, whether or not the Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act of New Brunswick was intra vires of the legislature of the province. The Appeal Division held that certiorari does not lie in such a case which made unnecessary any decision, as to the validity of the Act. Geoffrion K.C. and Fred. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant. The Secretary-Treasurer in signing the distress warrant performs a judicial act.\nFor the contrary proposition the respondent and Mr. Justice White in the Appeal Division rely on Ex parte Taunton[1]. That case merely decides that the issuing of a distress warrant under 43 Eliz., c. 2, is a ministerial act but is no authority on its issue under other conditions. A much earlier case Harper v. Carr[2], not referred to in Ex parte Taunton1, was such a case. There the issue of the warrant was held to be judicial.\nIn Painter v. Liverpool Gas Light Co.[3] the issue of a warrant without first hearing the parties was held to be illegal. This is one test of the ministerial or judicial character of the act. Another test is given in Staverton v. Ashburton[4] where Wightman J. said: \"Were not the justices under the statute 43 Eliz., c. 2, entitled to withhold their assent if they thought fit? That is the test as to whether the act is ministerial or judicial.\" This test was adopted by Allen C.J. in The Queen v. Simpson[5] at page 474.\nThe modern judicial tendency is towards giving to the term \"judicial act\" a very broad scope \"including many acts that would not ordinarily be termed judicial.\" Per Fletcher-Moulton L.J. in Rex v. Woodhouse[6].\nThe tax on liquor held for export is indirect taxation and the act imposing it is ultra vires. See Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[7] ; Attorney General for Quebec v. Queen Ins. Co.[8].\nByrne K.C., Attorney-General of New Brunswick for the respondent. The court below in quashing the writ exercised a discretion which should not be interfered with on appeal. Moreover the judgment appealed from is not final and this court has no jurisdiction. Faucher v. Compagnie du St. Louis[9]. As to the character of the Provincial Secretary's act we rely on the opinion of Mr. Justice White. And see also The Queen v. Shurman[10].\nThe validity of the Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act in question in proceedings is pending in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nGeoffrion K.C. and Fred. R. Taylor K.C. for the appellant.\nByrne K.C., Attorney-General of New Brunswick for the respondent.\nIdington J.\u2014The Chief Justice of the province of New Brunswick granted, on the application of the appellant, on the 31st of August last, an order absolute for the issue of a writ of certiorari directed to the respondent, and a rule nisi to quash a distress warrant which he had, in his quality of Provincial Secretary-Treasurer pretending to act under the Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act, being 12 Geo. V, c. 3 of the said province, issued against the goods of appellant directing the sheriff of the city and county of St. John, in said province, to levy thereon the sum of $62,042.\nThe return of the said respondent to the said writ was as follows:\u2014\nI, J. E. Hetherington, Provincial Secretary-Treasurer of the province of New Brunswick, do hereby certify that before the coming of the writ of our said Lord the King to me directed and to this schedule annexed, I did, as Provincial Secretary-Treasurer of the province of New Brunswick, on the 10th day of August, A.D. 1922, sign and issue a distress warrant, and on the 12th day of August, A.D. 1922, deliver the said distress warrant to Amon A. Wilson, Esq., which distress warrant is in the words and figures following:\n\"Amon A. Wilson, Esq.,\nHigh Sheriff of the city and county of St. John.\nSir: Under and by virtue of section 6 of the Act of Assembly 12 George V, chapter 3, cited as \"The Liquor Exporters Taxation Act,\" default having been made by the Security Export Company, Limited, of the tax imposed upon it by the said act within the time limited for payment. Therefore, I do hereby authorize and require you the said Sheriff to distrain the goods and chattels of the Security Export Company, Limited, wherever found within the province of New Brunswick and levy by distress upon the goods and chattels of the said Security Export Company, Limited, the sum of sixty-two thousand and forty-two dollars, being the amount of the tax due to the Crown for use of His Majesty in right of the province of New Brunswick by the said Security Export Company, Limited, upon forty-nine thousand six hundred and forty-two gallons of liquor, which the said Security Export Company, Limited, owns, now has, keeps or has property rights in, within the province of New Brunswick for export to a place outside of the province of New Brunswick, and you the said Sheriff shall levy the said sum of sixty-two thousand and forty-two dollars aforesaid and all costs of sale of the goods and chattels of the said Security Export Company, Limited, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the said tax and the costs of the said distress.\nDated this 10th day of August, A.D. 1922.\nJ. E. HETHERINGTON,\nProvincial Secretary-Treasurer, of the province of New Brunswick.\"\nThat the said warrant of distress is now, I verily believe, in the possession of the said Amos A. Wilson, Esq., High Sheriff of the city and county of St. John, aforesaid, and was so in his possession at the time of the receipt of the said writ by me, and I have not now, nor did I have at the time, nor at any time since the receipt of the said writ, the said distress warrant in my custody or keeping.\nAnd this is my return to the said writ.\nDated this 9th day of September, A.D. 1922.\nJ. E. HETHERINGTON,\nProvincial Secretary-Treasurer of the province of New Brunswick.\nThe said writ was granted by the said Chief Justice upon the following grounds:\u2014\n1. That the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer has no jurisdiction to issue the distress warrant or execution whereon the levy was made on the goods of the Security Export Company, Limited.\n2. That the Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act is ultra vires of the Legislature of the province of New Brunswick and in violation of the British North America Act.\n3. That the document in this case purporting to be a distress warrant is irregular in that it is not a formal warrant directing the Sheriff to levy the said tax with costs, but merely a letter of direction to the Sheriff to levy the said tax.\nThe appellant being, as seems to be admitted, lawfully engaged in the export of liquor, in course of such business stored in the King's bonded warehouse in St. John about 49,642 gallons of liquor for export to places outside the said province, upon which said Sheriff, on the 14th of August, 1922, levied by virtue of the said distress warrant.\nThe Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick having heard the questions raised upon the return of said rule nisi according to the practice provided by the Judicature Act, 1909, and order 62 thereunder, discharged said rule nisi, holding that the act of respondent in issuing said warrant was a mere ministerial act and in no sense a judicial act.\nThe court in so holding seems to rely upon section 9 of the said Act, which provides as follows:\u2014 9. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council may, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, and in so far as it is within the jurisdiction of the province so to do, make regulations, and the same repeal and amend from time to time, regarding the premises and kind of premises in which liquor shall be kept for export purposes, inspection of the said premises and the liquor kept therein, the kind and quality of liquor so kept, the marking and labelling of packages for exportation, the fixing and determining of the amount of the said tax, the cost to be allowed to the Sheriff executing any warrant of distress, the providing for the registration of all persons, firms, associations, companies and corporations carrying on a liquor export business or having liquor stored for export, and the returns to be made by them or their agents of liquor received, sold, exported and on hand, and generally all such matters and things incidental to or in any way connected with the liquor export business and the method and manner of conducting the same.\n(1) Such regulations, or such parts thereof as the Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall determine, shall be published in the Royal Gazette, and, when so published, shall have the same force and effect as if incorporated as provisions of this Act, and the violation of or failure to comply with any such regulations shall constitute an offence and subject the offender thereof to the penalty hereinafter mentioned.\nCounsel for appellant herein in the course of his argument produced a copy of the publication of such regulations; stated that same were published in the local Royal Gazette of the 7th of June, 1922, and that no others ever had been published; and submitted, as I think correctly, that the court could take judicial notice thereof.\nThe Attorney-General for New Brunswick, who appeared as counsel for respondent herein, neither pretended to deny said statements nor to challenge said submission.\nHe suggested mildly that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council could legally alter same from time to time as to each parcel of goods happening to come into store for exportation, and vary the tax as advised, without publication in the Royal Gazette.\nI cannot assent thereto as a correct interpretation and construction of the Act, or of said section.\nOn the contrary I hold that until publication in the Royal Gazette such changes of regulations could have no legal effect.\nI have taken the liberty of reading the said publication therein and cannot find, either that it changes the rate of taxation, or pretends to assign to any one the determination of the amount due by any exporter in respect thereof. It provides for the appointments of an inspector and assistant to give certain receipts and in many ways check exporters thereby from infringing the law. In course thereof he is to keep books and do many things, but, not in a single sentence nor altogether, is he assigned the duty of declaring anything due upon or in request of which a warrant of distress may be issued.\nThe fair inference to be drawn from sections 4, 6 and 7, which read as follows,\u2014\n4. The tax imposed by this Act in respect of all liquor had or kept as aforesaid at the time of the passing of this Act shall be paid to the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer within one month from the date at which said Act shall come into force, and on all liquor subsequently acquired, kept, sold or shipped as aforesaid, said tax shall be paid to the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer within fifteen days from the date when such liquor is acquired, kept, sold or shipped.\n6. In default of payment within the time limited of any tax by this Act imposed, the same may be levied, with costs, by distress upon the goods and chattels, wherever found, of the person, firm, association, company or corporation liable therefor, under a warrant signed by the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer, directed to the Sheriff of any county, and the sheriff to whom the same is directed shall levy the tax and all costs, by sale of the goods and chattels of the person, firm, association, company or corporation in default, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the tax and the costs of said distress.\n7. Any tax imposed by this Act may, at the option of the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer, be recovered by and in the name of the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer, by action in any court of competent jurisdiction,\ncoupled with the preamble reciting that the purpose of the Act was to assign to a department of the Government the control of liquor export business, is that the respondent, or he filling that office which he then filled, should decide and determine what the amount demanded should be, and, incidentally thereto, should decide when to issue a warrant of distress. In course of doing so he certainly would require to have the evidence before him to enable him to so determine and ought to act judicially in regard thereto, and he has not pretended, in his reply, above quoted, aught else, or that any one else had so decided or had the duty to decide. I infer that he might use the inspector's books and other material, as well as the bank account of his own department and record of his receipts thereby, as proper means of determining what was due from any exporter. Evidently the respondent's was the department to which the control as recited was intended to be assigned. I am for these reasons, as well as from the bare act of deciding the truth of what is recited by him in the warrant, of the opinion that he was not in what he did or should have done, limited to discharging mere ministerial functions.\nI therefore cannot agree with the court below in holding otherwise.\nAfter reading many of the cases cited in argument and many more, I am inclined to agree with Mr. Justice White that it is almost impossible to reconcile all the cases in question, but much of the apparent conflict is due to many changes in the law governing certiorari.\nAnd much, of all that, is cleared up by the reasoning in the modern cases to which I will presently refer, or cite.\nMeantime I may point out that the learned justice speaking for the court seems to rest the decision of the court now appealed from, almost entirely upon the authority of the case of Ex parte Taunton[11], arising out of and resting upon what 43 Elizabeth, c. 2, section 4, provided for in regard to two Justices of the Peace issuing a distress warrant to levy the amount assessed and declared due, by the mode described in a full and amply detailed manner in previous sections of the Act.\nJudgment had thereby been definitely declared and the amount due clearly ascertained. How that furnishes any analogy for what we have herein to deal with, I respectfully submit, passes my understanding. At best it was the decision of a judge in the Practice Court. Here we have no such declaration of any finding of the amount due except in this warrant of distress issued by the respondent and presumably determined by him on such material as he was ex parte furnished with. It seemingly combines judgment and warrant of distress in one document.\nIt seems rather an irregular method but that is what is complained of.\nThe case of The Overseers of Staverton v. The Overseers of Ashburton[12], is also referred to by Mr. Justice White, as if it turned upon the same section of said Act of Elizabeth, which it does not, as Ex parte Taunton11. Instead it turned upon section 5, which deals with an entirely different subject matter, relative to the question of apprenticeship. The judgment therein is, however, very valuable for our purpose, inasmuch as it has to deal with the distinctions between what is the discharge of a judicial duty and a ministerial duty.\nIt was attempted therein in appeal to uphold the judgment of a court appealed from that the mere assent of two justices was a ministerial act and could not be held or called the discharge of a judicial duty.\nThe contention there seemed quite as plausible as that which respondent herein so successfully set up below. It was overruled therein and the court appealed from reversed and seems to point our duty to do likewise herein.\nIt also upheld the decision in the case of The King v. Hamstall Ridware[13], which had turned upon a like narrow distinction between what was a judicial, though contended to have been only a ministerial duty.\nThe counsel for appellant calls attention to the following note on page 21 of Paley on Summary Convictions, 8th ed.,\nIn general the issuing of a warrant of distress or commitment is a judicial act as the party against whom it is sought should have an opportunity of showing that he has obeyed the order or conviction which the warrant is intended to enforce.\nOf those cited by Paley counsel for appellant selects Rex v. Benn[14] ; Harper v. Can[15] ; Painter v. Liverpool Gas Co.[16], and Hammond v. Bendy she[17].\nNumerous others are cited by Paley in said note but none, though distinguishing many from those just cited, which seem to help respondent herein.\nThe cases cited by either side herein have all been fully considered save a number of American decisions and others that would not bind us. I find that the American cases cited for the most part rest on local statutes.\nThe sole question that has given me most trouble was that which the court below proceeded upon. And upon that the only case respondent's counsel cites which, if still law, could bind us, is the case of Reg. v. Sharman; Ex parte Denton[18], which as counsel for appellant points out, was expressly overruled by The King v. Woodhouse[19]. And I find that this latter was in turn reversed by the House of Lords in Leeds Corporation v. Ryder[20]. What is the result in neat law? I find much to interest as well as help in the reasoning of many judges, but nothing decisive of the case in hand.\nI am quite satisfied on the foregoing cases and many others I have looked at that the act of the respondent was judicial and not ministerial and that certiorari would lie herein.\nAs an illustration of how wide the range of the authority of the court given the jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari extends, I may refer to the case of Reg. v. Coles[21].\nCounsel for respondent argued that this writ of certiorari in question herein was against the Crown.\nI fail to see how on the facts I have dealt with.\nIt certainly is against a servant of the Crown and so is every other directed to a justice of the peace, or to the Quarter Sessions, or any other inferior jurisdiction.\nThe Attorney-General on behalf of the respondent seemed to hint or suggest that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council in fact had directed all that was done herein.\nI hope not. But if so, such fact was not proven or relied on in any way in the return made by the respondent, who responded as if he and his department were in control as much as any justice of the peace or other officer subject to the supervision of the court having the powers implied in its power to issue a writ of certiorari.\nI come now to the question of the validity of the legislation.\nThe Provincial Legislature, according to my reading of the British North America Act, never had the power to impose either import or export duties except under and by virtue of a special reservation relative to timber and lumber, provided for by section 124 of the Act in favour of New Brunswick. That demonstrates how completely all concerned in framing the Act looked upon other export duties as without foundation, within the B.N.A. Act.\nThe exceptional privilege was cancelled by an agreement between New Brunswick and the Dominion at a price of $150,000 a year, as evidenced by the Dominion Statute 36 Vict., c. 41.\nIn the Attorney General's factum herein for respondent he makes no allusion to the contention set up, as the second of the grounds upon which the Chief Justice had ordered the issue of the writ and rule nisi, namely the invalidity of the said legislation in question herein by reason of its being ultra vires.\nYet he sets up as a reason in said factum that there is some other litigation pending which would decide the question of ultra vires.\nNumerous cases can be found where parties have exhibited the like perversity of pursuing two different paths to find the law, when the shortest would have sufficed.\nSometimes the pursuer of both remedies found one had been taken away by legislation, but in other cases he found both had been left open, and that is so in this case, because the legislature failed to take away the writ of certiorari, though evidently quite willing to go very far.\nThe appellant's counsel relies upon our decision in Martinello v. McCormick[22], which, if we had in this record evidence of what is meant by the King's shop, where the liquor was stored, might in itself be conclusive against respondent.\nMany other reasons might be assigned to shew how completely ultra vires this legislation is which seems to be quite regardless of the limits of power existent in the legislature.\nI am of the opinion that this appeal should succeed and the appeal be allowed with costs here and in the Appeal Division below; the warrant quashed, and the course made clear, according to local practice, for pursuing any other remedies those concerned have resorted to or may desire to pursue. There is some question raised in my mind as to the effect of recent legislation taking away the right of appeal in cases of certiorari and making the amount involved the only test unless where leave of appeal given.\nHaving considered the question and seeing no point made of it by respondent, I conclude that, the amount involved far exceeding the $2,000 limit, the appeal lies.\nNo leave to appeal here appears in the record and I assume therefore no leave asked for.\nDuff J.\u2014The statute under which the Secretary-Treasurer proceeded is entitled \"The Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act,\" and the relevant enactments provide that (section 3) any person\nwho now has or keeps or has property rights in * * * liquors for export to any place outside the said province or who in the said province sells or ships liquors to be delivered at any place outside the said province\nshall pay to the Crown a specified tax, calculated according to the quantity of liquor\nnow or hereafter had or kept within the province * * * or sold or shipped * * * for delivery outside\nof the province; (section 4),\nthe tax * * * in respect of all liquor had or kept * * * at the time of the passing of this Act shall be paid * * * within one month\nfrom the coming in force of the Act,\nand on all liquor subsequently acquired, kept, sold or shipped as aforesaid\nwithin fifteen days\nfrom the date when such liquor is acquired, kept, sold or shipped ;\nthe tax is to be a first lien and charge upon all the property in the province of any person liable to pay it; and by section 6, in default of payment within the time limited, the tax may be levied by distress upon the goods of the person liable\nunder a warrant signed by the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer, directed to the Sheriff of any county, and the Sheriff * * * shall levy the tax and all costs by sale of the goods * * * of the person in default.\nI think it is quite clear that there is no duty and no authority to adjudicate in the sense of giving a binding decision as to the conditions under which the statute authorizes the issue of a warrant.\nThe general rule touching the office of the writ of certiorari is usually expressed by saying that it lies to remove acts of inferior courts and judicial acts of bodies possessing statutory jurisdiction, but it does not lie to remove acts which are merely ministerial. Obviously the application of the rule turns upon the scope of the words \"judicial\" and \"ministerial.\" In applying the rule in particular cases, some judges have found the criteria of removability by developing the scope of \"judicial\" used in this sense, and others by considering the scope of \"ministerial.\" What is \"judicial\" is not, for the purposes of the rule, \"ministerial\"; what is \"ministerial\" is not, for the purposes of the rule, \"judicial.\"\nAs White J., who delivered the judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal, observes, it is, perhaps, impossible to reconcile all the cases, but fortunately the subject has been discussed in modern times in judgments which have illuminated it, from which, I think, a criterion may be adduced which is sufficient to determine the question arising on this appeal.\nIn a case of prohibition Reg. v. Local Government Board[23], Brett L.J. (Lord Esher) said:\nWhenever the legislature entrusts to any body of persons, other than the Superior Courts, the power of imposing an obligation on individuals, the courts ought to exercise as widely as they can the power of controlling those bodies of persons, if those persons admittedly attempt to exercise powers beyond the powers given to them by Act of Parliament.\nAnd May C.J., said, in The Queen v. Corporation of Dublin[24] :\nFor the purpose of this question, a judicial act seems to be an act done by competent authority upon consideration of facts and circumstances, and imposing liability or affecting the rights of others.\nThe judgment containing the most valuable exposition of the subject is that of Fletcher Moulton L.J., (as he then was) in Rex v. Woodhouse[25]. The Lord Justice there points out that while certiorari is often said to be applicable only to \"judicial acts,\" the cases by which this limitation is supposed to be established shew that the words \"judicial act\" must be taken in a very wide sense, including many acts that would not ordinarily be termed \"judicial,\" and his conclusion is this: The true view of the limitation would seem to be that the term \"judicial act\" is used in contrast with purely ministerial acts * * * in short, there must be the exercise of some right or duty to decide in order to provide scope for a writ of certiorari at common law.\nThere is no conflict, I think, between this modern statement of the rule and that cited by Mr. Taylor from Rex v. Glamorganshire[26]:\nThis court will examine the proceedings of all jurisdictions erected by Act of Parliament and if they under pretence of such Act proceed to encroach jurisdiction to themselves greater than the Act warrants, this court will send a certiorari to them to have their proceedings returned here to the end that this court may see that they keep themselves within their jurisdiction and if they exceed it to restrain them, and the examination of such matters is more proper for this court.\nMy conclusion is that the issuing of a warrant of distress by the Secretary-Treasurer in exercise of the authority given by the Act or in assumed exercise of such authority is not an act which can be described as merely ministerial. Assuming the conditions of authority to be fulfilled, he has the right and duty to decide, and the statute leaves it to his discretion, whether taxes shall be collected by means of distress or not, and the effect of his decision, the formal expression of which is the issue of the warrant, is that, always assuming the conditions of authority to exist, the person liable to pay the tax becomes subject to the additional liability to have his goods distrained and sold for the payment of what is due without previous judicial ascertainment of it. He is no mere passive instrument of the law. The liability to distress is a liability resulting from the determination of the Secretary-Treasurer that a distress warrant shall issue.\nA question which will require discussion, namely, whether there is anything in the statute itself, in the terms in which the authority is given, in the special nature of the subject matter with which the statute deals, showing that the authority given the Secretary-Treasurer ought not to be regarded as judicial for our present purpose, may conveniently be postponed for a brief examination of the grounds on which the court below proceeded in holding that the warrant of the Secretary-Treasurer is not removable by certiorari. The Appeal Division followed the previous decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in The Queen v. Simpson[27], in which a County Treasurer's warrant for the collection of taxes was under consideration, which proceeded largely on the authority of the decision in Ex parte Taunton[28], in which it was held that a warrant issued by justices for the collection of a poor-rate under the statute of Elizabeth was not removable. Ex parte Taunton28 has never been expressly overruled, and no case has been referred to in which such a warrant has been held to be removable, and, moreover, no decision was cited that is necessarily inconsistent with it; and I have been unable to find any such decision prior, at least, to the year 1910. There are, moreover, decisions and weighty dicta which lend it support. In The Queen v. Webber[29], Ridley J., and Darling J., both express the opinion that the distress warrant in question in that case was a merely ministerial act. The passage cited above from the judgment of May C.J., is preceded by this sentence:\nIt is established that the writ of certiorari does not lie to remove an order merely ministerial, such as a warrant.\nThis judgment of May C.J., had the approval of Lord Fitzgerald at the time, and the sentence I have just quoted, together with the passage quoted before, are reproduced with approval in the judgment of Palles C.B. in Reg. v. Local Government Board the Wexford Case[30], which had the concurrence of Walker L.J., and Holmes L.J.; and Fletcher Moulton L.J., at p. 535 of the judgment already referred to, observes that\nthe process of certiorari does not apply * * * to the issue of a warrant to enforce a poor-rate.\nAn early case, Rex v. Lediard[31], in which a warrant issued under the authority of statute was held not to be removable, on the ground that the issuing of it was a ministerial act merely, was followed in a subsequent case, Rex v. Lloyd[32]. Mr. Taylor vigorously assailed the judgment in Ex parte Taunton[33], but I do not think it is necessary to decide, for the purposes of this appeal, whether or not the question, if it had arisen in more recent times as touching a warrant for collection of a poor-rate, would have been the same. What we are really concerned about is whether or not the decision in Ex parte Taunton33 and other cognate decisions and the dicta to which I have referred furnish any rule or principle for our guidance in relation to the question now before us.\nThere is a most important distinction between the act of magistrates in issuing a warrant for the collection of a poor-rate and the act of the Secretary-Treasurer in issuing a warrant for the collection of the liquor tax. The jurisdiction of justices in proceedings for the recovery of a poor-rate under the Act of Elizabeth was a very peculiar one. It is quite true that it was the duty of the justices not to issue a warrant without calling upon the party whose goods it was proposed to distrain to shew cause against it; that is decided in a number of cases cited by Mr. Taylor, most of which will be found at pp. 21-22 of Paley's Summary Convictions. It is sufficient to refer to two of them: Rex v. Benn[34]; Harper v. Carr[35]. But while it was the duty of the justices to hear what the party affected had to say for the purpose of shewing that the rate was not a valid rate, as, for example, that though rated as an occupier, he was not an occupier, or that the land was outside the territorial jurisdiction of the rating authority, or that he was not liable to pay because he had already paid, the decision of the justices upon these points, as Parke B., points out in Newbould v. Coltman[36], was not a judicial decision, the inquiry into these matters not being a judicial inquiry, in the sense that their decision upon it was binding upon anybody and a party whose goods were distrained being consequently entitled afterwards to raise in an action the very matters which he had brought before the justices in answer to the summons, if it appeared either that the rate was an invalid rate or that the plaintiff was not liable to pay. Another striking feature of this proceeding was that if it appeared that the magistrates had jurisdiction, mandamus would lie to compel them to issue the warrant. The Queen v. Bradshaw[37] ; Church Wardens of Birmingham v. Shaw[38]; Reg. v. Marsham[39]. In Bradshaw's Case (1) and Marsham's Case (3) it was laid down in terms that the duty of the magistrates, their jurisdiction being unquestioned, was purely ministerial and having regard to the practice and the course of decision it is indisputable that, assuming the conditions of authority to exist, the magistrates in issuing such a warrant had no discretion, had no authority or duty to decide, and were mere passive instruments of the law; while any inquiry they might make as to the conditions of authority was not a judicial inquiry, and any conclusion they might reach had not the conclusive quality which is the attribute of a judicial decision. There is, indeed, a decision of a Divisional Court in the year 1910 (Lord Alverstone L.C.J., Channel and Coleridge JJ.) which suggests that the modern tendency is to regard as judicial for the relevant purpose the issue of such a warrant on the ground, perhaps, that the duty of the magistrates to inquire into the question of non-payment of the rate, for example, is a circumstance which marks the proceeding a judicial one. In the case referred to, The King v. Doherty[40], the application was to remove a warrant of commitment under a conviction which had adjudged that the defendant should be committed in default of payment of a fine, arid in default of sufficient distress the fine, unknown to the defendant, had in fact been paid, and that circumstance not having been brought to the attention of the magistrate, a warrant of commitment had issued. The warrant was removed and quashed, Lord Alverstone observing,\nit is now too late for this court to hold that a warrant of commitment is not a judicial act.\nIt would not be easy to distinguish between a warrant of commitment under this conviction and a warrant of distress under the same conviction; nor, perhaps, is it easy to find a distinction between such a warrant of distress and a warrant of distress to enforce a poor-rate. The judgment illustrates, I think, a modern tendency to enlarge the scope of certiorari. See the observations of Vaughan Williams L.J., in Reg. v. Nicholson[41].\nIt is useful, I think, to contrast the act of magistrates issuing a warrant for the collection of a poor-rate and the act of magistrates in assenting to the indenture of pauper apprentices under the Statute of Elizabeth. In Staver v. Ashburton[42] this latter act was held to be a judicial act. Wightman J., in the course of the argument, suggested that the true test for distinguishing between judicial acts and merely ministerial acts was to be found in the answer to the inquiry whether or not mandamus would lie. If the magistrates, assuming, of course, the conditions of their authority to exist, were entitled to withhold their hand or to act in their discretion, then mandamus would not lie, and the act would not be said to be ministerial merely.\nThese considerations convince me that Ex parte Taunton[43] and decisions like it do not afford a satisfactory guide for passing upon the point now before us. But another important question remains, and that is whether the act of the Secretary-Treasurer is an act which for the want of a better term I shall describe as \"administrative\" and outside the scope of certiorari. The authority given by the Act is not an authority conferred upon the Crown; it is given to the Secretary-Treasurer by his title of office, and, moreover, when the tax is sued for the action is to be brought in the name of the Secretary-Treasurer. I think it is clear that the Secretary-Treasurer acts in exercise of an authority given to him as Secretary-Treasurer by the statute. There are two decisions to which I think reference should be made in this connection. The first is the case of Degge v. Hitchcock[44], a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The question was whether certiorari would lie to bring up a \"fraud order\" made by the Postmaster General in effect prohibiting the persons against whom it was directed from using the mails. It was held that this order was not removable on two grounds: first, that as regards the conditions of the Postmaster General's authority or any suggestion of arbitrary and therefore unauthorized exercise of statutory power, no decision of the Postmaster General on such points could be conclusive, and that the parties affected might resort to equitable process for the purpose of correcting any excess of jurisdiction or abuse of authority, and assuming jurisdiction to exist, the authority of the Postmaster General was held primarily intended to be exercised for the protection of the public, and therefore falling within a class of acts in exercise of governmental functions which under the description \"administrative\" had been held to be outside the scope of the remedy invoked. The other case is a decision of the High Court of Australia in The King v. Arndel[45]. The question arose there in relation to an order made by the Postmaster General similar to that which came before the Supreme Court of the United States eight years later in the case just referred to. The opinion which prevailed as expressed in the judgment of Griffith C.J., at page 572, was that the order was not judicial in its character because, having regard to the nature of the subject with which the legislature was dealing and to the terms in which the authority was conferred, he drew the inference that the legislature contemplated the exercise of a duty in circumstances of emergency, and consequently without notice to the parties who might be affected. He drew the conclusion from this that the authority given by the statute could not consistently with the terms and the object of the statute be treated as \"judicial\" for the purpose of certiorari proceedings.\nIt is not without interest to observe, as appears from the report of Degge v. Hitchcock[46], that in exercising a jurisdiction of the same type the Postmaster General of the United States would be amenable to restraint by equitable process for arbitrary exercise of his jurisdiction and that, in fact, the practice in respect of such orders in the United States appears to be that they are only made there after an investigation in which the parties affected are heard.\nI have considered it right to refer to these decisions, but the analogy between the questions presented for decision in these cases and the questions now before us is not sufficiently close to enable us to derive much instruction from them. There is a wide difference between the authority of the Postmaster General to regulate the business of his department by orders made for the protection of the public against fraud and immorality and the jurisdiction of the head of a department to collect a debt due to the Crown by summary process in the absence of any judicial determination of liability. Administrative the act is, perhaps, in some sense, but its predominant characteristic is that it is an extraordinary remedy for the collection of a civil debt. Urgent, no doubt, this summary process might be in an easily conceivable emergency, but I am by no means prepared to hold that under the authority of this statute the Secretary-Treasurer is entitled to disregard the principle which was held to govern magistrates in issuing a warrant under the statute of Elizabeth and to require them first to give the person affected an opportunity to question his liability.\nThe statute cannot contemplate the issue of the warrant without inquiry by the Secretary-Treasurer into the facts; an inquiry which, though not judicial in the sense that his decision is binding, is judicial in the sense that it aims at ascertaining the facts with a view to a possible proceeding in the nature of an execution, the issue of which execution rests in his discretion. Even assuming the facts ascertained by the Secretary-Treasurer in such a manner as to establish to his own satisfaction the existence of authority he might well in any given case conceive it to be his duty, in view of possible dispute, not to proceed breve manu.\nOn the merits, the question to be dealt with is whether the legislation in question, the Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act, is an enactment which the province had authority to pass in execution of its power to legislate in relation to the subject of \"direct taxation within the province\" under item (2) of section 92. The statute professes to impose a tax on everybody who has in the province liquor for export and upon everybody in the province who sells or ships liquor to be delivered at any place outside the province.\nIt is perhaps worth while to emphasize the point that the sole question we have to consider is whether the legislation can be supported as legislation under item (2), and if it properly falls within item (2) then it is clearly within the power of the province to enact. There is here no ground for suggesting, as was held in Wharton's case, that under the guise of imposing a tax for the purpose of raising a revenue the province is really attempting to enact legislation upon a subject outside of its legislative jurisdiction\u2014the regulation of trade and commerce, for example. There is not the slightest ground for suggesting that the statute is anything other than it professes to be, namely, a taxing statute, a statute passed with the object of raising a revenue for the public purposes of the province by imposing duties upon the export of liquor and upon the sale of liquor for export.\nIt seems very clear, however, that the tax imposed is one which cannot be brought within the category of \"direct taxation.\" Postponing for a moment any reference to the decisions upon the construction of this phrase as used in the British North America Act, it may be well to note that so far as one is aware there is no principle of classification of taxes as \"direct\" and \"indirect\" that has found acceptance among economists or practical financiers according to which such a tax as that in question would not fall within the class of indirect taxes. A tax on commodities, such as a customs duty, an excise duty, is mentioned by Mill as a typical indirect tax. In the Oxford Dictionary one finds the statement that a direct tax is\none levied immediately upon the persons who are to bear the burden, as opposed to indirect taxes levied upon commodities, of which the price is thereby increased so that the persons on whom the incidence ultimately falls pay indirectly a proportion of taxation included in the price of the article.\nThe principle of distinction adopted, according to Professor Bastable, by \"practical financiers,\" which regards those taxes as direct that are levied on \"permanent and recurrent occasions\" and those as indirect which are levied upon \"occasional and particular events\" would equally exclude this tax from the class of direct taxes. If, therefore, the question now arose for the first time one must, I think, have been driven to the conclusion that whether the phrase \"direct taxation\" was to be read according to the sense which would be ascribed to the words by economists or by practical financiers or in popular use, the tax under discussion does not fall within it.\nThe phrase \"direct taxation\" has, however, received a construction in a series of cases beginning with The Attorney General v. The Queen Ins. Co.[47], and coming down to Alleyn v. Barthe[48], and in effect it has been authoritatively held that the definition of \"direct tax\" given by John Stuart Mill as one which \"is demanded from the very person who it is intended or desired should pay it,\" is to be taken as giving the sense in which the words are used in the B.N.A. Act because, to quote the judgment of Lord Hodhouse in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[49], this definition has appeared to the judges who have been called upon to construe the words\nto embody with sufficient accuracy * * * an understanding of the most obvious indicia of direct and indirect taxation which is a common understanding, and is likely to have been present in the minds of those who passed the Federation Act.\nIt was urged before us with a good deal of vigour by the Attorney General of New Brunswick that the legislature of New Brunswick was concerned only with the persons on whom the tax was levied; and indeed that the problem of determining the incidence of such a tax is one involved in so much obscurity that it cannot be assumed that the legislature acted upon any view of it, or with any view other than that of collecting the tax from the persons who by the statute are made liable to pay it.\nI think it may well be doubted whether the legislature of New Brunswick was in the least concerned with the point of the ultimate incidence of the tax, but this is by no means conclusive and is of little if any relevancy to the question now raised before this court, whether or not the legislature had legislative authority to create the tax. For the purpose of applying the definition of Mill in order to decide questions arising under item (2) of section 92, one must assume that the legislature imposing the tax contemplates the normal effect of such a tax imposed in the existing circumstances, and the question one must ask oneself is whether, in view of the normal effect and tendency of a given tax, it may be affirmed that the tax is demanded from the very persons who are ultimately to bear the burden of it. Normally, every addition to the cost of supply inevitably tends to increase the supply price\u2014the price that is to say, which is sufficient to call forth the exertions necessary for producing the given quantity\u2014and thus has a tendency to raise the market price. If the market price falls below this point permanently, then the given source of supply will inevitably be cut off. For the purpose of determining the cost of supply from a given source, there is no difference between the case of manufacture, the cost of transport, or a toll as a customs duty which must be paid in order to get the goods to market, and the seller who has to pay these things will require, if he can, the reimbursement of them in addition to his profit. No distinction of substance in this respect can be drawn between what is commonly known as a sales tax, a custom duty, an excise duty and the duties imposed by the statute now under consideration. The market price is a product of variable factors, and in particular circumstances may be such that goods are sold at a loss, but whether they are sold at a loss or at a profit, as a rule taxes on manufactured commodities which can be indefinitely reproduced enter into the factors determining the price at which the commodities are sold just as the cost of manufacture and the cost of transport do, and in the same degree.\nIt is therefore impossible to affirm that such a tax as this, which the taxpayer will certainly add to the price of his commodity if he can, is intended to be borne by the very persons from whom it is demanded.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The purpose of these proceedings was to bring before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick a distress warrant issued by the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer under section 6 of \"The Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act\" of that province (1922, c. 3). This warrant was directed to the sheriff of the City and County of St. John to levy the amount of a tax imposed by section 3 of that statute on the appellant. The right to issue the warrant is challenged not because the terms of the statute did not authorize the imposition of the tax, nor because there is any question as to its amount, or as to the existence of the conditions on which liability to pay it arises under the statute (all these matters are covered by the provisions of subsections 3, 4, 8 and 9), nor because there had not been default in payment, but solely on the ground that the statute itself was ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature in that the tax thereby imposed is not \"direct taxation.\" While the Provincial Secretary must satisfy himself that the tax, in respect of which he proposes to issue his warrant, is due and that the person whose goods are to be distrained is in default, he is not empowered to adjudicate upon those matters. He is merely authorized to provide for the collection of a tax actually in arrear by means of a distress warrant\u2014and this is not without significance. Newbould v. Coltman[50].\nInasmuch as other means of effectually raising the question of the validity of the statute are available\u2014we were told that it is presently in issue in an action in the Chancery Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick brought by the present appellant for equitable relief, and the right so to raise it was not questioned\u2014and the act which it is sought to review is that of an executive officer of a provincial government (Rex v. Arndel[51]), I gravely doubt the propriety of resort being had to the extraordinary remedy of certiorari and am disposed to think the court below would have exercised a sound discretion had it set aside the writ accordingly. Degge v. Hitchcock[52].\nBut I am also of the opinion that the writ was properly set aside by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on the ground that the act of the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer in issuing a distress warrant under section 6 of the \"Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act\" was a purely ministerial and not a judicial act. No doubt the phrase \"judicial act\" must be taken in a very wide sense and includes many acts not ordinarily termed judicial and of bodies not ordinarily considered to be courts. But I do not regard the making out and delivery of a distress warrant which a statute provides may be issued upon default in making payment of a tax by it ordained as such an act. The case of the issuing of a warrant to enforce a poor rate is clearly analogous, and to that Fletcher-Moulton L.J., said in Rex v. Woodhouse[53] :\nthe process of certiorari does not apply * * * even though the rate is one which could itself be questioned by certiorari.\nThe issuing of such a warrant in the opinion of the Lord Justice is an instance of a \"purely ministerial act.\" Indeed it is given as a typical example of such acts in most of the authorities; Short and Mellor's Crown Practice (2 ed.), p. 42; 10 Hals. L. of E., p. 172. The issue of a warrant to the sheriff by the secretary of a county under section 86 of \"The Act Respecting Rates and Taxes\" (C.S.N.B., c. 170) to levy the amount of rates is a similar act. Another analogous act or series of acts is what occurs upon the signing of judgment and the issue of execution thereon by the clerk of a court under statutory provisions or rules of court authorizing him to do so upon default of appearance by the defendant to a writ of summons. In both these cases the default, including all the circumstances requisite to put the person against whom the process is to issue in mora, must be made to appear to the official by the prescribed proof. But his act is none the less simply ministerial. He is only required to satisfy himself that the conditions under which he is empowered to act have been shewn to exist. His conclusion that they do in fact exist binds nobody\nFor other instances in which the issue of process under circumstances not dissimilar has, on the ground that the act is simply ministerial, been held not to be a proper subject for certiorari reference may be made to Rex v. Lediard[54], cited with approval in Rex v. Pryse-Lloyd[55]; Ex parte Taunton[56] ; The Queen v. Overseers of Salford[57] ; Rex v. Marsham[58]; The Queen v. Webber[59]. The issue of a warrant of commitment for non-payment of a fine and costs has been regarded as an act of a different character involving the exercise of judicial functions; Rex v. Doherty[60].\nIt is urged that the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer acted judicially in issuing the distress warrant in question because the statute gives him an option to withhold it and to resort to an action to enforce payment of the overdue tax (section 7). But such an exercise of judgment and discretion did not give to his decision to issue the warrant a judicial character. The People ex rel. Corwin v. Walter[61]. It is the duty of the Provincial Secretary when satisfied that the tax is in arrear to take one or other of the means directed by the statute to recover it. The liability of the appellant was in no sense imposed by the Provincial Secretary's determination to issue the warrant; it arose under the statute. The existence of the right to issue the warrant no doubt depended upon a contingency and, as an executive officer, the Provincial Secretary had to determine whether or not the contingency had happened. But, notwithstanding the necessity for such determination, the exercise of the power remained a ministerial act. The Queen v. Dublin[62] ; Reg. (Wexford C.C.) v. Local Government Board[63] ; Rex v. Kerry County Council[64]. The Provincial Secretary's\ndetermination does not bind. The happening of the contingency may be questioned in an action brought to try the validity of the act done under the alleged exercise of the power. ([1902] 2 Ir. R. 374.)\nNor were the rights of the appellant affected by the action of the respondent per se. The only right involved in what he did was his own right as an executive officer of the Crown to choose as between the two remedies available under the statute; one or the other it was his duty to take. In making the choice he may have been influenced by considerations of policy and expediency to which effect quite properly would be given in discharging such an administrative duty, but which may not be fit grounds for judicial action. Having said that\ncertiorari is the process by which the High Court controls the exercise of jurisdiction by inferior courts. For our purpose \"judicial\" must include juridical, Fitzgibbon L.J.[65], after quoting the words of Brett L.J. in The Queen v. Local Government Board[66]\u2014an application for prohibition,\u2014\nwherever the legislature entrusts to any body of persons other than the Superior Courts the power of imposing an obligation upon individuals, the courts ought to exercise as widely as they can the power of controlling those bodies of persons if those persons admittedly attempt to exercise powers beyond the powers given them by Act of Parliament,\nand the definition of a \"judicial act\" given by May C.J. in the Dublin case (supra),\u2014\nan act done by a competent authority upon the consideration of facts and circumstances, and imposing liability or affecting the rights of others,\nproceeds:\nThese statements have been criticized but, as applied to the cases under consideration, I respectfully venture to say that they appear to me to be right. They were made in cases where the acts considered were done in the exercise, or assumed exercise, of judicial, as distinguished from any other authority. Ministerial and administrative acts may be done by courts as well as by others; they may involve consideration of facts and circumstances; they may impose liabilities and may effect rights ; and yet such acts may not be controlled by certiorari. Therefore, the statements which I have quoted must be confined to acts involving the exercise, or assumed exercise, of some jurisdiction.\nThere was in this case no exercise, or assumed exercise, of jurisdiction in the sense in which the Lord Justice uses that term.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that it was properly held by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick that the remedy of certiorari is not available and that this appeal should, accordingly, be dismissed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014A preliminary question has been raised as to whether the act of the Secretary-Treasurer of the province of New Brunswick, the Honourable Mr. Hetherington, in issuing the warrant of distress is purely ministerial and not judicial.\nThe court below held that he acted ministerially and that consequently the writ of certiorari does not lie.\nTo decide this question we have to consider the legislation passed by the legislature of New Brunswick in 1922 and called \"The Liquor Exporters' Taxation Act.\"\nBy this Act, section 3, a tax of $1.25 a gallon is imposed on a person or company having in the province liquors for export to any place outside the province. The tax has to be paid within a certain delay (section 4) ; and if there is default of payment within this delay, the tax may be levied by distress upon the goods of the person liable under a warrant signed by the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer directed to the sheriff (section 6), or the Secretary-Treasurer may at his option take an action in his name before a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount of the tax (section 7). By section 9 the Lieutenant-Governor in Council is authorized to make regulations as to the premises in which liquor shall be kept for export, as to its inspection, its kind and quality and marking, as to the registration of all firms and persons carrying out the business and as to \"the fixing and determining of the amount of the said tax.\"\nWe have nothing before us shewing how the amount of the tax mentioned in the distress warrant has been determined. The Secretary-Treasurer has not thought advisable to submit the question to the courts as he had the option to do under section 7 of the Act; he has preferred to proceed against the appellant company by distress warrant.\nBefore issuing this distress warrant the Secretary-Treasurer had to satisfy himself that the appellant company had in its possession a certain quantity of liquor, that it had property rights in the liquor kept, that it was liable for the tax claimed, that there had been a demand for payment and default on the part of the debtor and that the law which he had as a Minister of the Crown to carry out was within the competency of the legislature.\nAll these questions could have been submitted at his discretion to the courts of the land to be determined but he has preferred to proceed by distress warrant, and it cannot be seriously contended for one moment that he did not then himself determine those questions of fact and of law before taking such a serious step as to levy the tax by distress upon the goods of the person liable. All those circumstances shew that he could not issue the warrant without determining those different questions. He has, upon consideration of facts and circumstances, imposed a liability and has affected the rights of the appellant company and consequently has made a judicial determination. The Queen v. Corporation of Dublin[67].\nAnybody who possesses authority from the legislature to perform judicial acts constitutes a court so as to be amenable to the writ of certiorari (Rex v. Woodhouse[68]). It has been in England a question whether certiorari lies as to the licensing justices. Reg. v. Sharman[69], and Reg. v. Bowman[70], are authority for the proposition that the licensing justices under the law as it existed before the licensing Act of 1904 were acting in an administrative capacity and that certiorari would not lie. But in the case of Rex v. Woodhouse68, these decisions of In re Sharman69 and In re Bowman70 were not followed; and it was decided that the acts of the licensing justices were judicial acts and that certiorari lies in respect of them.\nI was inclined to think at first that the acts of members of an executive council in a province were not amenable before the courts by way of certiorari; but in the very recent cases of The Board of Education v. Rice[71], and of Local Government Board v. Arlidge[72] it was decided that in a question which was the subject of an appeal to those departments, though it should not be considered as being tried, an opportunity should be given to the parties in the controversy to be heard; and if the boards failed in that duty their orders might be subject of certiorari. See also The Queen v. Local Government Board[73].\nIt seems to me that the decision of the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer of New Brunswick in issuing the warrant in question may be considered as a judicial act subject to review by certiorari.\nAs to the issuing of warrants, it has been decided that they are not judicial acts in the following old cases: a warrant to apprehend an offender Rex v. Lloyd[74] ; Rex v. Lediard[75] ; a warrant to levy a poor-rate Ex parte Taunton[76]; a warrant for the maintenance of order Rex v. Webber[77]. But we find also that the following warrants have been held judicial acts; a search warrant under 48-49 V, ch. 69, which relates to the protection of women and girls Hope v. Evered[78]; a warrant of arrest under the same act Lea v. Charrington[79].\nIt has been decided in England, in a case almost similar to this one, that the certificate given by commissioners of income tax authorizing repayment of sums paid in respect of income tax may be removed by certiorari in order to be quashed. Rex v. City of London Commissioners of Income Tax[80].\nFor these reasons, I consider that the writ of certiorari would lie.\nWe have then to decide the main issue which has been raised by the appellant company as to whether this legislation imposing a duty on liquor to be exported is ultra vires. On this point I need not repeat what has been so well said by my brother Duff, in whose view I concur, that this tax is ultra vires.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below.\nMignault J. (dissenting).\u2014While at common law certiorari lies only to review proceedings of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to define with absolute precision what are judicial or quasi-judicial acts (Corpus Juris. Certiorari, no. 68, vol. 11, p. 121). There is no doubt the term \"judicial\" or \"quasi-judicial\" is here used in a very wide sense, but on the other hand if the act be a purely ministerial one, certiorari certainly does not lie. As said by Fletcher-Moulton L.J., in Rex v. Woodhouse[81] :\nThe true view of the limitation would seem to be that the term \"judicial act\" is used in contrast with purely ministerial acts. To these latter the process of certiorari does not apply, as for instance to the issue of a warrant to enforce a rate, even though the rate is one which could itself be questioned by certiorari. In short, there must be the exercise of some right or duty to decide in order to provide scope for a writ of certiorari at common law.\nThe instance suggested by Fletcher-Moulton L.J., the issue of a warrant to enforce a rate where certiorari does not lie, although the rate itself could be questioned by that process, is most pertinent in the present case, for here the act attacked is a distress warrant to enforce a tax, and it is hard to distinguish this case from the instance suggested by the learned judge.\nThere are no doubt cases under statutes requiring the assent of two justices for the issue of a warrant, where the giving of this assent, when there was no inquiry and judicial act preliminary to the assent of the justices, was held to be a judicial act. The King v. Inhabitants of Hamstall Hidware[82]; Overseers of Staverton v. Overseers of Ashburton[83]; Harper v. Can[84]. But such cases are clearly distinguishable from the one under consideration, the statute here giving the respondent no discretion to refuse to collect the tax when the contingency provided for has happened.\nThis appears to me the deciding factor in this case as to the possibility of attacking by certiorari the distress warrant issued by the respondent. Section 6 of 12 Geo. V, ch. 3 (New Brunswick) states that in default of payment within the time limited (by the statute) of any tax by the Act imposed, the same may be levied under a warrant signed by the Provincial-Treasurer directed to the sheriff. Section 7, it is true, gives the Secretary-Treasurer the option of taking an action to recover the tax in any court of competent jurisdiction. But he must do one thing or the other, issue the warrant or take action before the courts, and in so doing his act is of a purely ministerial and administrative character and in no wise a judicial one. He does not determine the liability of the taxpayer, he decides nothing, he merely issues a warrant or takes an action to recover a tax imposed by the statute. Should he institute an action to collect the tax it would not be contended that his act was a judicial one. And if that be so, the mere signing of a warrant under which the sheriff proceeds to levy the tax, which decides no question of liability but only puts the machinery of the law into motion, is surely not a judicial act. On this ground, I think the appeal fails. The substantial question of the validity of this statute, which cannot be determined upon these proceedings, is, I understand, in issue before the New Brunswick courts in another action. This lessens the regret that I would otherwise feel to have to dispose of this case on the rather technical ground that the appellant misconceived its remedy when it attacked the distress warrant by certiorari. There does not appear, however, any possibility of avoiding the conclusion that this is not a case for certiorari.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Fred.

C.R. 44) Duff J. dissenting, that such use of the word \"Community\" as a specific trade-mark was calculated to \"deceive or mislead the public\" and its registration was properly rejected.\nPer Brodeur J., Duff J. contra. A general trade-mark protects the registered owner not only in respect to goods which it makes but also as to those which it is authorized to make by its charter.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] refusing to overrule the refusal of the Minister of Agriculture to register the word \"Community\" as a specific trade-mark descriptive of the washing machines manufactured by the appellant company.\nThe Oneida Community does a very large manufacturing business in connection with which it has registered the word \"Community\" as its general trade-mark. The Home Appliance Co. applied for registration of the same word as a specific trade-mark to designate the electrical washing machines which it makes and which have never been made by the Oneida Community though it could do so under its charter. The application of the Home Appliance Co. was refused and such refusal was confirmed by the judgment of the Exchequer Court (1). The Home Appliance Co. appealed from this judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada. R. S. Smart for the appellant. A general trade-mark only protects the owner in regard to goods which use and mode of dealing have rendered definite. Edwards v. Dennis[2]. And see In re Vulcan Trade-Mark[3].\nThe goods designated by the specific trade-mark applied for cannot possibly be mistaken for those of the respondent and therefore are not calculated to mislead or deceive the public. Payton & Co. v. Snelling, Lampard & Co.[4] ; Lambert Pharmacol Co. v. J. Palmer & Sons[5].\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the respondent. The word \"Community\" has become so identified with respondent's goods that any use of it by other manufacturers is calculated to deceive. See In re Gutta Percha and Rubber Company's Application[6] ; Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney & Co.[7].\nWhere there is a doubt as to whether or not the registration will cause confusion it should be refused. Eno v. Dunn[8] ; E. Z. Waist Co. v. Reliance Mfg. Co.[9].\nR. S. Smart for the appellant..\nW. L. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI would do so on the ground that the Minister having exercised his discretion and having properly, under the circumstances, refused the appellant's application for the registration of the word \"Community\" as a specific trademark, on the ground that its use by the appellant was calculated to deceive or mislead the public and this having been confirmed by the Exchequer Court to which an appeal had been taken, this court should not now interfere.\nEverything that could have been said for the appeal was well said by Mr. Smart, for the appellant,\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant made an application, to the Commissioner of Patents, to have registered under the provision of the \"Trade-Mark and Design Act,\" a specific trade-mark consisting of the word \"Community\" which the respondent had previously, many years before, adopted as its general trade-mark and had obtained the registration thereof under said Act.\nThe minister in charge of the department having to consider such application, acting under the powers conferred upon him by said Act, refused said application of the appellant.\nThe question raised herein is whether the said minister acted within his powers, under section 11 of said Act, R.S.C., chapter 71, which reads as follows:\u2014\n11. The Minister may refuse to register any trade-mark,\u2014\n(a) if he is not satisfied that the applicant is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of such trade-mark;\n(b) if the trade-mark proposed for registration is identical with, or resembles, a trade-mark already registered;\n(c) if it appears that the trade-mark is calculated to deceive or mislead the public ;\n(d) if the trade-mark contains any immorality or scandalous figure;\n(e) if the so-called trade-mark does not contain the essentials necessary to constitute a trade-mark, properly speaking.\nThere is ample authority, in my opinion, for the minister, within the said first three subsections which I quote, upon the relevant evidence presented herein, to reject said application.\nThe appellant appealed by way of petition to the late Sir Walter Cassels, the President or Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada, to overrule the said decision of the Minister. He refused to do so, and dismissed the application with costs.\nThere happen to have been two cases in which the minister, at the respective times there in question, was overruled, and in one of them, In re Vulcan Trade-Mark[10], the question so raised was brought before this court. See[11], in which the jurisdiction of the court below was in question.\nWe upheld the jurisdiction and agreed in the result the court below had reached.\nThat case does not seem to me to have any resemblance to this. The petitioner there had, in fact, long used a specific trade-mark which it was contended was being infringed, and seemed likely to be liable to suffer an injustice unless the registration of it was permitted. The numerous cases cited, and questions raised, by the appellant therein seem to me almost all beside the question involved herein which is simply whether or not the minister's power has been exceeded.\nThe impropriety of adopting respondent's name and general trade-mark for its own purpose is to me quite sufficient ground for the minister's refusal.\nThen there are others who had adopted the word \"Community\" as part of the corporate name.\nThe confusion liable to be created by a new company coming in and obtaining the use of such name as Community, even as a specific trade-mark, is one of the many things the minister, in order to protect the public as well as the parties so concerned, is not only entitled, but also bound, I submit, to consider.\nThe appellant's persistence suggests something, not its own, is to be gained at the expense of others if we should unhappily give it what it asks for, and make of the court below and this court such superintendents of the minister as never was, I imagine, within the contemplation of Parliament.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal, in my opinion, should be allowed. There is no ground, I think, on which it can properly be held that the use of the word \"Community\" by the appellant is calculated to mislead the public into thinking that the appellants' washing machines are the products of the respondents' manufactory. The respondents have, in point of fact, confined their trade in Canada to animal traps, silverware, cut glass and fruits. The evidence adduced by the respondents is worthless, and there are no facts from which I feel entitled to concur in an inference that such will be the effect of the use of the word \"Community\" by the appellants.\nI am unable to agree with the learned trial judge that the registration of a general trade-mark gives a right to exclude others from the use of it as a specific trade-mark in connection with any goods of any description that a corporation, being the registered holder of it, is entitled to manufacture or sell under its constitution. That, I think, is not consistent with the description given by statute of a general trade-mark (section 4 (a)), which shews, I think, very plainly that it was only intended to protect the use of it by the registered proprietor in connection with some class of commodities in which the proprietor deals at the critical moment when the question arises. I adopt the view advanced by Mr. Smart in his able argument that the protection accorded by the statute to the proprietor of a general trade-mark does not affect the use of it by others as a specific trade-mark in connection with the sale of articles not within the scope of the trade, business, occupation or calling carried on by him at the time when any question of infringement or proprietorship arises. I have no hesitation in holding that the use of the word \"Community\" by the appellants as descriptive of their washing machines would not have been at the date of their application an infringement of the respondents' trade-mark.\nMuch was made upon the argument of a supposed exercise of discretion by the Minister. The conclusion to which I have come is that there was no exercise of discretion by the minister. I am convinced that in this case the minister has, in accordance with the usual practice, dismissed the appellants' application for the sole reason that the word \"Community\" appears on the register as the respondents' general trade-mark.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014By section 11 (c) of The Trade-Mark and Designs Act (R.S.C. c. 71) the minister is empowered\nto refuse to register any trade-mark * * * if it appears that the trademark is calculated to deceive or mislead the public.\nBy section 42 the Exchequer Court is given jurisdiction to order the entry of a rejected trade-mark\non information * * * of any person aggrieved by any omission without sufficient cause to make (such) entry in the register of trade-marks.\nIn the case at bar the minister refused the appellant's application to register the word \"Community\" as a trademark for washing machines. The respondent already had that word registered as its general trade-mark\u2014\"destined to be (its) sign in trade\" (subsection 4 (a) and 16), but had never applied it to washing machines. We are not informed as to the grounds on which the Minister proceeded.\nThe late President of the Exchequer Court in dismissing the appellant's petition or information, preferred under section 42, after referring to the extended business of the respondent, the fact that it is a well known trading company and the enormous sums spent by it in advertising, said:\u2014\nThere is no reason why the petitioner should have adopted this particular name for its trade-mark. It appears as if the object of the petitioner was to gain some benefit from the market created by the objector's company at enormous expense.\nThere was in the circumstances before the learned judge, apart from any evidence of dubious admissibility, quite enough in my opinion to justify the inference that the trade-mark which the appellant seeks to have registered \"is calculated to deceive or mislead the public.\"\nIt would I think be unwarrantable on the record before us to find that the appellant was \"aggrieved by an omission without sufficient cause to make (the) entry\" which it sought.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The respondent company, the Oneida Community, is a large manufacturing company incorporated under the laws of the State of New York and carries on a hardware business.\nIn 1908, it had the word \"Community\" registered in Canada as a general trade-mark. The goods which it has manufactured and sold since have borne this trade-mark.\nThe appellant company, which is manufacturing washing machines, applied for the registration of the same word \"Community\" as a trade-mark for its washing machines. The application was refused, on account of the existence on the register of the respondents' general trademark, under the provisions of section 11 of the Trade-Mark and Design Act.\nThis section 11 provides that\nthe Minister may refuse to register any trade-mark (a) if he is not satisfied that the applicant is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of such trade-mark, (b) if the trade-mark proposed for registration is identical with or resembles a trade-mark already registered, (c) if it appears that the trade-mark is calculated to deceive or mislead the public. The powers and discretion of the Minister are very wide under this section. The trade-mark legislation protects the trader who has established a reputation from the unfair competition of other persons who might sell their goods in such a guise that the purchaser would think that they were his. It constitutes for its owner a statutory monopoly.\nThe goods of the respondent company command in the city of Winnipeg, where the appellant has established lately its business, a very high reputation and their per capita sales in that city are larger than in any other city, Canadian or American.\nIt is true that to-day the Oneida Company does not manufacture washing machines; but under their charter they are authorized to manufacture machinery generally and their corporate powers would not prevent them from dealing with this class of goods.\nA general trade-mark which is used by a manufacturer or a dealer gives him the exclusive use of the mark not only as respects articles which he is actually manufacturing but also concerning articles which he has the right to manufacture. The rights arising out of the possession of a registered trade-mark are not limited to the exact kind of goods for which the mark has been used and may depend on the circumstance that the goods in question are sold by the same class of persons. Kerly, Trade-Marks, 4th ed., p. 34.\nThe word which constitutes his trade-mark should not be used by others and the minister has not only the power but it was his duty to avoid any confusion which would necessarily result from the use of this same word as a trade-mark by some other manufacturers. Besides, the minister has exercised a discretion with which I would not like to interfere. The discretion which entitles the minister to refuse to register marks on the ground of similarity to other marks should be exercised even where the owners of the latter have consented. In re Dewhurst's Application for a Trade-Mark[12].\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Mignault J.\u2014With some doubt I have come to the conclusion not to interfere with the judgment of the late President of the Exchequer Court. I am not clear that section 11 of the Trade-Mark and Design Act confers on the minister a discretion which should not be reviewed by the court except where a case of abuse of discretion is made out. But here the specific trade-mark \"Community\" in connection with washing machines could well be said to be \"calculated to deceive or mislead the public.\" It further seems probable that the application for the registration of this specific trade-mark was prompted by the desire to profit by the reputation which the respondent had created for its trade-mark as applied to goods put by it on the market. And no doubt purchasers of the appellant's goods under such a name might be induced to believe that they were buying the respondent's goods.\nI do not mean to hold that by registering a general trademark a person can monopolize the use of the mark for any purpose whatsoever. The judgment here can rest on the ample ground that the specific trade-mark which the appellant sought to have registered was objectionable under section 11.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fetherstonhaugh & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ewart, Scott, Kelley & Kelley.\n[1] [1923] Ex.

Levesque Es-Qual (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1923: May 18; June 15.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nConstitutional law\u2014Succession duty\u2014Bank stock\u2014Company shares\u2014Head office\u2014Situs of property\u2014\"Succession Duty Act\" R.S.Q. (1909), Arts 1375 and 1376, as amended by 4 Geo. V, c. 9\u2014Art. 6 C.C.\nThe respondent, acting on behalf of the province of Quebec, claimed from the appellants, executors of the estate of the late W. Smith, domiciled at his death in Halifax, succession duties on the following: first on 2,076 shares of the Royal Bank of Canada having its head office in Montreal but having established at Halifax a local registry under section 43 of the \"Bank Act\"; and secondly on 100 shares of the Montreal Trust Company, incorporated by the Quebec Legislature and 175 shares of the Abbey Fruit Salts Company incorporated under a Dominion charter, both having their head offices in Montreal.\nHeld that the executors were not liable to pay succession duty on the shares first mentioned which have already been declared by a judgment of this court to be situate in the province of Nova Scotia. Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer for the Province of Nova Scotia (58 Can. S.C.R. 570).\nAs to the shares secondly described, this court was equally divided: Davies C.J. and Idington and Anglin JJ. holding that these shares were not liable to Quebec succession duty as they were not \"actually situate within the province.\" Duff, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. contra.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec (1), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court at Montreal, and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. and Hague K.C. for the appellants. The late W. Smith being domiciled at the time of his death in Nova Scotia, all these shares must be deemed to have their situs there: mobilia sequuntur personam.\nThese shares are not \"actually situate within the province of Quebec,\" within the meaning of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act and of sections 1375 and 1376 of the Quebec \"Succession Duty Act,\" or within the limits of the constitutional powers of that province.\nThese shares do not fall within the scope of the word \"property\" as used in Art. 1375 and therefore do not come within the operation of the taxing clauses under which the province claims. Art. 1376 enacts what the word \"property\" includes. As the shares in question are intangible property, they are therefore not, and cannot be \"actually situate\" within the province. The effect of Art. 1376 is to exclude all property not comprised within the description given by that article from the operation of Art. 1375.\nAs to the shares of the Royal Bank of Canada, this court has already held that they were situate in the province of Nova Scotia. Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia[1].\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the respondent. The shares are \"situate within the province\" of Quebec. Generally speaking, the head-office of a company is the place where its property and the shares in it of the particular holders are situated. Attorney-General v. Higgins[2]; Attorney-General v. Sudeley[3].\nE. L. Newcombe K.C. and Hague K.C. for the appellants.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin's reasons for allowing this appeal and dismissing the action in this case.\nI desire it to be understood that I do not in any way modify or alter my reasons for judgment in the case of Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer for the Province of Nova Scotia1, where I stated at page 576\nthat the domicile of the decedent would be the test in Canada of the right to levy succession duties upon his personal property wherever it might be locally or physically situate and that such taxation could only be levied by the province of the domicile.\nIdington J.\u2014The late Wiley Smith, long domiciled before and at the time of death, in Halifax, died there intestate on the 28th February, 1916.\nLetters of administration were shortly thereafter duly granted to the appellants by the probate court of the probate district of the County of Halifax.\nAmong the assets of the estate so transmitted were 2,076 shares of the Royal Bank of Canada; 100 shares of the Montreal Trust Company and 175 shares of the Abbey Fruit Salts Company. A question was raised in the case of Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer for the Province of Nova Scotia[4], as to the liability of the appellants on behalf of the estate to pay succession duties claimed by said Provincial Treasurer, and this court, Mignault J. dissenting, held that the appellants were liable.\nNotwithstanding that judgment (4th Feb. 1919) and payment of the amount so held due, the respondent on behalf of the Government of Quebec sued herein, in December, 1919, to recover succession duties claimed to be due the province of Quebec under and by virtue of articles 1375 and 1376 of the R.S.Q., 1919, as amended by 4 Geo. V, c. 9, which reads as follows:\u2014\n1375. All property, movable or immovable, the ownership, usufruct or enjoyment whereof is transmitted owing to death, shall be liable to the following taxes calculated upon the value of the property transmitted, after deducting debts and charges existing at the time of the death.\n1376. The word \"property\" within the meaning of this section includes all property, movable or immovable, actually situate within the province, and all debts which were owing to the deceased at the time of his death, or are payable by reason of his death, and which are either payable in the province or are due by the debtor domiciled therein; the whole whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province.\nI adhere to my opinion as expressed in pages 576 to 582 of said report of said case and need not repeat same here, but refer thereto for my reasons relative to that item of the claims herein.\nThe Montreal Trust Company originated in an Act of the Quebec legislature incorporating its predecessor, whose name and charter by many amendments were changed into that name it now bears, and range of action it now enjoys.\nSo far as I can discover there is nothing in that legislation or some of the articles of the \"Quebec Companies Act\" made by such legislation applicable to it, that would require for the transfer of its shares any ancillary probate or letters of administration or anything equivalent thereto, in order to enable the appellants (of whom that very Trust Company seems to be one) to dispose of said shares.\nIndeed (if counsel understood my question put during the argument herein, and I their reply), there is nothing of that kind in question herein as to either of the companies referred to and concerned in this case.\nThe Abbey Fruit Salts Company is admitted to have been incorporated under the Dominion \"Companies Act.\" There certainly is nothing in its charter either requiring or entitling it to require ancillary probate or letters of administration before assenting to transfer of its shares by the executors or administrators of any estate embracing such shares.\nI assume, therefore, that there is no need for appellants to seek anything in way of Quebec governmental authority to complete their title or enable them to dispose of said shares. Lovitt v. The King[5], and in appeal Rex v. Lovitt[6], turned upon that test, and nothing else, raising, of course, the constitutional question.\nThe property therein was thus essentially of that kind to which the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam is applicable.\nAnd the case of Lambe v. Manuel[7] governs all that in my view is necessarily applicable to resolve this case. True the Quebec Act has been revised since, but so far as it contravenes that decision in principle is ultra vires.\nIf I had to depend only upon the question of the interpretation or construction of the above quoted sections of the Act, which taken literally is, in some of the terms of the second section, so absolutely ultra vires that I am surprised to find its literal reading contended for, I should be inclined to adopt Mr. Newcombe's argument as to its meaning, but I do not find that necessary in my view.\nThe adoption of what the respondent's counsel contends for herein, in relation to each item in question, would render this the most important case we have heard for many years; if we only use a very little common knowledge and recognize the fact that Montreal and Toronto are the headquarters of banking, of railway and other commercial enterprises that reap from all Canada, and in order to do so are dependent on the legislative and judicial protection of their manifold interests furnished by and at the expense of many provinces other than Quebec or Ontario. I wish always, in anything we have to decide, and especially the interpretation and construction of the B.N.A. Act, to look ahead and see where the decision we may reach would land the powers that be in the practical results. Over refinement of words leads in such case, if ever, to undesirable results.\nAre we to conclude that such a result as double taxation is inevitable? That is, above all things, to be avoided, and certainly not invited.\nI would allow this appeal with costs throughout and dismiss respondent's action.\nDuff J.\u2014In the previous case of Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer for Nova Scotia[8], the majority of the court proceeded upon the ground that the bank shares being by law transferable in Nova Scotia, they had a local situation there, and as we are bound by that decision, the appeal must obviously, as to these shares, be allowed.\nMr. Newcombe now raises for the first time a question as touching the other assets in Quebec, namely, the shares in the Montreal Trust Company and the Abbey Fruit Salts Company\u2014the first being a Quebec company, the second being a Dominion company, and both having their head offices in Montreal.\nThe application of the Quebec statute does not appear to have been challenged in the courts below in respect of the shares in these companies except upon the ground that being intangible property they could only have a local situation in the place of the domicile of the debtor\u2014a contention which would appear to be disposed of by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Lovitt[9].\nThe point now raised by Mr. Newcombe which, as I say, is an entirely new one, is that these shares do not fall within the scope of the word \"property\" as used in article 1375, and therefore do not come within the operation of the taxing clauses under which the province claims. By article 1376 it is enacted:\nThe word \"property\" within the meaning of this section includes all property, movable or immovable, actually situate within the province, and all debts which were owing to the deceased at the time of his death, or were payable by reason of his death, and which are either payable in the province, or are due by a debtor domiciled therein; the whole whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province, or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province;\nand Mr. Newcombe's argument is that as the shares in question are intangible property, they are therefore not, and cannot be \"actually situate\" within the province, and that the effect of article 1376 is to exclude all property not comprised within the descriptions given by that article from the operation of article 1375.\nIt will be more convenient first of all, I think, to consider the general scope of the section in which Art. 1376 appears\u2014c. 9 of 4 Geo. V. Chapters 9 and 10 of the statutes of that year were passed, as is well known, in consequence of the decision in Cotton v. The King[10]. The second of these statutes deals with the subject of succession duties upon transmissions within the province in consequence of the death of persons domiciled therein, of movable property having a \"local situation\" outside the province and duties are thereby imposed upon such transmissions. By chapter 9, all property, movable or immovable, \"actually situate\" within the province, and debts owing to the deceased, either payable in the province or due by a debtor domiciled within the province which is transmitted owing to death, wherever the deceased was domiciled and wherever the transmission takes place, is subject to the duties provided for. Prima facie, Art. 1375 seems to proceed upon the assumption that the whole estate comes under the operation of that section; that is to say, the whole estate within the province. Where the estate is partly in and partly out of the province, the \"whole estate\" appears to be assumed by Article 1377 to be divided into two parts\u2014that part which is \"actually situated\" without the province, and that part which is \"actually situated\" within. Article 1382 again seems to proceed upon the assumption that shares and bonds of incorporated companies and individual interests in partnerships having their chief places of business within the province are subject to the operation of the Act. The two statutes, chapters 9 and 10, are complementary to one another, and they appear to be designed to tax in the one case transmissions taking place within the province of property having a \"local situation\" outside the province, where the deceased had his domicile in the province; and in the other to tax property transmitted irrespective of the domicile of the deceased and irrespective of the question whether the transmission takes place within the province or without the province where the property is \"actually situated,\" to use the words of Article 1376, \"within the province.\"\nThe effect of Mr. Newcombe's contention is that from this latter class of property all intangible property is excluded, with the exception of debts which are specially mentioned; and in particular, all shares in joint stock companies and in partnerships, even where the company or partnership carries on business exclusively within the province. Admittedly this class of property is taxed where it has a \"local situation\" outside the province and the transmission takes place within the province on the death of a person domiciled therein, and, as I have already mentioned, Article 1382 seems to proceed upon the assumption that such property comes within the operation of chapter 9.\nMr. Newcombe's argument proceeds, broadly, upon two lines: first, the phrase \"actually situated,\" he says, in itself has no application to intangible property; and second, he argues that the special mention of debts in Article 1376 and the use of the phrase \"locally situated\" in chapter 10, which admittedly may apply to intangible property, afford presumptive evidence that in Article 1376 the legislature was deliberately employing a phrase of less comprehensive import.\nI think Mr. Geoffrion's contention is sound that the special mention of debts in Article 1376 has little or no significance. The statute is there giving the indicia of the classes of debts governed by the Act; and in fixing these indicia neither the common law rule nor the civil law rule is adopted in its entirety; and that, I think, sufficiently accounts for the special mention of debts. I have been unable to come to the conclusion that \"actually situate\" in Articles 1376 and 1377 differs in meaning in any presently material respect from the phrase ; \"locally situate\" in Article 1387 (6). They are both, I think, used as Mr. Dicey uses the latter (Conflict of Laws, 3 ed., note (p), p. 340) in contrast with \"constructively or fictitiously situate in the country where the deceased dies domiciled, in accordance with the principle mobilia sequuntur personam.\" \"Actual,\" no doubt, is a word constantly used by English lawyers in contrast with \"constructive\" or \"fictitious,\" and the argument is that \"actually\" here is used in contradistinction to what does not physically exist but is only deemed to exist for juridical purposes.\nThe fallacy, I think, lies in construing these words without regard to the sense they commonly bear in legal discussion and exposition in connection with the subject of succession duties, with which this legislation deals. \"Locally situate\" is a phrase which has been in constant use in the sense ascribed to it by Mr. Dicey at the place mentioned; that is to say, as indicating a situation not ascribed to property in obedience to the theory that movables have a situs at the domicile of their owner. \"Local situation\" is hardly a phrase which anybody but a lawyer would be likely to apply to an incorporeal right such as a debt. Lawyers employ it, not for the purpose of indicating that debt has in fact a location in any absolute sense, but that it may have certain attributes of locality which determine its situs for legal purposes, which situs is determined from the attributes of the debt itself, independently altogether of the domicile of its owner and of the fiction mobilia sequuntur personam. The use of the phrase \"actually situate\" is not so common, but it would, perhaps, be difficult to give a good reason why, for the purpose of excluding the fiction mobilia sequuntur personam, \"actual\" would not be as appropriate an adjective as \"local\".\nOne may advert, perhaps, for a moment to the circumstance that the situs ascribed to intangible property for the purpose of determining the authority of the excutor to deal with it, for example, is not, strictly speaking, a fictitious situs. The authority of the ordinary, as the Chief Baron points out in The Attorney General v. Bouwens[11], over the effects of the deceased rested upon the circumstance that these effects were so situate that \"he could have disposed of them in pios usus.\" At p. 192 he points out that the ordinary could administer all chattels within his jurisdiction, and if an instrument was created of a chattel nature, capable of being transferred by acts done within his jurisdiction and \"sold for money\" there, there was no reason why the ordinary or his appointee should not administer that species of property. And the Chief Baron's judgment, I think, points to the essential element in determining situs in the case of intangible chattels for the purpose of probate jurisdiction as\nthe circumstance that the subjects in question could be effectively dealt with within the jurisdiction,\nto quote Mr. Dicey's words, at p. 342. I repeat that such a situs cannot in my opinion be described as a \"fictitious\" situs. This view of the effect of these words is not without support from very high authority. There is, for example, the well-known judgment delivered by Sir Arthur Hobhouse on behalf of the Judicial Committee in Blackwood v. The Queen[12]. The controversy had arisen out of the contention that all movables of the deceased, which included in part, at least, intangible property, should be considered to have a situs in the Colony of Victoria, where the deceased was domiciled, the estate contending that the enactment there under consideration applied only to such property as had an actual situation in the colony. Sir Arthur Hobhouse, at p. 91, says that the question was whether\nall moveable assets belonging to the deceased, wherever actually situate,\nshould be brought into account by the executor or only so much as came under his control by authority of the probate. The phrase \"actually situate\" is here used in contrast to a situs ascribed to movables in obedience to the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam. Similar language is used more than once in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Lovitt[13]. At p. 218 the phrase \"actual situs\" (the property in question was a bank deposit) is used as an equivalent of \"situate\". At p. 220 this sentence is employed to state the contention there advanced:\nThe defendants, however, contended that the situation of the property is to be determined not by its actual locality, but according to the principle expressed in the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam.\nOn the same page the phrase \"actual situation\" is used in the same sense. Mr. Geoffrion has called attention to the circumstance that in the judgments of this court in The King v. Cotton[14] the word actual is employed for the same purpose more than once in the judgments of different members of the court.\nBy Art. 6 of the Civil Code the rule that personal property is governed by the law of the owner's domicile is formally adopted as part of the law of Quebec. That rule has been so commonly stated in the form that personal property is deemed to be situate wherever the owner is domiciled, that it is not surprising to find in this legislation phrases obviously used with the object of excluding that fiction in determining situs. Nor do I think it is surprising to find the phrase \"actually situated,\" which has been so frequently used in authoritative judgments dealing with the very subject with which the legislature was concerned in a sense including intangible property to which the law ascribes a situs by virtue of some quality inherent in the property itself and having no relation to the domicile of the owner.\nThe appeal should, as regards these shares, be dismissed but the appellant is entitled to the costs of appeal.\nAnglin J.\u2014In Smith v. Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia[15], in which the Attorney General of Quebec intervened, a majority of this court held that the situs of the 2,000 shares in the Royal Bank, in respect of which the Province of Quebc now claims succession duty, was at Halifax, N.S., where a local registry had been established under s. 43 of the \"Bank Act,\" and not at Montreal, where the head office of the bank is located. We are bound by that decision and cannot entertain the respondent's contention that those shares were \"actually situate within the Province\" of Quebec. Article 1376 (4 Geo. V, c. 9),\nThe position is different as to the other stocks in respect of which succession duty is claimed viz., 100 shares in the Montreal Trust Company and 175 shares in the Abbey Fruit Salts Company. Both these companies have head offices in Montreal and shares in them are transferable there only. Nevertheless the attribution of a situs to such shares at Montreal is purely fictitious. They were the property of a decedent domiciled without the province. In order that they should be liable to Quebec succession duty they must have been \"actually situate within the Province.\" Notwithstanding Mr. Geoffrion's ingenious suggestion, based on The King v. Lovitt[16], that we should construe the word \"actually\" as intended merely to exclude the fictitious situs of personal property dependent on the application of the rule mobilia sequuntur personam, I am of the opinion that we are not justified in giving to that word any other than its ordinary connotation, especially where to do so would have the effect of extending the scope of a statute imposing taxation.\nActual situs is ordinarily used in contradistinction to fictitious or notional or ideal situs on whatever basis the latter may be attributed to property and whether such property possesses some other physical situs or is without any such situs. Indeed actual situs and physical situs seem to be almost interchangeable terms, both implying, to use the language of Mr. Dicey (Conf. of L. 2 ed. p. 71) \"real local situation\"\u2014the occupation of a definite space. I am unable to place on the words \"actually situate\", r\u00e9ellement situ\u00e9, in Art. 1376 any other construction. The phrase, \"actually situate\" in Art. 1376 (4 Geo. V., c. 9) seems to be used in contradistinction to the phrase \"locally situate\" employed in Art. 1378 (b), (4 Geo. V., c. 10) and to imply a greater restriction, as might be expected in a provision covering non-residents as well as residents.\nI have not overlooked the use of the word \"includes\" rather than the word \"means\" in Art. 1376, but in dealing with a taxing statute I am not disposed on that account to treat the definition of \"property\" in that article as other than exhaustive.\nIt follows that the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed. The appellant is entitled to her costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with my brother Duff.\nMignault J.\u2014The respondent, acting on behalf of the Crown in right of the Province of Quebec, claims from the appellants, administrators of the estate of the late Wiley Smith, domiciled at his death in Halifax, Nova Scotia, succession duties on the following movable property.\n1. 2,076 shares of The Royal Bank of Canada, the head office of which is in Montreal;\n2. 100 shares of The Montreal Trust Company, a corporation incorporated by the Quebec Legislature, with head office in Montreal;\n3. 175 shares of Abbey Fruit Salts Co., Limited, a company incorporated under a Dominion charter, the head office of which is also in Montreal.\nAs to the 2,076 shares of The Royal Bank of Canada, a majority of this court distinctly held in Smith v. The Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia[17] that these shares were situate, at Wiley Smith's death, in Nova Scotia, at the branch registry office of the bank in Halifax. While I did not concur in that holding, I am, of course, bound by it. As a consequence, the appeal must succeed as to these shares on which, on account of their situation, the Province of Quebec could not impose a succession duty where the succession devolved outside of the province.\nI will therefore consider the merits of the appeal merely as to the shares of the Montreal Trust Company and of Abbey Fruit Salts Co., Limited. It was held by both courts below that these shares were situate at the head office of these companies and therefore within the Province of Quebec.\nAs Wiley Smith died in Nova Scotia, the right of the Province of Quebec to impose succession duties on these shares depends on their being \"within the province\" in the meaning both of sect. 92, s.s. 2, of the British North America Act and of the Quebec statute, 4 Geo. V, c. 9, Arts. 1375 and 1376.\nChapters 9 and 10 of 4 Geo. V contain the law concerning succession duties of the Province of Quebec. They add two new sections\u2014sections XX and XXa\u2014to chapter 5 of Title 4 of the Revised Statutes. The scheme of section XX is to tax property actually situate within the province transmitted by the death of a person domiciled within or without the province, and of section XXa to tax the transmission by death within the province of property locally situate outside of the province. If the shares in question can be taxed it is only under the provisions of section XX.\nArticle 1375 of section XX renders all property, movable or immovable, the ownership, usufruct or enjoyment whereof is transmitted owing to death, liable for succession duties. And the word \"property\" is defined as follows by Article 1376:\u2014\n1376. The word \"property\" within the meaning of this section includes all property, movable or immovable, actually situate within the province and all debts which were owing to the deceased at the time of his death, or payable by reason of his death, and which are either payable in the province, or are due by a debtor domiciled therein; the whole, whether the deceased at the time of his death had his domicile within or without the province or whether the transmission takes place within or without the province.\nMr. Newcombe on behalf of the appellants contended that, with the exception of \"debts\" which are specially referred to, intangible property, such as the shares in question, is incapable of actual situation anywhere, and therefore is not comprised in the definition of the word \"property.\" This would entail the consequence that these shares are not within the meaning of the taxing provision, Article 1375.\nIf \"actually situate\" means\" physically situate,\" of course intangible or incorporeal property cannot have such a situation. But if \"actually\" is used to exclude a fictitious or notional situation, \"such as one derived from the rule \"mobilia sequuntur personam,\"\u2014and this seems to result from the French version of Article 1376, which uses the words \"r\u00e9ellement situ\u00e9,\" thus denoting the real as opposed to the fictitious or notional situation\u2014I do not think that Article 1376 should be so construed as to leave out of the contemplation of this statute the whole class of intangible property, debts only excepted as being expressly mentioned, for the sole reason that such property cannot have an \"actual\" situation. That certainly was not the intention of the legislature as is shewn by Article 1382, which requires from every corporation, company or firm having its chief office in the province a notice of any interest, shares, stock or bonds possessed therein by any person dying outside of the province.\nMoreover it has always been considered that intangible property can have an actual or real situation at least for the purpose of probate duties. The shares in question could be transferred only at the head office of these two companies, so any sale of the shares, to be effective as against the companies, would have to be perfected by a transfer of the shares at the head office in Montreal. In England, and for the purpose of probate duty, these shares, I think, would be considered as having an actual situation if there were a register in England where sales or transfers could be registered. Of course, this is a succession and not a probate duty, but if these shares can have an actual situation for the purpose of a probate duty, I fail to see why they cannot have one for a succession duty, or a legacy duty to which the taxes imposed by chapter XX bear a very close resemblance. On this question, I may perhaps be permitted to refer generally to the authorities cited in my judgment in Crosby v. Prescott[18].\nI do not think that a different situation can be ascribed to these shares under the Quebec civil code. Article 6, in the case of movables, admits of the rule mobilia sequuntur personam except, inter alia, where the rights of the Crown are involved, when the Quebec law applies. And it would seem to follow that shares in Quebec companies, which are movable by determination of law (article 387 C.C.), being subject to Quebec law when the question involved relates to the rights of the Crown, should also be held to be actually situate in the province of Quebec by the laws of which they are governed. I cannot conceive of a company having an actual situs at its head office and its shares having no real situs anywhere. And if the shares, for instance, of the Montreal Trust Company, incorporated under a Quebec charter, are not in Quebec, it would be difficult to say where they really are.\nThe words \"actual situs\" have been used by the Judicial Committee in respect of intangible property. See for example Rex v. Lovitt[19]. In Cotton v. The King[20] we find several times, in connection with bonds, debentures, shares, etc., the expression \"locally situate\" which is also used in 4 Geo. V (Que.) c. 10, article 1387b. If Mr. New-combe's contention is well founded, shares, bonds or debentures could have no local situation. So I venture to think that the legislature uses these expressions in the sense in which they are used in these cases, as indicating that this species of property can have an actual or local situation which I would place at the head office of the company.\nThe affidavit of the appellants, which is the respondent's exhibit no. 1, expressly refers to the shares of the Royal Bank of Canada, the Montreal Trust Company, and Abbey Fruit Salts Co. as being\nthat portion of the estate which was situate in the province of Quebec on the day of the death of the deceased.\nThe appellants, of course, may not be bound by their admission on what is really a question of law, but I may perhaps refer to it as shewing how novel Mr. Newcombe's construction really is.\nI therefore think that this very ingenious contention cannot be upheld, and, in my opinion, the shares of the Montreal Trust company and of Abbey Fruit Salts Co. were actually situate in the province of Quebec and therefore subject to the duty claimed.\nBeing, however, bound by the decision of this court in Smith v. Provincial Treasurer[21], I would allow the appeal as to the 2,076 shares of the Royal Bank of Canada, and the amount by which the judgment should be reduced can easily be determined by the parties, and if not it can be spoken to. I would give the appellants their costs in this court and would not interfere with the disposition of costs in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Meredith, H olden, Hague, Shaughnessy & Heward.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Charles Lanct\u00f4t.\n[1] [1919] 58 Can.

Campbell (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nGeorge Linnell (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1923: May 01; 1923: May 02; 1923: June 15\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNegligence\u2014Excavation in adjoining land up to border line\u2014Person falling into from his own land\u2014Absence of warning or protection\u2014Liability.\nThe appellant Reid, intending to build upon his lot no. 17, let a contract to the appellant Campbell who in turn let the work of excavation to the appellant Fisher. The respondent was a sub-lessee of certain premises situate on the adjoining lot no. 18. The excavation was made at the back of buildings already existing, up to the lane and extended to the border line of the two lots; but it was not shored up and was left without fence, or railing, or warning lights. The respondent, while passing at night through the yard back of his house, fell into the excavation, of which he was not aware, was injured and sued the appellants for damages. The action was tried as one of negligence and was submitted as such to the jury who brought in a general verdict for the respondent.\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that the appellants were liable.\nPer Duff J.\u2014Having regard to the course of the trial, it is not open to the appellants now to ask for a new trial, and they could only succeed in the appeal by showing that the evidence adduced is sufficiently complete and conclusive as to negative the appellant's liability. The fact that the fence on the dividing line between the two properties was removed is in itself a complete answer to the appellant's contention that what was done by them was done solely in the ordinary exercise of the proprietor's rights in respect of his own land.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014Although there was no absolute duty to guard independent of negligence, the exercise by the appellants of their rights to excavate entailed an obligation to do for the protection of those who they knew might be expected to make use of the adjoining yard what a prudent and reasonable man would regard as . requisite, or usually sufficient, to prevent a person using ordinary care from falling into the excavation while moving about the yard as was customary; and the verdict of the jury implies both the existence of this duty and the omission to discharge it, constituting actionable negligence.\nPer Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The contract between the appellant Reid and his contractors provided specifically for lights and railings in order to avoid accidents, thus showing that this was a reasonable precaution that should have been taken, and their failure to provide same renders them liable. Per Davies C.J. (dissenting).\u2014The excavation was made by the appellant Reid, or with his authority, on his own land, in the exercise of his rights to the ordinary enjoyment of his land; and there was no evidence of negligence which could justify the verdict of the jury.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1923] 1 W.W.R. 900) affirmed, Davies C.J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Morrison J, with a jury and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. As already said, the case was tried as an action brought upon a charge of negligence and was submitted to the jury as such by the trial judge, both in his charge and in the specific questions framed by him, with the expressed approval of the counsel. The jury, ignoring the above specific questions, brought in a general verdict for the respondent, awarding him $5,000. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal and to this court, the appellants raised a contention not urged at the trial, that the respondent must fail because the acts complained of were acts done without negligence by the appellant Reid or by his authority on his own land in exercise of his rights as proprietor and in the ordinary enjoyment of his property. The respondent's reply was first, that the making of the excavation had the effect of depriving the adjoining land of its natural support, and no other support having been substituted, the excavation itself was a contravention of that adjoining proprietor's right to lateral support for his land, and second, that the excavation, although done on appellant Reid's own land, constituted a danger in the absence of a protection or warning to persons who might, without knowledge of its existence, be in the vicinity after dark, and that these circumstances imposed upon the appellants a duty to provide such protection or warning. The court expressed no opinion on the first ground raised by the respondent.\nL. G. McPhillips K.C. for the appellants.\nH. R. Bray for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal by the defendants from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia dismissing by an equal division of the court an appeal by the defendants from the judgment of Mr. Justice Morrison in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, whereby the learned trial judge (after the jury had brought in a general verdict for the plaintiff respondent for $5,000, but did not answer the special questions the learned judge had put to them, as was their right under the law of British Columbia), pronounced judgment for that amount with costs.\nThe action was brought to recover damages for injuries which the respondent alleged he suffered by falling into a pit or excavation in the lot immediately adjoining the lot of which he was a part sub-lessee by reason of the excavation not having been shored up and being left without fence or railing or warning lights.\nI have carefully read and considered the evidence and judgments and have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed.\nI am so fully satisfied with the reasons for their judgment of Martin and McPhillips JJ. in the Court of Appeal, that I have really nothing useful to add to them.\nThe quotations made by them from the decisions of the learned judges who determined, in the English courts, the many cases cited, and especially the decision of the House of Lords in Dalton v. Angus[2] clearly established to my mind the right of the defendants to excavate up to the limits of the boundary line (provided such excavation was done without negligence) the cellar into which the plaintiff fell and negative the obligations which the plaintiff claimed were attached to that right of either shoring up the adjoining land or of fencing off the same or of keeping the same lighted during the hours of darkness.\nI am quite unable to find any evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants in carrying out their legal right to make the excavation they did which could justify the verdict of the jury.\nThe attempt to apply the law which governs relating to excavations alongside a public road or private way for the protection of those using those roads or ways should not prevail, in this case, where there was no such road or way but a simple boundary line between two lots. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant Reid was the owner of a lot numbered 17, lying alongside of another lot, numbered 18, and, intending to build upon his said lot 17, let a contract therefor to his co-appellant, Campbell, who in turn let the work of excavation to the other co-appellant Fisher,\nThe said lot 18 had erected upon it a large building when one Mrs. Roberts, three years previous to the incidents in question herein, had become the tenant of said lot 18 and the erections thereon and so continued at the time of the occurrences in question herein.\nShe lived therein and had sub-let different parts of said building respectively to a number of different tenants, of whom respondent was one, and a social club was another, besides others.\nThe said building fronted on a leading street and in its rear there was, between it and a lane running past the rear end of both lots, a vacant space of about twenty-five feet wide by twenty-eight feet in length, which was used by tradesmen and others serving those in the building and also by the tenants and numerous members of said club, as occasion might require either for ingress or egress or to serve their purpose in any way such as might happen to be respectively needed by them or their guests or visitors.\nOne use therefor was found by respondent in depositing his garbage in a tin can placed in that vacant space close to the lane but even by cars which served the business of those those like him in occupation of the said building had similar tin cans to receive their respective accumulations of garbage.\nIn short the said vacant rear space was used not only as a pathway in from the lane and out from the building to the lane and even by cars which served the business of those having dealings with any one in said building.\nThe appellants' work of excavation on lot 18 was begun on the 7th February, 1922, and by the night of the 10th of said month had reached at the line between said lots at the rear part thereof, a depth of five or six feet.\nThat night was dark and stormy, when respondent went out shortly after six, when he had got done with his day's work carrying his refuse to deposit it in his garbage can, whilst on his way to the lane in rear, to avail himself of an offer made by a friend to carry him home in his (the friend's) car.\nFrom his room in the building he had no chance of seeing what was going on in the way of the excavation in question and was absolutely ignorant of what had been done in regard thereto.\nTo proceed from his room on said errand it was necessary to descend a stairway. When he reached the foot of the stairs he of necessity had to turn a step or two to his can, which took him close to said excavation. The next turn was to the left and thence to the lane. He had not gone another step, he thinks, until the earth at the edge of the excavation gave way and he fell down into same and broke his leg and suffered other grievous injuries.\nThis action was brought to recover damages suffered as result of said fall.\nThere is no pretence that any notice was given by the way of lights or otherwise or any protection by railing, or in any way.\nThere had been a fence there according to the evidence of Mrs. Roberts and that, she says, was removed by those engaged in the work of excavation.\nThis is denied in such a peculiar way that I would not be surprised to learn that the jury accepted Mrs. Robert's version as they had a perfect right to do.\nA perusal of the entire evidence, I think, leaves that course clearly open to them and leaves a very decided impression on my mind that there was something there or thereabouts to keep strangers coming from lot 17 off the rear end of lot 18.\nThe whole question of fact was left to the jury by the learned trial judge in a fair charge of which no complaint was made at the time of the trial, and which ended by submitting to them for their answers the following questions:\n1. Did the defendants do anything which persons of ordinary care and skill would not have done under the circumstances?\n2. Have they omitted to do anything which persons of ordinary care and skill under the circumstances would have done?\n3. Did the plaintiff do anything which a person of ordinary care would not have done under the circumstances?\n4. Did he omit to do anything which a person of ordinary care would have done under the circumstances and thereby contribute to the accident? The jury did not answer these questions.\nIn British Columbia they are not bound to, and are so told by the learned trial judges.\nNevertheless the consideration of such questions helps I think, so long as not confusing by number or frame thereof, to keep the minds of jurors concentrated on the proper issues.\nThe counsel for appellants at the trial expressly declared himself as well satisfied with the questions.\nThe jury found a verdict for plaintiffs (now respondents) and assessed the damages at $5,000, for which the learned judge entered judgment.\nThe Court of Appeal was equally divided.\nThis appeal raises the question whether or not appellants in excavating up to the line of the division between lots 17 and 18, or either of them, owed, under such circumstances as in question herein, any duty to others entitled to walk on the rear part of said lot 18.\nIt has been argued on their behalf herein that no duty exists under such circumstances to any one save those using a public highway.\nThat seems to me rather a startling proposition. Nor do I find it maintained by the cases cited in support of it.\nThe fundamental principle upon which the cases holding that those passing along a highway are entitled to recover by reason of the owner of adjacent land having, either by excavation or by structural erection on his land, created a source of danger to such persons as used the highway, is that they having an absolute right to be where they are, the land owner must not, in the use of his land, disregard their right to pass in safety.\nIt does not follow, that the principle upon which those cases so rest is exclusively confined to highways. It is no doubt most frequently resorted to in cases of injury arising out of the use of a highway. And it has been extended by statutes in England relative thereto and they are substituted as the basis of most actions there. And penalties in most of said statutes are imposed for the purpose of detering such plain and unjustifiable use of one's land. But in no case has the legislation obliterated the original common law principle. I need not elaborate the development of the law, or set forth each case more or less applicable. The facts in this case as above set forth entitled the respondent to use as a means of exit from his place of business the rear part of the lot 18, and to assume that it was in the same safe condition as it had been for years before the appellants swept away the railing or guard Mrs. Roberts testified to as existent, and made the excavation thereby a double source of danger.\nIn the case of Clayards v. Dethick and Davis[3], the defendants in constructing a trench across the private entrance of plaintiff to his stable, had as absolute a right to excavate as appellants had herein but, by reason of neglecting to take due care of the plaintiff's rights in the premises, were held liable to damages arising therefrom.\nIn the case of Bower v. Peate[4], Chief Justice Cockburn sets forth the principle which must govern the acts of adjoining proprietors as follows:\u2014\nThe answer to the defendant's contention may, however, as it appears to us, be placed on a broader ground, namely, that a man who orders a work to be executed, from which, in the natural course of things, injurious consequences to his neighbour must be expected to arise, unless means are adopted by which such consequences may be prevented, is bound to see to the doing of that which is necessary to prevent the mischief, and cannot relieve himself of his responsibility by employing some one else\u2014 whether it be the contractor employed to do the work from which the danger arises or some independent person\u2014to do what is necessary to prevent the act he had ordered to be done from becoming wrongful. There is an obvious difference between committing work to a contractor to be executed from which, if properly done, no injurious consequences can arise, and handing over to him work to be done from which mischievous consequences will arise unless preventive measures are adopted. While it may be just to hold the party authorizing the work in the former case exempt from liability for injury, resulting from negligence which he had no reason to anticipate, there is, on the other hand, good ground for holding him liable for injury caused by an act certain to be attended with injurious consequences if such consequences are not in fact prevented, no matter through whose default the omission to take the necessary measures for such prevention may arise.\nThis exposition on the following pages demonstrates what is correct law to apply.\nIn the case of Hughes v. Percival[5], Lord Blackburn suggests how and in what respect that expression of the principle might in some cases, but not affecting what we have to deal with herein, be too broad. That case and the cases of Pickard v. Smith[6]; Corby v. Hill[7]; Lynch v. Nurdin[8]; and Kimber v. Gas, Light and Coke Company[9], and authorities cited in each, all illustrate the law applicable herein in its different aspects, and some of them show how the owner is deprived herein of the claim he makes to be distinguished from his co-appellants herein.\nIt may be noted here that when letting his contract to Campbell he had a different conception of the law from what his counsel sets up herein for that contract expressly provided for guards and lights to prevent just such accidents as in question herein, yet never were provided and I infer he must have known so.\nThe appellants' counsel's complaint of the changing the basis of action from nuisance to negligence as if important, tempts me to quote from Stroude's Judicial Dictionary the following early definition of \"nuisance\":\u2014\n\"Nusauns\" is where any man levieth any wall, or stoppeth any water, or doth any thing upon his owne ground, to the unlawful hurt or annoyance of his neighbour (Terms de la Ley: Vf, Cowel: jacob).\nWhat follows may be usefully studied by any one feeling he has a similar ground of complaint as made herein.\nI think this appeal should be dismised with costs throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal presents some curious features. The grounds upon which the appeal is based are grounds which were not even suggested at the trial, although in the main I think, open on the pleadings. They were raised in Court of Appeal, and upon them the judges of that court were equally divided.\nThe action was tried as an action brought upon a charge of negligence, was treated by all parties at the trial as such, was submitted to the jury as such by the learned trial judge, both in his charge and in the specific questions framed by him; and the course of the trial judge in the submission of the case to the jury was not only not objected to, but was expressly approved by counsel, counsel for Reid, speaking in presence of all counsel engaged, saying to the judge, we are really satisfied with the questions you have put.\nIn these circumstances the appellants are, I think, clearly disqualified from asking for a new trial. It is a sound rule and a necessary rule that if a party at the trial deliberately elects to fight his case upon a given issue on which he is beaten, he cannot afterwards claim a new trial on the ground that the case really turned upon another issue.\nThis is not a case to which the enactment of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act would apply, that a party's right to have the issues of fact submitted to the jury is a right which may be \"enforced by appeal\" notwithstanding any failure to take exception at the trial. In Scott v. The Fernie Lumber Co.[10], a decision pronounced in 1904, it was held by the full court that this enactment, which was then s. 66 of the Supreme Court Act, of 1904, had not wholly repealed the rule that a litigant is bound by the way in which he conducts his case at the trial, and that nothing in the section should be taken to give a right to a new trial in cases where counsel have expressly agreed upon the issues to be submitted to the jury or where the issues as submitted, have been accepted by all parties, as the only issues upon which the jury is to pass. Since that decision, s. 66 has been reenacted at least once without alteration, and as far as I am aware the principle laid down in Scott v. The Fernie Lumber Co.[11] has been acted upon by the British Columbia courts down to the present time. (See the judgment of McDonald C.J., in National Pole Co. v. Thurlow Logging Co.\nThis, however, by no means concludes the matter. Though a new trial should not be accorded the appellants for the purpose of raising issues which they elected not to raise before the jury, it would, I think, be going too far if the facts in evidence entitled the defendants to have the action dismissed on the ground that there is no right in law upon the facts admitted or found by the jury or incontestably established, (and by that I mean established by evidence of so complete and conclusive a character as would have justified a judgment for the defendants in face of a finding against the defendants by the jury) to deny them, notwithstanding what occurred at the trial, on appeal the right to have the action dismissed. Accordingly I think the principal contention of the appellants' counsel was open to him upon appeal in British Columbia and is open here, that contention being that the plaintiff must fail because the acts complained of are conclusively shown to have been acts done by the defendant Reid or by the authority of the defendant Reid on his own land in exercise of his rights as proprietor and in the ordinary enjoyment of his property, and that contention I proceed to examine.\nI premise that in my opinion it is not open to serious dispute that there was evidence from which a jury might properly find that, in the absence of a light or some other means of warning or a protecting barrier, the excavation constituted a danger exposing the owner of the adjoining property and persons using the adjoining property as the owner's tenants and licencees, without negligence, to the risk of serious injury, and in effect the jury has found that; and that there was evidence from which a jury might find that persons who, like the plaintiff, were entitled to use the adjoining property as tenants or licencees of the owner, were likely in the ordinary course to be sufficiently near the excavation to make that excavation, in the absence of any warning or protection, a real danger to them while in the exercise of their rights.\nIs it an answer to the prima facie case thus established that the excavation was made by Reid or with his authority on his own land and in the exercise of his right to the ordinary enjoyment of that land?\nThe respondent's reply first, that the making of the excavation had the effect of depriving the adjoining land of its natural support, and no other support having been substituted, the excavation itself was a contravention of the adjoining proprietor's right to lateral support for his land; and secondly, that the acts of Reid and his contractor and workmen were not acts done in the ordinary enjoyment of Reid's rights as proprietor, but that in the special circumstances of the case the excavation, although done on Reid's own land, obviously constituted a danger in the absence of a protection or warning to persons who might, without knowledge of its existence, be in the vicinity of it after dark, and that these circumstances imposed upon those who were responsible for the excavation a duty to provide such protection or such warning.\nUpon the first point I do not think it is necessary to pass. I cannot refrain from observing, however, that in the extreme form in which the point was presented by counsel for the appellants I can find very little in any of the authorities cited to give countenance to it. Counsel contended that the presence of the owner in person would amount to the imposition of an \"artificial\" weight upon the land in respect of which his right to lateral support from his neighbour's land would cease to be operative.\nConsider the case of the surface owner and subjacent proprietor where the right of support is of the same character. The surface owner is entitled to the support of the surface in its natural state, on the ground, as Lord Campbell said in Humphries v. Brogden[12], that otherwise the surface property could not be \"securely enjoyed as property\"; a reason which would seem to be broad enough at least to extend to the case in which the owner is in person upon the land doing some necessary act for the assertion or protection of his rights. I can at all events entertain little doubt that Lord Selborne, in Dalton v. Angus[13], in speaking of \"that which is artificially imposed upon the land \", which \" does not itself exist\" ex jure naturae, was not thinking of the person of the owner. I think it is unnecessary, however, to pass upon this point; and I shall assume that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the ground that the acts of the defendants did constitute a violation of the adjoining proprietor's right of lateral support.\nThe ground on which I think the appeal should be dismissed is this: A jury under a proper direction might have found that the situation, created by the excavation in the place in which it was, constituted, for the reasons above mentioned, in the absence of protection or warning, a danger to persons who might be present in the vicinity of it in the ordinary enjoyment without negligence of their right to be there under the authority of the owner of the adjoining property, and the circumstances under which the situation was created as disclosed by the evidence gave rise to a duty on the part of those concerned to provide such protection or warning.\nA fact of cardinal importance was deposed to by Mrs. Roberts, the plaintiff's landlady, namely, that there was a fence between her property and Reid's, and that this fence was taken down in course of the execution of the work complained of without her permission, with a promise to replace it that was never carried out. This evidence of Mrs. Roberts was not contradicted, and there was no cross-examination upon it. It was argued by Mr. McPhillips that it must be left out of consideration. But it is impossible to ignore it for the simple reason that, as I have mentioned already, the defendants are only (if at all) entitled to have the action dismissed upon the ground that from the evidence as it stands the only proper conclusion is that the plaintiff has no cause of action.\nIt is a reasonable assumption that the fence was where it ought to have been, namely, on the line between the two properties, and that fact is fatal to the contention that the appellants in creating the situation out of which the action arose were strictly limiting themselves to acts done in the ordinary enjoyment of Reid's proprietary rights.\nThere is indeed much force in the argument advanced on behalf of the respondents that even in the absence of the fence the law would have imposed upon the defendants the duty of taking proper measures to protect Mrs. Roberts and her tenants and licensees from the danger created by the existence of the excavation on the principle that there is a duty to give warning of dangers one creates which are not discernible by reasonable care by people whom one knows, or with reasonable care ought to know, may lawfully be in the vicinity of the danger so created.\nI respectfully concur in the opinion expressed by Scrutton, L.J. in Kimber's Case[14]. I think there is much to be said for the view that the principle of the highway cases (Hadley v. Taylor[15],for example) is properly applicable. A hole placed near the highway, if so near to the highway that a person lawfully using the highway and using it with ordinary caution, accidentally slipping, might fall into it, constitutes a nuisance to the highway and an actionable nuisance at the suit of a person injured by reason of its existence there. That is to say, the rights of the owner of land adjoining a highway are qualified by this, that he must not in the ordinary use of his land create a danger of such a character, and it is one of those cases to which Lord Campbell referred in Humphries v. Brogden in these words:\nThe books of reports abound with decisions restraining a man's acts upon and with his own property where the necessary or probable consequence of such acts is to do damage to others.\nWhy is the principle not applicable to qualify in like manner the rights of a proprietor of land whose property adjoins a private way? The decision in Corby v. Hill[16], (and particularly the judgment of Mr. Justice Willes), suggests that as regards the duty of persons engaged in a lawful work upon a way who creates a situation which in the absence of warning or protection is dangerous to persons using the way in a reasonable manner, there is no distinction between a public way and a private way; in both cases there is the duty to provide protection and warning imposed upon the person who creates the danger. Why should any distinction exist between a public way and a private way in respect of a danger created upon adjoining property? And if the duty arise in such circumstances is it not a duty resting upon principle, and is the principle not equally applicable where the dangerous condition of affairs arises from acts which are done by a proprietor upon his own land but immediately adjoining a place on his neighbour's property that is in common use and which may expose to risk of injury persons using it without negligence and without warning?\nI put the example on the argument of a foot path between the gate and the door of the owner of one of two adjoining houses and an excavation created without warning in midwinter immediately adjoining the footway by his neighbour. Can there be any distinction in principle between the case of the messenger boy who, after dark, slips and falls into the excavation, and the wayfarer who in like circumstances suffers a like mishap in passing along the public road? I can perceive no sound distinction between the two cases. I do not overlook the passage from the judgment of Lord Penzance in the case of Dalton v. Angus[17] cited by Mr. Justice Galliher, in which Lord Penzance says that if not bound by authority, he would have considered it no unreasonable application of principle to hold that an owner of land, if he desires to excavate it and does so in a quarter adjoining his neighbour's property, should be obliged to take measures to prevent the excavation resulting disastrously to his neighbour. The proposition suggested thus broadly cannot, of course, now be maintained consistently with the settled doctrines of the English law, but I think there is much to be said for the view that it would be no unreasonable application of the principle of Hadley v. Taylor[18] and like cases to hold that the appellants were under an obligation to Mrs. Roberts and her tenants and licensees to give warning of the excavation made on their own property. However that may be, it is, as I think, beyond dispute that the act of the defendants in removing the fence imposed upon them an obligation to provide something which would be an effective substitute.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff was tenant of part of a messuage on lot 18 and enjoyed, in common with other occupants of that lot, rights of user of a yard on the rear part of the lot, which abutted on a lane. The defendant, Reid, owned the adjoining lot, 17; his co-defendants were a contractor and sub-contractor, the latter of whom made an excavation for a building to be erected by the former for Reid on the rear of his lot. This excavation extended to the boundary between lots 17 and 18 and along the yard on lot 18.\nOn a dark night in February, the plaintiff, while lawfully passing through the yard, to reach his automobile, in which he intended to leave the premises via the lane, fell into the excavation on lot 17 and was seriously injured. A jury awarded him $5,000 damages and the judgment entered on that verdict against the three defendants was sustained as the result of an equal division in the Court of Appeal. The dissenting judges, Martin and McPhillips JJ. A. dealt with the case as one depending entirely on an alleged breach by the defendants of their duty to the owner and occupants of lot 18 not to deprive that lot of such lateral support as was necessary to sustain it in its natural state, which in their opinion meant without the addition of any superincumbent weight\u2014even that of a person lawfully walking upon it. They were of the opinion that since breach of the duty so defined had not been shown and the defendants owed no other duty to the plaintiff he could not recover.\nGalliher J. was of the opinion that, assuming that the earth near the edge of lot 18 had slipped under the plaintiff's weight as he deposed and as the jury was entitled to find it did, there had been such an interference with lateral support as would entail liability. Eberts J. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nAlthough otherwise presented in the pleadings, the case was submitted to the jury solely as one of negligence. As they were entitled to do under the law of British Columbia, they brought in a general verdict, ignoring certain specific questions put to them by the learned trial judge. While the verdict imports such findings as are necessary to support a judgment based on negligence, it leaves us in the highly unsatisfactory position of not knowing what views the jury took on several questions of fact which were distinctly in issue. For instance, whether the plaintiff's fall was due to the earth on lot 18 near the edge of the excavation giving way under his weight or to his inadvertently, but not negligently, stepping over the boundary and into the hole, as the evidence that the bank or side of the excavation was found intact on the following morning suggests; and whether the defendants had removed a fence between the two properties, are matters of importance. But, inasmuch as the verdict may have been based on the view that the defendants owed to the plaintiff a duty either to warn him of the existence of the excavation or to guard him as one of the lawful users of lot 18 against the danger of falling into it by erecting barriers or placing warning lights, we would not, I think, be justified in assuming either that the plaintiff's fall was in fact attributable to a withdrawal of whatever lateral support the defendants were legally bound to leave, or that a trap had been created by the removal of a fence on the presence of which, as marking the boundary of lot 18, the plaintiff had been wont and was entitled to rely.\nWe must, however, assume that the jury found some breach of duty amounting to actionable negligence on the part of the defendants and that they negatived contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, probably accepting his story that he was wholly ignorant of the existence of the excavation.\nCounsel for the defendants frankly conceded the hopelessness of attempting to re-open the issue of contributory negligence, but he insisted that there was no evidence on which the jury could properly have found negligence on the part of the defendants, maintaining that their only duty was not to take away such lateral support as the law required them to leave for lot 18; that that would not include support for the land plus the weight of a person walking upon it; and that in any event, there was no finding that subsidence of the earth on lot 18 was the cause of the plaintiff's fall. With the contention last stated I am disposed to agree and consequently am not prepared to uphold the judgment in so far as it rests on deprivation of lateral support.\nHaving regard to the evidence of the known user of the yard by the occupants of lot 18 and by persons having business with them, and especially to the fact that the defendant Reid deposed that it was used as a back entrance to the buildings on lot 18\u2014a trades entrance\u2014the jury, in my opinion, was entitled to find that it was incumbent on the defendants in the exercise of ordinary prudence to make reasonable provision for safeguarding a person lawfully using the yard on lot 18, as the plaintiff did, against the obvious danger of falling into the excavation which they had made immediately adjoining it by taking some means for that purpose such as the erection of a barrier or the placing of danger lights or other reasonably efficient means of protection or warning. In this view it is immaterial whether the plaintiff's fall was due to the earth along the edge giving way under his weight or to his having accidently over-stepped the boundary line.\nThere was in this case no absolute duty to guard independently of negligence, such as exists where an excavation is adjacent to a highway and the maintenance of it unprotected is unlawful, a nuisance and indictable. Hardcastle v. South Yorkshire Railway Co.[19]; Beven on Negligence, p. 360. But the right of the defendants to excavate as they did, like other rights of using property, was subject to the qualification implied in the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. Their right to excavate as they did is unquestioned; but the exercise of that right entailed an obligation to do for the protection of those who they knew might be expected to make use of the adjoining yard what a prudent and reasonable man would regard as requisite, or usually sufficient, to prevent a person using ordinary care from falling into the excavation while moving about the yard as was customary.\nAlthough neither of them is upon its facts at all directly in point, in two cases I find expressions of judicial opinion which indicate this duty. In re Williams v. Groucott[20], Blackburn J. said:\nLooking at the general rule of law that a man is bound to use his property so as not to injure his neighbour, it seems to me that when a party alters things from their normal condition so as to render them dangerous to already acquired rights, the law casts on him the obligation of fencing the danger, in order that it shall not be injurious to those rights.\nIn Hawken v. Shearer[21], Mathew J. said:\nIt appears to me that the true principle has been well laid down in Groucott v. Williams, which is this, that where an alteration has been made in the normal state of things, calculated to cause injury to a neighbour, an obligation is cast upon the person who makes such an alteration to protect his neighbour from injury.\nAnd Cave J. said:\nA man may dig a pit in the middle of his own field, and leave it unfenced, but if he does so at the side of the road he must fence it and if he alters an existing state of things whereby he makes a highway dangerous, he is liable for any accident occasioned by such alteration. No doubt there are certain limitations to this general principle *** But it equally applies to the case of an adjoining owner.\nThe same principle underlies statements of the Lords Justices in the recent case of Kimber v. Gas, Light and Coke Co.[22]. Bankes L.J. said (page 445),\nIf a person creates a dangerous condition of things (something in the nature of a concealed trap), whether in a public highway, or on his own premises, or on those of another, and he sees some other person who to his knowledge is unaware of the existence of the danger lawfully exposing himself or about to expose himself to the danger which he has created, he is under a duty to give such person a warning. There may be cases. in which the duty exists though actual knowledge of the danger may not be brought home to the person charged with negligence *** The duty arises quite independently of the occupation of the premises. It does not arise out of any invitation or licence. It is not a case of mere omission. The duty arises out of the combination of all the circumstances.\nScrutton L.J. said (p. 446),\nIt is clear that persons lawfully doing work which interferes with a public right, as contractors opening the highway, must use reasonable care not to injure persons lawfully using the highway, which would include taking reasonable precautions to warn such persons of dangers created by the contractor which the passer-by could not with reasonable care discover. But it is said the case is different when the work is done on private premises in which the contractor has no proprietary or possessory interest and on which he is only a licensee of the owner. The contractor's duty it was said was only, not actively and negligently to injure other persons on the premises, as by carelessly dropping hammers on their heads, and included no duty to warn them of dangers, even hidden ones, which the contractor's work had created *** There are of course cases where there is moral culpability, but no legal liability. A sees B, a blind man, walking along a highway straight into a pond and gives him no warning, A is not legally liable for he is under no legal duty to B. But if A has himself made the hole in the highway, he is under legal liability at once: Penny v. Wimbledon Urban Council[23]. I cannot see that it makes any difference that B is a person lawfully on private premises where A has made the hole or that A is under a duty as to his acts towards B such as not to hit him with his tools, different from his duty to warn B of dangers A has created which are not discernable by reasonable care on the part of B. It is A's duty to carry on his work with due precautions for the safety of those whom he knows, or ought reasonably to know, may be lawfully in the vicinity of his work; and the most obvious precaution would be to warn B, who is going towards the hidden danger A has created.\nSee also 21 Hals. L. of E. pars. 888 and 896.\nThere was in my opinion evidence on which it was competent for the jury to find that the defendants owed to the plaintiff the duty of safeguarding him against, or at least of taking reasonable means to warn him of the existence of, the danger they had created. Failure to discharge that duty, if it existed, is not questioned. The verdict of the jury implies both the existence of the duty and the omission to discharge it, constituting actionable negligence.\nThe case is not one of so-called casual or collateral negli- gence on the part of the sub-contractor. The making of the excavation as contracted for up to the boundary line necessarily involved creating the hazardous situation. The owner and his contractor were bound to see that reasonable protection was provided. They did not avoid responsibility by entrusting the work to a sub-contractor, however reputable, even though they expressly stipulated for effectual precautions being taken by him.\nIf the fall of the plaintiff into the excavation was due to the negligence of the defendants, the fact that in so falling he became an involuntary trespasser cannot avail them as an answer to his claim.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that the judgment appealed from should be sustained.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This action was brought by Linnell to recover damages which he suffered by falling into an excavation in the lot immediately adjoining the lot on which he was a part sub-lessee. He claims the excavation should have been shored up and should not have been left without fence, railing or warning lights.\nThe lot on which the excavation was made is called lot 17, and the adjoining lot on which Linnell resided is called lot 18. Lot 17 belonged to the defendant Reid, and the other defendants, Fisher and Campbell, were respectively contractors and sub-contractors for this excavation.\nThe plaintiff Linnell had the right to be at the place where the accident happened. He was going through the yard of his residence, in a dark night, to deposit some garbage in cans lying in the yard; and, when he was near the excavation, the ground being likely loosened by frost, gave way under the weight of the plaintiff. A question of contributory negligence was raised against Linnell; but the jury, by returning a general verdict, has evidently discarded the contention of contributory negligence.\nThe defendants contend that there was no duty imposed by law upon them to guard the excavation against persons lawfully using lot 18.\nIt is settled beyond question that an owner is entitled to have his soil supported in its \"natural state\" and as an incident to the land itself. Dalton v. Angus[24]. It does not mean however that this right to lateral support should be considered as a right to have the adjoining soil remain in its natural state, but a right, as said by Lord Blackburn in the case of Dalton v. Angus[25],\nto have the benefit of support, which is infringed as soon as and not until damage is sustained in consequence of the withdrawal of that support.\nLord Penzance, in the same case, said that\nit would be, I think, no unreasonable application of the principle sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas to hold that the owner of the adjacent Boil should take reasonable precautions by way of shoring or otherwise to prevent the excavation from disastrously affecting his neighbour.\nIn the present case, the contract of Mr. Reid, the owner of the property, with his contractors, provided specifically for lights and railings being provided in order to avoid any accident. Nothing of the kind was done. This provision of the contract shows conclusively that precautions of that kind were needed and that their omission was not a prudent act. None of these precautions were taken. The contract was in that respect violated.\nEvery man may use his own land for all lawful purpose without being answerable for the consequences, provided he exercises ordinary care and skill to prevent any unnecessary injury to the adjacent land owner.\nIf in this case the defendants had taken the precaution of doing what their contract provided for, the accident of which the plaintiff was the victim would have been avoided.\nIt has been contended in that respect by the defendant Reid, the owner, that he is not liable for the injuries received by the plaintiff as a result of negligent acts of the other defendants who were independent contractors, and he was not liable for the collateral or casual negligence of an independent contractor.\nThis point has been fully considered in the case of Dalton v. Angus[26], and I may then in that respect quote the following passage from the opinion of Lord Blackburn which shows conclusively that the defendant Reid's contention is not well founded:\nEver since Quarman v. Burnett[27], it has been considered settled law that one employing another is not liable for his collateral negligence unless the relation of master and servant existed between. them, so that a person employing a contractor to do work is not liable for the negligence of that contractor or his servants. On the other hand, a person causing something to be done, the doing of which casts on him a duty, cannot escape from the responsibility attaching on him of seeing that duty performed by delegating it to a contractor.\nLord Buckley, in Robinson v. Beaconsfield Rural District Council[28], expressed the same view in the following terms:\nEven if the council had contracted for the discharge of this duty, they would have remained liable to the plaintiffs for the contractors' failure to perform the duty.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This case has been somewhat confused by the appellants treating it as if it involved a question of support of land, and by the respondent applying to it the rules governing the liability for allowing an obstruction or an excavation to be on a highway or in close proximity thereto.\nThe real question is whether an owner who makes an excavation on his own property extending to the boundary line of the neighbouring property, there being no fence between the two properties, is under any duty to persons whom he knows are likely to pass to and fro on the adjoining property to protect the excavation by railings or barriers or to place a light over it at night in order to prevent accidents.\nThe appellant Reid was the owner of a lot of land known as no. 17, with a building fronting on Granville Street, Vancouver. The neighbouring property, no. 18, with a building also fronting on Granville Street, was occupied by several tenants or sub-tenants, the respondent being one of the latter. In the rear of both buildings was a vacant piece of land, there being apparently no fence between the two properties, and behind the vacant land was a public lane. In the rear of the building on the neighbouring property was a stairway leading to the second story and this stairway, as well as the vacant land, to the knowledge of Reid, was used as a means of egress and ingress by the tenants of the neighbouring property and by persons whose business brought them there. Reid decided to build on the rear of his property, and gave a contract for the building to the appellant Fisher. For that purpose it was necessary to excavate a trench up to the line between the two properties and the work of digging this trench was undertaken by the appellant Campbell. It was a condition of the specifications accompanying Reid's contract that the contractor would at all times maintain the necessary guards around the excavations and other places requiring them and all night lights, etc., so as to prevent accidents.\nOn the evening of the 10th of February, 1922, there being no railing on the side of the trench towards the property occupied by the respondent, nor a light over it, the respondent, when leaving the neighbouring building by the stairway and crossing the vacant space in the rear in order to reach a motor car waiting for him, fell into the trench and was badly injured. The night was dark and stormy and the respondent did not know, he says, that an excavation had been made on Reid's property, and, in fact, the digging had been commenced only two or three days before. The jury evidently believed the respondent's testimony, and having returned a general verdict for the respondent, instead of answering the questions submitted to them, (a most inconvenient practice, I must say, although permitted by statute), they must be taken to have found all necessary facts in the respondent's favour.\nThe appellants' theory\u2014they had no witnesses who could say how the accident happened\u2014was that the respondent walked into the excavation. The latter says that the ground gave way under his right foot and then he fell. This statement of the respondent has given rise to an interesting discussion on the law governing the support of land between neighbouring properties, but with all possible deference to the learned judges who thought otherwise, it is in my opinion unnecessary to express any opinion on this question. The legal problem which arises is the one I have stated above, and its solution depends on the answer given to the question whether the appellants owed any duty towards persons lawfully on the neighbouring property, and who, they knew, were likely to pass thereon in close proximity to the excavation, to guard the trench and have it lighted at night in order to prevent such an accident as that which occurred. No exactly parallel case has been cited, for different considerations apply to the highway cases and the question, I have said, is really not one of support of land. It may be admitted that Reid was within his rights when he dug the trench up to the boundary line of his property, as was also the respondent when he passed over the rear portion of the property at night in ignorance that an excavation had been made on the line of his neighbour's property. But rights of ownership and of enjoyment of property are not without certain limitations which the due protection of similar and co-equal rights renders necessary. The old maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas is an undoubted rule of law, although it must be applied with proper caution so as not to come in conflict with the equally venerable maxim qui jure suo utitur neminem laedit. Broom (Legal Maxims, 8th ed., p. 308) commenting on the rule sic utere tuo, etc., lays down five propositions which he deduces from the decided cases. I will cite the two first.\n1. It is, prima facie, competent to any man to enjoy and deal with his own property as he chooses.\n2. He must, however, so enjoy and use it as not to affect injuriously the rights of others.\nThe respondent among other cases cited the recent decision of the English Court of Appeal in Kimber v. Gas, Light and Coke Co.[29]. In that case workmen, in repairing an old building and converting it into two dwellings, had left a hole in the floor of a dark landing, and the plaintiff, who visited the building during the work, under a permit with the view of renting the upper portion, and was admitted by the workmen but not warned of the existence of the hole, fell into the hole and recovered damages against the contractor. I find stated in the judgments there a legal principle which can be applied in a case like the one under consideration. I quote from the language of Scrutton, L.J., at p. 447:\nIt is A's duty (A is a person carrying on work, and, ex hypothesi, lawfully doing so) to carry on his work with due precautions for the safety of those whom he knows, or ought reasonably to know, may be lawfully in the vicinity of his work.\nScrutton L.J., very pertinently cites the remark of Lord Macnaghten that the plainer a proposition is the harder it often is to find judicial authority for it. The learned Lord Justice indeed goes as far back as Corby v. Hill,[30] to support his proposition. Corby v. Hill[31] was the case of building materials placed on a private road by a builder with leave of the owner, and the builder was held liable to the plaintiff whose horse was injured by coming in contact with the obstruction.\nIn deciding that Reid and his contractors and workmen were under a duty towards persons lawfully passing on the neighbouring property to guard the excavation he had dug out up to the boundary of his land, I am unconscious of unduly stretching the rule I have just quoted. Although I have not found any absolutely parallel case, I think this is a most reasonable, and, I may add, a common sense application of the old maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas. Such an excavation on a dark night was a real trap. Moreover the specifications had directed that guards should be placed around it, and this shows that such a precaution was considered reasonable by the parties themselves. In my opinion, the liability of the appellants for not having properly guarded his excavation cannot be questioned.\nMr. McPhillips argued that the respondent's action was framed as an action based on a nuisance and that the learned trial judge dealt with it in his charge to the jury as an action of negligence. I think however that the statement of claim sufficiently alleges the negligence of the appellants to stand as an action in tort.\nThere is no trespass established here. The respondent was where he was entitled to be when he fell into the trench.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Senkler, Buell & Van Horne.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

Duff J. contra; Davies C.J. and Anglin J. expressing no opinion, although Anglin J. semble in the affirmative.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that, on the assumption that section 14 did apply, there is nothing in it to extend the limited and clearly defined powers of the respondent company under \"The Rural Telephone Act.\"\nPer Davies C.J. and Mignault J.\u2014The word \"capacities\" in the second part of section 14 does not mean \"powers.\"\nPer Duff J.\u2014The effect of section 14 as regards the extraprovincial capacities of companies to which it applies is to establish as a rule of construction the rule laid down by Blackburn J. in the Ashbury Company's Case (L.R. 7 H.L. 653) but held by the House of Lords in that case not to be applicable to companies incorporated under \"The Companies Act\" of 1862, the rule being that companies affected by it have prima facie all the capacities of a natural person but subject to all restrictions created expressly or by necessary implication by any statutory enactment by which such companies are governed. Section 14 does not apply to companies incorporated for the purpose of working a rural telephone system under \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" since the memorandum of association of such a company must be read as incorporating the restrictions upon the capacities of such a company to be found in \"The Rural Telephone Act\" which by necessary implication exclude the operation of section 14 in relation to such companies.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Under the provisions of \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" the respondent company already possessed for the purposes for which it was incorporated all \"actual powers and rights\" and the fullest \"capacity\" which the legislature could bestow (Honsberger v. Weyburn Townsite Co., 59 Can. S.C.R. 281) ; and section 14 did not add anything to such \"capacity.\"\nPer Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The corporate powers and capacity of the respondent company rest upon \"The Companies Act\" entirely, and section 14 impliedly gives to it the capacity and power to make promissory notes.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1922] 2 W.W.R. 1211) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] reversing the judgment of Bigelow J. at the trial[2] and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThis was an action on a promissory note for $5,407.50 made by the respondent company, payable on demand to one George Foley and indorsed by him to the appellant bank.\nOn the trial, the principal defence raised on behalf of the respondent company was that making the promissory note was beyond the powers of the company.\nF. F. MacDermid for the appellant.\nF. A. Sheppard for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The single question in this appeal is whether the respondent company did or did not have the power to make the promissory note in question.\nThe respondent is a non-trading corporation organized under \"The Rural Telephone Act\" of Saskatchewan (see Statutes of Saskatchewan 1912-13, c. 33, since repealed by 1918-19, c. 46) for a specific purpose. As such it had no power to make a promissory note. Bateman v. Mid-Wales Railway Co.[3]. That act provided explicitly for the manner in which it could raise or borrow the necessary moneys required to carry out its object and purpose, viz., by debentures. Every step the organized company had to take had to be approved of by the Minister and the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nAfter being organized under \"The Rural Telephone Act\" it became incorporated under \"The Companies Act\" of Saskatchewan and the question at once arises whether such incorporation conferred upon it the power, under section 14 of that Act, to do what it could not do before and make the promissory note in question. That section reads as follows:\u2014\nEvery company heretofore or hereafter created (a) by or under the authority of any general or special ordinance of the North West Territories; or, (b) under any general or special Act of this legislature; shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed in a special Act, or ordinance, incorporating it or in a memorandum of association thereof, have and be deemed to have had since incorporation the capacity of a natural person to accept extra-provincial powers and rights, and to exercise its powers beyond the boundaries of the province and to the extent to which the laws in force where such powers are sought to be exercised permit; and unless the contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating the company or in a memorandum of association thereof, such incorporation shall, so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned, have and be deemed to have had the same effect as if the company were or had been incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal.\nThe question arises under the second part of this section and really is whether the words\nsuch incorporation shall so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned\nextend to or embrace \"powers\" not given to it by its organization under \"The Rural Telephone Act.\" I do not think they do. Lord Haldane in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King[4] drew a clear and broad distinction between \"capacities\" and \"powers.\" I frankly say that I do not clearly understand what the word \"capacities\" in the second part of the above section really means. But I am satisfied it does not embrace \"powers.\" The language used is very precise in expressing the intention of the legislature as it says \"so far as capacities\" of such companies are concerned, which to my mind impliedly excludes \"powers.\" Unless, therefore, the word \"capacities \"is construed in this section as embracing \"powers\" I cannot see how it can apply to extend the limited and clearly defined powers of the company under \"The Rural Telephone Act.\"\nIn the view I take of the meaning and extent of \"The Companies Act\" above quoted it is not necessary for me to express any opinion with respect to the ground on which the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan based its judgment, viz. that section 14 of \"The Companies Act\" does not apply to companies created under \"The Rural Telephone Act.\"\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent was duly incorporated on the 8th of May, 1918, under and by virtue of the Saskatchewan Act known as \"The Companies Act.\" The memorandum of association presented as the basis of such incorporation in compliance with sections 5 and 6 of said Act, stated that\nthe object for which the company is established is the construction, maintenance and operation of a telephone system.\nIn the course of carrying on its business within the limits of the said object it had become indebted to one Foley and as the result of a settlement between him and respondent of their said dealings it was agreed that the said indebtedness amounted to the sum of $5,407.50, and therefore the respondent gave on the 12th of June, 1920, to said Foley its promissory note payable on demand to the order of said Foley for the said amount.\nHe discounted same with the appellant shortly after and thus it became in due course the holder thereof.\nThe respondent's authorities, upon payment being demanded by appellant, professed to have discovered that a mistake had been made in the amount due said Foley and that the amount of said promissory note exceeded by a considerable sum what was actually due said Foley, and refused payment.\nThis action was brought by appellant to recover the amount of said promissory note.\nThe respondent in answer thereto pleaded amongst other things its incorporation and, what it contends in law, that the making of said note was beyond the powers of the said company.\nIt was conceded at the trial that the appellant was the holder of said promissory note in due course and entitled, under the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" to recover if the respondent could be held to have given it within its power and capacity to make same.\nThe learned trial judge overruled this defence and entered judgment for the amount claimed.\nHe relied upon an amendment originally enacted in 1917, in the following words:\u2014\n13 (a). Every company heretofore or hereafter created:\n(a) by or under the authority of any general or special ordinance of the North West Territories; or (b) by or under the authority of The Companies Act, being chapter 72 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, or under this Act or any Act that may hereafter be substituted therefor; or\n(c) under any general or special Act of this legislature; shall, unless \"a contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance, incorporating it or in a memorandum of association, thereof, have and be deemed to have had since incorporation the capacity of a natural person to accept extraprovincial powers and rights, and to exercise its powers beyond the boundaries of the province to the extent to which the laws in force where such powers are sought to be exercised permit; and unless the contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating the company or in a memorandum of association thereof, such incorporation shall, so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned, have and be deemed to have had the same effect as if the company were or had been incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal.\nThis in substance is now section 14 of chapter 76 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1920.\nThe learned trial judge quoted the last sentence as the essential part thereof, in which I agree, but owing to the Court of Appeal having dealt with same from another angle of vision, to which I am about to refer, I quote the entire amendment. He seemed to rely upon the decision of the Ontario Appellate Division in the case of Edwards v. Blackmore[5], in which it had to consider a similar enactment.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed said judgment, holding that the said amendment could not be made applicable to the case of the respondent.\nThe learned Chief Justice referred to \"The Rural Telephone Act\" of Saskatchewan as being that under which respondent was organized.\nI, with great respect, cannot adopt his reasoning.\nThe corporate powers and capacity of the respondent rest upon \"The Companies Act\" entirely, and the amendments thereto made by the legislature of Saskatchewan so expressly, as above, were such as no one can properly discard. It impliedly gave the capacity and power to make a promissory note.\nThat legislature had given, by \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" certain jurisdiction over the respondent and its like creatures to the Minister named, as it was quite competent for the said legislature to enact, and thereby it limited the borrowing powers of such creations as respondent. I have read the said \"Rural Telephone Act\" to see if it said anything therein as to the power of the respondent to give a promissory note for anything else than borrowed money, and I fail to find anything therein touching the power to make a promissory note for anything else than borrowed money and even that only impliedly in section 31.\nThis note now in question was not given for borrowed money. Therefore I fail to see how its powers in regard : to what is here in question can be held to be in any way touched by the provisions of \"The Rural Telephone Act.\"\nI submit that even if there had been any such provisions in said Act it was quite competent for the legislature to have modified all that.\nIt has not done more than declare, as set forth in the above quoted section, that unless a contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating it, or in a memorandum of association thereof certain new capacities are to be given to the corporate creations of \"The Companies Act.\"\nThere was no special Act incorporating it. Its incorporation was solely within the powers given therefor by \"The Companies Act,\" and there was nothing in the memorandum of association by which that expressed a contrary intention.\nThe fact that such men as the promoters of such an association required the sanction or approval of a certain minister as preliminary to such an application does not constitute that as part of the memorandum of association.\nI submit it is the plain meaning of the language used that must govern us and not something imaginary as result of a metaphysical train of reasoning that we have to deal with.\nThe later enactments when expressed plainly always should overrule the prior enactments of the same legislature. If the latter has erred that is the court to go to.\nI respectfully submit that to uphold and give effect to the judgment appealed from instead of leaving the matter to the legislature we would run grave danger of doing more harm than any good to be gained by defeating what as regards Foley may be an unfounded claim.\nMoreover, I am unable to understand how the respondent can get away from the effect of sections 113 and 114 of \"The Companies Act\" as it now stands, and has stood in otherwise numbered sections.\nThere may be some explanation that I have failed to discover, for the point was not made clear in argument, though appellant's factum refers to a section 98 which, unless one of these sections is what it meant, I cannot understand.\nThe references of respondent to section 117 dealing with borrowed money is beside the question and should have been left aside for we are not concerned with borrowed money.\nAs to the Edwards Case[6] relied upon by the learned trial judge I do not see how it helps us herein or if the converse view had been taken how it could hinder us. It turned upon an Ontario amendment to its \"Companies Act\" each respectively framed quite differently from the Saskatchewan \"Companies Act\" and the amendment thereto now in question herein.\nI think this appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014The crucial question concerns the effect of section 14 of \"The Companies Act.\" I have reached two conclusions as to the effect of that section : first, it does not, as I think, apply to the respondent company; secondly, on the assumption that it did apply, there is nothing in it to exclude the express and implied prohibition touching the exercise of the company's capacities and powers to be found in \"The Rural Telephone Act.\" As to the first point. Section 14 is in the following words:\nEvery company heretofore or hereafter created :\n(a) by or under the authority of any general or special ordinance of the Northwest Territories; or,\n(b) under any general or special Act of this legislature; shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed in a special Act, or ordinance, incorporating it or in a memorandum of association thereof, have and be deemed to have had since incorporation the capacity of a natural person to accept extraprovincial powers and rights, and to exercise its powers beyond the boundaries of the province and to the extent to which the laws in force where such powers are sought to be exercised permit; and unless the contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating the company or in a memorandum of association thereof, such incorporation shall, so far as the capacities of su eh companies are concerned, have and be deemed to have had the same effect as if the company were or had been incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal. 1917, c. 34, s. 42 (3).\nA rural telephone company, by which phrase I shall designate a company incorporated for the purpose of working a rural telephone system under \"The Rural Telephones Act,\" is a company incorporated and organized under the joint authority of \"The Rural Telephones Act\" and \"The Companies Act.\" The first step in the proceedings is a petition to the Minister charged with the administration of the Act, in which are set forth a description of the proposed system, in accordance with the regulations of the department, a statement of the amount of capital proposed, evidence that a majority of the resident occupants who may be charged or taxed under the Act are to be shareholders of the company, and that a minimum sum in cash amounting to five dollars per pole mile of the system as described in the specifications has been actually raised. The Minister may in his discretion grant the prayer of the petition and permit the petitioners to organize a company for the purpose of working the system, and then, and then only, is it competent to these persons to proceed to incorporation for that purpose under \"The Companies Act.\"\nThe design of the statute is to produce a scheme by which the inhabitants of rural districts may combine in a company to provide a telephone system for the benefit of the district and to raise the necessary funds by debentures charged upon lands adjoining the system. The general plan is that every person having a telephone connection with the system is a shareholder in the company, that everybody is entitled to have such connection who is a resident occupant along the line of the system, and that all property actually or presumptively accommodated by the presence of the system is chargeable with the payment of moneys raised in the first instance for construction and is taxable for the purpose of meeting the interest on such moneys.\nThe authority given by the Minister is an authority to incorporate a company for the purpose of constructing and working such a system under the provisions of the Act. It is a strictly limited authority, to establish a co-operative telephone system under the conditions prescribed by the Act and to use therefor the machinery of incorporation provided by \"The Companies Act.\" It is most important to note also that the permission of the Minister is an essential part of the proceedings for incorporation under \"The Companies Act.\" By section 44 of \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" 1912, no company can be incorpprated under \"The Companies Act\" for the purpose of working a, telephone system without the sanction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council unless the proceedings prescribed by \"The Rural Telephone Act\" have been taken. Every memorandum of association, therefore, of a company to be incorporated under the authority of \"The Rural Telephone Act\" strictly ought to shew on its face that it is a company to be incorporated under the permission of the Minister for the establishment of the system sanctioned by the Minister; and every such memorandum of association must, in my judgment, be read, however general its language may be, as incorporating by reference the objects of the company as shewn by the petition and the permission of the Minister. The certificate of incorporation of the respondent company correctly refers to the company as a company \"organized under the provisions\" of \"The Rural Telephone Act.\"\nI find little difficulty in concluding, when the matter is looked upon in this way, that the memorandum of association does contain or must be deemed in law to contain within the meaning of section 14, an expression of the \"contrary intention\" which excludes the operation of that section. The learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan has called attention to the fact that the objects of the company under \"The Rural Telephone Act\" are territorially limited in the strictest way. The area within which the system is to operate is fixed by the Minister; no extension of the system is permitted without the authority of the Minister; and it is only such a company which, through the machinery of \"The Companies Act,\" the memorandum of association, and so on, can be given corporate capacity to work a rural telephone system. It obviously follows that that part of section 14 which gives to certain companies capacity to acquire extra-provincial powers and rights to an unlimited extent can have no application to such companies. Nor can the other limb of the section be applied. The objects as stated in the memorandum of association, if correctly stated (or perhaps one ought to say, in the memorandum of association as one must interpret it in light of the special provisions of \"The Rural Telephone Act\" already referred to), are objects limited in such a way as necessarily to exclude the idea of a general capacity such as that acquired by a company incorporated by letters patent.\nAssuming, however, that companies incorporated under \"The Rural Telephone Act\" are not excluded by the express language of section 14 from the operation of that section, I should still be disposed to think that the effect of \"The Rural Telephone Act\" was to restrict the powers of companies organized under it in such a way as to exclude the capacity to create negotiable instruments generally.\nIn order to get a just conception of the purview of this section, it is necessary to bear in mind that it was passed in consequence of the decision of the Privy Council in the Bonanza Creek Company's Case[7], and it is important, I think, to note one or two points in the judgment of the Judicial Committee delivered by Lord Haldane in that case. The company whose powers were there under consideration was an Ontario company incorporated by letters patent and governed by the Ontario Companies Act.\nHis Lordship, in the course of his judgment, pointed out that the effect of the decision of the House of Lords in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[8] was that a company deriving its existence solely from statute must be deemed to have only such capacities as those conferred upon it either expressly or by implication by the language of the statute creating it. In such a case it is not admissible to treat the words creating the corporation as conferring upon it all the capacities of a corporation at common law, subject only to such restrictions as may be found in the statute, as the legislature has not in view in such a case a common law corporation, but only its own creature. It is wrong, in answering the question what powers the corporation possesses when incorporated exclusively by statute, to start by assuming the legislature meant to create a company with a capacity resembling that of a natural person, such as a corporation created by charter would have at common law, and then to ask whether there are words in the statute which take away the incidents of such a corporation.\nAnd this, His Lordship says, is the error into which the House of Lords held that Blackburn J., as he then was, had fallen in his judgment in the Exchequer Chamber. But His Lordship points out, at page 578, that although the assumption that the legislature had a common law corporation in view may be wrong, because the language of the statute may not\nwarrant the inference that it has done more than concern itself with its own creature,\nnevertheless\nthe language may be such as to shew an intention to confer on the corporation the general capacity which the common law ordinarily attaches to corporations created by charter. In such a case a construction like that adopted by Blackburn J. will be the true one.\nThe effect of section 14 is, as I think, to bring the companies to which it applies within the principle thus enunciated by Lord Haldane. It is difficult indeed to escape the conclusion that it was precisely this passage in Lord Haldane's exposition which the legislature had in view in enacting section 14.\nAnd what is the result? If we turn to the judgment of Blackburn J., in the Exchequer Chamber[9], there is this passage:\nI do not entertain any doubt that if, on the true construction of a statute creating a corporation, it appears to be the intention of the legislature, expressed or implied, that the corporation shall not enter into a particular contract, every court, whether of law or equity, is bound to treat a contract entered into contrary to the enactment as illegal, and therefore wholly void; and to hold that a contract wholly void cannot be ratified.\nAnd at p. 264 he formulates thus the question that must be answered:\nDoes the statute creating the corporation by express provision, or necessary implication, shew an intention in the legislature to prohibit, and so avoid the making of, a contract of this particular kind?\nThe effect, then, of section 14 upon the companies to which it applies is not to abrogate entirely the doctrine of ultra vires but to establish a rule of construction which in effect is that such companies are to be deemed to have the capacities of a common law corporation, subject to such restrictions as the legislature has evidenced an intention of imposing upon it. In declaring in section 14 that the companies referred to are to have the capacities of a common law corporation, the legislature cannot be supposed ; to have intended to abrogate the restrictions and prohibitions which the legislature itself has shewn an intention to impose upon such companies. A company created by charter, as Lord Haldane points out at pp. 582-3, is necessarily subject to the restrictions imposed upon it by the legislature, and where the enactment imposing such restrictions evinces an intention that a given transaction shall not be entered into, then any attempt on the part of the company to enter into such a transaction must be inoperative in law. Lord Haldane's judgment, as I read it, gives the sanction of his approval to the principle expressed in the first of the passages quoted above from Blackburn J., in those cases in which Blackburn J's principle of construction is properly applicable.\nIn this view I am disposed to think that there is ample evidence to be found in the provisions of \"The Rural Telephone Act\" of an intention to prohibit the giving of promissory notes and negotiable instruments generally by rural telephone companies; and consequently that on the assumption upon which we have been proceeding, the promissory notes in question must be held not to have been the promissory notes of the company.\nIt is desirable, I think, to refer before taking the leave of the case to the point which was made on the argument that the whole of section 14 is limited to the capacity to acquire extra-provincial powers and rights. I may say at once that such a reading appears to me to involve the deletion of the second limb of the section. Evidence could be accumulated indefinitely of the use of the words \"corporate capacity\" to describe the powers of companies and other corporations to enter into contracts, make promissory notes and do other acts in the law. In his judgment in the Bonanza Company's Case[10], Lord Haldane draws a distinction between \"capacities\" and \"actual powers and rights\" which for his purpose is, of course, a most useful and illuminating one; because he is there dealing with the validity of acts which depend for their validity upon two coefficients\u2014the capacity of a corporation derived from the law from which it takes its being, and the power and right of the corporation to exercise its capacities in a territory where that law is without authority; and the words of section 14 \"capacity * * * to accept extraprovincial powers and rights\" are natural and appropriate to that part of this section which deals exclusively with such \"powers and rights.\" The distinction may come into play in cases where the respective jurisdictions are not marked off by territorial delimitation; such, for example, as the case of a Dominion corporation seeking to acquire land in a province deriving its \"capacity\" in the sense in which Lord Haldane uses the word, from the Dominion, and its right to exercise that capacity from the province which requires a license in mortmain, or in the case of a provincial corporation executing a bill of exchange or promissory note. The law which recognizes a bill of exchange or promissory note made by an artificial person as a good bill or note is a Dominion law while the capacity to make such instruments is a capacity which the corporation could derive from the province alone.\nBut there is, of course, nothing in Lord Haldane's judgment throwing a doubt upon the propriety and aptitude of the phrase \"corporate capacity\" sanctioned by the widest and most inveterate usage; as applied to the power now in question.\nIt has been suggested, indeed, that the words, \"as far as the capacities of such companies are concerned\" are on this view superfluous. What I have already said will sufficiently indicate that in my opinion they are far from superfluous; on the contrary they indicate a deliberate intention to adopt for the purpose of determining the capacities of such companies the principle of construction laid down by Blackburn J., as explained by Lord Haldane. And indeed a moment's reflection shews that the use of some such phraseology was necessary in order to confine the effect of the enactment by reference to the purpose the legislature had in view. One rule of law, for example,, touching common law corporations which it might very well have been thought desirable to avoid is the rule that subjects a corporation created by letters patent which has infringed some provision of its charter to proceedings in scire facias for the recall of the charter. The jurisdiction of the courts in such cases at common law is strictly confined to corporations created by matter of record. The Queen v. Hughes[11]. The effect of the omission of the words in question might very well have raised a serious point as to whether or not in addition to the statutable machinery for the winding-up of companies created by special Act or under the \"Companies Act\" the common law procedure by scire facias would have been available. I do not pursue the point. I mention this as one example of the things which it may have been desired to avoid by the use of these words.\nAlthough not suggested on the argument, a point has arisen as to the effect of sections 112 to 114 of \"The Companies Act.\"\nI shall state with brevity and directness my view upon this point. I infer from Form A, which gives the general form of memorandum of association, that the statute contemplates, in cases in which the power to make negotiable instruments is not by implication involved in the statement of the principal object or objects of the company arid this power is intended to be taken, that it shall be taken by express words in the memorandum of association.\nThe sections mentioned are not to be read as enacting that every company\u2014an athletic association, for example,\u2014formed under \"The Companies Act,\" is to have the capacity to create negotiable instruments, even though the memorandum of association be silent upon the subject.\nWhere the memorandum of association is silent upon the subject, then the question of the existence or non-existence of the capacity is to be solved by answering the question whether a grant of the power is implied in the stater ment of the objects of the company and the other provisions of the memorandum. I have already said sufficient to shew that in my opinion a memorandum of association containing, as the memorandum now before us contains, no statement as to the company's objects except the statement that the company is formed to construct and to work a rural telephone system, does not give such a power by implication.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Whether the giving of a promissory note for an indebtedness admittedly incurred in carrying out the purpose for which it was incorporated was ultra vires of the respondent company is the question before us on this appeal.\nIncorporated in 1918 under the Saskatchewan \"Companies Act\" (R.S.S. 1909, c. 72), the respondent is a purely statutory corporation to which the doctrine of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[12], applies. It possesses, however, all the powers conferred on companies by that Act, except as varied by \"The Rural Telephone Act\" (1912-13, c. 33, s. 43). Those powers were expressly continued and confirmed by section 48 of \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" 1918-19, c. 46 (R.S.S. 1920, c. 96). See also section 46 of the same statute. By an amendment to the Companies Act, made in 1917 (c. 34, s. 42 (3) (R.S.S. 1920, c. 76, s. 14) it was provided that\nEvery company heretofore or hereafter created:\n(a) by or under the authority of any general or special ordinance of the North West Territories; or\n(b) under any general or special Act of this legislature shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance, incorporating it or in a memorandum of association thereof, have and be deemed to have had since incorporation the capacity of a natural person to accept extraprovincial powers and rights, and to exercise its powers beyond the boundaries of the province to the extent to which the laws in force where such powers are sought to be exercised permit; and unless the contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating the company or in a memorandum of association thereof, such incorporation shall, so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned, have and be deemed to have had the same effect as if the company were or had been incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal.\nThe contrary intention was not so expressed.\nAs at present advised, I am not prepared to accede to the view which prevailed in the Court of Appeal that s. 14 of c. 76 R.S.S. 1920, is inapplicable to the respondent. That section expressly provides for its application to every company created under any general or special act of the legislature. The respondent is such a company. But it is probably not necessary to determine that question.\nI agree with the opinions expressed below that the respondent is a statutory non-trading corporation, whose authority to make promissory notes must be found in the statutes which confer its powers. Bateman v. Mid-Wales Ry. Co.[13]. The note was not given for borrowed money. Therefore, while section 117 of \"The Companies Act\" (1915, c. 14) cannot be invoked to authorise it, neither would section 31 of \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" 1918-19, c. 46, by implication exclude the power of the company to make it. Having regard to the language of section 48 of \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" 1918-19, c. 46 (R.S.S. 1920, c. 96), nothing in that Act can be invoked to cut down whatever powers the respondent acquired by virtue of its incorporation in 1918 under \"The Companies Act\" subject to the provisions of \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" 1912-13 (c. 33); vide s. 43.\nBut, assuming the applicability of section 14 of \"The Companies Act\" (R.S.S. 1920, c. 76), above quoted, to the respondent, it does not in my opinion help the appellant. The word \"capacity,\" as first used in that section, is explicitly restricted to its passive or subjective sense\u2014the capacity \"to accept extra-provincial powers and rights\"\u2014as Viscount Haldane used it in the Bonanza Creek Case[14], at page 576\u2014\"capacity to acquire and exercise rights and powers.\" As his Lordship said, at page 583:\nActual powers and rights are one thing and capacity to accept extra-provincial powers and rights quite another.\nThe word \"capacities\" occurs again in the latter part of the section in this context\u2014\nsuch incorporation shall, so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned, have and be deemed to have had the same effect as if the company were or had been incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal.\nApart altogether from the familiar rule of construction that where a word occurs twice in the same statutory provision, it will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each case, the obviously limitative purpose of the phrase, \"so far as the capacities of the companies are concerned,\" and the known fact that this legislation, like somewhat similar legislation in other provinces, was enacted in consequence of the decision in the Bonanza Case[15] make it reasonably certain that the word \"capacities\" is here again used in the purely passive or subjective sense. It confines the operation of section 14 to enabling companies to which it applies to accept and exercise powers and rights otherwise conferred upon them and does not import or imply any grant of \"actual powers or rights\" additional to those conferred elsewhere in the statute.\nFor reasons stated in Honsberger v. Weyburn Townsite Co.[16], I strongly incline to the view that the respondent company already possessed for the purposes for which it was incorporated all \"actual powers and rights\" and the fullest \"capacity\" which the legislature of Saskatchewan could bestow. I doubt therefore whether section 14 was at all necessary and rather think it added nothing to the \"capacity\" which the defendant company already had. Its purpose was to put it beyond doubt that companies incorporated under the Saskatchewan Companies Act or special Acts, which could not invoke the benefits held in the Bonanza Case15 to result from the instrument of incorporation having taken the form, prescribed by the Ontario \"Companies Act,\" of Letters Patent issued under the Great Seal, should, nevertheless, \"so far as their capacities are concerned,\" be in the same position as if that form of incorporation had been authorized and adopted\u2014that and nothing more.\nI find nothing in section 14 which would confer on a non-trading statutory corporation, such as the defendant, the actual power to bind itself by making a promissory note.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the giving of the note in question was ultra vires of the defendant company and that the judgment in appeal should be affirmed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The question to be decided is whether the respondent company had the power to sign a promissory note. Some corporations are given special authority to sign promissory notes by their charters or by the general laws by which they are governed. (Revised statutes of Canada, c. 79, sec. 32; Revised statutes of Saskatchewan, c. 72, s. 96.) In the case of others such authority is implied from the nature of their object (Royal British Bank v. Turquand[17]. Trading companies could not easily carry on their trade without having the implied power of signing notes, which have become an instrument of primary necessity in their business relations.\nIn England, it is stated that the authority cannot be implied from the mere power to contract debts, since the power to issue negotiable paper involves something more than the contracting of a debt, namely the imposition upon the corporation of the liability to innocent indorsers for debts which the corporation is not authorized to contract (Lindley on Companies, p. 242). It has been held in England that this implied power is not possessed by a water works company. Neale v. Turton[18]. But the tendency of recent decisions is towards a more liberal interpretation of these powers. Re Peruvian Railways Co.[19].\nThe corporation which has signed the note in question in this case is a telephone company incorporated as a public service corporation under the provisions of \"The Rural Telephone Act\" of Saskatchewan. This Act requires that persons desirous of constructing a telephone system should apply to the Minister for the purpose of obtaining his authorization. Plans and specifications of the proposed system and a statement of the amount to be raised by debenture have to be submitted to the Minister. The area within which the construction and operation can be carried out is determined by the Minister. The capital of the company is limited at $10 per pole mile and is divided into shares of $5 each and not more than four shares may be held by any one person. To raise the money for the construction, the company is authorized to issue debentures, but written notice has to be given of the resolution authorizing the loan to all the shareholders, and the resolution must be approved by the Minister and by the local Government Board. The debentures must be countersigned by the Minister and form a lien on the lands adjoining the system. The moneys for the payment of these bonds are obtained exclusively from taxes levied on the lands affected.\nIt seems admitted that these telephone companies were not authorized to sign promissory notes until the law was passed in 1917 by the Saskatchewan Legislature which reads as follows:\u2014\n14. Every company heretofore or hereafter created: (a) by or under the authority of any general or special ordinance of Northwest Territories; or\n(b) under any general or special Act of this legislature; shall, unless a contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance, incorporating it or in a memorandum of association thereof, have and be deemed to have had since incorporation the capacity of a natural person to accept extraprovincial powers and rights, and to exercise its powers beyond the boundaries of the province to the extent to which the laws in force where such powers are sought to be exercised permit; and unless the contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating the company or in a memorandum of association thereof, such incorporation shall, so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned, have and be deemed to have had the same effect as if the company were or had been incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal.\nAt first sight, we might say that this section gives every company the same powers as a company incorporated under the great seal which is authorized to make notes. But it would be, according to my mind, to give to this section an effect which the legislature never intended. This legislation of 1917 was passed with the purpose of complying with the suggestion made by the Privy Council in the Bonanza Creek Case[20]. It had been said by Lord Haldane that\nthe words \"legislation in relation to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects\" (B.N.A. Act, sec. 92, s.s. 11) do not preclude the province from keeping alive the power of the executive to incorporate by charter in a fashion which confers a general capacity analogous to that of a natural person. Nor do they appear to preclude the province from legislating so as to create by or by virtue of a statute a corporation with this general capacity. What the words really do is to preclude the grant to such a corporation whether by legislation or by executive act according with the distribution of legislative authority of powers and rights in respect of objects outside the province, while leaving untouched the ability of the corporation, if otherwise adequately called into existence, to accept such powers and rights if granted ab extra.\nIt had been contended by the federal authorities in this Bonanza Creek Case20 that a provincial company could not carry on business outside the territory of the incorporating province. In deciding this question, the Privy Council made in 1916 the suggestions above quoted. The Legislature of Saskatchewan, at the session of 1917, passed a necessary remedial legislation which is embodied in section 14, which I have also quoted above.\nThe legislature evidently intended to grant to its provincial companies the capacity of accepting extra-provincial powers and of exercising its powers beyond the boundaries of the province as far as the laws of the country or province in which the powers are sought to be exercised permit. Going further than that would be giving these companies a more extended power than the remedial legislation contemplated.\nI then come to the conclusion that the Cudworth Rural Telephone Company was never authorized by the statute of 1917 to sign promissory notes.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant's argument chiefly centres around section 14 of chapter 76 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1920, which is \"The Companies Act\" of that province. This section was added as section 13a to \"The Companies Act\" by chapter 34, section 42, of the statutes of 1917 after, and I think I may say because of, the decision of the Judicial Committee in Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King[21]. It was there held that a company incorporated by letters patent issued by the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario under the Ontario \"Companies Act\" with the object of carrying on the business of mining, has a status and capacity which enable it to accept and exercise mining leases and rights conferred by the authorities of the Dominion and the Yukon Territory.\nSpeaking on behalf of their Lordships, Lord Haldane, referring to the power granted to a province by section 92, par. 11, of the B.N.A. Act for the incorporation of companies \"with provincial objects,\" said (p. 576):\u2014\nSuch provincial objects would be of course the only objects in respect of which the province could confer actual rights. Rights outside the province would have to be derived from authorities outside the province. Further on, his Lordship said (p. 582):\u2014\nThe doctrine of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[22] does not apply where, as here, the company purports to derive its existence from the act of the sovereign and not merely from the words of the regulating statute * * * If validly granted it appears to their Lordships that the charter conferred on the company a status resembling that of a corporation at common law, subject to the restrictions which are imposed on its proceedings.\nAnd further, at p. 5.83:\u2014\nThe limitations of the legislative powers of a province expressed in section 92, and in particular the limitation of the power of legislation to such as relates to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects, confine the character of the actual powers and rights which the provincial government can bestow, either by legislation or through the executive, to powers and rights exercisable within the province. But actual powers and rights are one thing and capacity to accept extraprovincial powers and rights is quite another. In the case of a company created by charter the doctrine of ultra vires has no real application in the absence of statutory restriction added to what is written in the charter. Such a company has the capacity of a natural person to acquire powers and rights. If by the terms of the charter it is prohibited from doing so a violation of this prohibition is an act not beyond its capacity, and is therefore not ultra vires, although such \u00e0 violation may well give ground for proceedings by way of scire facias for the forfeiture of the charter. In the case of a company the legal existence of which is wholly derived from the words of a statute, the company does not possess the general capacity of a natural person and the doctrine of ultra vires applies.\nAnd at p. 584:\u2014\nThe words \"legislation in relation to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects\" do not preclude the province from keeping alive the power of the executive to incorporate by charter in a fashion which confers a general capacity analogous to that of a natural person. Nor do they appear to preclude the province from legislating so as to create, by or by virtue of a statute, a corporation with this general capacity. What the words really do is to preclude the grant to such a corporation, whether by legislation or by executive act according with the distribution of legislative authority, of powers and rights in respect of objects outside the province, while leaving untouched the ability of the corporation, if otherwise adequately called into existence, to accept such powers and rights if granted ab extra.\nThe law having been thus authoritatively stated, the Saskatchewan legislature amended its \"Companies Act\" by adding thereto the enactment which is now section 14 of chapter 76 of the revision of 1920. It is declared by what I will call the first part of this section that every company then or thereafter created by or under the authority of any general or special ordinance of the Northwest Territories or under any general or special Act of the Legislature, unless a contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating it, or in a memorandum of association thereof, shall have and be deemed to have had since incorporation the capacity of a natural person to accept extraprovincial powers and rights, and to exercise its powers beyond the boundaries of the province to the extent to which the laws in force where such powers are sought to be exercised permit. And after this general declaration, which exactly covers the point determined in Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King[23], the second part of section 14 states:\nand unless the contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating the company or in a memorandum of association thereof, such incorporation shall, so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned, have and be deemed to have had the same effect as if the company were or had been incorporated by letters patent under the Great Seal.\nThe scheme of the Saskatchewan Companies Act is incorporation by means of a memorandum of association and not by letters patent, so that, without the general declaration of the first part of section 14, a company so incorporated would come within the rule of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[24]. The intendment of the first part of section 14 is to give the company, notwithstanding its mode of incorporation, the capacity of a natural person to accept extra-provincial powers and rights and to exercise its powers beyond the boundaries of the province in so far as permitted by the law where these powers are sought to be exercised. This confers on a company incorporated in Saskatchewan by means of a memorandum of association a capacity which it would not have under Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King23, which refers merely to companies incorporated by royal charter, so that in Saskatchewan the distinction between the two kinds of incorporation, in so far as the capacity to accept extra-provincial rights is concerned, becomes immaterial.\nThe second part of section 14 gives rise to a serious difficulty. It declares that \"such incorporation,\" to wit, incorporation by statute, unless the contrary intention is expressed in a special Act or ordinance incorporating the company, or in a memorandum of association thereof, shall, in so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned, have and be deemed to have had the same effect as if the company were or had been incorporated by letters patent under the great seal.\nThere is no question here of the acceptance of extra-provincial powers and rights. The statutory company is to have the capacity of a company incorporated under royal charter, unless the contrary intention is expressed in the statute incorporating it. This, it is contended, does entirely away with the rule of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[25]. And the words of Lord Haldane,\nin the case of a company created by charter, the doctrine of ultra vires has no real application in the absence of statutory restriction added to what is written in the charter\nare relied on as supporting the contention that the defence of ultra vires cannot be sustained.\nOn the other hand, it is argued that the word \"capacity\" or \"capacities\" is used in the passive sense in section 14. This can be granted as to the first part of the section. It may be added that this word is primarily so used, for capacity is defined as \"ability or fitness to receive\" (Stroud's Judicial Dictionary). And the point considered in the Bonanza Company Case[26] was the ability of a provincial company to receive or accept extraprovincial rights, that is to say capacity in the passive sense\u2014so it is contended that the words of section 14, \"so far as the capacities of such companies are concerned,\" should be considered as restricting or cutting down the generality of the declaration of the legislature.\nIt must be admitted that, in so far as the abolition of the doctrine of ultra vires is concerned, the legislature has weakened what otherwise would have been an unequivocal declaration by the introduction of qualifying words in the second part of section 14. Of course also the memorandum of association must be looked at, and here the purpose mentioned is\nthe construction, maintenance and operation of a telephone system,\nwhich seems to negative the existence of unlimited powers. The word \"capacity\" in the first part of the section is used in the passive sense and it is not an unfair inference that if this word was intended to have in the second part the meaning of powers and rights the latter expressions would have been employed, if for no other reason, in order to avoid the use in this section of the same expression with I two different meanings. So I think that section 14 does not in the present instance conclude the matter as contended by the appellant. This suffices to distinguish this case from Edwards v. Blackmore[27], the Ontario statute being differently worded, and no doubt the company was of a different nature, and I desire to be understood as expressing no opinion as to the decision of the Ontario court.\nOn the other branch of the case, I have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the respondent company had no power to issue the note here in question. Granting that under section 48 of \"The Rural Telephone Act\" it had all the powers conferred on companies by \"The Companies Act,\" except as varied by \"The Rural Telephone Act,\" my opinion is that, reading these two Acts together with the memorandum of association and considering the nature of this company which is a local public service organization and the restrictions placed on its borrowing powers, the issuing of negotiable instruments clearly transcended its corporate powers.\nI would therefore not interfere with the unanimous Judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ferguson, MacDermid & MacDermid.\nSolicitors for the respondent : McCraney, Hutchinson, Carroll & Sheppard.\n[1] [1922] 2 W.W.R. 1211.\n[2] [1922] 1 W.W.R. 287.\n[3] L.R. 1 C.P. 499.\n[4] [1916] 1 A.C. 566.\n[5] [1918] 42 Ont.

F. Macdonnell for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014While I feel myself compelled by the decided cases to allow this appeal and restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Ives, I may say that I do so with great regret.\nUnder the circumstances the costs throughout of all parties as between solicitor and client must be borne by the estate. IDINGTON J.\u2014The line of decisions begining with Farrar v. Winterton[3], and down to Beddington et al v. Bau-mann et al[4], holding that the subject matter of a specific devise or bequest made by a testator, having been sold by him, the devise or bequest was thereby adeemed so settled the English law of wills that it thereby became the law of the North West Territories before Alberta was set apart and hence when that happened it continued to be the law of Alberta until changed by legislation, which the legislature has not seen fit to enact.\nHaving received, from a consideration of the will and events relative thereto now in question, a very decided impression that the result of so holding as the learned trial judge felt he must would lead to thwarting the testator's probable intention, I have examined the line of decisions I have referred to and a great many more.\nIn the result I am driven by the weight of authorities to conclude that the judgment appealed from cannot be maintained.\nI had hoped to find, inasmuch as Jarman had considered that the legal estate passed to the devisee in the case of a mere bargain and sale there might be a basis upon which to found something that would uphold the judgment appealed from. That, however, turned out, by a consideration of some of the cases, of which Re Clowes [5] was one, which showed that owing to the Imperial Conveyancing Act and Law of Property Act, 1881 (Imp.), c. 41, sec. 30, even the legal estate was taken away and would pass to the executor or administrator.\nAnd that was the state of the English law and I suspect well fitted when introduced into the Northwest to receive the Torrens system of registration and other items upon which Mr. Justice Beck rests, in a way which, with great respect, I cannot.\nIn short it was the old common law doctrine that I had imagined might have saved the situation if in course of developing our judge made law, some court happened to discover a possible cause of injustice, and by its decision furnished a remedy we could adopt. No such precedent existing, I see no help for it but to allow the appeal and restore the learned trial judge's judgment.\nI think the costs of all parties in the courts below and here should be allowed out of the estate.\nDUFF J.\u2014I am constrained, I regret to say, to the conclusion that this appeal must be allowed and the judgment of Ives J., restored. The costs of all parties as between solicitor and client should be borne by the estate. I can add nothing of any value to the judgment of Mr. Justice Clarke.\nANGLIN J.\u2014It is now too well settled to admit of controversy that the right of a vendor of land to the purchase money, though secured by lien upon the land sold, is not such an estate or interest as s. 23 of the English Wills Act, 1837 (Imp.), c. 26 (in force in Alberta entitles a devisee of the land under the will of such vendor, made prior to the sale, to claim. The decisions to that effect of Lord Langdale in Farrar v. Winterton[6], and of Lord Romilly in Gale v. Gale[7], have been followed ever since, the latter having been explicitly approved by the House of Lords in Beddington v. Baumann[8].\nThe assimilation in Alberta of the course of descent of real estate to that of personalty affords no ground for a departure from such a well settled rule. Section 23 of the Wills Act applies equally to real and to personal estate.\nThe result of decisions of this court in Jellett v. Wilkie[9], Williams v. Box[10], Smith v. National Trust Co.[11], Yockney v. Thomson[12], Grace v. Kuebler[13], and other cases, is that, notwithstanding such provisions as s. 41 of ch. 24 of the Alberta statutes of 1906, equitable doctrines and jurisdiction apply to lands under the Land Titles or Torrens system of registration and equitable interests in such lands may be created and will be recognized and protected. The presence of that provision in the Alberta statutes does not afford sufficient ground for holding that where a testator has, after making his will, executed an agreement for the sale of his entire interest in a parcel of land in that province specifically devised in the will, the devisee is entitled to claim any part of the purchase money thereof remaining unpaid as an interest preserved to him by the operation of s. 23 of the Wills Act.\nI would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Ives.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The three appellants and the respondent are the children of the late Arthur W. Church, who died in Edmonton, Alberta, on February 5, 1921, leaving a will, executed at Edmonton on February 28, 1916, whereby he purported to divide his property real and personal among his four children. The principal clause of this will is as follows:\u2014\nI give, devise and bequeath all my real and personal estate, of which I may die possessed, in the manner following, that is to say: To my youngest daughter, Mary Alice Viola Hill (wife of Stewart Hill) of Edmonton, Alberta, I bequeath Lot 15, Block 46 (the house number on this lot being 10649, 80th Avenue) in the city of Edmonton (South), province of Alberta. The balance of my property to be divided equally between my daughter, Amy Ethel Watson (wife of Harvey G. Watson), of Central Park, British Columbia, my son Arthur Harvey Church, of Edmonton, Alberta, and my daughter, Kate Adeline Joyce (wife of A. Joyce) of Edmonton, Alberta.\nOn April 1, 1920, the testator entered into an agreement of sale with one Lockerbie whereby he agreed to sell to Lockerbie and the latter agreed to purchase from him lot 15, block 46, in the City of Edmonton, to wit, the property he had devised to the respondent, for the sum of $4,500, whereof $500 was paid immediately, and the balance was made payable in monthly instalments of $30 with interest at eight per cent payable half yearly. Rigorous provisions secured the payment of this balance, as, for instance, a clause that on default of payment of any instalment of principal or interest, the whole amount outstanding would become due and payable, or the agreement forfeited and determined, at the option of the vendor; also a clause that until the completion of the purchase, the purchaser should hold the premises as tenant to the vendor at a rental equivalent to the instalments of principal and interest, the legal relation of landlord and tenant being constituted between the vendor and the purchaser. Lockerbie was given immediate possession by the agreement.\nNotwithstanding these clauses intended to secure the payment of the purchase price, and although Lockerbie could demand a conveyance only when he had entirely completed the payment of the price and interest, it is unquestionable that he immediately acquired an equitable interest in the property.\nIn the Appellate Court Mr. Justice Stuart cited the well-known case of Ross v. Watson[14], as determining what are respectively the rights of the vendor and the purchaser under a sale agreement such as this. The question there was whether the purchaser, who had ceased his payments on account of non-fulfilment of representations (which were adjudged to be sufficient to absolve him from specific performance) had a lien on the property for the payments he had already made. The decision was that the purchaser had such a lien and it was clearly laid down by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Westbury, and by Lord Cranworth, who concurred with him, that where by an agreement of sale the ownership of an estate is transferred subject to the payment of the purchase price, every portion of the purchase money paid in pursuance of the agreement is a part performance and execution of the contract, and, to the extent of the money paid, does in equity finally transfer to the purchaser the ownership of a corresponding portion of the estate.\nIn Ross v. Watson 14 the purchaser, in the exercise of his right to do so, had refused to complete the purchase, and it was decided that he had a lien on the property for the money he had paid. But, with deference, I cannot think that, to quote the language of Mr. Justice Stuart, the decision casts\nsome doubt upon the wide general proposition that in equity the property is the property of the purchaser.\nIt appears, on the contrary, that the ownership in equity of the purchaser in Ross v. Watson14 was the foundation of the lien which he was held to possess. Lockerbie therefore, at the death of the testator, had acquired in equity, and to the extent of the purchase money paid by him, the ownership of a corresponding portion of the estate of the testator.\nIt will be said, and such was the reasoning of Mr. Justice Stuart, that the testator, at his death, had still a substantial interest in the property, to the extent at least of the purchase money still unpaid. But he could assert no such interest against Lockerbie if the latter continued, as he has done, to pay the purchase money as it became due. So long as the conditions of the agreement of sale were carried out, the vendor was entitled only to this purchase money, and the purchaser, on completing its payment, had the right to demand a conveyance. Had the vendor refused to make this conveyance, the purchaser would have been entitled to compel him to do so by an action for specific performance; and therefore the interest which the purchaser acquired under the sale agreement was certainly an interest which equity would recognize and one commensurate with the relief which equity would give by way of specific performance. Howard v. Miller[15].\nIt is suggested that this recognition of an equitable interest belonging to the purchaser under a sale agreement cannot be relied on where there prevails a land titles system such as that in force in Alberta. And the respondent cites section 41 of the Land Titles Act, Alberta, under which, after a certificate of title has been granted for any land,\nno instrument until registered under this Act shall be effectual to pass any estate or interest in any land.\nIt would probably be sufficient to say that section 41 is mainly intended for the protection of third parties who have obtained registration and that the respondent claiming under her father's will is not in a better position than the latter would have been to contend that an equitable interest did not pass to Lockerbie under the sale agreement. While giving to section 41 and similar provisions full effect for the protection of third parties who have complied with the Act, it does not appear possible, and certainly not inter partes, to exclude from the Land Titles Act equitable interests in property resulting from sale agreements. Equitable interests in property subject to the Act were expressly recognized by this court in Jellett v. Wilkie[16], and the provisions of the Act authorizing the filing of caveats show that such interests cannot be summarily excluded. I have found in the New Zealand reports a case decided by a single judge where, under section 38 of the New Zealand law corresponding with section 41 of the Alberta statute, it was said that in enforcing according to equitable doctrines contractual rights created by an unregistered instrument, the court cannot act inconsistently with section 38 by holding an interest to pass where the section says none shall pass Orr v. Smith[17]. See also Howie v. Barry[18]. In these cases there were rival claimants to rent, and the rights of the debtor who had paid the rent in good faith to the registered lessor were involved. I have however found, under the Torrens system, no authority excluding equitable interests as such, and certainly not as between the registered owner and a person to whom he has agreed to sell the property, and it does not seem possible to exclude them here. (See Hogg, Registration of Title to Land Throughout the Empire, pp. 111 et seq.).\nI have referred to these matters because they were relied on by the learned judges who formed the majority of the Appellate Divisional Court. I cannot think, however, that they afford the respondent any answer to the contentions of the appellants. Moreover, the respondent, under the devise made to her, seeks to obtain the balance of the purchase money rather than an interest in the land itself, which interest the testator could not have asserted against Lockerbie so long as the latter fulfilled all the conditions of the promise of sale. The question now is whether this devise has become inoperative by reason of the sale of the devised property.\nThe legal position here can be stated as follows: By reason of the sale agreement, any interest in the property in question of the vendor as against the purchaser, and so long as the latter made the stipulated payments, was converted into a claim for the purchase moneys. What the testator devised to the respondent was the property itself. What he had at his death\u2014and it is then that the will speaks\u2014was the right to the price and not the property. The devise therefore fails because its subject matter no longer existed at the testator's death.\nA different situation was dealt with by this court in the recent case of Hicks v. McClure[19]. There the testator had himself sold a property which by his will he had directed his executors to sell and divide the proceeds between his two sons, and it was held that the bequest was really of the proceeds of the property. Here the devise is of the property itself.\nIt does not appear to me to matter that in Alberta real estate has been assimilated to personal property, both going to the personal representative of the deceased. So long as Lockerbie is not in default, the respondent could not claim either from him or from the personal representative of the deceased the property itself, and the answer to any demand by her of the purchase money is that it was not given to her under the devise of the property.\nI cannot therefore avoid the conclusion that the devise to the respondent entirely fails. But can the appellants claim the purchase moneys under the bequest to them of the balance of the testator's property? The answer should be in the affirmative if the bequest is a residuary bequest.\nThe language used,\nthe balance of my property to be divided equally between * * * *\ntaken in connection with the declaration of the testator,\nI give, devise and bequeath all my real and personal estate of which I may die possessed of in the manner following * * *\ncertainly indicates the intention that the appellants shall have everything except the property specifically devised to the respondent. They take therefore the residue of the estate, for the \"balance\" mentioned in the will is certainly what is known to the law as the \"residue,\" both expressions having the same meaning. And the residue comprises this purchase price, so that it must go to the appellants.\nThat the testator ever contemplated that his youngest daughter, the respondent, would take nothing under his will, and that the price of the property he had left to her would go to his other children, or that he intended any such result, seems very doubtful. But the court cannot make a will for him or provide the respondent with an equivalent for the loss of the property which the testator had devised to her. Nothing would be more dangerous than to refuse to apply the settled rules as to the ademption of legacies because it may be conjectured that the result would be contrary to the intention of the testator. Dura lex, it is true, sed lex, and the law must be applied.\nWithout therefore concealing my regret that this result cannot be avoided, I have come to the conclusion to allow the appeal with costs here and in the appellate court, payable out of the estate, and to restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAppeal allowed, costs to be paid by the estate.\n[1] [1922] 3 W.W.R. 1207.\n[2] [1922] 2 W.W.R. 1268.\n[3] [1842] 5 Beav. 1.\n[4] [1903] A.C. 13.\n[5] [1893] 1 Ch. 214.\n[6] 5 Beav. 1.\n[7] [1856] 21 Beav. 349.\n[8] [1903] A.C. 13.\n[9] [1896] 26 Can.

On July 30, 1912, the city appellant passed a by-law under which the respondent company obtained exclusive power to lay pipes in the streets of the city for the purpose of supplying natural gas at a certain price and for a period of fifteen years. Its terms and provisions were accepted by the respondent. On the 5th of April, 1922, the respondent company notified the city appellant that it would cease in the month of May to sell gas owing to the impossibility of continuing to sell it at the price fixed in the by-law and in view of the refusal by the city to grant any increase in rates. The city appellant then asked for an injunction to restrain the respondent from discontinuing the sale of gas and for a declaration that the respondent was bound to supply gas at the price and for the period stipulated. The judgment of the trial judge, maintaining the appellant's action, was reversed by the Appellate Division; and the appeal to this court was dismissed on equal division.\nPer Davies C.J. and Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014Although the courts may not have been denuded of jurisdiction to entertain the present action, they should decline to exercise it and should relegate the parties to the Board of Public Utilities which the legislature has constituted to deal with such cases and has clothed with powers adequate to enable it to do full and complete justice.\nPer Idington, Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014On the construction of the agreement between the parties, their reciprocal obligations were of a contractual character.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The case is one for remedy by injunction without the city appellant being obliged to submit the question of rates to the Board.\nPer Davies C.J. and Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014Under the circumstances, a merely declaratory judgment should not be rendered.

Per Duff and Brodeur JJ.\u2014No provision in the Alberta \"Public Utilities Act\" deprives the Supreme Court of authority to deal with the questions raised in this case, Davies C.J. and Anglin and Mignault JJ. expressing no opinion as to whether the effect of that Act was to oust the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.\nJudgement of the Appellate Division ([1923] 1 W.W.R. 838) affirmed on equal division of the court.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Johnstone K.C. (Ball with them) for the appellant.\nHellmuth K.C. and Savary K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Not without much doubt I have reached the conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs. I concur in the reasons for dismissal stated by my brother Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant is a municipal corporation endowed with all the corporate capacity and powers enabling it to enter upon such a contract as it contends was made between it and the respondent, which is a corporation engaged in the procuring of natural gas, and its distribution and sale, and also endowed with the corporate capacity and power to enter into such a contract as appellant contends was entered into between them, in respect of a supply of natural gas for use thereof by appellant and its inhabitants.\nThe long history leading up to the creation of the relations, whatever they are, between the said parties, has been set forth in great detail by the learned trial judge and in part so far repeated by the learned judges in the Court of Appeal, who heard the case there, that I do not see any useful purpose to be served by repeating same here.\nSuffice it to say that the predecessors in title of the respondent had been in negotiation with appellant for the acquisition of a franchise from it to sell gas to it and its inhabitants for a term of years and had progressed so far that 'the appellant had passed a by-law relative thereto in 1910 pursuant to agreement with said parties.\nThat was entered into under circumstances which rendered it of necessity largely conditional.\nAbout eighteen months later the respondent having acquired such rights as its predecessors in title had, and other interests which opened up for it much brighter prospects and possibilities, approached appellant with a view to bringing about a contract much more favourable for it, the respondent induced appellant to amend its said by-law and by revote of the electors they duly assented thereto.\nThat amending by-law and its terms and provisions were duly accepted and agreed to by the respondent, in the following letter:\u2014\n128 Seventh Avenue East,\nCalgary. Alta., 1st August, 1912.\nTo the Mayor and Council\nof the city of Lethbridge, Alta.\nGentlemen,\u2014We beg respectfully to acknowledge receipt of a certified copy of by-law No. 154 of the city of Lethbridge, being a by-law to amend by-law No. 99 of the said city, such by-law No. 99 being a by-law to grant a franchise to lay pipes through the city of Lethbridge for the distribution of natural gas.\nWe hereby notify you that we consent and agree to the amendments set forth in said by-law No. 154 and will conform to and fulfil all the matters and provisions therein referred to and contained.\nGiven in behalf of the Canadian Western Natural Gas, Light, Heat and Power Company, Limited, at Calgary, this first day of August, 1912.\nEUGENE COSTE,\nPresident.\nJOHN BAIN,\nSecretary.\n[Seal]\nBoth parties having acted in conformity therewith for nearly ten years, except in one particular to which I will presently refer, respondent in a notice, dated 5th April, 1912, gave to the parties who had been using its gas in Lethbridge, that it would on the tenth of May following cease to supply same. The only excuse given was that it could not, except at a future loss, continue to supply at the agreed upon rates. A novel reason, it seems to me, for breach of contract by leave of a court of justice ignorant of the profits hitherto reaped.\nThere had been a previous failure to supply manufacturers which, I incline to think, was so far tacitly assented to by the appellant that possibly an injunction in that respect might, if applied for, have been well refused.\nIn all other respects I see no reason, if contracts are to be observed at all, why the respondents can claim to be relieved so long as the supply of gas is available.\nThe question raised herein is whether or not there ever has been a contract between the parties or anything beyond the mere concession of a franchise which respondent can abandon at will.\nI consider that there clearly was a contract which constituted an obligation and bound respondent to observe all the matters and provisions therein referred to and contained, from which nothing but an absolute failure of supply of gas, cost what it may, can relieve them.\nI fail to see the analogy in law between the cases of railway franchises such as came in question in the Great Western Railway Company v. The Queen[2]; York and North Midland Railway Company v. The Queen[3], or the more recent case of Darleston Local Board v. London & Northwestern Railway Co.[4], and others cited by respondent's factum, and this case.\nRespondent's counsel when citing, at the end of a long list of decisions, the case of La Ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[5], comes, accidentally I imagine, on a decision much more closely in point than any other he cites.\nThat decision arose out of an attempt the converse of which is attempted herein, but in principle I submit should destroy (although the converse attitude of the parties was there involved) any claims of respondent to pretend that the relation of the parties herein was other than contractual and implied an obligation upon the party obtaining from a municipality such a franchise as herein involved to give the promised consideration therefor.\nAt least for my part in that case I tried, perhaps at too great length, to demonstrate that the nature of the relation was contractual.\nIn that I see I referred to the English law as well as the Quebec Code, for it arose out of the application of municipal laws which are much alike and only that the Quebec code gave specifically a remedy if the nature of the relation created could be held contractual as it was in that case by this court.\nI agree so fully with the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in the court below that I need not waste effort here to repeat same reasoning.\nOut of respect to the majority opinion I may say I am quite unable to see how the appellant can be forced to have recourse to the local Board of Commissioners unless and until the legislature sees fit to go further and adopt the more modern fashion of regulating things by commission.\nI do not think that the injunction granted under the circumstances and limited to the causes calling for it after ten years mutual observance of the contract, exceeds the bounds of such relevant law as it rests upon.\nIt is not the case of an attempt to enforce specific performance ab initio when it might have been met by the fatal objection of involving too much supervision of the due performance of obedience to the injunction granted.\nCertainly it is not a case where damages could be allowed at all adequate to the breach of the contract involved.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nDUFF J.\u2014I am unable to escape the conclusion that paragraph two of by-law 154 gives expression to the terms of a contract on behalf of the company, to which contract the company gave its adherence by the acceptance of the by-law, to supply on demand the demand for gas of the city and the inhabitants' thereof along the line of the five miles of pipe referred to in the preceding limb of the paragraph. I am unable to concur with the view that the company can get rid of this obligation of its own mere motion by going through the form of abandoning its rights under the by-law. It may well be that the termination of those rights under the terms of the contract, by the operation, for example, of article 13, would put an end to the personal obligation under paragraph two; but that it is unnecessary to consider for the purposes of this appeal.\nThe appellant municipality is, I think, entitled to a declaration to the above effect. The propriety of a declaratory judgment was not disputed by the defendant, either in the pleadings or at the trial. Judgment having gone in favour of the plaintiff municipality, the trial judge having construed the contract in accordance with the plaintiff municipality's contention, the respondent company appealed to the Appellate Division, not upon the ground that there was any impropriety in the trial judge entertaining the action and deciding the questions raised upon their merits, but actually asking for a decision in its favour on the construction of the contract, a decision on the merits of the issues raised. Having asked for and got such a decision, it is not competent to the respondent company in answer to the plaintiff municipality's appeal to raise any question as to the propriety of a declaratory judgment. To entertain such an objection in such circumstances would be contrary to settled principles as well as to authority. Bickett v. Morris[6]; Burgess v. Morton[7]; Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v. British Bank for Foreign Trade[8].\nThe claim for a mandatory order stands on a different footing. Interests other than the interests of the plaintiff municipality may be affected by such an order, and the Board of Public Utilities has ample power to protect such interests. In these circumstances it is not \"convenient,\" although it might otherwise have been \"just,\" as between the parties, to grant such a mandatory order.\nI have examined with care the provisions of the Alberta statute establishing the Board of Public Utilities, and can find nothing in that statute depriving the Supreme Court of Alberta of authority to deal with the questions in controversy in this action in accordance with the course of the court.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The appellant is a municipal corporation; the respondent, a public utility subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the province of Alberta.\nBy s.s. 2 of s. 54 of \"The Public Utilities Act of Alberta, 1923,\" c. 53, it is provided that, in the absence of a filed consent to the contrary, all statutory provisions applicable prior to the enactment to the statute to contracts made before the 1st day of May, 1923, and to the price to be charged for the supply of a commodity or service thereunder shall remain applicable thereto. The contract in question in the present case was made in 1910 and amended in 1912. The question at issue must, therefore, be determined under the Public Utilities Act of 1915, c. 6, and amendments thereto made prior to the 21st of April, 1923.\nBy s.s. 2 of section 69, of the Public Utilities Act of 1915, which constituted the Board of Public Utilities Commissioners of Alberta, it is provided that:\nThe Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all cases and in respect of all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act or by any other Act.\nSection 21 declares that:\nThe Board shall have a general supervision over all public utilities subject to the legislative authority of the province.\nBy clause \"c\" of section 23, the board is given power to fix just and reasonable rates, tolls, and charges\nwhenever the Board shall determine any existing individual rate, joint rate, toll charge, etc., to be unjust, insufficient or unjustly discriminatory, or preferential.\n(I rather incline to agree with Mr. Justice Clarke that the construction put on this latter clause in Northern Alberta Natural Gas Development Co. v. Edmonton[9], was too narrow.)\nBy s. 27 the board is empowered to require every public utility (a) to conform to the duties imposed upon it by any municipal by-law or by any agreement with any municipality, and (b) to furnish adequate and proper service, etc.\nSection 39 empowers a municipal council by resolution to authorize an application to the board whenever it deems that the interests of the public in the municipality, or a Considerable part thereof, are sufficiently concerned; and s. 40 provides for action by the board on such application. Other sections confer on the board plenary powers for redressing grievances and enforcing rights in all matters in respect of which it is given jurisdiction. Vide s.s. 52 et seq.\nThe decision of the board is made final and res judicata (s. 64) and, subject to a restricted right of appeal (s. 70), binding and conclusive on all companies and persons and municipal corporations and in all courts. (S. 69 (1) ).\nWhile a great deal may be said for the view that the effect of this legislation was to oust the jurisdiction of the courts in regard to such matters as are presented in this action, the present appeal may be disposed of without so deciding.\nFor reasons stated by my brothers Duff and Mignault, I agree that the mandatory order sought should in no event be granted. I am also, with my brother Mignault, of the opinion that a merely declaratory judgment should not be pronounced.\nThe avowed intention of the legislature was that the board should exercise general supervision over all public utilities; jurisdiction, when conferred upon it, is declared to be exclusive; the enforcement of agreements between public utilities and municipalities is expressly made a subject of the jurisdiction of the board; the board is empowered to determine all matters of law and of fact requisite for the decision of questions within the ambit of its jurisdiction and to order and require any company, person, or municipal corporation to fulfil any obligation imposed by any agreement or by any order or direction of the board. Having regard to these provisions of the statute and also to the fact that no order for concrete relief would follow upon any judgment declaratory of the rights of the parties to this action, I am of the opinion that a merely declaratory judgment could not prove other than embarrassing to the board, to whose jurisdiction the parties must ultimately have recourse. Out of respect to the legislature and to carry into effect the spirit, if not the letter, of its policy, as expressed in the Public Utilities Act, the courts, although they may not have been denuded of jurisdiction to entertain such an action as that now before us, should, I think, decline to exercise that jurisdiction, if they possess it, and should relegate the parties to the board which the legislature has constituted to deal with such cases and has clothed with powers adequate to enable it to do full and complete justice in the premises. Subject, therefore, to the reservation indicated in the conclusion of Mr. Justice Clarke's opinion, I would, solely for the foregoing reasons, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The most important issue in this appeal is whether by the agreement between the parties the respondent company is bound to supply gas to the city of Lethbridge.\nIn 1910 and 1912, by-laws were passed by the council of the city by which the respondent company obtained exclusive power to lay pipes in the streets of the city for the purpose of supplying natural gas within the city to the plaintiff corporation and its inhabitants at a certain price and for a period of fifteen years.\nIt is claimed on the part of the plaintiff that by the agreements which have been passed between the city and the gas company and which are based on the above by-laws, the gas company is bound and obliged to supply gas at the price mentioned for the above period of fifteen years. On the part of the defendant gas company, it is contended that there is no obligation on its part to supply gas for a definite period, that it could relinquish the privilege which it possessed to use the streets of the city at any time it desired and that their contractual relations would then come to an end.\nOn the fifth of April, 1922, the gas company notified the city of Lethbridge that it would cease in the month of May to sell natural gas within the city because of the impossibility of continuing to sell gas at the price fixed by its franchise and the refusal of the city to any increase in rates.\nThen the present action has been instituted by the city for an injunction to restrain the gas company from discontinuing the sale of gas and for a declaration that the company is bound to supply gas to the city and its inhabitants at the price and for the period stipulated in the agreements.\nThe trial judge decided in plaintiff's favour but his decision was reversed in appeal.\nAs I said before, there were two by-laws passed by the city; the first one was passed in 1910 and was of a tentative nature. It provided for the granting of the franchise in the future because the owners of the gas wells were still in the experimental stage and would not make a formal and binding contract for the supplying of gas during a certain period of time. But the by-law and the contract of 1912 were more explicit. The experimental stage had passed away and now the respondent company felt that it could stipulate more explicitly as to the supply and the period of the exclusive franchise. A price was agreed upon and the period of fifteen years determined.\nBy section 2 of the contract, the company agreed to construct its pipe line in the city before January, 1913, and to supply the demand for gas to the city and its inhabitants.\nBy section 9 it is provided that the franchise shall be used subject to the terms hereof by the company until the expiration of fifteen years.\nBy section 10 the price for the supplying of gas for domestic purposes is fixed.\nWith such provisions, is it possible for a company to withdraw from the field before the period of fifteen years has elapsed, on the assertion that the supplying of gas at the price stipulated is not a paying proposition? I cannot agree with such a contention.\nThe franchise obtained was for a period of fifteen years and was with the obligation on the part of the company to supply gas at a certain price. The transaction involves the very essence of reciprocal obligation of a contractual character.\nIn two cases which came before this court some years ago, viz., La ville de Chicoutimi v. Legare[10], and La ville de St. Jean v. Molleur[11], it was decided that the franchises for waterworks in these two municipalities constituted contractual relationships which created for both sides rights and obligations.\nIn this case the gas company obtained the exclusive right for fifteen years to lay its pipes in the city limits, but with the obligation during that period to supply the inhabitants with gas at the price agreed upon.\nThe contractual relations cannot now be changed without the consent of both parties.\nIt was urged on the part of the respondent company that the ordinary courts of the land had no power to deal with the question but that the Public Utilities Commission had an exclusive jurisdiction in that matter. This point was not raised by the company in its plea but was brought up in the Appellate Division by some of the learned judges and seems to be the ground upon which they relied to decide in favour of the gas company.\nThe statute of Alberta as to the Public Utilities does not, in my opinion, give the board the right to adjudicate with respect to rights arising out of past transactions, but its power seems to be limited to directing what is to be done in the future and the board is not empowered to deal with the breaches of agreements which might be urged. It may be\u2014and I do not decide that point\u2014that contractual relations may be the subject of decisions by the board; but it does not dispossess the ordinary courts of the land of the right of dealing with the result of contractual obligations which might have been stipulated between the parties.\nFor those reasons the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored, with costs of this court and of the Appellate Division.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The injunction which the learned trial judge granted to the appellant against the respondent was to restrain the latter\nfrom shutting off its supply of natural gas from the plaintiff (appellant) or the inhabitants of the city of Lethbridge or in any way interfering with the supply of the same to the said city or its inhabitants or from discontinuing the supply of the same to the said city or its inhabitants at the price or prices or upon the terms set out in by-laws 99 and 154 of the city of Lethbridge and the defendant's (respondent's) letter of August 1, 1912, directed to the mayor and council of the said city, until the expiration of the term of fifteen years from the said 30th day of July, 1912.\nThis injunction was accompanied by a declaration\nthat the plaintiff city is entitled to a supply of natural gas from the defendant company sufficient for the requirements of the city and its inhabitants for a continuous period of fifteen years from the 30th day of July, 1912, at a price or prices not greater than those set forth in by-law 99 as amended by by-law 154 of the said city.\nThe injunction in the terms in which it was granted is equivalent to an order to the respondent to continue the supply of natural gas to the city of Lethbridge and its inhabitants at the prices fixed by the by-law until the end of the fifteen-year period mentioned therein. Quite in dependently of the question whether the court should make such an order,\u2014and I must frankly say that I think it objectionable\u2014there can be no doubt, even admitting that the respondent violated its contract with the appellant, that the court should not exercise its extraordinary powers and grant such an injunction, if another convenient and equally effective remedy is available to the appellant.\nThis calls for the consideration of the provisions of the Alberta Public Utilities Act (chapter 6 of the statutes of 1915) referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Clarke in the appellate court.\nThe object of this statute is to create a body, called the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, clothed with full jurisdiction and power to deal with all questions relating to public utility services, such as the furnishing of water, light, gas, heat or power, as well as with disputes between public utility corporations and the municipalities and persons who are entitled to these services. That the respondent is a \"public utility\" within the meaning of section 2, subsection (b), of the statute can admit of no doubt. And it is equally certain that a contract to supply natural gas to a city and its inhabitants is one with respect to which the jurisdiction of the board can be exercised.\nThe powers and jurisdiction of the board are set out in sections 20 and following of the Act. Thus under section 27, the board has power, after hearing, upon notice, by order in writing to require every public utility\n(a) to comply with the laws of this province and any municipal ordinance or by-law affecting the public utility, and to conform to the duties imposed upon it thereby, or by the provisions of its own charter or by any agreement with any municipality or other public utility.\nBy section 39 it is provided that\nevery municipal council, whenever it deems that the interest of the public in a municipality or in a considerable part of a municipality are sufficiently concerned, may by resolution authorize the municipality to become a complainant or intervenant in any matter within the jurisdiction of the board; and for that purpose the council is authorized to take any steps and to incur any expense and to take any proceedings necessary to submit the question in dispute to the decision of the board, and if necessary to authorize the municipality to become a party to an appeal therefrom.\nSection 40 enacts that\nif the Attorney General, a municipality or any party interested makes a complaint to the board that any public utility, municipal corporation, company or person has unlawfully done or unlawfully failed to do, or is about unlawfully to do, or unlawfully not to do, something relating to a matter over which the board has jurisdiction as aforesaid, and prays that the board do make some order in the premises, the board shall, after hearing such evidence as it may think fit to require, make such order as it thinks proper under the circumstances.\nTo the same effect, as conferring the widest jurisdiction on the board and providing for the enforcement of its orders, sections 52 and following may be mentioned without quoting them at length, and by section 64 it is provided that\nthe decision of the board upon any question of fact or law within its jurisdiction shall be final and be res judicata.\nWithout going to the length of holding that the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts is ousted by this statute, as this court held it was ousted by such a statute as the Ontario Workmen's Compensation Act, The Dominion Canners Co. v. Costanza[12], I think that when the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court is appealed to, it is quite a pertinent inquiry whether the complainant cannot obtain full redress under such a statute as the Alberta Public Utilities Act by applying to the board created by that statute. And because I am convinced that this appellant can do so in order to enforce its rights under the contract it made with the respondent, and that the remedy provided by the statute is a convenient and effective one, I do not think that the appellant has made out a case which would justify this court in restoring the mandatory injunction which was set aside by the appellate court.\nMr. Lafleur, on behalf of the appellant, pressed for at least a declaration of the asserted right of the appellant to a continuation, during fifteen years, of the services of the respondent upon the terms and at the prices stipulated in by-law no. 99 as amended by by-law no. 154 of the city of Lethbridge. I think the whole matter had better be left to the determination of the board of public utility commissioners, without any pronouncement on the rights, contractual or otherwise, of the appellant, but I do not wish to be taken as acquiescing in the view, entertained by some of the learned judges of the appellate court, that there was no binding contractual obligation on the part of the re- spondent to continue the service of natural gas during the fifteen years upon the terms and at the prices mentioned in the by-law, or that the respondent could, by abandoning its franchise, escape from any such obligation. I would leave all these questions to be finally determined by the board whose decision, the statute states, is final and constitutes res judicata.\nThe right to resort to the jurisdiction of the board to obtain redress is reserved to the appellant under the judgment appealed from, and all the rights and proper remedies of the appellant are thus safeguarded.\nFor these reasons, my opinion is that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed, no costs.\n[1] [1923] 1 W.W.R. 838.\n[2] [1883] 1 E. & B. 874, 118 E.R. 663.\n[3] [1883] 1 E. & B. 858, 118 E.R. 657.\n[4] [1894] 2 Q.B. 694.\n[5] [1908] 40 Can.

The King, [1923] S.C.R. 666\nDate: 1923-10-09\nThe City of Hull (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty the King (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1923: May 16; 1923: October 9.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nStatute\u2014Construction\u2014Municipal law\u2014Hull city charter\u2014Interpretation (Q.) 1908, 8 Edw. VII, c. 88, s. 392a.\nWith a view to the beautification of the cities of Ottawa and Hull, the Dominion Government passed an order in council providing that a commission be constituted consisting of at least six members, including the mayors of both cities, charged with the details of taking all necessary steps to perfect such plan, the cost of the plan to be borne by the government for one-half and by the cities of Ottawa and Hull proportionally to their population for the other half. This was communicated to the city appellant with a request that it state whether it was willing to pay its share of the expenses, and the city council at a special meeting passed a resolution approving of the project submitted and appointing a committee to confer with the government and the other bodies interested. Subsequently the city appellant passed another resolution that having heard the report of its representatives, it approved of the project as submitted. This was communicated to the government which thereupon by order in council appointed the commission, the mayor of Hull becoming a member. He was present at most meetings and copies of plans prepared by the commission were sent to the city which obtained leave to use parts thereof to advertise the city. The appellant's charter, as amended by 8 Edw. VII, c. 88 provides (s. 392a) that \"no resolution of the council authorizing the expenditure of money shall be adopted or have any effect until * * * \u2014and also that \"the city shall not be liable for the price or value of work done * * * unless * * *\" \"\u2014a certificate of the city treasurer is produced establishing that there are funds available appropriated for the particular object for which payment is sought; and no right of action shall exist against the city unless the foregoing formalities are strictly observed, notwithstanding that the city may have benefited by any such * * * work done * * * or other services rendered.\" By the present action, the government seeks to recover the city appellant's share, $6,500.32.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that in the absence of such a certificate by the city treasurer, no right of action exists in favour of the government to recover from the city appellant the amount claimed.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court ([1923] Ex. C.R. 27) reversed, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] maintaining the respondent's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR. V. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant.\nNap. Champagne K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2] in a case tried by Mr. Justice Audette wherein he adjudged that the appellant was liable to pay the respondent the sum of $6,560.32.\nThe relevant facts (which are undisputed) are fully set forth in the reasons of the said learned trial judge.\nI agree in all the essential features of the reasoning of the said judge and therefore conclude that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI observe amongst the cases cited by the counsel for the appellant the case of Larin v. Lapointe[3], as disposed of at one stage in the Superior Court of Quebec.\nThat case ultimately came before this court[4] and the majority of us who heard it, relying upon much more stringent provisions in the charter of the city of Montreal than exist in appellant's charter, and are relied upon by counsel for the appellant herein, and applying said provisions, accepted the view taken by the Court of Review and allowed the appeal therein.\nIn due time that was appealed from to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. That court reversed us, as appears by the case of Lapointe v. Larin[5].\nThe court above, to put the result briefly, held that the council, having authorized what was done and complained of, the resolution was valid.\nIf that is applied to what is argued for herein by appellant's counsel it should, I submit respectfully, sweep aside the major part of his argument and reduce the question to the narrow compass of the necessity for a by-law which does not seem to me necessary to found such a piece of business as the contract in question herein. Duff J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed, and the action dismissed. Section 392 (a), c. 88, 8 Edw. VII, is in point and is conclusive. The legislature had no doubt good reasons for this stringent enactment, which makes it very difficult for the municipality to incur legal responsibility in respect of contracts for work and materials or for professional services. It is not for us to canvass the reasons for such an enactment nor to look for expedients for evading it.\nAnglin J.\u2014Seldom, if ever, has a public body presented in this court a defence so palpably devoid of merit as that put forward in this case. That the council of the defendant municipality solemnly undertook by resolution to pay its proportionate share of the cost of the work and services for which it now repudiates liability, that such work and services were duly rendered, and that the municipality has had the benefit of them there has been no attempt to deny. That the city council could now, if so minded, legitimately and properly provide an appropriation to cover the debt which it morally owes to the plaintiff and could thus enable a certificate to be given by the city treasurer\nthat there are funds available appropriated for the particular object for which payment is sought,\nis not seriously controverted. But the city council is not so minded. It sets up in answer to the plaintiff's demand the following special provision, added to its charter in 1908 (8 Edw. 7, c. 88) as s. 392a:\nNo resolution of the council authorizing the expenditure of moneys shall be adopted or have any effect until a certificate of the city treasurer is produced establishing that there are funds available and at the disposal of the city for the service and purpose for which such expenditure is proposed, in accordance with the provisions of this charter.\nNo contract or agreement whatever shall be binding on the city unless it has been approved by the council.\nThe city shall not be liable for the price or value of work done, materials supplied, goods or effects furnished of any kind whatever, nor for any fees for professional services, salary, wages or other remuneration, without the special authorization of the city council, nor unless in any case a certificate of the city treasurer is produced establishing that there are funds available appropriated for the particular object for which payment is sought; and no right of action shall exist against the city unless the foregoing formalities are strictly observed, notwithstanding that the city may have benefited by any such contract, agreement, work done, materials supplied, or other services rendered. In making this statutory provision the legislature no doubt intended to provide a means which would enable the municipal council to resist claims arising out of ill-advised and unauthorized undertakings entered upon by unwise officials. It had confidence that the privilege so conferred would not be taken advantage of for the repudiation of liabilities incurred by the authority of the council itself and to which the municipality had no moral defence. That confidence was misplaced.\nWith deep regret that any Canadian municipal council should be found willing to take a position so humiliating, I find myself constrained to uphold the defence put forward and to allow the city's appeal because effect must be given to the plain and explicit terms of the statute that, without the city treasurer's certificate\nthat there are funds available, appropriated for the particular object for which payment is sought * * * no right of action shall exist.\nThe contract now before us does not concern one of those unimportant matters of frequent occurrence, to which Viscount Haldane alludes in the Mackay Case[6], and in which \"convenience almost amounting to necessity\" has been held to dispense from compliance with formalities prescribed by statutory provisions not dissimilar in their purport and scope to Art. 392a of the appellant's charter.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed and the action dismissed.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014En 1913, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 du Canada a recommand\u00e9 la nomination d'une commission qui pr\u00e9parerait des plans d'ensemble pour l'ouverture et l'embellissement de parcs et de boulevards dans les cit\u00e9s d'Ottawa et de Hull et il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pay\u00e2t la moiti\u00e9 du co\u00fbt de ces plans et que l'autre moiti\u00e9 f\u00fbt pay\u00e9e par Ottawa et Hull proportionellement \u00e0 leur population. Cet ordre en conseil fut transmis aux autorit\u00e9s de Hull et le conseil de cette municipalit\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 deux fois sur cette proposition du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, d\u00e9cida de l'approuver le 18 juillet 1913.\nLa proposition du gouvernement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par les deux villes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, un contrat s'est alors implicitement form\u00e9 par lequel le gouvernement paierait la moiti\u00e9 du co\u00fbt des plans et l'autre moiti\u00e9 serait pay\u00e9e par les deux cit\u00e9s proportionnellement \u00e0 leur population.\nLe 12 septembre 1913, la commission \u00e9tait nomm\u00e9e par ordre en conseil du gouvernement et le maire de Hull en \u00e9tait nomm\u00e9 l'un des membres.\nDes plans auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par la commission dans les ann\u00e9es suivantes et sur demande du maire des copies de ces plans auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 remises \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Hull en 1916.\nLa cit\u00e9 de Hull refuse maintenant de payer sa proportion du co\u00fbt de ces plans en disant que la r\u00e9solution qu'elle avait adopt\u00e9e \u00e9tait ultra vires parce qu'elle n'avait pas eu au pr\u00e9alable un certificat de son tr\u00e9sorier \u00e9tablissant qu'elle avait des fonds disponibles \u00e0 cette fin. Elle invoque \u00e0 ce sujet l'article 392a de sa charte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 en 1908 et qui se lit comme suit:\u2014\nNulle r\u00e9solution du conseil, autorisant la d\u00e9pense de quelques sommes d'argent, ne pourra \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e ou n'aura d'effet tant qu'un certificat du tr\u00e9sorier de la cit\u00e9 n'aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produit, \u00e9tablissant qu'il y a fonds disponibles et \u00e0 la disposition de la cit\u00e9 pour le service et les fins pour lesquels cette d\u00e9pense est propos\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente charte.\nAucun contrat ni arrangement quelconque ne liera la cit\u00e9 \u00e0 moins qu'il n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le conseil.\nLa cit\u00e9 ne sera pas responsable du prix ou de la valeur des travaux faits, mat\u00e9riaux fournis, marchandises ou effets vendus de quelque sorte que ce soit, ni d'honoraires pour services professionnels, salaires, gages ou autre r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, sans l'autorisation sp\u00e9ciale du conseil de la cit\u00e9, ni, \u00e0 moins, dans chaque cas, qu'un certificat du tr\u00e9sorier de la cit\u00e9 ne soit produit, \u00e9tablissant qu'il y a des fonds disponibles et effectu\u00e9s aux fins sp\u00e9ciales pour lesquelles le paiement est demand\u00e9; et aucun droit d'action n'existera contre la cit\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que les formalit\u00e9s ci-dessus n'aient \u00e9t\u00e9 strictement observ\u00e9es, bien que la cit\u00e9 puisse avoir b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de tel contrat, arrangement, travaux faits, mat\u00e9riaux fournis et autres services rendus.\nCette disposition de la charte est extr\u00eamement s\u00e9v\u00e8re et restreint consid\u00e9rablement les relations d'affaires que la cit\u00e9 est tenue d'avoir, et m\u00eame dans certains cas elle pourra nuire \u00e0 son cr\u00e9dit, mais il ne nous appartient pas d'en scruter les motifs et de conna\u00eetre les circonstances qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette l\u00e9gislation. Elle n'est d'ailleurs que la reproduction presque textuelle des articles 336 et 337 de la charte de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. (62 Vic., c. 58).\nCette corporation, avec ses nombreux \u00e9chevins et officiers, \u00e9tait expos\u00e9e \u00e0 encourir des dettes que le conseil municipal lui-m\u00eame n'aurait pas sanctionn\u00e9es; et alors le l\u00e9gislateur a cru devoir la prot\u00e9ger en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que le conseil municipal seul pourrait lier la corporation et que m\u00eame dans certains cas les r\u00e9solutions du Conseil seraient sans effet si le tr\u00e9sorier ne certifiait pas qu'il y avait des fonds disponibles.\nDans le cas actuel, nous avons une r\u00e9solution du conseil de Hull approuvant le contrat qui s'est fait entre le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les cit\u00e9s d'Ottawa et de Hull par lequel des plans devaient \u00eatre pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour l'embellissement de ces deux municipalit\u00e9s. Etait-il n\u00e9cessaire que le conseil de Hull e\u00fbt un certificat de son tr\u00e9sorier avant d'approuver ce contrat?\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend que oui et elle se base particuli\u00e8rement sur le troisi\u00e8me paragraphe de l'article 392 a.\nJe ne crois pas cette pr\u00e9tention bien fond\u00e9e. Cet article nous met on pr\u00e9sence de trois cas distincts; 1. autorisation du conseil pour un paiement d'argent; 2. confection de contrats par la cit\u00e9; 3. travaux qui peuvent donner lieu \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation quantum meruit. Il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis que le premier cas ne se pr\u00e9sente pas dans la cause actuelle. Le conseil, par sa r\u00e9solution du 18 juillet 1913, n'ordonnait pas le paiement d'aucune somme d'argent, et par cons\u00e9quent, le certificat du tr\u00e9sorier n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire.\nSi on voulait \u00e9tendre cette premi\u00e8re partie de l'article \u00e0 toutes les conventions ou \u00e0 tous les r\u00e8glements qui pourraient occasionner une d\u00e9pense d'argent, on atteindrait un r\u00e9sultat bien \u00e9trange. Ainsi, par exemple, la cit\u00e9 est autoris\u00e9e, je crois, \u00e0 acheter du pouvoir \u00e9lectrique pour \u00e9clairer ses rues et ses \u00e9difices. Il est important que ces contrats d'\u00e9clairage couvrent plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Comment pourrait-elle avoir un certificat de son tr\u00e9sorier pour toute le p\u00e9riode du contrat? Ce serait impossible, vu que les revenus disponibles ne sont que pour les d\u00e9penses d'une ann\u00e9e.\nDes contrats de la nature de celui qui nous occupe sont valides sur simple approbation du conseil municipal et il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'il y ait un certificat du tr\u00e9sorier. C'est ce que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu couvrir en disant dans la deuxi\u00e8me partie de son article 392 (a) \"aucun contrat ni arrangement quelconque ne liera la cit\u00e9 \u00e0 moins qu'il n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le conseil.\" Alors si le conseil l'approuve, la cit\u00e9 est li\u00e9e. C'est ce qui s'est produit dans le cas actuel.\nPar la troisi\u00e8me partie de l'article, le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu \u00e9viter ces r\u00e9clamations nombreuses qui devaient se faire contre la corporation et qui donnaient lieu \u00e0 l'action quantum meruit parce que la cit\u00e9 en avait profit\u00e9 et parce que certains \u00e9chevins ou officiers z\u00e9l\u00e9s avaient fait faire certains travaux ou ordonn\u00e9 l'achat de certains mat\u00e9riaux. La l\u00e9gislature a voulu mettre fin \u00e0 ces abus. Voil\u00e0 toute la port\u00e9e, suivant moi, de ce dernier paragraphe.\nEn tant que les contrats sont concern\u00e9s, l'article n'enl\u00e8ve le droit d'action que dans le cas o\u00f9 ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par le conseil.\nIl n'y a pas de doute que par les dispositions de la charte la cit\u00e9 avait le droit de faire des plans non-seulement pour am\u00e9liorer son propre territoire mais aussi en dehors (arts. 92 et 144).\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend aussi qu'un r\u00e8glement aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre adopt\u00e9 pour autoriser ce contrat. Je ne vois pas de grande diff\u00e9rence entre la r\u00e9solution qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e et la disposition qui se trouverait incorpor\u00e9e dans un r\u00e8glement.\nLa question est venue devant le conseil \u00e0 deux reprises diff\u00e9rentes. Nous ne savons pas d'ailleurs si le conseil de ville a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que deux ou trois lectures des r\u00e8glements municipaux devaient \u00eatre faites avant leur passation ainsi qu'elle y \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e par l'article 4400 S.R.P.Q. (1908).\nIl s'agirait tout au plus, si un r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait requis. d'une insuffisance de d\u00e9signation qui ne saurait invalider dans l'esprit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la loi la d\u00e9cision du conseil. (arts 4185 et 4186 S.R.P.Q.).\nPour toutes ces raisons, je consid\u00e8re que l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer la somme qui lui est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014The facts of this case are not in dispute.\nOn June 5, 1913, an order in council was adopted by the Dominion Government on a memorandum submitted by the Minister of Finance who stated that he had had under consideration the need for the adoption of a comprehensive scheme or plan looking to the future growth and development of the cities of Ottawa and Hull and their environs, particularly providing for the location, laying and ornamentation of parks and connecting boulevards, the location and architectural characteristics of public buildings and adequate and convenient arrangements for traffic and transportation within the area in question. And the minister recommended that a commission be constituted, consisting of at least six members, including the mayors of Ottawa and Hull, charged with the duty of taking all necessary steps to draw and perfect such a plan for the purpose of the beautification and systematic development of the two cities, to carry out which plan the cities of Ottawa and Hull and the Ottawa Improvement Commission together with the transportation and traffic companies would be required to cooperate with a view to its gradual completion. It was added that it would seem equitable that the Government should pay half the cost of preparing such a plan and that the other half should be paid by the two cities jointly and ratably according to population. The minister therefore recommended that the civic authorities of the respective cities be invited to express their views as to the proposals made, to say whether they were willing to bear half of the expense involved and to assent to the appointment of their respective mayors on such commission.\nThe minister sent a copy of this order in council to the mayor of Hull, requesting that the city council express its view as to the proposals made, and if the proposals met with its approval to say whether the city was willing to bear its proportion of the expense as suggested and to consent to the appointment of a representative of the city on the commission as proposed.\nA special meeting of the city council of Hull took place on June 20, 1913, and the council adopted a resolution expressing its approval of the scheme and named a committee to meet with the members of the committee of the city council of Ottawa, the Ottawa Improvement Commission and the members of the Privy Council in order to discuss the proposals, this committee to report to the council.\nThe committee met the bodies referred to and reported to the Hull council, and at a meeting of the latter on July 18, 1913, the following resolution was adopted: Que ce conseil, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le rapport verbal du comit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cial charg\u00e9 de rencontrer les repr\u00e9sentants du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral relativement \u00e0 l'embellissement des cit\u00e9s d'Ottawa et de Hull, approuve le projet tel que soumis par le ministre aux membres du comit\u00e9, et que copie de cette r\u00e9solution soit envoy\u00e9e au Ministre des Finances, \u00e0 Ottawa.\nA copy of this resolution was sent to the Minister of Finance by the city clerk.\nThereupon another order in council was adopted on September 12, 1913, creating an honorary commission composed of the mayors of Ottawa and Hull and of four other members, to take all necessary steps to draw up and perfect the scheme or plan as proposed in the first order in council, the commission being authorized to employ clerical and other assistants, to engage city planners, landscape gardeners, architects, engineers and other experts, to summon before them witnesses and generally to take such steps as might be necessary to accomplish the objects of the commission.\nThe mayor of Hull acted on this commission which prepared an elaborate report, translated and printed in French and in English, with plans, etc., Hull duly receiving copies thereof. The city of Hull asked permission to use the plans and plates for the advertisement of the city, and this permission was granted and presumably the plans were used by it.\nThe total cost amounted to $75,809.08, of which the Government assumed one half, and the other half, to wit $37,904.54, was payable by Ottawa and Hull jointly and ratably according to their population, Ottawa's share was $31,344.22 and Hull's $6,560.32. The accounts were duly sent to both cities in August, 1918. Ottawa has paid its full share. Hull, in reply to numerous requests, put off payment on one pretext or another, until at last this action was taken by the Government to compel payment.\nIt is admitted by the appellant that if there be any legal liability on its part to pay the respondent anything, the amount payable by it is $6,560.32, with interest from the 20th August, 1918.\nThe plea of the city of Hull is a purely technical one. It does not pretend that the expenditure was not incurred in conformity with the orders in council and the approval it had expressed, but in order to escape payment, it invokes certain provisions of its charter, and the failure by it to take the measures prescribed before a financial liability can be incurred by the city.\nI cannot help regretting that the city of Hull has seen fit to raise this technical objection in order to resist payment of its share of the expenditure incurred. Its excuse is that it did not take the steps required by its charter in order to assume this obligation. It could easily have taken these steps, and could do so now, and its neglect in that regard is deliberate. The city of Ottawa has paid its full share, nearly five times greater than that of Hull, of the expenditure which both Ottawa and Hull authorized by their city councils, thus establishing a painful contrast between the conduct of the two cities. This, however, does not dispose of the difficulty, nor would it justify the court in disregarding the provisions of the charter of the appellant corporation which the plea invokes, if these provisions are an answer to the action of the respondent.\nIt therefore remains to be seen whether, in view of the statutory provisions invoked by the city of Hull, the action of the Government can be maintained.\nThe city of Hull was incorporated under a statute of the province of Quebec, 56 Victoria, ch. 52, to which many amendments have since been made. By 8 Edward VII, ch. 88 (1908), section 392a, which read as follows, was added to the charter:\n392a. No resolution of the council authorizing the expenditure of any moneys shall be adopted, or have any effect until a certificate of the city treasurer is produced, establishing that there are funds available and at the disposal of the city for the service and purposes for which such expenditure is proposed, in accordance with the provisions of this charter.\nNo contract or agreement whatever shall be binding upon the city, unless it has been approved by the council.\nThe city shall not be liable for the price or value of work done, materials supplied, goods or effects furnished of any kind whatever, nor for any fees for professional services, salary, wages or other remuneration, without the special authorization of the city council, nor unless, in every case, a certificate of the city treasurer is produced establishing that there are funds available appropriated for the particular object for which payment is sought; and no right of action shall exist against the city, unless the foregoing formalities are strictly observed, notwithstanding that the city may have benefited by any such contract, agreement, work done, materials supplied or other services rendered.\nHere the approval of the city council was given by the resolutions adopted on June 20 and July 18, 1913. What was wanting was a certificate of the city treasurer establishing that there were funds available and at the disposal of the city for the service and purposes for which the expenditure was proposed. That the appellant could have observed this formality is beside the question, for if the omission of the certificate that funds were available for the expenditure contemplated is a fatal omission, if in the words of section 392a\nno right of action shall exist against the city, unless the foregoing formalities are strictly observed, notwithstanding that the city may have benefited by any such contract, agreement, work done, materials supplied or other services rendered,\nthere is no escape from the conclusion that the respondent's action cannot be maintained.\nAfter the most anxious consideration, I cannot place any meaning on section 392a other than that it is an absolute bar to any claim to hold the appellant liable for the expenditure incurred under the orders in council In my opinion, with deference, the debt claimed by the respondent cannot be treated, as the learned trial judge somewhat suggested, as a \"judicial obligation\" within the meaning of section 393 of the appellant's charter, which authorizes the city council in cases of urgent necessity, either for the purpose of meeting a \"judicial obligation\" or for other unforeseen or uncontrollable causes, to procure the necessary funds to meet obligations of that character by such means as it may deem advisable. There can be no \"judicial obligation\" without a judgment enforcing a liability, and there can be no judgment against the city in a case where the statute states that no right of action shall exist.\nIt may be added that the appellant corporation has a very wide power to provide by by-law for municipal services of all kinds which entail the expenditure of public moneys (sect. 92 of the charter), and an appropriation of the amounts necessary for these purposes is made yearly in the month of February (sect. 390). To such by-laws, paragraph 1 of section 392a does not apply, for its whole scope is to guard against resolutions (and not by-laws) authorizing the expenditure (and not merely the payment) of public moneys. Paragraph 2 of section 392a requires the approval of the city council before any contract or agreement whatever shall be binding on the city, and should be read with paragraph 3. The latter paragraph, in the case of work done, materials supplied, goods or effects furnished of any kind whatever, or fees for professional services, salary, wages or other remuneration, requires two formalities before the city can be held liable, viz., the special authorization of the city council and the production of a certificate of the city treasurer that funds are available. The special authorization of the city council would generally form a contract between the city and the person or corporation performing the work or furnishing the goods or materials, but, notwithstanding what is stated in paragraph 2, and saving the case of by-laws under section 92, it would still be necessary to obtain the certificate of the city treasurer. I think, as I have said, that paragraph 2 must be read with paragraph 3, and not given such an effect as to render in most cases the latter paragraph meaningless.\nThe result is that the appeal must be allowed and the respondent's action dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Duff J.\u2014I can find no evidence of an intention on part of the appellant to forego his right of appeal or of facts which in point of law must be treated as abandonment of his right of appeal. My conclusion is that the payment was made under a threat of execution. Nevertheless, I should not wish to commit myself to the proposition that payment of a judgment in response to a demand of the judgment creditor without an express threat of execution, or initiation of execution proceedings, could, save in very exceptional circumstances, properly be treated as a voluntary payment.\nAnglin J.\u2014The fair conclusion from the material before us would appear to be that the appellant caused the costs, for which the respondent had judgment against him, to be paid under threat of execution. That payment was not such a voluntary act on his part as would indicate an intention to acquiesce in the judgment and forego his right of appeal therefrom. The respondent's motion to quash cannot succeed and should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The respondent moves to quash the appeal on the ground of acquiescence in the judgment appealed from by payment of the costs of the Court of King's Bench and of the Superior Court on the dismissal of the appellant's action.\nWith the consent of the appellant, the costs were paid by The United States Fidelity & Guarantee Company, which had given security for these costs at the time of the appeal to the Court of King's Bench. It appears however by the correspondence between the attorneys of the two parties that these costs were paid after the respondent's attorneys had threatened to issue execution against the appellant if they were not paid. They wrote to the surety, to whom they had been referred by the attorney for the appellant, demanding payment and stating that if they did not receive a satisfactory answer before a stated date they would immediately have the appellant's property seized. It was under these circumstances that the payment of the costs was effected.\nAlthough no reservation of the right of appeal was made, which of course would have been more prudent, my opinion is that this was not a voluntary payment from which acquiescence in the judgment can be inferred. I find a decision of la cour de cassation, of the 28th May, 1867 (Dalloz, 1867.1.215) very much in point. It was held that\nle paiement des frais d'un arr\u00eat, apr\u00e8s signification de l'arr\u00eat et de l'ex\u00e9cutoire de d\u00e9pens, et sur une menace \u00e9crite d'ex\u00e9cution forc\u00e9e, n'emporte pas acquiescence \u00e0 cet arr\u00eat; et, d\u00e8s lors, ne rend pas non recevable le pourvoi en cassation forme contre le m\u00eame arr\u00eat.\nI would therefore dismiss the motion with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nGregor Barclay for the motion.\nC.

V, c. 81.\nThe Quebec statute entitled \"An Act respecting the owners of houses used as disorderly houses,\" 10 Geo. V, c. 81, authorizing a judge to order the closing of a disorderly house, is intra vires the provincial legislature, as it deals with matter of property and civil rights by providing for the suppression of a nuisance and not with criminal law by aiming at the punishment of a crime.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court and maintaining the intervention in this case.\nThe questions in issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nTh\u00e9berge K.C. for the appellant.\nGeoffrion K.C. for the intervenant.\nIdington J.\u2014This action was taken by the respondent Dawson under and by virtue of 10 Geo. V, c. 81 of the Quebec Legislature, entitled \"An Act respecting the owners of houses used as disorderly houses,\" which provides, by sections 2, 3, 4, and 7, as follows:\u2014\n2. It shall be illegal for any person who owns or occupies any house or building of any nature whatsoever, to use or to allow any person to use the same as a disorderly house. A certified copy of any judgment convicting any person of an offence under section 228, 228a, 229 or 229 of the Criminal Code shall be prima facie proof of such use of the house in respect of which such conviction was had.\n3. Any person knowing or having reason to believe that any building or part of a building is being made use of as a disorderly house, may send to the registered owner, or to the lessor, or to the agent of the registered owner, or to the lessee of such building, a notice, accompanied by a certified copy of any conviction as aforesaid, if any there be, by registered mail to the last known address of the said owner, agent or lessee, as the case may be.\n4. Ten days after the mailing of such notice, if such building or any part thereof still continues to be used as a disorderly house, any person may apply for and obtain an injunction directed to the owner, lessor, lessee or occupant of such building, or to all such persons, restraining them, their heirs, assigns or successors from using or permitting the use of such building or any other building for the purposes above-mentioned.\n7. If the judge finds that the use of such building as a disorderly house continues, he shall by his final judgment, in addition to all other orders he is by law empowered to make, order the closing of the said building against its use for any purpose whatsoever for a period of not more than one year from the date of judgment.\nThe power of the legislature to so enact having been questioned, by appellant pleading in defence, the Attorney General for Quebec became an intervenant immediately thereafter. Thereupon the intervenant pleaded, the now appellant answered same, and the intervenant replied.\nThe case thus constituted was heard by Mr. Justice Maclennan who gave judgment for the respondent and granted the injunction claimed by him as provided in said section 7 of said Act, and for the intervenant with costs maintaining the constitutionality of the Act.\nFrom that judgment the present appellants appealed to the Court of King's Bench for Quebec.\nThat court seemed to be divided on the questions raised. The majority held that it was not quite satisfactorily proven by the mere production of a registrar's certificate shewing title in appellant that she was in fact the owner at the time of the trial.\nIndeed there was evidence tending to the contrary and hence the court sent the case back to the Superior Court to hear evidence and determine that question.\nThe Court of King's Bench, however, by a majority, there being a dissenting judge on the question, upheld the constitutionality of the Act and dismissed the appeal as to that issue, with costs to the responding intervenant.\nThen the appellants brought this appeal here. A question was raised as to the case so disposed of, being ripe for appeal here. The majority of this court held, however, that as between appellant and intervenant the judgment appealed from was final and decided that this court had jurisdiction and should hear the case as to the said issue. I confess as to some doubt as to that course being entirely the best for if the issue between the other parties should, in the court below, result in the appellant's success on the reference back there, perhaps they should not be subjected to the costs of this hearing. I rather think the case is unique in this regard. The appeal, however, has been taken here by appellants and the question raised is a very important one to have determined if there can exist doubt when applied only as herein.\nI have long entertained the opinion that the provincial legislatures have such absolute power over property and civil rights, as given them by section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, item 13 thereof, that so long as they did not in fact encroach upon the powers assigned by the said Act to the Dominion Parliament it would be almost impossible to question any such exercise of power so given unless by the exercise of the veto power given the Dominion Government. That veto power was originally designed to prevent an improper exercise of legislative power by the provincial legislatures.\nI, therefore, do not see that if properly interpreted and construed the said Act now in question herein can be said to be ultra vires.\nThere is, however, one aspect of it which rather disturbs me, and that is this: The Act takes certain sections of the Criminal Code as the basis of its subject matter and then proceeds to apply convictions thereunder as the basis of its application.\nAnd if, as might well happen, the keeper of the disorderly house so penalized should also be the owner thereof, and this Act applied in such a case, it would look very much like adding as a matter of course to the penalties imposed by Parliament for the offence in question, when Parliament alone is endowed with the power and has imposed on it in so doing the sole responsibility of determining what is the proper measure of punishment.\nThat, however, is not the case presented on the facts in question herein. I point it out as being the possible cause of future embarrassment and would have preferred to see its enactment somewhat differently framed. As to the argument addressed to us that the local legislatures cannot legislate to prevent crime, I cannot assent thereto for in a very wide sense it is the duty of the legislature to do the utmost it can within its power to anticipate and remove, so far as practicable, whatever is likely to tend to produce crime; and yet not produce worse forms of it, or tending thereto.\nSometimes we may doubt the wisdom of what is done in that direction and find it in fact productive of crime or a lowering of the usual standard observed by mankind. That possibility may exist in regard to many phases of social life. What we are concerned with herein, however, is merely the question of the power of the legislature so far as the relevant facts raise same. It certainly has, I think, the power called in question herein so far as the relevant facts require. Indeed the duty to protect neighbouring property owners in such cases as are involved in this question before us renders the question hardly arguable.\nThere are many instances of other nuisances which can be better rectified by local legislation within the power of the legislatures over property and civil rights than by designating them crimes and leaving them to be dealt with by Parliament as such.\nMr. Justice Maclennan and others in the court below have so well presented the exposition of the law as it has been expounded in many well known cases relative to the overlapping of the powers of Parliament and local legislatures, that I need not repeat the citation of cases here.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs to the intervenant.\nDuff J.\u2014The legislation impugned seems to be aimed at suppressing conditions calculated to favour the development of crime rather than at the punishment of crime. This is an aspect of the subject in respect of which the provinces seem to be free to legislate. I think the legislation is not invalid.\nAnglin J.\u2014This litigation began on the 4th of June, 1920. The right of the appeal to this court is therefore governed by the Supreme Court Act as it stood before the amendments which became effective on the 1st of July of that year.\nBy the judgment of the Court of King's Bench the main action between the plaintiff and the defendant is remitted to the Superior Court to permit of further proof being adduced in regard to the ownership of the property in question. That is not a final judgment and is therefore not appealable here.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court maintaining the intervention of the Attorney General on the other hand was confirmed and in that proceeding there is a final judgment upholding the constitutionality of the Quebec Statute (10 Geo. V, c. 81). Substantially for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Greenshields, I am of the opinion that this statute in no wise impinges on the domain of criminal law but is concerned exclusively with the control and enjoyment of property and the safeguarding of the community from the consequences of an illegal and injurious use being made of it\u2014a pure matter of civil right. In my opinion in enacting the statute now under consideration the legislature exercised the power which it undoubtedly possesses to provide for the suppression of a nuisance and the prevention of its recurrence by civil process.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Nous avons \u00e0 decider sur cet appel si la loi provinciale de 1915 concernant les propri\u00e9taires de maison de prostitution est inconstitutionelle.\nLe parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, dans sa loi criminelle, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 puni par l'amende et l'emprisonnement les propri\u00e9taires qui permettent sciemment que leurs maisons soient employ\u00e9es comme maisons de prostitution. (Art. 228 a Code Crim.)\nLa l\u00e9gislature provinciale de Qu\u00e9bec, sachant que ces maisons affectaient consid\u00e9rablement la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s du voisinage et rendaient plus difficile la r\u00e9glementation polici\u00e8re, a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d'ordonner leur fermeture si, apr\u00e8s avis, les propri\u00e9taires ne voyaient pas \u00e0 y faire cesser le commerce immoral qui s'y faisait.\nLa jouissance d'un immeuble est une mati\u00e8re concernant \"la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et les droits civils\" qui, par les dispositions de l'article 92 ss. 13 de l'acte de la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration est du ressort des provinces; et la l\u00e9gislature provinciale a le pouvoir exclusif de faire des lois sur cette mati\u00e8re.\nVouloir enlever aux provinces ce pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif parce que le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u00e9clare criminelles les tenanci\u00e8res d'une maison de prostitution me para\u00eet \u00eatre absolument contraire \u00e0 l'esprit de notre constitution. Nos lois provinciales fourmillent d'exemples et de cas o\u00f9 les lois criminelles sont invoqu\u00e9es pour d\u00e9terminer les droits et les obligations civiles des citoyens. Certains contrats sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ill\u00e9gaux par nos lois civiles parce qu'ils violent des dispositions du code criminel. Les articles 984 et 990 du code civil en sont des exemples typiques quand ils d\u00e9clarent qu'un contrat est fait sans consid\u00e9ration et est ill\u00e9gal, si cette consid\u00e9ration est contraire aux bonnes moeurs et \u00e0 l'ordre public, ou si elle est prohib\u00e9e par la loi. La jurisprudence consacre \u00e9galement ce principe quand elle d\u00e9clare ill\u00e9gale tout contrat de nature \u00e0 favoriser la prostitution.\nJe pourrais \u00e0 ce sujet citer-Fuzier-Herman vo. propri\u00e9t\u00e9 no. 88, o\u00f9 il dit:\u2014\nOn admet que r\u00e9tablissement d'une maison de tol\u00e9rance est susceptible de donner lieu en faveur des voisins \u00e0 une action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 raison de la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation de valeur locative ou v\u00e9nale que leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a subie par ce fait.\nIl est incontestable que si une personne maintient une maison ou fait une chose qui constitue une nuisance, et que cet acte soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 criminel par le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, nos tribunaux peuvent \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s par des lois provinciales \u00e0 \u00e9mettre une injonction pour mettre fin \u00e0 ces violations du droit public. La coop\u00e9ration des deux pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs est d\u00e9sirable dans ces cas-l\u00e0. J'aurais bien du doute-de savoir si le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pourrait ordonner la fermeture d'une maison de prostitution; mais je suis bien convaincu que ce pouvoir r\u00e9side dans la l\u00e9gislature provinciale. Le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral peut d\u00e9clarer criminelle une action quelconque; mais cela ne saurait emp\u00eacher les provinces de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur la m\u00eame mati\u00e8re en tant que les droits civils sont concern\u00e9s.\nJe n'h\u00e9site donc pas \u00e0 conclure que la l\u00e9gislation attaqu\u00e9e par l'appelante est constitutionnelle et que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Mignault J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel contre un jugement de la cour du Banc du Roi en date du 20 d\u00e9cembre 1921. Je tiens \u00e0 dire que le long d\u00e9lai qui s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis ce jugement est enti\u00e8rement le fait des parties. Cette cause paraissait sur nos r\u00f4les depuis plusieurs termes, mais on en demandait toujours la remise. Si enfin elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e c'est que nous avons cru devoir y insister.\nLa cause d'ailleurs n'est appelable ici qu'en tant que l'intervention du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est concern\u00e9e; quant \u00e0 l'action de la demanderesse, la cour du Banc du Roi l'a renvoy\u00e9e devant la cour sup\u00e9rieure pour preuve additionnelle et ce n'est pas l\u00e0 un jugement final dont on puisse interjeter appel \u00e0 cette cour.\nL'intervention du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a pour but de combattre la pr\u00e9tention de la demanderesse que la loi 10 Geo. V (Qu\u00e9.) ch. 81 (1920), est inconstitutionnelle. Cette loi d\u00e9clare qu'il est ill\u00e9gal pour toute personne qui poss\u00e8de ou occupe une maison de l'utiliser ou de permettre qu'on en fasse usage comme maison de d\u00e9sordre. On peut obtenir \u00e0 cette fin une injonction d'un juge de la cour sup\u00e9rieure pour prohiber cet usage, et si le juge constate que cette maison continue \u00e0 \u00eatre employ\u00e9e comme maison de d\u00e9sordre, il peut en ordonner la fermeture pour toute fin quelconque pendant une p\u00e9riode n'exc\u00e9dant pas un an.\nC'est cette loi que l'appelante attaque pr\u00e9tendant qu'elle empi\u00e8te sur la juridiction du parlement canadien sur le droit criminel. A mon avis, il n'y a pas l\u00e0 l\u00e9gislation criminelle. La l\u00e9gislature veut emp\u00eacher qu'on ne se serve d'un immeuble pour des fins immorales; elle ne punit pas l'offense elle-m\u00eame par l'amende ou l'emprisonnement, mais elle ne fait que statuer sur la possession et l'usage d'un immeuble.

(1920), c. 84, s. 82.\nOne of the statutory provisions, made a part of every contract of fire insurance by section 82 of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, K.S.S. 1920, c. 84, is that a fire insurance company is not liable \"for loss beyond the actual value destroyed by fire.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (16 Sask. L.R., 146), that \"actual value\" means the actual value of the property to the insured at the time of the loss and not its replacement value.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge and maintaining the respondents' actions.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nP. M. Anderson K.C. for the appellants.\nG. H. Yule for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin J. I would allow this appeal and direct a new trial.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal arises out of the trial of three actions brought by the respondents against three different insurance companies and consolidated for the purposes of the trial and final determination of the issues raised in each case which are in substance the same.\nThe said insurance companies had each insured the respondents against loss by fire as alleged in the respective declarations against each company, as follows: The Canadian National Fire Insurance Company on the buildings, $4,600, $200 and $200, and on the furniture and other personal contents $1,500; The Union Insurance Society of Canton, Limited, on the buildings, or one of them $3,000, and on the hotel furniture, $875, and on liquors, cigars and cigarettes, $125; The British Crown Assurance Corporation, Limited, on the buildings, $3,000, and on the furniture, supplies and personal effects, $875, and on liquor, cigars, cigarettes, etc., $125.\nEach of these insurances had been effected between the 1st of February, 1920, and the 7th of August, 1920.\nThe main building was a large structure and with other smaller buildings had been used in carrying on a hotel business and the contents chiefly used for same purpose in a village of only one hundred and fifty inhabitants.\nThe property had been built in 1910 or 1911, and sold to one Daley with contents in 1912 for $20,000.\nThat was before prohibition was in sight. The result of the prohibition enactments was so ruinous to the entire property in so small a place that in 1917 Daley turned it over to the Saskatchewan Brewing Company for $3,200, or $3,300, which he owed it.\nThat company sold it in February, 1920, to two of the individual respondents for $3,000.\nA Chinaman who had been using it for his business purposes sold the contents to same parties in same month for $950, which were only slightly added to before the fire.\nThe individual respondents (Lashkewicz and Rosalia Pura) then entered into a partnership under the name of \"Colonsay Hotel Company,\" now one of the respondents.\nThey had as part of the articles of partnership agreed to do their business with the Bank of Toronto, then the only bank carrying on business in said village of Colonsay.\nFrom the accounts so kept the business latterly did not seem to be prosperous, indeed would seem to have been a losing one.\nYet respondents pretend that during such losing period Lashkewicz sold to respondent, Peter Pura, his half interest in the hotel property and its contents, on the 20th September, 1920, for $7,000, of which $1,000 was professed to be paid in cash.\nNo one seems to have been able to trace this alleged $1,000. A fire took place on the 3rd of October, 1920, which consumed the entire building and most of the contents. The adjuster, one Morkill, after almost a day taken up with Peter Pura, settled, as was supposed by him, the entire loss with which appellants are chargeable, at the sum of $5,700, but his wife, respondent Rosalia Pura, refused to accept any such sum. Hence these actions which were tried by Mr. Justice McLean with a jury.\nMany questions were raised by the pleadings and at the trial with which we need not concern ourselves, in the view I take and to which I am about to refer, arising out of the learned trial judge's charge to the jury who, under said charge, returned a verdict estimating the value of the hotel building at $16,500, and of the insured contents at $3,500.\nThe learned judge then directed a judgment to be entered for a total of $13,376.64, distributed ratably to be borne by the respective appellants as in the formal judgment appears.\nA number of the learned trial judge's directions were taken exception to but in the result need not be dwelt upon here.\nThe learned trial judge, in regard to the measure of loss, directed the jury as follows:\u2014\nThe contract of insurance is to indemnify the assured against loss., I suppose the ideal way, or the way that would come most near to indemnifying the plaintiff in this case would be to place upon that site a building of the same dimensions, the same number of rooms, and the same basement, and the same appliances and the same equipment, and from that building and equipment to deduct, in some mysterious way, ten years wear and tear. He is not entitled to a new building, because he did not lose a new building. He is entitled to the same kind of building less the wear and tear on the building that he lost. I am going to instruct you as a matter of law, and if I am wrong there is another court that will set me right, that in respect to this building, and in the condition of the hotel business the proper basis on which you should fix the value of that hotel is this: a similar building erected there, at the time of the loss with the same equipment, and ten years wear and tear and depreciation taken off that;\nand as follows:\u2014\nThe contract of insurance also contains this clause\u2014you will find it on the back of each of the policies, as these policies are required by law to contain it\u2014that instead of making payment, the insurer can rebuild or replace within a reasonable time the property damaged by loss, giving notice of intention, and so on. That gives the insurer the privilege of replacing. On the strength of that provision, and the interpretation I put on the term \"market value,\" and the interpretation I put on the contract of indemnity, my instructions to you are that the proper legal basis on which you should fix the value of that building for the purposes of compensation, if they are entitled to compensation under those insurance policies, is the replacement value.\nThe appellants herein appealed against this and the resultant judgment to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. That court maintained the learned judge's said charge and dismissed the appeal with costs.\nHence this appeal herein therefrom.\nThe question thus raised is most important in light of the facts which I have outlined above in order to present the salient features and leading facts of the case to which the charge had reference.\nI entertain a very decided opinion that the learned trial judge erred in so directing the jury, and that the judgments below should be reversed.\nThere are, no doubt, many cases in which such a charge might be upheld, where the loss sustained and the cost of replacement might be the equivalent of each other. But I respectfully submit that the statutory condition, imposed by section 82 of chapter 84 of R.S.S., forms part of every fire insurance contract entered into in Saskatchewan, and which reads as follows,\n14. The company is not liable for the losses following, that is to say:\n(a) For the loss of property owned by any other person than the assured, unless the interest of the assured is stated in or upon the policy; nor for loss beyond the actual value destroyed by fire nor for loss occasioned by ordinance or law regulating construction or repair of buildings\nhas not been properly applied herein.\nIndeed the words therein\" nor for loss beyond the actual value destroyed by fire\" mean just what they say, and that is the cash market value. Market value is often made up of cash and a credit convertible into cash. They do not permit of any imaginary value the owner may be inclined to hold out for and expect, even reasonably, in the future.\nThese policies, in question herein, each and all contained also the following as part of the contract:\u2014\nTotal concurrent insurance including this policy limited to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the actual cash value of the property insured.\nThese words used in framing each of the contracts in question herein as to what the respective insurance policies in question were intended to cover and give the insured, should, I respectfully submit, have put this case, now presented, beyond all doubt as to the meaning of the words \"actual value\" in the statutory condition. Indeed I suspect they have escaped the court below.\nIt is not the appellants alone who are interested for they evidently had over-insured, but also the general public suffering so much from over-insurance.\nThe counsel for appellants cited the case of Pitman v. Universal Marine Insurance Co.[2], and Westminster Fire Office v. Glasgow Provident Investment Society[3], and MacGillivray on Insurance, page 672 and, I should add the cases cited by that author, and the case of Castellain v. Preston[4].\nThe cases cited in all these are instructive and useful as a guide. I respectfully submit it would be impossible to find any express decision reaching such remarkable results as herein in question.\nI think a new trial should be directed with costs in any event of the appeals below and herein, and costs of the first trial to abide the result of the new trial.\nDuff J.\u2014I am unable to concur in the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case. A very serious mistake was, I think, made by the learned trial judge. The jury ought to have been told that the pecuniary loss suffered by the insured in the destruction of the hotel was the true and only measure of the indemnity to which it was entitled. It seems to be quite clear that the loss should in the circumstances be measured by the value of the property\u2014not necessarily the selling value, if the insured could establish a value in use greater than the selling value\u2014and I can entertain no doubt whatever that the point upon which a jury should have been told to apply their minds was that of ascertaining the value to the insured of the property destroyed.\nThe appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed. There seems to be no reason for departing from the usual rule as to costs. The appellants therefore should have their costs on both appeals, and the costs of the abortive trial should abide the event. Anglin J.\u2014The verdict for the plaintiffs and the judgment founded on it for $13,376.64 must in my opinion be set aside because they involve substantial wrong occasioned by misdirection.\nA large hotel containing upwards of twenty-two rooms, in the village of Colonsay (population 150), built in 1910 was sold in 1912 for $20,000. Subsequently deprived of a license because of the introduction of prohibition, after having been occupied for a time by a Chinaman, it was acquired, with its appurtenances and contents, by the plaintiffs, about eight months prior to its destruction by fire on the 3rd of October, 1920, for $3,950. The equipment was supplemented by a further expenditure of about $450. There is no evidence of any increase in the value of the property between the time of its acquisition by the plaintiffs and its destruction. For the six months immediately prior to the fire the hotel appears to have been run by the plaintiffs at a substantial loss and the evidence presents no ground for believing that they entertained any expectation of an improvement in this condition of affairs,\nThe plaintiffs had insured the buildings with the defendant companies for $11,000 and the contents, including supplies, for $3,500\u2014$14,500 in all.\nDefences of fraud in making proofs of loss were negatived by the jury and were not further pressed here, the sole ground of the present appeal being that the jury's valuation of the buildings at $16,500 and the contents at $3,500 at the time of the fire were grotesquely excessive, and that the recovery awarded on that footing by the trial judge of $13,376.64 far exceeded any possible actual value of the property destroyed.\nAfter the fire, Peter Pura, one of the plaintiffs, would appear to have been ready to settle the amount of the loss with the adjusters, representing the three defendant companies, at $5,100 which they offered to pay; but his co-plaintiff, Rosalia Pura, would not assent thereto.\nThe jury was instructed by the learned trial judge in these terms:\nMy instructions to you are that the proper legal basis on which you should fix the value of that building for the purpose of compensation, if they are entitled to compensation under those insurance policies, is the replacement value.\n* * * * You will take the same basis for valuing the hotel and for valuing the furniture, that is, replacement value.\nThere is nothing in the charge to qualify these directions, which have since had the approval of the Court of Appeal.\nEach of the policies insures against loss or damage by fire the property therein described and each contains on its face this stipulation:\nTotal concurrent insurance, including this policy, limited to 66\u2154 per cent of the actual cash value of the property insured.\nIn the case of the National Fire Insurance Company's policy on the furniture and supplies for $1,500 there is an unfilled blank for the percentage of the concurrent insurance. That policy may therefore be read with the words \"* * * per cent of\" deleted from it. Each of the policies was also subject to the statutory conditions imposed by the Saskatchewan Insurance Act (c. 84, R.S.S. 1920), one of which (s. 82, s.s. 14 (a)) provides that\nThe company is not liable * * * for loss beyond the actual value destroyed by fire.\nI am, with great respect, very clearly of the opinion that \"replacement value\" (by which I understand is meant what the replacement in statu quo ante the fire of the insured property destroyed or injured would cost, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation) is not either \"the actual value destroyed by fire\" or \"the actual cash value of the property insured.\" Both these phrases\u2014one in a statutory condition, the other on the face of each policy\u2014I think mean the same thing and that is \"the actual value of the property to the insured at the time of the loss,\" having regard to all the conditions and circumstances then existing\u2014not necessarily its market value on the one hand and certainly not, on the other, its \"replacement value\" which, while it may sometimes be less than its actual value to the insured, will more often exceed that value and sometimes, as in the present instance, very grossly exceed it. The right of recovery by the insured is limited to the actual value destroyed by fire.\nThat there was in the direction I have quoted from the change manifest error in my opinion is indisputable; that it directly induced the jury's findings whereby they valued the hotel building at $16,500 and the insured contents at $3,500 is equally clear; that substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned in the trial (Con. R., 650) admits of no doubt.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and a new trial had. Costs of the abortive trial will abide the event of the new trial.\nMignault J.\u2014The learned trial judge in these three cases instructed the jury that the proper legal basis on which they should fix the value of the hotel building under the insurance policies was the replacement value.\nWith much deference, I think this was clearly misdirection in law. According to statutory condition 14 (contained in The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, chapter 84, R.S.S. 1920, section 82) the insurance company is not liable for loss \"beyond the actual value destroyed by fire.\" Condition 17 gives the company the option, instead of making payment, to repair, rebuild or replace, within a reasonable time, the property damaged or lost on giving notice of its intention within fifteen days after the receipt of the proofs of loss.\nThe construction of the contract adopted by the learned trial judge would render this option of no possible benefit to the insurers, for they would be called upon to pay the cost of replacing the property whether they chose to replace it or not. Moreover, it is the \"actual value\" which they have to pay, subject to their right to replace if they elect to do so, and this is not necessarily the \"replacement value.\"\nI cannot help thinking that this instruction of the learned trial judge to the jury was the cause of the large award which they made for this hotel and its furniture. Had they been properly instructed as to the mode of determining the amount of the loss, there would have been no ground for complaint on the question of quantum, but I am constrained to hold that the instruction given them was erroneous.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, and direct a new trial. Costs of the abortive trial should abide the event of the new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Anderson, Sample, Bayne & Noonan.\nSolicitor for the respondents : G.

[1914] c. 195 ss. 13 (1) and 83.\nBy section 5 of the Ontario Assessment Act \u201call income derived either within or without Ontario by any person resident therein\u201d is assessable and by section 13 (1) \u201cevery agent, trustee, or person who collects or receives, or is in any way in possession or control of, income for or on behalf of a person who is resident out of Ontario shall be assessed in respect of such income.\u201d\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (50 Ont. L.R. 305), Idington J. dissenting, that a trustee under a will cannot be assessed for income received which, as directed by the will, had to accumulate for a designated term of years and then be apportioned among testator\u2019s children when neither the identity of the beneficiaries nor the amount to be assessed against the trustee can be presently ascertained. As to beneficiaries resident in Ontario they and not the trustee should be assessed if their identity could be ascertained.\nPer Duff J. Sec. 13 (1) provides for indirect taxation and is ultra vires of the Ontario Legislature.\nBy section 83 of the Act every tribunal or judge to which an appeal may be taken can determine whether \u201cany person or things are or are not assessable or are or were legally assessed or exempted from assessment.\u201d\nHeld per Duff J. that notwithstanding these provisions a person assessed may, after the assessment has been upheld, bring action for a judgment declaring it illegal on the ground that the legislation professing to impose it is ultra vires. Idington J. contra.\nPer Davies C.J. and Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. The judgment of this court declaring the assessment illegal deprives the trustee of any interest he may have had to challenge the validity of the provisions of the Assessment Act assuming to impose it and the dismissal of the action for a declaratory judgment (52 Ont. L.R. 562) should be affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the County Court judge and confirming the assessment on income received by the appellant and per saltum from the judgment of Mr. Justice Orde[2] dismissing the appel- lant\u2019s action for a judgment declaring the assessment illegal on the ground that the legislation imposing it is ultra vires.\nThe material facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. The appellant appealed with success to the County Court judge whose judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division. He then brought an action for a declaratory judgment as stated above.\nMacMaster K.C. and Fraser for the appellant. The Act does not allow a personal action to be taken against an executor in respect to income of persons resident out of the province. In re Gibson and The City of Hamilton[3].\nThis is indirect taxation which the legislature cannot impose. See Burland v. The King[4] at pages 223 to 225. See also Oriental Bank v. Wright[5].\nF.D. Davis K.C. for the respondent.\nBayly K.C. for the Attorney General of Ontario.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin, in which I concur, I am of the opinion that the appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Orde should be dismissed, the costs, including those of the Attorney General, to be paid by the appellants; and that the appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division should be allowed and that the costs in that court and here should be paid by the municipal corporation to the appellant.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014Two appeals by said appellant are herein presented and heard together involving the assessment of his income as surviving trustee under the last will of the late John Curry of the said city, who died on or about the 11th day of May, 1912.\nBy his said last will the testator devised and bequeathed, after payment of his debts, testamentary and funeral expenses, all his real and personal property wherever situate, to his wife, his son, and his son-in-law in trust to convert same into money and to hold, invest, accumulate and dispose of same under and in accordance with the trusts thereinafter set out.\nSaid executors and executrix obtained probate of said will. The said wife died a few months after the testator, and the said son died in March, 1920, leaving the appellant, who was said son-in-law, sole surviving executor and trustee when the assessment in question was made.\nThe appellant, at the time of the testator\u2019s death and ever since, has resided in said city of Windsor. He was assessed in respect of the John Curry estate for an income assessment \u201cliable for all taxes\u201d of the sum of $100,000, and notice of such assessment is dated 30th October, 1920.\nThe appellant then gave the following notice of appeal:\nNOTICE OF APPEAL\nTo the Assessment Commissioner of the municipality of the city of Windsor:\nSir,\u2014Take notice that I intend to appeal against the above assessment for the following reasons:\nOnly the income of the estate payable to one annuitant under deceased\u2019s will resident in Windsor, to amount of $8,000 is assessable. The rest of income is accumulated until 1933 and is not taxable.\nJ.B. MCLEOD,\nAppellant.\nThe Court of Revision of said city confirmed the said assessment.\nThereupon the appellant appealed to the learned senior judge of the County of Essex who, holding himself bound by the authority of In re Gibson and City of Hamilton[6], allowed the appellant\u2019s appeal and reduced the said assessment for income to $14,000.\nHe then, no doubt intending to conform with the amendment of 1916 to the Assessment Act providing for an appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, by way of a stated case set forth the relevant facts of the amount of the income and what part thereof he had held assessable and the amount of the income derivable from real estate securities and submitted the following questions:\u2014\nFirst\u2014Whether the income from the said estate is assessable for income under the Assessment Act.\nSecond\u2014Whether in the event of income being payable by the said estate as found by the Assessment Commissioner for the city of Windsor and the Court of Revision thereof the interest upon moneys payable under the said agreements for sale of real estate of the deceased is exempt from income tax under section 21, s.s. 5 of the said Assessment Act or otherwise.\nDated this 7th day of February, 1912. I am of the opinion that the income from the said estate is assessable and would answer the first question in the affirmative.\nThe legal owner thereof resides in Windsor and on the facts stated the income was not derived from anything outside Ontario.\nIndeed on the case submitted we have nothing to do with that or with who may be the ultimate recipient, or his or her residence, though we were confused in argument by much irrelevant discussion thereof.\nThe case submitted to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario is all we have anything to do with except the decision of that court pursuant thereto. See the case of Dreifus v. Royds[7].\nIn passing from the first question and the bearing thereon of the decision in In re Gibson and Hamilton[8], I may be permitted to say that I fail to see how it can have any bearing on this case.\nThere a very curious situation was produced by reason of the testator having been domiciled in Beamsville and his trustees having been scattered so that it may have been difficult to find in the Assessment Act language to so fit such a case as to entitle Hamilton to assess the income.\nHere we have a very simple case in that regard.\nThe point raised by the second question is quite as simple if we correct the printing of it from section 21, subsection 5, to section 5, subsection (2), as I suspect it should be, to accord with the reasoning of the learned judges below. Section 21 of the Assessment Act has no subsection (5).\nSo interpreting the second question I would answer the question in the affirmative.\nThe investment in agreements for sale of real estate has become a well recognized form of investment security.\nIts income is neither interest on a mortgage nor rent of real estate.\nIt clearly falls within the definition of income given by the Assessment Act as amended and there is no exemption to fit it. We must give effect to the plain language of the Act and not try to engraft upon it another meaning we may think would in some cases be more just.\nI therefore conclude that this appeal should be dismised with costs throughout.\nThe other appeal between same parties and heard at same time seems to me a rather extraordinary one.\nIt arises in this way\u2014After the better part of a year of litigation pursuing the prescribed course of law and, as I hold, the only course of law (save possibly in case of fraud or an absolutely clear violation of an exemption by refusing to pay taxes) open to any one calling in question a municipal assessment and rectifying it, if wrong, the appellant, on the 8th of June, 1921, two months after the Appellate Division below had given judgment in the other case, and a month after the appeal therefrom to this court had been launched, issued a writ against respondent to restrain its officers from collecting the assessment.\nThe Assessment Act expressly declares the roll valid subject to such appeals as duly taken. In the case of MacLeod v. Campbell[9], which counsel seem to have overlooked, we decided that a similar attempt should not be made to rectify an erroneous assessment. I still think that is good law though decided six years ago.\nMoreover we have nothing to do with assessment appeals save what comes before us in the prescribed method adopted in appellant\u2019s first case, unless, of course, by special leave which has not been given herein and I respectfully submit never should be given in such a case as this second one.\nI think that appeal also should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014It will be more convenient, I think, to consider the two appeals together.\nThe effect of sections 5 and 15 of the Ontario Assessment Act is discussed in the judgment of Mulock C.J., in In re Gibson and Hamilton[10]. The opinion of the learned Chief Justice as to these sections, in which Mr. Justice Riddell concurred, is thus stated by him at page 461:\nAccording to section 5, \u201cincome,\u201d to be liable to taxation, must be income \u201cderived\u201d by a person resident in Ontario or \u201creceived in Ontario by or on behalf of a person resident out of Ontario.\u201d That is, the income in respect of which any one is liable to taxation must be either (a) income derived by such person being resident in Ontario, or (b) income received by an agent, trustee, etc., for a non\u2011resident.\nIn the former case the person assessable is the beneficiary; in the latter, it is his representative. The beneficiary \u201cderives\u201d the income, but the representative merely receives it.\nIncome to be assessable must, I think, fall within one or other of these two classes.\nThis view seems to me to be the right view, not only for the reasons appearing in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice, but because the subsequent legislation has adopted it. The decision in In re Gibson and Hamilton10 was pronounced in May, 1919, and the amendment enacted in 1919, section 18, subsection 1 (a), 9 Geo. V, c. 50, s. 8, provided that a return to be made by any person as to income should be in the form prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. By order in council passed on the 15th July, 1920, pursuant to this enactment, a form of return was prescribed, and the frame of the return so prescribed makes it quite clear that the person making a return, the prospective income taxpayer, is to give items of income which he is to receive beneficially during the current year, except in the case where the person making the return is in receipt of income on behalf of a non-resident in capacity of agent, trustee, guardian or executor. The order in council proceeds upon the theory that where income is received in trust for persons resident within Ontario, it is the beneficiary who is to be assessed and not the trustee; and this view of the Act is again the construction upon which the legislature itself proceeded in enacting s. 6, c. 67, 11 Geo. V, by which it is required that agents, trustees, executors and other persons who collect or receive or have in their possession or control income for or on behalf of a person resident in Ontario shall, on receipt of notice from the assessor, furnish a statement in writing giving the names and addresses of the persons resident in the municipality who\nought to be assessed for their income therein, together with the amount of income payable\nto such person during the current year.\nI am not overlooking the fact that by force of the provisions of the Interpretation Act the re\u2011enactment of legis- lation which has been judicially construed is not to be treated as a legislative adoption of such construction. What we have here is not a re-enactment merely of legislation which had been construed judicially, but an adoption of a judicial construction by an order in council passed pursuant to specific statutory authority and subsequent legislation, which is plainly founded and shaped upon the theory that the construction so adopted by the order in council is the right construction.\nIt follows that the appellant was not properly assessed in respect of that part of the income of the estate which is in question on the appeal from the Appellate Division, and that the appeal should therefore be allowed and the judgment of His Honour Judge Coughlin restored.\nSuch being my view of the effect of s. 5 in so far as it relates to \u201cincome derived * * * by any person resident\u201d in Ontario, it is unnecessary to consider the question raised whether or not, if the section, in that branch of it which deals with such income, had the scope which has been ascribed to it by the Appellate Division, it would have been impeachable as ultra vires of the legislature. But as regards the second branch of the section, and as regards s. 13, provisions dealing with income received or in possession or in control of any person in Ontario for or on behalf of a non-resident, the constitutional validity of these provisions must, I think, be examined. The trust does provide for the payment of a certain annual sum, $8,000 to a lady who is resident in Detroit and, as I understand it, permanently domiciled there. The municipality has asserted its right to assess the trustee in respect of this income.\nIt is necessary briefly to advert to the course of the proceedings. The appellant and his co\u2011trustee, who has since died, appealed from the assessment of 1920 to His Honour Judge Coughlin, and before him they expressed themselves content with the assessment in so far only as it included two specific annuities of $8,000 and $6,000 and their liability to assessment in respect to these items of income and their liability to pay taxes in respect of them for the year 1920 are not in question. The judgment of His Honour was delivered December 28, 1920, adopting the contention of the trustees, and accordingly reducing the assessment to $14,000.\nOn the 25th April, 1921, the Municipal Council, acting upon the power conferred by s. 56 (1) of the Assessment Act, passed a by-law providing that the municipal taxes for 1921 should be assessed and levied upon the assessment roll prepared in 1920, and the action was commenced in the following June. The necessary result of the decision of this court in appeal no. 1 would be, if s. 13 were intra vires, that the appellant would be taxed for 1921 upon income in his control as trustee in respect of the assessment of $8,000, according to the roll of 1920, as amended by His Honour Judge Coughlin.\nBut I can entertain no doubt that when the objection to an assessment is that the enactment professing to authorize it is ultra vires the roll, whether attacked by appeal under the Assessment Act or not, is not binding upon the person assessed.\nSection 83 is framed in sweeping terms, no doubt, but it is an enactment relating to procedure, and it must be presumed in the absence of specific words that the legislature in enacting that section was not resorting to the very questionable course of giving force and effect to a tax it had no power to impose by placing obstacles in the path of those seeking a judicial determination upon the point of the legality of the tax. Section 83, in my opinion, applies only to assessments within the lawful authority of the provinces.\nThe course taken by the appellant before Judge Coughlin would not strictly, in view of the appeal of the municipality from that decision, preclude the appellant from impeaching the assessment of 1920 on the ground now taken in this action; and there can certainly be no impropriety in impeaching it for the purpose of disputing the liability of the estate to taxation in respect of it in 1921. The action in my opinion lies.\nNor is it any answer to the action to say that the annuity payable to Gladys Alma Curry is not income received by the trustee by or on behalf of her. It is quite clear that this income falls within s. 13 in the sense that it is income which has been received in Ontario, and at the moment when it becomes payable to her it is income in possession and control of the trustee for her and on her behalf, at which moment the funds in possession of the trustee and applicable in payment of the annuity are subject to a trust in her favour to the extent of the sum she is entitled to receive.\nWe come, then, to the point of substance, whether ss. 5 and 13, in so far as they apply to income received or held in trust for a non-resident, are within the powers of the legislature of the Province of Ontario to enact. The meaning and effect of the words \u201cdirect taxation\u201d as they appear in item no. 2 of s. 92 of the British North America Act have been considered in many cases, and as Lord Moulton says in Cotton v. The King[11], it \u201cis no longer open to discussion\u201d that the meaning to be attributed to that phrase is substantially the definition quoted from the treatise of John Stuart Mill in these words:\nA direct tax is one which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it.\nIt is well to remember a circumstance which has been adverted to in the judgments of Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee more than once, that economists have not been in entire agreement as to the principle of the classification of taxes as direct and indirect. In Attorney General v. Reed[12] Lord Selborne pointed out in a passage which is cited by Lord Moulton in Cotton\u2019s Case11 that the definition given by McCullough, for example, would have been more unfavourable to the provinces than the definition taken from Mill. And it may be added (see Bastable, Public Finance, ed. 1903, p. 271) that on the basis of the distinction adopted by \u201cpractical financiers\u201d as the principle of the classification, the provinces would have been in a still less favourable position; that principle being that those taxes are considered direct which are levied on \u201cpermanent and recurring occasions,\u201d while charges on \u201coccasional and particular events\u201d are brought under the category of \u201cindirect taxation.\u201d\nOn this basis death duties of all kinds would be excluded from the jurisdiction of the provinces. Generally speaking income tax, according to any basis of classification, would be regarded as a direct tax, but it is, of course, quite obvious that for the purpose of applying s. 92 of the British North America Act, a principle of classification having been adopted by the courts in giving effect to the language of the Act according to the sense in which it would most probably have been understood by the legislature which passed it, the provinces cannot have that principle applied for the purpose of empowering them to levy death duties and at the same time have it discarded when it seems to impose embarrassing restrictions upon the manner in which provincial fiscal authority is to be exercised.\nFrom the terms of s. 11 (2) it is manifest that the income in respect of which the assessment is made is the income for the current year\u2014the year in which the assessment is made. That is the normal rule, and the rule as given by that section must, I think, apply to assessments under s. 13. That seems to be the construction under which the order in council proceeds, as appears from the form of the prescribed return, and I think it is the correct construction. True, s. 13 applies only to income \u201ccollected or received\u201d or \u201cin possession or control,\u201d and prima facie this means income received in fact or in fact in possession or control. But the language of s. 5 as well as that of s. 11 does not materially differ from this and it is quite clear that where it is a person beneficially entitled who is assessed, it is s. 11 (2) that gives the rule by which the assessor is to be guided, and under that section the amount of the assessment may be the result of estimate or, if estimate is impossible, fixed at a sum not less than an arbitrary minimum determined by the amount of income received in the previous year. I think s. 13 must be read as imposing the liability only, and that s. 11 (2) must be considered as prescribing the method by which the amount of the assessment is to be ascertained. S. 56 must also be adverted to, under which a council may adopt the assessment of the preceding year\u2014a proceeding which may entail the result that a person assessed in the year immediately preceding, pursuant to s. 11 (2), for an amount determined by his income the year before that may in consequence become liable to pay in one year\u2014the year following that of the redaction of the roll\u2014income tax in respect of the amount of income received two years before, although such amount may be far in excess of the sum received by him during the year for which he is assessed and taxed.\nThe effect of this section, then, is that a trustee in receipt of an income for a non-resident beneficiary may be liable to pay income tax in respect of an income of an estimated amount which he may only in part have received or not have received at all. It is past question not intended that he shall ultimately bear the tax. Normally he will indemnify himself, no doubt from moneys in his hands, but his liability is in no way, conditioned upon the existence in his hands of a fund out of which the tax can be paid. The tax is not a lien upon the trust property, and the municipality has no recourse against such property. If he resort to funds in his hands for payment, it is not pursuant to any duty laid upon him by the taxing authority so to apply the funds, but as a means of indemnifying himself against the personal liability which the statute imposes upon him directly.\nWhere personal liability is imposed upon a trustee or agent in respect of income received by him as such and the tax is not charged upon the income and there is no recourse against it by the taxing authority and the trustee is under no duty to the taxing authority to retain the income in his hands and apply it in payment of the tax, we should appear to have a case in which the trustee is the very person from whom the taxing authority demands the tax it being left to him to secure his indemnity from those who are ultimately intended to sustain the burden.\nThe case is, of course, quite different where no personal liability is imposed, where, for example, the liability of the trustee or agent is limited to the amount in his hands for his beneficiary, as in the case of Burland v. The King[13].\nWhere, too, trust property is charged with the payment of the tax, it is conceivable that the proper inference as to the legislative intent would be that the primary source of payment should be the trust fund, and the personal liability designed only as security for the proper application of the fund, but this is not a point of view with which we are concerned on this appeal.\nThe reasoning above was foreshadowed in the judgment of Lord Selborne in Attorney General v. Reed[14], and is that upon which the judgment of Lord Moulton proceeds in Cotton\u2019s case, and was expressly approved.\nBoth appeals to this court should, therefore, be allowed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The appellant (plaintiff) is the surviving trustee under the will of the late John Curry of the city of Windsor, Ontario, who died on the 11th of May, 1912. By his will he directed certain properties to be held by his trustees and the income thereof accumulated for a period not yet expired. The beneficiaries, who will be definitely ascertained only on the expiry of this period, are some resident in Ontario, some elsewhere, and some yet unborn.\nThe validity of the municipal assessment for the year 1920 by the city of Windsor of the appellant as such trustee in respect of annual income derived from properties so held forms the subject of this appeal. Following the procedure for appeal provided by the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.O. 1914, c. 195) the appellant carried his case to the Appellate Divisional Court, unsuccessfully contending that, properly construed, the provisions of that Act do not authorize the impeached assessment. In an action subsequently brought for a declaratory judgment, he challenged the validity of the legislation invoked by the respondent to support the assessment if it should be given the construction put upon it by the Appellate Division. He now appeals from the judgment of the Divisional Court in the former proceeding; and, by consent, under s. 37 (b) of the Supreme Court Act (1920), per saltum from the decision of Mr. Justice Orde who dismissed the latter action. The tax on $72,310.57, the amount of the assessment in dispute, exceeds $2,000. Our jurisdiction to entertain both appeals in my opinion admits of no doubt.\nThe late Charles Curry, a co-trustee of the appellant who lives in Windsor, resided at Detroit in the State of Michigan and died there on the 24th March, 1920. A portion of the income of the estate derived from the purchase of properties in the city of Detroit, it is now claimed, was in 1920 kept in the First National Bank in that city, certain payments being made out of it and only the surplus (how much does not appear) was \u201cchecked into the estate in Ontario.\u201d The latter evidence, however, was not before the court on the original assessment appeal, having been given only in the subsequent action.\nThe case stated by the County Court Judge in the Assessment Appeal makes no reference to any foreign income but places the \u201cnet income within Ontario\u201d at $86,310.57, the details of which appear in an appended statement furnished by the trustee. For the purpose of the appeal from the Divisional Court the suggestion that part of the assessed income did not come into Ontario must, therefore, be disregarded, notwithstanding the fact that the assessment of income for 1920 would appear to have been based by the assessor on the actual receipts of the year 1919, as provided for by section 11 (2) of the Assessment Act. Indeed the sum of $86,310.57 appears to have been treated throughout the proceedings which culminated in the judgment of the Divisional Court as income actually received in Ontario by the appellant trustee for the year 1920; and it was so treated in the factum filed on his appeal to this court from that judgment. It is, I think, too late now to enter upon any discussion of the actual amount of income received in that year in Ontario. The sum mentioned in the stated case must be accepted as accurate for the purposes of this appeal. That income, however, included, as appears in the stated case, a sum of $13,873.34 for interest paid by purchasers of real estate in Ontario, which forms the subject of a distinct ground of appeal.\nOf the sum of $86,310.57, $6,000 was paid to a beneficiary residing out of Ontario and $8,000 to another beneficiary residing in the province. To his assessment in respect of this $14,000 the appellant submitted before the County Court Judge. The appeal, therefore, concerns his liability for assessment in respect of the balance of $72,310.57, of which the stated case says:\u2014\nUnder the provisions of the said will of the late John Curry the balance of the above\u2011mentioned net income together with that of previous and subsequent years is to be accumulated by the trustees for a period of twenty-one years commencing on the 11th day of May, 1912, and expiring on the 10th day of May, 1933, whereupon the accumulated trust fund is to be divided among persons at present unascertained and whose right and title will depend on the circumstances at the time fixed for the said division.\nOn behalf of the appellant it is stated and is not denied that some of the beneficiaries under this trust may be persons still unborn.\nThe material provisions of the Assessment Act are as follows:\u2014\n5. All real property in Ontario, and all income derived either within or without of Ontario by any person resident therein, or received in Ontario on behalf of any person resident out of the same shall be liable to taxation subject to the following exemptions:\n(Here follow certain exemptions, including,\nSubsection 21. Rent or other income derived from real estate, except interest on mortgages. 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 5, par. 20).\n11 (1). Subject to the exemptions provided for in sections 5 and 10: (a) every person not liable to business assessment under section 10 shall be assessed in respect of income.\n12 (1). Subject to subsection 6 of section 40, every person assessable in respect of income under section 11 shall be so assessed in the municipality in which he resides, either at his place of residence or at his office or place of business. 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 12 (1); 7 Edw. VII, c. 41, s. 2.\n13 (1). Every agent, trustee or person who collects or receives, or is in any way in possession or control of income for or on behalf of a person who is resident out of Ontario, shall be assessed in respect of such income.\nSection 5 declares the liability of income to taxation. I assume that it evinces a general intention that all income earned, derived or received in the province, not specially exempted, shall be taxable. But, as Taft C.J., said in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Smietanka v. First Trust and Savings Bank[15], such an intention\nmust be carried into language which can reasonably be construed to effect it. Otherwise the intention cannot be enforced by the courts.\nAssessment is the only basis of municipal taxation under the Ontario system (s. 3). As put by Sir William Mulock C.J. Ex., in In re Gibson and Hamilton[16].\nthere can be no taxation of income without previous assessment of some person in respect of such income.\nA person assessed in respect of income is thereby made personally liable to pay a tax upon it at a rate imposed according to other provisions of the law. The only clauses under which it was contended at bar that the appellant is liable to assessment are s. 11 (1) and s. 13 (1). The question presented therefore is: Does the appellant in respect of the income for which he has been assessed fall within either of those provisions? The first point for determination is whether under s. 5, in respect of income received by him for accumulation under the trust above stated, the trustee appellant is properly assessable.\nThere can be no room for doubt that by the words \u201cany person resident out of the same\u201d in s. 5 is meant a beneficiary for or on whose behalf income is paid to some agent, collector, recipient or custodian in Ontario. The corresponding words \u201cby any person resident therein\u201d there can, I think, be little room for doubt are intended to designate a person standing in the like relation to the income, that is, the beneficiary of it, who is said to \u201cderive\u201d it, whereas the agent, trustee, collector, recipient or custodian on behalf of the non-resident is said merely to \u201creceive\u201d it. That distinction is carried out in s. 11 (1) and s. 13 (1). Under the former the resident beneficiary \u201cderiving\u201d the income is made assessable; under the latter, in respect of income derived by the non-resident beneficiary, not he, but the person who collects or receives it for or on his behalf is to be assessed. There may be little difficulty in applying these provisions where the income got in by the trustee or agent is payable forthwith to certain beneficiaries. But other considerations arise where the right of enjoyment is deferred by a trust for accumulation and where, as here, some of the beneficiaries are or may be unborn and the shares of those in esse are not presently ascertainable. For what proportion, if any, is the trustee assessable and for what the beneficiaries?\nUnborn beneficiaries cannot properly be designated either as resident in Ontario or as resident out of the same. The proportion of the 1920 income to which they may eventually be entitled is problematical. In so far as that income may ultimately be payable to persons now resident in Ontario, if the amounts held for them had been ascertainable in 1920, I should incline to the view that such beneficiaries and not the trustee would have been assessable in respect thereof had the trust for accu- mulation not prevented their presently obtaining it. I find no provision in the statute making a trustee for accumulation for the benefit of resident beneficiaries assessable in respect of the income ultimately to be \u201cderived\u201d by them.\nIn so far as the income in question belongs to non-residents, assuming the validity of s. 13 (1), I should think the trustee is the person to be assessed. But here again arises the question, insolvable in 1920, \u201cfor how much\u201d?\nAfter giving to the provisions of ss. 5, 11 (1) and 13 (1) much thought and consideration, my conclusion is that in respect to income directed to be accumulated by a trustee for future distribution amongst persons wholly or partially unascertained, some of them within and some of them without Ontario, he is not assessable. As to so much of that income as will ultimately be derived by resident beneficiaries s. 11 (1) applies and such beneficiaries when ascertained and when they derive the income are made assessable. The trustee is not. The contrast between s. 11 (1) and s. 13 (1), when read in the light of the distinction made in s. 5 between resident and non-resident beneficiaries, seems to make this reasonably clear. On the other hand as to so much of the income as is received or collected for or on behalf of non-resident beneficiaries in esse and will ultimately go to them the difficulty in the way of assessing the trustee for it seems to lie in the fact that the amount is unascertainable. As to whatever portion, likewise unknown, is to go to persons still unborn it is impossible to classify these either as resident or as non-resident. Hence the liability of the trustee to assessment is uncertain and that of the beneficiaries an impossibility. We seem to be confronted with another instance of casus omissus similar to that dealt with by the Supreme Court of the United States in Smietanka v. First Trust and Savings Bank[17].\nFor the respondent it is contended that the trustee is the person who \u201cderives\u201d the income of the trust estate; that qua income it is in reality his; that the right of the beneficiaries is not to receive income but to share in an accumulated fund; that, therefore, for purposes of taxation the income is that of the trustee and not that of the beneficiaries. It accordingly contends that the word \u201ctrustee\u201d in s. 13 (1) is not used in the ordinary legal sense but signifies merely an accountable agent. I cannot accede to that view. It involves deleting the word \u201ctrustee\u201d from s. 13 (1). I see no reason for giving that word any such restricted meaning. It is, I think, most improbable that in framing and enacting the Assessment Act the draughtsman and the legislature proceeded on the idea that income received by a trustee belongs to him and not to his cestui que trust\u2014that he has any real ownership of it or a taxable interest in it. Where they intended to make him taxable in respect of such income, notwithstanding lack of beneficial interest, they expressly so provided\u2014s. 13 (1). Sections 5, 11 (1) and 13 (1), when read together, seem to me to make it abundantly clear that only in the case of a non-resident beneficiary was it intended that the trustee should be assessable in respect of income.\nNor does s.s. 1 (h) of s. 22 of the Assessment Act, referred to by Mr. Justice Lennox, in my opinion help the respondent. Determination of assessability is not the office of section 22. That is dealt with by preceding sections. Section 22 merely defines the method to be pursued by the assessor in preparing the assessment rolls and in placing thereon the names of persons made assessable under such earlier provisions and the particulars of the various subjects of their assessments, etc.\nI agree with the opinion expressed by Sir William Mulock C.J. Ex. in In re Gibson v. City of Hamilton[18].\nIn the view I have taken it is unnecessary to determine whether the $13,873.34 received as interest upon unpaid purchase money for lands falls within the exemption provided for by clause 21 of s. 5:\u2014\nRent and other income derived from real estate in Ontario, except interest on mortgages.\nI incline to the opinion that it does not.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that the defendant was not assessable in respect of any portion of the $72,310.57 income in question. The appeal from the judg- ment of the Appellate Divisional Court should, therefore, be allowed with costs in that court and here to be paid by the municipal corporation to the appellant.\nThe view I have taken of the assessment appeal proper\u2014and which I understand finds favour with the majority of the members of the court\u2014suffices to dispose of the liability of the appellant for the taxes in question and renders unnecessary consideration of the constitutional question presented in the action tried before Mr. Justice Orde. Indeed it does more; it deprives the appellant of his status to raise that question, inasmuch as in a proceeding already pending when that action was begun the assessment which he would impeach as involving indirect taxation is held not to be within the provisions of the legislation attacked on that ground. It is true that he repeats in that action his claim that the assessment be set aside on the ground already taken in his assessment appeal. But that was quite unnecessary and the only substantial purpose of the action was to bring the constitutional question before the court in the event of the judgment of the Appellate Division in the assessment appeal being upheld. As the result of the disposition of that appeal practically deprives the plaintiff of any interest he might otherwise have had to challenge the validity of the provisions of the Assessment Act under which the respondent sought to tax him, it follows that the judgment of Mr. Justice Orde dismissing that action, though on other grounds, should be upheld and the appeal from it dismissed with costs, including the costs of the Attorney General.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014These are two appeals concerning the validity of an assessment on the income of the Curry estate.\nMr. John Curry died in 1912 leaving a will of which the appellant, McLeod, is the sole surviving executor and trustee. Under the provisions of this will, the trustees are directed to pay from the income certain annuities to the wife and children of the testator and to invest the surplus income from the estate for a period of twenty-one years. At the expiration of the accumulation period the whole trust fund will be divided among the children of the testator; and, in the event of the death of any of them, the share of the one so dying will be divided amongst the testator\u2019s grandchildren.\nAs a consequence of the provisions of this will, the fund is accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons.\nOne of the questions raised is whether unascertained and unborn beneficiaries are assessable under the provisions of the Ontario Assessment Act.\nSection 5 of the Act enacts that\nAll * * * income derived either within or without of Ontario by any person resident therein or received in Ontario by or on behalf of any person resident out of the same shall be liable to taxation.\nIn section 13 of the same Act, it is declared that\nEvery agent, trustee or person who collects or receives or is in any way in possession or control of income for or on behalf of a person who is a resident of Ontario shall be assessed in respect of such income.\nThis question is not a new one. It was considered in a case of Gibson v. City of Hamilton[19], and there it was held by the Chief Justice of the Exchequer and by Mr. Justice Riddell that the income in respect of which any one is liable to taxation must be either income derived by a person resident in Ontario or income received by a trustee for a non-resident.\nIn the former case, the person assessable is the beneficiary; in the latter case, it is his representative.\nSection 13 of the Act says that the trustee can be assessed only in the case where he collects the income for a person who resides out of Ontario.\nBut quaere where the beneficiary is unknown and where a trust fund has been created, as in this case, for persons who cannot be identified or ascertained.\nIt has been contended that the word \u201cperson\u201d in section 5 of the Assessment Act would cover the trustee; and it is claimed then that McLeod as trustee of the estate could be assessed for the whole income of the estate.\nIt should not be forgotten in that respect that McLeod pays to the living daughters of Mr. John Curry a sum of $14,000 out of the income. The balance of the income, about $72,000, goes into the trust fund. If the City of Windsor can tax Mr. McLeod himself for these $14,000 paid to the children, it could also assess the same persons, if they live in the City of Windsor; and in such a case those persons would be assessed twice, once through the trustee and once of their own right. That would be the result of the construction of section 5 if \u201cany person\u201d who is mentioned there covers not only the beneficiaries but also the trustee. I am of the view that the trustees can be taxed only for a person when such person resides out of Ontario; and where no such person exists, as in the present case because we do not know to whom the trust fund which is accumulated will be later on given, I am of opinion that the beneficiary in this case does not come within the class of persons mentioned in section 13, namely, persons residing out of Ontario. The assessment can be validly made only on a person living at the present time and residing out of Ontario. The principle is that municipal corporations can levy no tax unless the power is plainly conferred.\nDillon, Municipal Corporations, 5th ed., vol. 4, s. 1377; Maxwell, Interpretation of Statutes, 5th ed., pp. 463, 464; City of Ottawa v. Egan[20].\nThe Assessment Act of Ontario does not confer plainly upon the municipal corporations the right of assessing an income which is not to be paid to a living person residing outside of Ontario.\nFor these reasons the appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below and the assessment set aside.\nThere is also to be considered in this appeal the declaratory action instituted by the appellant to have the assessment declared illegal and also unconstitutional. I consider this action useless and it should be dismissed with costs throughout.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal from Appellate Division allowed with costs.\nAppeal from Orde J. dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: McLeod and Bell.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Davis and Healy.\n[1] 50 Ont.

Hutton (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1923: May 30; 1923: October 9.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nVendor and purchaser\u2014Agreement for sale\u2014Assignment\u2014Covenant by assignor\u2014Foreign action by assignee\u2014Consent judgment\u2014Order for sale of land\u2014Liberty to assignee to bid\u2014Purchase by assignee\u2014Action on foreign judgment\u2014Alternative claim for original debt.\nD. sold land in Saskatchewan by agreement of sale, the purchaser paying cash, assuming a mortgage on the land and undertaking to pay the balance of the price by instalments. D. assigned this agreement to H. and entered into a covenant to pay, on demand, any moneys as to which the purchaser made default. D. did not pay an amount as to which there was such default and H. brought action in Saskatchewan claiming the whole amount due him under the assignment, a declaration that he had a lien on the land and an order for sale in case the debt was not paid. D. filed a consent to judgment in these terms being entered and as entered it provided that on sale of the land H. should have leave to bid and the purchaser should receive a certificate of title \u201cfree from all right, title and equity of redemption\u201d on the part of D. The judicial sale took place and H. became the purchaser. Later the land was sold to satisfy the mortgage against it and the title passed from H. who had taken an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario on the Saskatchewan judgment and also claiming on D\u2019s. covenant the amount due on said judgment.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (53 Ont. L.R. 105) that such action could be maintained and H. was entitled to recover the amount claimed less the full amount of the purchase money at the judicial sale.\nHeld also that D. could not claim that the leave to H. to bid at the sale was beyond the consent to the Saskatchewan judgment; that the consent to the order for sale covered all that could follow in the ordinary course of practice.\nPer Mignault J.\u2014H. was estopped from raising this question by failing to appeal from the Saskatchewan judgment.\nHeld further that the finality of the foreign judgment could not be raised by D. in this action.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial[2] in favour of the respondent.\nThe facts are fully stated in the above head-note.\nDay K.C. and Walsh for the appellant. The respondent cannot have both the land and the personal remedy. See Sanderson v. Burdett[3] at page 129. Mutual Life Assur. Co. v. Douglas[4] at page 247.\nThompson K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Duff, in which I concur, I am of the opinion that this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant being possessed of a quarter section of land in Saskatchewan, subject to a mortgage upon which there remained to accrue due a balance of $1,000, sold, on the 5th February, 1915, by articles of agreement of that date, said quarter section to one Boles for the price of $5,635, of which he paid $900 in cash, and assumed the balance of the said mortgage to be paid off by him.\nOn the 21st of May following she, in consideration of the sum of $3,035, by indenture of that date to which said Boles was a party, assigned said articles of agreement to the respondent; and assigned thereby also the said land to the respondent.\nA long covenant therein by her with respondent assuring him of her right to so assign is followed by the following:\u2014\nAnd the said assignor doth further, for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenant, promise and agree to and with the said assignee, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, that in case of default by the purchaser in payment of any sum or sums of money which shall become due or owing under the articles of agreement, that he will forthwith on demand, well and truly pay or cause to be paid to the said assignee, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns any sum or sums so in default.\nThe use of the masculine instead of the feminine terms properly applicable to appellant is covered by a general provision at the end of the document.\nAfter this covenant on the part of the appellant just quoted in full, Boles, the purchaser, acknowledges notice of the said assignment and admits the amount owing by him is as thereinbefore set out.\nThen he covenants as follows:\u2014\nAnd the said purchaser doth further covenant, promise and agree to and with the said assignee that he will pay or cause to be paid to the assignee, the said sum of money still owing and unpaid under the said articles of agreement, on the days and times and in the manner therein set forth, and that he will keep, observe and perform all covenants, provisos and agreements in said agreement contained.\nThe following November the respondent\u2019s solicitor wrote the appellant about an over-due instalment of principal and interest on the said mortgage which was answered by her husband contending that she should not be thus called upon, as respondent had agreed to look to the land. That correspondence lasted many weeks and will be referred to later.\nOn the 27th January, 1914, respondent sued the appellant and Boles.\nI need not recite the story of that litigation further than to say that part of it resulted in an order for the leave to sign judgment against the defendants therein for the sums named, and a direction for the sale of the land allowing respondent to bid, and is called an \u201cOrder nisi.\u201d\nI am far from being convinced that everything done relative thereto was done in due order. I assume, however, that the respondent became the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, which, if previous values in question to be taken seriously, and not a mere myth, was a sale that should not have taken place, especially to the respondent conducting said proceedings; and in any event did not entitle him to hold same as against the appellant in the event of his resorting to her covenant sued on herein.\nHowever all that may be, to which I will advert later, the sequel to said proceedings, so far as evidenced herein, seems to me far from what I should expect in a final judgment of a foreign country or province seeking recognition in a suit alleged to be founded thereon.\nI am, however, presented, at some angles of the argument of this appeal, with a reminder of the case of Davidson v. Sharpe[5], wherein I proceeded upon the theory that the exemplification therein presented and received in evidence, being the final word of the British Columbia court issuing same, must be held conclusively in favour of the plaintiff appellant.\nThe majority having taken another view I am not quite sure, but think I had better adhere to the principles I there had in mind as to the necessity for finality of the proceedings had in a foreign jurisdiction which must be had in mind when a suit is brought on a foreign judgment.\nI agree with the learned judges below in that regard and think with those taking that view that this action so far as founded upon said alleged final judgment, should be dismissed from the consideration of this case.\nThe fact that for half a century or so it has been by force of a statutory amendment possible to re-try, as it were, in Ontario the original causes of action and any proper defences existing in relation thereto, renders that aspect of this appeal of little consequence, for the respondent has presented his case alternatively and sued upon the appellant\u2019s covenant set forth above.\nUpon that aspect of the case the appellant has met with little encouragement in the courts below, for the unanimous opinion seems to have been against her.\nAs to the grounds taken by her counsel herein, and apparently below also, that she is a mere guarantor, the cases they refer to as relevant thereto are cases of principal and surety, pure and simple.\nAnd there is, I respectfully submit, not the slightest ground for contending that such a legal relationship existed between appellant and Boles. To use the word \u201cguarantor\u201d (which is one of wide import covering a suretyship, or a case of warranting a machine) as descriptive of appellant herein, does not help in argument of such a case as presented. We must look at the actual facts and realize, if we can, what the parties are about.\nAs to the suggested election by the respondent bidding and buying at the Saskatchewan sale barring his right here to resort to the covenant, the case of Mutual Life v. Douglas[6] seems irrelevant and, so far as not so, the decision is against appellant\u2019s argument.\nThe ground taken that the respondent by purchasing has lost any right, is to me quite untenable. He clearly had a right to bid, according to the local law, and we cannot impose upon the courts there our views as to the desirability, or otherwise, of his having such a right.\nIn my personal view as to the desirability of sanction- ing such a system, without the most stringent provisions relative to upset or reserved bids, and the appearance at all of a party concerned appearing on the scene as an actor therein, is quite repugnant to what I hold as desirable. Perhaps we could not have a better illustration of the undesirability of having that done, than is to be got by looking at the results presented herein.\nThe respondent gets thereby the equity in a property he had, a year or so before, evidently deemed worth at least six or seven times what he bid for it.\nIt is, however, entirely another question that is raised as to the legality thereof. I cannot say it is entirely illegal.\nThen where does that leave appellant? Her counsel argues stoutly that said suit having been to enforce a vendor\u2019s lien, the result, as between these parties, must be the same in law as if the case had been for foreclosure between a mortgagee and mortgagor, and the mortgagee, after obtaining his final order, had sold the property.\nI have tried anxiously to find the foundation for such a proposition of law. I can find no case of enforcing a vendor\u2019s lien in any other way than by directing a sale of the land or interest bound by the lien. I venture to think no case exists of a proceeding by way of foreclosure, and hence the law relevant thereto is not applicable to the case of a lien.\nThe cases relied upon are either cases of foreclosure, or nothing akin to what we have to deal with herein.\nBut in another aspect of this case I am about to present, the legal situation may produce in my view analogous results.\nThere are some aspects of the transaction between the appellant and the respondent which are not unlike the case of a mortgagor and mortgagee; but when duly considered and analyzed, that transaction, in question herein, to my mind, is clearly not the creation of a mortgage, but an absolute sale of a security.\nIt is a case of bargain and sale, and that accompanied by a common business assurance that the quality of the thing the vendee is getting will be found such as her covenant imperatively requires it shall turn out to be. That has failed. And though the statutory law of England changed in various ways, for the past three quarters of a century, some of the conditions relative to sales by those in the position of mortgagees, or the courts on their behalf, I have not been able to find a single decision that puts a vendee, in course of such sales, in the same position as a mortgagee is in relation to foreclosure.\nThe appellant\u2019s counsel seemed to me to assume that the mortgagee acquiring, by virtue of modern statutory legislation relative to sales of the mortgaged property, a title thereto must stand in every respect in the same position as a mortgagee who has obtained a final order of foreclosure, that is, that if he sues upon the covenant he opens up the whole matter and the mortgagor is entitled to redeem.\nNot a single case of the many cited touches this point and supports such an assumption.\nThe correspondence which I adverted to above clearly offers the appellant, indeed assures her, that the basis of the deal between her and respondent was that upon repayment of the money advanced, with interest and costs of course, she should have all that the respondent had been assigned by her.\nThat, however, was not acted upon when available and is now no more than evidence of what in respondent\u2019s mind fair dealing required.\nIt seems difficult to believe that the quarter section, passing through different hands, and which the evidence herein discloses as being worth, at all events, from $3,000 to $5,600, should be sold by the prior mortgagee for apparently less than $1,000. The chances are any such sale is liable to be impeached and the prior mortgage redeemed.\nThe correspondence I have referred to presents on behalf of respondent exactly the legal implication existent by virtue of the assignment, and binds him to return all he got thereby including the resultant sale to himself. I infer it was that aspect of the correspondence that induced the consent to the order nisi. Respondent has not, according to his evidence, resold the equity he got thereby. I incline to the opinion that the judgment should have provided for the assignment by the respondent to appellant, upon payment to him of the amount found due herein, of any interest he may have acquired in said lands.\nThe evidence of what was done under the first mortgage is most unsatisfactory and there may yet be some means of redeeming same.\nAgain this action in any event is but for damages for breach of appellant\u2019s covenant.\nIt is the general principle of law that the party claiming damages for breach of contract is in duty bound to minimize the damages where he can reasonably be expected to do so.\nThe respondent seems to have dealt with the property he acquired in such a manner that if lost, as now pretended it was, there is strong ground for suspecting him of reckless neglect, including possibly a disregard of obligation under section 64 of the Saskatchewan Land Titles Act, and that it was through such neglect a valuable asset has been lost, to the detriment of appellant.\nI should have preferred to see the reference directed cover this ground and, if what I suspect turned out correct, allowance duly made appellant in reduction of the judgment awarded against her.\nI am bound to say, however, that no such contentions, thus limited, were presented in argument and must assume counsel had good reasons, not appearing in the case, for not so contending.\nI must therefore assent to the formal judgment upon which the majority of this court has agreed.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed, but before explaining the grounds upon which I think the respondent Hutton is entitled, with a modification to be stated presently, to maintain the judgment in his favour in the courts below, it is important to make it quite clear that this conclusion does not involve any decision upon either of two points, one of great general importance and the other of some difficulty, which were rather elaborately argued. The first of these is the question whether an unpaid vendor who has, in proceedings to enforce his lien for the purchase money, obtained leave to bid and, pursuant to that leave, purchased the property, can after the property has passed out of his possession and power proceed to enforce the judgment for the unpaid residue. Whether the vendor in such circumstances is in the same position as a mortgagee is a question of general importance, and before deciding it adversely to the view advanced on behalf of the appellant, the weighty considerations which were urged and might be urged in support of that view would require the most careful examination. The other question is whether, the respondent having lost his title to the property in consequence of proceedings taken by the holder of a paramount security, he is in any view of the law, in consequence of the provisions of the agreement between him and the appellant, free from the operation of the principle which the appellant invokes. Upon neither of these questions, it must be understood, is any opinion now expressed.\nThe grounds upon which I think the appeal fails are as follows: The respondent took proceedings in the courts of Saskatchewan for the recovery from Boles and Mrs. Dent, under the agreement of the 5th February, 1913, and the assignment of the same agreement of the 21st May, 1913, of the moneys due under the agreement, an alternative claim being for judgment against the defendants for the full balance of the purchase money and a declaration that the plaintiff, the respondent Hutton, had a lien on the lands for the same and for the sale of the property under the direction of the court to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Boles, upon whom the writ of summons was served by special leave, did not appear. Mrs. Dent appeared and delivered a defence disputing liability, and subsequently the respondent moved for judgment for the moneys due under the agreement, for a declaration of the respondent\u2019s lien and for an order for the sale of the land under the direction of the court to satisfy the claim. On the return of this motion a judgment was given which, as appears from the formal judgment, included a direction that the respondent Hutton should have leave to bid and, further, that the purchaser should receive a new certificate of title of the land in question \u201cfree from all right, title and equity of redemption\u201d on the part of the defendants or either of them.\nIt is plain, I think, that the effect of the judgment is that the respondent is to recover from Boles and Mrs. Dent the moneys due on the agreement subject to a deduction of the amount received for the sale of the lands, and that the respondent is to have leave to bid, and that if he becomes the purchaser he is to receive a title free from any equity of redemption just as any other purchaser would, and that the amount of the purchase money, just as in the case of a purchase by a stranger, is to be deducted from the amount of the judgment.\nIt is argued on behalf of the appellant that this judgment is inoperative as an estoppel, for several reasons; first, it is said that it is not a final judgment because there is no judgment of the court determining in figures the amount of the deficiency after crediting the amount of the purchase money; secondly, it is said that the judgment was a consent judgment, and that the direction by which the respondent had leave to bid and consequently the right to acquire the lands by purchase free from any equity of redemption or other equity went beyond the limits of the consent, and that it is therefore in no way binding upon the appellant.\nDealing first with the second of these objections, in the absence of evidence to the contrary it must be assumed, I think, that the formal judgment correctly expresses the view of the local master as to the judgment he intended to give. The formal consent which is in evidence was a consent to judgment in terms of the notice of motion, that is to say, to a judgment providing for a sale under the direction of the court. The consent, therefore, was clearly in terms a consent to judgment ordering a sale under such directions. If one is to assume that the formal consent was the only consent given it would not, I think, be fair to construe it as a consent in advance to a direction which could not properly be given or a direction which would not be intra cursum curiae; but it was nevertheless a consent to a sale subject to any direction which, according to the practice of the court, should be or become a binding direction. It would not preclude the appellant from objecting to a particular direction, but it was nevertheless a submission to the jurisdiction in the fullest sense, and therefore a submission to any direction which, though wrong in point of law or practice, should be given in the ordinary course, and should be allowed to remain without challenge in accordance with the procedure of the court.\nAs to the first objection, although difficulty might have arisen if the respondent\u2019s action had been based upon the judgment alone, the appellant\u2019s acceptance of the judgment precludes her from setting up any equity inconsistent with the terms of it. On the other hand it seems to be clear that the respondent is bound to credit the appellant with the full amount of the purchase money payable under the sale by which the respondent acquired title to the property. By the terms of the judgment, it is true, the respondent was entitled to deduct his costs, but that must be taken to mean the costs as ascertained in the usual way by proceedings in the Saskatchewan court. No such proceedings are in evidence, and so far as we are informed the costs have not been ascertained in such a way as to enable the Supreme Court of Ontario to measure the extent of the deduction. The judgment should be modified accordingly. Success on this minor point, however, should not affect the matter of the costs in this appeal. Subject as above, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014So far as the respondent\u2019s action in the Supreme Court of Ontario is based on the judgment he obtained in the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan against the appellant, I think the latter, not having appealed from the judgment, is not entitled to set up that this judgment went beyond the consent she had given to the motion of the respondent for judgment and the particulars of the judgment to be rendered mentioned therein. The judgment as rendered stands against the appellant and is binding on her, and she cannot attack it upon the ground for which I was of opinion that the master\u2019s order in the case of Sayre v. Security Trust Company[7] should be set aside as containing contradictory and irreconcilable provisions.\nIt is, therefore, conclusively determined against the appellant that the respondent could bid at the sale ordered by the judgment, and that if he became the purchaser the registrar should issue to him a certificate of title\nfree from all right, title and equity of redemption on the part of the defendants or either of them.\nThe respondent also holds a personal judgment against the appellant and her co-defendant for $4,563.52, with interest and costs to be taxed, and the sale was ordered in the event of the defendants failing, as they did, to pay into court the amount of the personal judgment against them, the proceeds of the sale to be applied in satisfaction of this judgment. No matter who became the purchaser at the sale so ordered, the respondent remained a judgment creditor of the appellant and her co-defendant for the balance outstanding of the judgment after deducting the proceeds of the sale.\nThe doubt I felt upon my first consideration of the case was whether the respondent, having, after the judgment and the sale ordered by it, suffered the property to be sold at the suit of the first mortgagee, could now recover from the appellant the balance outstanding of his personal judgment against her, not being in a position to re-convey the property on which he held a vendor\u2019s lien on payment of the balance due him. But there again it is conclusively determined against the appellant that the title of the purchaser at the judicial sale is to be free from all right, title and equity of redemption on the part of the appellant. In other words, by the effect of the judgment from which she has not appealed, the appellant loses her right of redemption and remains personally liable for the balance of the personal judgment against her. Upon this ground my opinion is that in an action in Ontario upon the Saskatchewan judgment, which I consider a final judgment, it is not open to the appellant to raise this objection, assuming that it could be urged in the case of a vendor\u2019s lien. Of course, it is unnecessary and would not be proper to express any opinion upon the merits of such a judgment, but I must not be taken as departing from the view I expressed in Sayre v. Security Trust Co.[8], where the merits of a somewhat similar judgment were in question.\nHaving said this, I may perhaps express my general concurrence in the judgment of my brother Duff which I have had the advantage of fully considering and which, I take it, is based upon the conclusiveness of the Saskatchewan judgment.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Day, Ferguson & Walsh.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Thompson & Proudlove.\n[1] 53 Ont.

Did the indictment upon which the accused was arraigned, tried and convicted in this case disclose the commission of a criminal offence?\n2. Was the said promissory note a false document as described by the code, article 335?\n3. Was the said promissory note a forged document, as required by article 466 of the code?\n4. Was the said promissory note a document such as described by article 477 of the Criminal Code?\n5. Is there entire absence of proof of any intention to defraud on the part of the accused when signing and uttering the said document?\n6. Was the evidence made by the Crown relating to the said note of $3,500 dated 2nd June, 1921, payable to Dame Euph\u00e9mie Gauthier Reeves, to the promissory note of $1,500 dated 2nd November, 1921, payable to H. Ernest Benoit, to the promissory note of $4,000 dated 12th November, 1921, payable to Alexander Choini\u00e8re and to the note of $2,500 payable to one Pothier admissible in evidence? and that the said stated case be in due course transmitted to the clerk of the court with the record.\nA document was accordingly forwarded by the judge of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace to the Court of King's Bench, which was treated by the latter court as being a stated case within the meaning of this order. Apparently the notes taken by the judge at the trial, if any, were not sent to the Court of King's Bench, nor was that court furnished with a shorthand note of the evidence.\nIn the opinion of the majority of the court the facts stated in the case as framed by the learned trial judge are not of such a character as to make it possible to answer question 5 in the negative, and in the absence of a complete statement of the material evidence it is obviously impossible to answer it in the affirmative. In respect of this question there was a dissenting judgment in the Court of King's Bench.\nThe order of the Court of King's Bench seems to have contemplated a stated case which should in itself contain a full account of the evidence given material to that question or that the Court of King's Bench should be put in possession of a note of the evidence taken at the trial. In these circumstances, in order that this court may be in possession of the information necessary to enable it to give an affirmative or a negative answer to the question, the proper course seems to be to direct that the judge of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace furnish to this court a copy of such parts of the evidence given at the trial as may be material.\nBy the combined effect of subsections 1017 and 1024 of the Criminal Code this court seems to have authority to make such an order.\n"}

The statutory signals (ringing bell and blowing whistle) were not given. Owing to bluffs and shrubbery intercepting his view, the respondent was unable to see down the railway in the direction of the approaching train until he had reached the right-of-way. The respondent had listened for the whistle and looked for smoke. When he reached the right-of-way, he took a hurried glance along the track which did not disclose any danger. He then gave his attention to his automobile as it went up a grade towards the track and did not again look along the track until too late to avoid the accident. In an action for damages, the jury negatived contributory negligence on the part of respondent and he recovered damages.\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that the respondent's failure under the existing circumstances to make a more careful and complete observation, which would have disclosed the approaching train, did not so incontrovertibly amount to contributory negligence that no jury could reasonably find otherwise.\nWabash Railway Co. v.

L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and G. H. Yule for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014At the close of the argument in this appeal I was of the opinion that it should be allowed on the ground of the contributory negligence of the respondent in not looking, after he had emerged from the shrubs and other obstructions which had impeded his view, to see if a train was approaching before he attempted to cross the level railway crossing. Had he looked when he did get an unobstructed view of the track he could not have failed to see the approaching train in time to avoid an accident. I have tried, but have failed, to excuse his neglect to look because he had not heard the statutory warnings. I cannot bring myself to doubt that had he looked, as the law obliges, before going on to the crossing, he could not and would not have failed to see the approaching train.\nIt is of the greatest public importance that this court should not fritter away the duty that is incumbent on all those who attempt to cross level railway crossings to look and listen before crossing to satisfy themselves that no train is approaching. This duty to look and listen before crossing is not abrogated because of a failure to hear the statutory warnings while approaching the crossing, or by the fact that the statutory warnings of ringing the bell or blowing the whistle were not given.\nIt may not be our law in Canada, as it is in some of the United States of America, that before crossing a level railway crossing there is a duty to \"stop, look and listen,\" but it is law in Canada requiring alike to \"look and listen\" before attempting to cross such a crossing. Listening alone is not sufficient, particularly when looking is at the same time possible. To fail to look is to my mind such a breach of an obvious and necessary duty that it cannot be excused because there is or chances to be a concomitant breach of duty on the parts of the servants of a railway to give the statutory warnings.\nHere the plaintiff before coming on to the crossing was driving his motor amongst shrubs and other obstructions which did not give him a clear view of the track. Whilst he was amongst these obstructions he did not hear the statutory warnings and so presumed that no train was approaching and that there was no duty on his part to look before crossing. In fact he says\nI cannot say what I did, I merely glanced down.\nI take this to mean that he did not look with such care as he should have, because if he had he could and would certainly have seen the approaching train.\nIt has been alleged that he had only a few seconds in which to see the train when he did get clear of the obstructions. This in my opinion is no ground of excuse for not looking. He had plenty of time to look after he emerged into the open, but negligently considered that because he had not already heard the statutory warnings no train was approaching and it was not necessary for him to look. Whereas when he did get into the open he would certainly have seen the train had he looked\u2014the train then being about 50 feet from the crossing.\nIn my opinion this appeal should be allowed on the ground of the contributory negligence of the respondent but for which the accident would not have happened.\nIdington J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by the learned judges in the court below I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs. The evidence of the respondent, if accepted, affords a sufficient ground for a verdict within the principle of the observations both of Lord Cairns and of Lord Penzance in Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Ry. v. Slattery[2].\nAnglin J.\u2014Accepting the jury's finding that the plaintiff's injuries were ascribable to the omission by their servants to give the statutory crossing signals, the defendants appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan holding them liable, contending that contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff is so clearly established by his own evidence that.no jury could have reasonably found otherwise and that the case should therefore have been withdrawn by the learned trial judge and the action dismissed. Failure to look with reasonable care for an approaching train before crossing the railway is the fault charged against the plaintiff.\nOwing to bluffs and shrubbery intercepting his view, the plaintiff was unable to see down the railway tracks in the direction of the approaching train until he had reached the right-of-way\u2014at a distance of about 50 feet from the tracks. He testified that because of these conditions he listened with great care for bell and whistle signals but heard none and looked for smoke but saw none. Being thus more or less lulled into a sense of security, he did not, when he reached the right-of-way, look down the track as carefully as he would otherwise have done, contenting himself with a hurried glance, which did not disclose the danger, and then fixing his attention upon guiding his automobile over the crossing, approaching which the highway is only 9 feet or 10 feet wide and is flanked by ditches running along the railway and about 7 feet in depth. Can it be said that his failure under these circumstances to make a more careful and complete observation, which would have disclosed the approaching train, so incontrovertibly amounted to contributory negligence that no jury could reasonably find otherwise or could hold that he was excused from doing more than taking the hurried glance he did, which served to confirm the impression, already created by the omission of the statutory signals and his failure to see any smoke when approaching the railway, that no train was coming? The four learned judges who constituted the Court of Appeal have already answered this question in the negative. Were they so manifestly in error that we should reverse their judgment? I think not. I regard the following observations of Lord Herschell in Peart v. The Grand Trunk Ry.[3], as most apposite:\nThen, on the other hand, it is to be remembered that, although the deceased knew perfectly well there was a crossing, and knew that some train might be coming along there, he also knew that if a train was coming, and if the duty of the company was performed there must have been from Lossings crossing and those other crossings a continuous whistling which he could not fail to hear, and that might, as the learned judge pointed out to the jury it was a fair thing for them to consider, deprive him of all suspicion that a train could be coming. Their lordships do not say that the evidence was conclusive at all to show that the deceased was not guilty of contributory negligence, but it shows that it was a fair and proper case for the jury to consider whether or not he was guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe case at bar appears to me to fall within the principles underlying the decisions of this court in Wabash Railway Company v. Misener[4], and Ottawa Electric Railway v. Booth[5], and of the House of Lords in Slattery's Case[6], and is readily distinguishable from The Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Smith[7], where the plaintiff had failed to take any precautions and in the view of the majority in this court there were no circumstances upon which a jury could have found that neglect excusable.\nThe damages awarded, while possibly too large, cannot be said to be so excessive as to shock the conscience of the court.\nMignault J.\u2014Judgment was rendered in this case in favour of the respondent for $11,483.25. on the verdict of a jury, and this judgment was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The appellant brings the case to this court on practically two grounds:\n1. That there was no evidence on which the jury could find that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence in not looking down the railway line to see whether a train was coming, before he attempted to cross the track. 2. That the amount of damages granted by the jury was excessive. No criticism is made of the charge to the jury of the trial judge.\nThe facts of the accident may be stated in the language of Mr. Justice Turgeon of the Court of Appeal:\nThe accident occurred through the collision of the appellant's train and the respondent's automobile on a level crossing at the intersection of the railway line with a public highway. The company's servants were negligent in not ringing the bell and blowing the whistle as required by \"The Railway Act,\" 1919, ch. 68. The respondent, who was driving the automobile accompanied by one Birkett, says that he was proceeding eastward towards the track at a speed of about 10 or 12 miles an hour. He knew that the train (a regular passenger train) was due to pass at about the time in question, and while still some distance away from the track he kept a lookout for smoke and listened for the whistle, but neither saw nor heard anything. His view of the track towards the south, from which direction the train was coming, was obscured by trees until the right-of-way was reached, 50 feet from the track. On arriving at this right-of-way he glanced down the track, but did not see the train. He then gave his attention to his automobile and continued towards the track. Just before reaching the rails he looked again, and this time he saw the train, as he says, \"practically on top\" of him. In the emergency he tried to speed up his car so as to clear the track, but this attempt failed. The collision occurred, his automobile was wrecked and he himself was severely injured. He admits that he would likely have seen the train in time to avoid the accident if he had looked more carefully, and that if he had seen the train from the entrance to the right-of-way he could have stopped his automobile in time. But he says he felt sure there was no train coming, because he had listened for the signal and had not heard it.\nThe jury, in answer to questions put to them, found that the plaintiff was injured by the negligence of the defendant, such negligence consisting in that the defendant had failed to blow the whistle and ring the bell, and that no negligence of the plaintiff had contributed to the accident. The damages were assessed at $1,483.25 as special damages and at $10,000 for general damages.\nThe rule which has frequently been applied in cases of this character is that a person in the position of the plaintiff is bound to exercise reasonable care, having due regard to all the circumstances of the case. Whether he has or has not done so is a question for the jury, properly instructed, to decide, and an appellate court will not interfere with their finding if there was evidence on which it could reasonably be based.\nThe case under consideration is very close to the line as will be apparent when it is compared to the recent decision of this court in Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v. Smith[8], strongly relied on by the appellant.\nIn that case, a majority of the court held that the trial judge was justified in withdrawing the case from the jury at the close of the plaintiff's evidence and dismissing the action.\nThe facts were that Smith had driven his car for half a mile in full view of the defendant's railway where a train was then approaching the highway crossing, and the testimony of persons driving an automobile immediately behind Smith's car was that they had seen the approaching train during the whole of the time occupied in traversing this half mile stretch of the highway. The engine did not whistle until it gave two short blasts immediately before the accident, nor did the bell ring. Smith stated that he could not remember turning his head and looking to see whether a train was coming, although he thought he had looked because he always did so. Under these circumstances and because, in my opinion, no jury could reasonably find in favour of the plaintiff, I concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal from the Court of Appeal which had ordered a new trial.\nThe statement of the facts of this case above quoted shows that the respondent, when approaching the railway, knew that a train, a regular passenger train, was due to pass at about the time in question, and while still some distance from the track he kept a lookout for smoke and listened for the whistle, but neither saw nor heard anything. Until he reached the right-of-way, fifty feet from the track, his view in the direction whence the train was coming was obstructed by trees. On arriving at the right-of-way he glanced down the track, but did not see the train, and then he gave his attention to his car, for the roadway was rather narrow and the railway ditches were on either side. He admitted that had he looked more carefully on reaching the right-of-way he would likely have seen the train in time to prevent the accident, but he added that he felt sure there was no train coming because he had listened for the signals and had not heard any.\nThere is a difference between the two cases in that Smith for a full half mile had a clear view of the track and could have seen the train, as the people in the car behind him saw it, had he looked, and the inference was irresistible that he did not look. Here the plaintiff could not see the train until he reached a point fifty feet from the tracks, but then had he looked carefully he would have seen it. In both cases there was a failure to give the statutory signals and had these signals been given there was room in both cases for the contention that they might have prevented the plaintiff from crossing the tracks. In this case, there is also to be considered the statement of the plaintiff that the absence of signals led him to conclude that no train was coming, lulled him into a sense of security, to use the terms found in many of the cases, and so convinced him that he could cross the track in safety.\nI think this statement of the plaintiff, which was evidently believed by the jury, sufficiently distinguishes this case from the Smith Case[9] and permits us to consider whether on the whole evidence the conclusion of the jury that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence is so unreasonable that it should be disregarded as being perverse. While I do not think I would have acquitted the plaintiff of contributory negligence had I tried the case, the point is that the jury were the sole judges of the facts and I am not in position to say that there was no evidence whatever on which they could reach the conclusion they did.\nThere is a rather close parity between this case and the decision of this court in Wabash Railroad Co. v. Misener[10]. The circumstances there were even more favourable to a finding of contributory negligence than the facts proved in the case under consideration. And yet this court declined to set aside a judgment of the appellate court which confirmed the judgment of the trial judge giving effect to the verdict.\nPerhaps it may not be amiss here to refer to what I said in Grand Trunk Pacific Co. v. Earl[11], as to the doctrine of common fault which prevails in the province of Quebec. In my judgment, the facts of the present case would furnish a typical case for the application of such a doctrine, were it in force in Saskatchewan. But this is of course beside the question we have to consider.\nThe practice of this court is against interfering with the quantum of damages which, although undoubtedly large in this case, is not so unreasonable that it cannot be upheld.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Borland & McIntyre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: G.

Appeal was taken from the sentence to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, and the same was dismissed on November 22, 1923, but one judge of the Court of Appeal dissented. Under section 1024 of the Criminal Code, the appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe appellant was admitted to bail pending the hearing before the court of first instance, and also pending his appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia; but, upon application to the Court of Appeal to admit him to bail pending the determination of his appeal to this court, the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal held that that court had no jurisdiction, presumably considering that, in- asmuch as an appeal had been taken to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court of Appeal was functus officio. Hence the application to this court.\nSection 1019 (1) of the Criminal Code, as enacted by section 9 of 13-14 George V, c. 41, reads as follows:\u2014\n1019 (1).

After consultation with such of my brother judges as were available, forming with myself a majority of the court, we have come to the conclusion that this court has no jurisdiction to make the order but that section 1019 (1) of the Criminal Code confers jurisdiction upon the Chief Justice or the acting Chief Justice of the Provincial Court of Appeal, or upon a judge of that court to be designated by him, to admit the appellant to bail pending the determination of his appeal. The latter words of the section \"the determination of his appeal\" must be construed as extending to the continuance of his appeal from the provincial Court of Appeal to this court and that therefore the jurisdiction to admit the appellant to bail pending the appeal here rests with the judge specially named in that section.\nApplication is refused.\n"}

When the last station on his journey had been passed an official went through the train calling out \u201cnext stop\u201d or \u201cnext station\u201d West Toronto. Before reaching that station the train had to stop for a few seconds in obedience to a stop signal and M. went to the platform of his car, on which there were no step doors, and alighted falling to the ground and sustaining severe injury. In action against the Ry. Co. he admitted that he had understood the announcement to mean that the next station would be West Toronto. The jury found negligence by the company and that such negligence was\u2014\u201cWe believe that the defendants should * * * when compelled to stop trains use precaution to prevent passengers from alighting.\u201d A verdict for M. was maintained by the Appellate Division.\nHeld, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting, that the action should be dismissed; that it was the duty of the officials of the company to stop the train as they did; that they were under no duty, either statutory or imposed by regulations of the Railway Board, to warn passengers that the train had not reached the station which was the only precaution suggested on M\u2019s behalf as available; and that there was no breach of the common law duty to carry safely as, owing to the brief period of the stoppage and the haste in which M. left the car, an effective warning was not possible.\nPer Duff J.\u2014By the announcement \u201cnext stop West Toronto\u201d M. was placed in a situation which, without further warning, might be one of peril, and the trial judge refused to submit to the jury the suggestion of counsel that the announcement should have been accompanied by a warning that the train might stop at the semaphore, basing his refusal on the admission of M. that he understood the announcement to mean that the next station was West Toronto. This may have been regarded by the jury as a direction that on this crucial question such admission was conclusive against M. and there should be a new trial the finding of the jury as to negligence being too vague and uncertain to permit of a judgment against the company.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThe facts are stated in the above head-note. The case has been tried twice. A judgment of nonsuit on the first trial was set aside by the Appellate Division and a new trial ordered.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and R.E. Laidlaw for the appellant.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario composed of four judges, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Middleton, Latchford and Logie JJ. The Chief Justice and Middleton J. were to allow the appeal from the judgment entered by the trial judge for $4,000 on the findings of the jury and to dismiss the action, while Latchford and Logie JJ. were to dismiss the appeal. The court being equally divided the appeal was consequently dismissed, whereupon the company entered an appeal to this court.\nThe case had been twice tried first before Mr. Justice Hodgins who non-suited the plaintiff at the close of his evidence which non-suit was set aside on appeal and a new trial directed. The new trial was heard before Mr. Justice Riddell sitting with a jury who found for the plaintiff, now respondent, for $4,000 damages.\nThe questions and answers of the jury were as follows:\n(1) Was the casualty in question a mere accident, or was it caused by negligence? Ans. It was caused by negligence.\n(2) Was it caused by the negligence of the defendants? Ans. Yes.\n(3) If so, what was the negligence? Answer fully. Ans. We believe that the defendants should on occasions when compelled to stop trains, use precautions to guard passengers from alighting from trains so stopped.\n(4) Could the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided the casualty? Ans. No.\n(5) What should he have done? Ans. Nothing.\n(6) Was the train in motion when the plaintiff stepped off? Ans. No.\n(7) Damages. Ans. $4,000.\nAfter the jury had answered the questions as above set forth, the learned trial judge declined to hear argument on behalf of the appellant. He said,\nI think it is a matter to be disposed of by the Divisional Court and it is so near the line it ought to go to the Divisional Court in any case.\nI agree so fully with the judgments of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Mr. Justice Middleton, for allowing the appeal and dismissing the action, that I feet it is not necessary for me to repeat in full their reasoning.\nAs Mr. Justice Middleton says there might be evidence to justify the holding that the plaintiff was not negligent, but he goes on to say:\nWhen we turn to the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence the case is different. * * * If the jury intend to impute fault to the brakeman in not going again through the car to warn the passengers against alighting, then they impose upon him a duty in conflict with his statutory duty to go back upon the track and protect the rear of the train. They probably did not intend this because the trial judge warned them that they must specify all the negligence which they thought existed and that the negligence found would alone be regarded. The plaintiff in his evidence pointed out this as the thing that he complained of, and the jury refused to find for him. The truth probably is that the jury desired to find for the plaintiff but could not put their hands on any particular fault, and so resorted to the device of a vague general statement. More is required than this. Negligence \u201cin the air\u201d is not enough. See, for example, Newberry v. Bristol Tramways Co.[2], where a similar finding was paraphrased: \u201cWe find there was negligence but we cannot tell what. We negative the various suggestions of negligence, to which the evidence has been directed, but we divine the existence of some other negligence too obscure to be named in words or to be proved by testimony.\u201d The principle is there stated by Hamilton L.J. (now Lord Sumner) \u201cthat the jury cannot fix a defendant with liability for want of care, without proof given or reason assigned, out of their own inner consciousness and on their own notion of the fitness of things.\u201d A verdict must rest on a foundation of actuality and not merely upon an ideal or vague view. If the jury meant that the train should have had a larger crew so that there might have been a man on guard at each door, then the jury went too far because the crew necessary on each train is subject to specific regulations by the Railway Board, and the decision of the board governs.\nOn the argument I asked the plaintiff\u2019s counsel if he could surmise exactly what the jury intended, and he could not. His answer was in effect: It is not for the plaintiff or for the jury to say what should be done, it is enough to say something should have been done. I do not agree with this. The plaintiff must shew something done which ought not to have been done, or something omitted which should have been done, before he can recover.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of a case in which the respondent by the evidence, as I read it, had presented a rather simple problem for solution yet there has been a very remarkable difference of judicial opinion in the course thereof.\nHe was a passenger on appellant\u2019s train from Chesley to West Toronto which passed through and had stopped at Weston.\nThe distance between Weston and West Toronto is between three and four miles and usually takes only about nine minutes to run.\nThe respondent was accompanied by his wife and they naturally were alert to any announcement to be made by the train officials as to when to get off the train at West Toronto, their point of destination.\nThe trainman in charge having, as West Toronto was approached, announced \u201cNext stop West Toronto,\u201d they got ready to answer said call as the train slowed up and duly proceeded to the nearest door of their car which was next to the last of a very long train consisting of ten cars of which six were passenger cars.\nThe train stopped and they got on to the open platform of their car and appellant, though it was pitch dark, went down the steps of the car and then, assuming he was quite safe, stepped off, but it turned out that the last step of the car was three or four feet from the ground. The result was a violent fall from which he suffered very serious injuries.\nHence he sued appellant for the damages thus suffered attributing same to the negligence of the appellant in inviting him thus to alight at the next stop which was not, as supposed, the next station.\nThe case has been tried twice on substantially the same evidence.\nOn the first trial Mr. Justice Hodgins, before whom it was tried, dismissed the action.\nThat ruling was set aside by the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario and a new trial granted, which took place before Mr. Justice Riddell who submitted to the jury seven questions, which appear with the answers thereto, as follows:\u2014\n(1) Was the casualty in question a mere accident, or was it caused by negligence? Ans. It was caused by negligence.\n(2) Was it caused by negligence of the defendants? Ans. Yes.\n(3) If so, what was the negligence? Answer fully. Ans. We believe that the defendants should, on occasions when compelled to stop trains, use precaution to guard passengers from alighting from trains so stopped.\n(4) Could the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided the casualty? Ans. No.\n(5) What should he have done? Ans. Nothing.\n(6) Was the train in motion when the plaintiff stepped off? Ans. No.\nWas the plaintiff aware that it was in motion? Ans. No.\n(7) Damages. Ans. $4,000.\nIt is quite clear therefore that mere accident was not the cause of respondent\u2019s injuries but appellant\u2019s negligence, and respondent was exonerated from any negligence on his part.\nThe learned trial judge who ought to know the due import and significance of these answers at once entered judgment for the respondent with costs.\nUpon appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario by the appellant here, the court hearing said appeal was equally divided, and hence the appeal failed and was dismissed accordingly.\nThe appellant then brought this appeal here. Its main contention, indeed only one in law, is that the answer to the third question is not sufficiently explicit and comprehensive.\nI read it, as I think such questions and answers must always be read, in light of the evidence and the learned trial judge\u2019s charge, and so reading same I can find no difficulty in the case and agree with the learned judges Latchford and Logie in the court below maintaining, for the respective reasons each has assigned, the judgment of the learned trial judge upon said verdict.\nIf the stop at the point where the respondent got off was quite likely to be rendered necessary by reason of the immense traffic converging at the West Toronto station yard, then it clearly was the duty of the appellant to have taken precautions to guard passengers from alighting from trains so stopped. I do not think it was necessary for the jury to have written a treatise on the subject to enable any one to comprehend the true import of their answer.\nNor do I intend to elaborate upon the manifold methods by which one of many precautions might have been taken. I prefer, with all due respect for those who differ from me in so concluding, to apply common sense to the usual method of reading such question and answer verdicts in light of the evidence and the learned trial judge\u2019s charge.\nI may be permitted to add that I fail to see any resemblance between what is presented herein and what transpired in the case of Newberry v.

(dissenting).\u2014The respondent was a passenger on the appellant\u2019s railway from Chesley to West Toronto. The train was due to arrive at the plaintiff\u2019s destination at 9.15 p.m., but on the day when the accident occurred, the 5th November, 1921, it did not arrive until ten o\u2019clock. The train comprised ten cars, and the car in which the plaintiff was riding was not vestibuled, and had no step-doors to prevent passengers from descending the car steps for the purpose of alighting. There were three other cars of the same design in the train. The evidence is to the effect that two train officers separately called out to the passengers, \u201cNext stop West Toronto,\u201d and the last one punched the railway tickets. Shortly afterwards the train stopped, no further announcement having been made or warning given. The night was dark and, according to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, he was unable to see where he was. The train had, in fact, stopped before reaching the station, and the plaintiff, assuming that he was at the West Toronto station, got up with his wife, walked on to the platform of the car, went down three steps and in stepping off the last of these fell, injuring himself seriously. The jury negatived contributory negligence, and found that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff were due to the negligence of the appellant company.\nThere was a conflict of evidence at the trial upon several questions, principally upon the question as to whether or not the train had in fact stopped. This question the jury answered in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe stopping of the train before reaching the station of West Toronto was explained by witnesses called on behalf of the appellants. As the railway line approaches St. Clair Avenue in West Toronto it takes the form of a curve just before it reaches the railway yard, about a quarter of a mile west of that street. At or near the entrance to the yard there is the usual semaphore or distance signal. At St. Clair Avenue there is also a signal which, the trainmen said, was set at Stop as they passed the distance signal. Thereupon the train was slowed down and, according to their evidence, the stop signal having been raised before they reached St. Clair Avenue, they increased the speed and proceeded. On this last point the jury declined to accept their evidence.\nThere was evidence (as the Divisional Court held in ordering the second trial) from which the jury might draw the conclusion that the announcements and the stop together amounted in the circumstances to a representation that the train had reached the place where the passengers for West Toronto were to leave it. Moreover, it would be within the province of the tribunal of fact to decide whether (in view of the possibility, knowledge of which by the company could not be denied, of the train being brought to a standstill by the St. Clair Avenue signal) the announcements so made without qualification and without warning given then or afterwards prima facie constituted negligence in themselves, as conduct calculated in a contingency which the company ought to have anticipated, to lead passengers without warning into a situation which without warning was a dangerous one.\nPassengers are entitled to rely upon the servants of a railway company performing their duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid putting them into a position of peril. They are entitled to act on such announcements as are made without analyzing them critically, and without suspicion, and to proceed with confidence on the plain obvious meaning of them.\nIt is arguable no doubt that the verdict expresses with sufficient certainty a finding to this effect; but I am forced to the conclusion that the verdict is too vague, too uncertain in its meaning and effect, to be treated as a proper basis for a judgment against the appellants. But I confess that I am quite unable to discover any adequate ground for awarding judgment against the respondent, dismissing the action.\nAs I have said there was evidence to support a finding of negligence in the sense above mentioned. With great respect, I think the manner in which the case was left to the jury was calculated to divert their minds from the real question before them. In answer to the request of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to submit to the jury his suggestion that the announcements should have been accompanied by a warning of the possibility of a stop at the semaphore, the learned trial judge in effect declined to do so, giving as his reason, in the presence of the jury, the admission of the plaintiff that he knew that when the conductor announced the next \u201cstop\u201d he meant the next station. This was to ignore the contention that the effect of the announcement was that the next stop would be the station at which the plaintiff was to alight, and might easily be regarded by the jury as a direction that upon the question\u2014the crucial question in the case\u2014whether the appellants negligently misled the plaintiff by the announcements, the plaintiff\u2019s admission referred to by the learned trial judge was conclusive against him. I am inclined to think that to this observation of the learned judge is to be attributed the form of the answer to the third question.\nThe learned trial judge had, it should be noted, asked the jury to consider two suggestions made by the plaintiff himself in his evidence. One, that the announcement of the station should be delayed until the signal for proceeding was received at St. Clair Avenue; and an alternative one, that if, on approaching the yard, the signal at St. Clair was set at \u201cstop\u201d the passengers should then be warned to keep their seats.\nThe importance of this way of presenting the plaintiff\u2019s case to the jury, excluding the suggestion made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the announcements should have been accompanied by a warning, while submitting the suggestions just mentioned, received illustration in Mr. McCarthy\u2019s argument. Naturally he emphasized the phraseology of the answer to the third question as confining the scope of the answer to precautions coming into effect either after the train had stopped, or after the certainty, or the immediate probability, of a stop had become apparent. Whether or not this is the necessary meaning of this answer, at least I am convinced that it is the better reading of it; and the conclusion was urged upon us, as involved in certain decisions of this court, that the jury, having thus defined the negligence they were finding, necessarily negatived any charge of negligence based upon the absence of precautions coming into play at an earlier stage, such as the warning suggested by Mr. Ferguson. If that be the correct way of looking at the verdict and, as I have already intimated, I am by no means satisfied that it is not, then it is impossible to affirm, I think, that the learned judge\u2019s observations, above referred to, did not very gravely affect the form of the findings.\nThen I think the learned judge gave the jury the impression that in answer to the third question they should seek to indicate the precautions negligently omitted by the appellants. As I have said, given a stop long enough to lead the plaintiff to think the station had been reached, and the absence of warning and the absence of contributory negligence, the ensemble of the facts, beginning with the announcements themselves, might have been stated, if that was their view, as constituting the negligence for which they held the appellants responsible; and it is barely possible that, as Mr. Scott argued, this is precisely what the jury, without assistance, was attempting to do; although, if such was their object, I agree that they signally failed in it\nIt was not for the plaintiff to specify the appropriate precautions. The fact that without warning he had been invited into a situation which without warning was a situation of peril, by the appellants, was prima facie a breach of their duty to him as a passenger. If the appellants\u2019 answer was to be that this was unavoidable it was for the appellants to shew that; the burden of explanation was upon them. A finding against the appellants on that issue could not be set aside as unreasonable.\nThere should be a new trial. In view of the opinion of the majority of the court there is no object in discussing the question of costs. ANGLIN J.\u2014The respective functions of the court and the jury in cases such as this were definitely stated by the House of Lords in Bridges v. North London Railway Co.[9] It is for the court to determine whether there was any evidence of facts upon, or by legitimate inference from, which a jury might find that negligence of the defendants dans locum injuri\u0153 was established. If there is such evidence, it is for the jury to decide whether it warrants such a finding. Robson v. North Eastern Ry. Co.[10] If they determine that it does it is not within the province of an Appellate Court to hold that it does not and on that ground to set aside the verdict.\nSome facts in this case are perfectly clear. There were two calls\u2014either \u201cWest Toronto next stop\u201d or \u201cWest Toronto next station\u201d\u2014made by the train crew and heard by the plaintiff at a time when the train was still at a considerable distance north of that station. The signal for the diamond crossing at St. Clair Avenue, which is about one-quarter of a mile north of the West Toronto station, was set against the train and the engineer could not lawfully cross that thoroughfare until that signal had been reversed. The train slowed down when approaching the diamond crossing and, on conflicting evidence, the jury found that it actually stopped north of St. Clair Avenue and that fact cannot now be questioned. Their further finding negativing contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff involved acceptance of his story that, when he attempted to alight, he believed the train had stopped at the station and that he used reasonable care in making that attempt. Those facts, I agree, must also now be assumed.\nThat nothing was done after the train stopped to prevent passengers alighting and that the plaintiff was injured while in the act of alighting from the train are undisputed facts. It must be assumed that when he attempted to alight the train was stopped north of St. Clair Avenue. The precise duration of that stop is not proven. The train crew all denying that any stop was made, and agreeing in the statement that the train had only slowed down and that the signal having been reversed it proceeded to the station without actually stopping, of course no evidence of the duration of the stop could be had from them. The plaintiff and his wife say the train had stopped before he opened the door of the car to reach the platform preparatory to alighting. Thompson, a witness called for the plaintiff, says that the train did not stop until the plaintiff was on the platform. At most, only a few seconds elapsed between the stopping of the train and the plaintiff\u2019s stepping off. His wife says the train started again immediately after he had stepped off\u2014that she had not time to follow him. It, therefore, seems to be certain that the stop, if made (as we must assume it was), was but momentary.\nThe train comprised ten cars, the six in the rear being passenger coaches. The train crew consisted of a conductor and two trainmen, each of the latter being in charge of three of the passenger coaches. The plaintiff travelled in the coach next to the last. It was the duty of the trainman in charge of the three rear coaches, in the event of a stop being made between stations, to go back on the track to protect his train against the danger of any following train running into it while stationary. There was no attempt to shew that the train crew was not adequate or that it did not meet the requirements of the regulations of the Board of Railway Commissioners.\nThe only finding of negligence made by the jury was the following:\nWe believe that the defendants should on occasions when compelled to stop trains use precaution to guard passengers from alighting from trains so stopped.\nThis finding must be read in the light of the evidence and the charge of the learned trial judge. So read, notwithstanding its generality, it is not open to the objection that prevailed in Newberry v. Bristol Tramways Co.[11] and in Hood et ux. v. Walthamstow Urban District Council[12]. I am disposed to regard it, as did Latchford and Middleton JJ., as sufficiently expressing the jury\u2019s view that some precaution was practicable. Since the only precaution suggested by the plaintiff, or on his behalf, was that the train crew should, after the train had stopped, have warned passengers not to debark because the train was not yet at the station, the jury\u2019s finding should be taken to imply that the failure to give such a warning was negligence dans locum injuri\u0153. The question presented, therefore, is whether, upon the evidence in the record and such inferences as they could legitimately draw from it, the jury could reasonably make such a finding.\nThe calling out of the name of each station a short time before the train reaches it is customary and is such a convenience to the passengers whose destination it is and to the conductor who is obliged to collect their tickets or hat checks that its discontinuance would evoke a storm of protest. The stopping of the train at the diamond north of St. Clair Avenue, while not altogether unexpected, is not usual; it is said to occur in the case of the train with which we are dealing about once a week. This stop was made in the discharge of an imperative duty. Neither singly, nor taken together, did the announcement of the station and the stop following it involve any fault or negligence. But, having regard to the darkness (10.10 p.m.), a situation was thus created in which it might not unreasonably be anticipated that some passenger, in the belief that he had been invited to alight, would make the very mistake which the plaintiff made and might sustain injury, as he did, without being himself in any way negligent or at fault. That the possibility, if not probability, of such an occurrence was, or should have been, realized by the defendant\u2019s officials and employees also seems clear. It follows that if its happening could have been prevented by any reasonably practicable precaution, omission to take it would be negligence.\nIt is upon the practicability of giving an effective warning under the circumstances that, after most anxious consideration of the whole record, it seems to me evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s case is lacking. A finding that there was sufficient time after the train had stopped for the train crew to have taken steps that would probably have prevented the plaintiff making the mistake he did in my opinion cannot be supported on the evidence before us. On the contrary, it seems to be reasonably certain that there was no opportunity for their giving the warning, the omission of which is the fault relied on by the plaintiff. It may be that the moment the train stopped the members of the train crew available for that duty should have started going through the train to give some warning. But, having regard to the evidence indicating that the stop was momentary and to the fact that the plaintiff stepped off the car immediately upon its being made, no jury, in my opinion, could reasonably find that any attempt to give such warning would have been effective to prevent the plaintiff\u2019s alighting or to bring to his attention the danger of attempting to do so. Not only is this a fair inference from the facts in evidence; it is, I think, the only legitimate inference. Negligence of the defendants dans locum injuriae, essential to the plaintiff\u2019s success, is not merely not established by direct proof or reasonable inference; its existence is excluded by the facts that are proven.\nFor these reasons I concur in the judgment allowing this appeal.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario, whereby the judgment of the trial judge giving effect to the verdict of the jury was sustained on an equal division. The case has been tried twice, a divisional court having ordered a new trial after the trial judge at the first trial had dismissed the action at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case.\nThe material facts are as follows:\nThe respondent, on the evening of the 5th of November, 1921, was travelling with his wife on a Grand Trunk train from Chesley, Ont., to West Toronto. The last station before West Toronto is Weston, and after leaving the latter place, the brakeman passed through the car where the respondent and his wife were seated, calling out: \u201cNext station West Toronto,\u201d or \u201cNext stop West Toronto.\u201d Whichever it was, however, is not material, because the respondent says he understood that the call meant that West Toronto would be the next station. Before reaching the latter station the train had to cross St. Clair Avenue, where there is a tramway line and considerable traffic, and where also there are gates erected for the protection of the public. When these gates are closed to traffic the semaphore signals that the line is clear and trains cross the highway without stopping and proceed to West Toronto station, a quarter of a mile distant. When, however, the gates are open to traffic on the avenue the signal from the semaphore stops the train before it reaches the crossing.\nOn the evening in question, at about 10 o\u2019clock, this train arrived near the crossing and found that the signal was set against it. There was a conflict of evidence on the question whether the train actually stopped, or merely slowed down to a speed of about four miles an hour, but the jury, as they were entitled, found that it did stop, and that fact must be assumed to be conclusively established. We must therefore take it that the train stopped, certainly for a very short time, waiting for the signal to proceed. As it stopped, the respondent and his wife, who were in the car next to the rear car, rose from their seats, opened the car door and went out on the platform. The respondent looked from the steps leading from the platform of the car and saw lights ahead on the right side. His first intention was to alight on that side, but his wife having remarked that the station was on the left side, he got off on the left side, although it was dark there, and fell to the ground, suffering the injuries for which he now seeks compensation.\nThe jury were cautioned by the trial judge that, if they found that the defendant was guilty of negligence causing the accident, they should state in what the negligence consisted, and that any act of negligence not specified by them would be held to have been negatived.\nUnder these circumstances, the jury having found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant, they had to answer the further question what was this negligence. The answer written down by them was:\nWe believe that the defendant should, on occasions when compelled to stop trains, use precaution to guard passengers from alighting from trains so stopped.\nThey also found that the plaintiff could not have avoided the accident by the exercise of ordinary care, thus negativing any contributory negligence on his part.\nWe have now, on this very vital question, an extremely vague answer. When trains are compelled to stop before reaching a station\u2014and they are compelled to stop whenever the signal is given them that the line is not clear\u2014the railway company must, in the opinion of the jury, use precaution to guard passengers from alighting from trains so stopped. What this precaution should be, the jury do not say. Had they been further questioned, as they should have been, the matter would have been clinched, and it is possible either that they would have specified a precaution which the appellant was not bound to take, or that they would have made some such answer as was considered insufficient in Newberry v. Bristol Tramways Co.[13] The vagueness of the jury\u2019s answer is now the difficulty with which the respondent must contend.\nI will assume that the jury did not intend to go outside of what was properly their province, and lay down, perhaps as a counsel of perfection, a general rule for the guidance of railway companies when they are compelled to stop their trains between stations. Taking the answer of the jury in connection with the facts in evidence, they probably meant that the next station having been announced and the train being compelled to stop before reaching it, the railway company should have taken precautions to prevent passengers who had heard the announcement from assuming that the train had reached the station and alighting as this respondent did. This is the construction placed on the answer of the jury by Mr. Justice Middleton in the Appellate Division and I am willing to accept it although, with deference, I cannot but regret that the jury were not further questioned.\nOn the other hand, it is obvious that unless there is a breach of duty on the part of the railway company there is no negligence in law and there can be no liability. The duty of railway companies is to carry their passengers with due care to their destination. To insure the performance of this duty the Railway Act has formulated certain rules and there are also certain regulations of the Railway Commission which have statutory force. If these rules and regulations are not observed there is a breach of duty and consequent liability. And, there is also liability if the common law duty to carry the passengers with due care is not fulfilled. In his factum, Mr. Scott says:\u2014\nThe defendants brought about a dangerous situation to the plaintiff by telling him that the next station or the next stopping place was the place where the plaintiff desired to alight and then stopped the train without warning him that his destination had not been reached.\nThis statement is made in the attempt to bring the case within the rule res ipsa loquitur, but it seems to me an impossible contention to say that the announcement of the next station, or of the next stopping place, created a dangerous situation to the passengers of the train. And then if the train did stop before the next station was reached in obedience to an order to stop which the company was compelled to obey, there was in so stopping no possible breach of the duty the company owed to its passengers, nor can it be fairly said that the company brought about a dangerous situation to them, assuming that they acted as reasonable beings should act.\nIf then a passenger, in the erroneous impression that the train has stopped at the station which had previously been announced, alights from the train and is injured in so alighting, is the railway company liable as for a breach of its duty to carry him with due care to his destination? No enactment of the Railway Act or regulation of the Railway Commission has been cited as imposing a duty on the company under such circumstances.\nThis is not the case of a servant of the company seeing the passenger in the act of alighting under this erroneous impression and not warning him that the train has not yet reached his station. Even in such a case, where the train was still running, when the passenger alighted, at a speed of from twenty to twenty-five miles an hour in approaching the station where it was to stop, this court held that the railway company was not liable. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Mayne [14]. See also Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. v .Hay [15].\nThere is no suggestion that this train was not properly equipped and manned. There were four baggage and six passenger cars, of which the two first were what are known as vestibule cars and the four last platform cars. There was a conductor and two brakesmen, one of the brakesmen being in charge of the three first cars, the other of the three last.\nIn case the train stopped between stations it was the duty of the company to have an employee go to the rear of the train to flag any approaching train and thus prevent a rear end collision. This is referred to by some of the learned judges as being a statutory duty, and it would be a statutory duty if it were required by the Railway Act or by an order of the Railway Commission. I have been unable to find in the Railway Act any mention of this duty and no orders of the Railway Commission have been put in evidence. I will however assume that it was the duty of the railway company to send a man to the rear of the train when it stopped to flag any approaching train, such action being imperative to insure the safety of the passengers. The rear end brakesman was in the third car from the rear when this train slowed down on approaching St. Clair Avenue, and says that he prepared to go to the rear to discharge this duty. He did not go because he says the train did not stop.\nNo law or regulation has been cited as requiring the train employees, when the train stops as this train did before reaching a station, to warn the passengers that the train is not yet at the station and that they should not attempt to get off. It would in most cases be impracticable to do so. This was a long train crowded with people going to Toronto for Thanksgiving day. Assuming as we must that the train really stopped for a moment, the rear end brakesman who was looking after the part of the train where the respondent was travelling, was obliged to go to the rear end of the train, as I have explained. The front end brakesman had three cars under his charge, and the conductor could not be everywhere. Moreover such a stop would ordinarily be a very short one and to go through six crowded cars to give a warning not to alight would require several minutes. If the answer of the jury be taken to mean that the company should have used vestibule cars, the exit door of which is opened only when the station is reached, it suffices to say that there was no such obligation incumbent on the appellant. So far I can find no duty of the train employees to tell the respondent that the train had not yet reached the station, assuming they did not see him in the act of alighting, and they did not.\nBut it is said that there was here an invitation to leave the train. This, however, was merely an invitation to alight when the train reached West Toronto station, and not if perchance a semaphore signal stopped the train before it got there.\nWe are referred to several decisions where, the train having run beyond a station or stopped short of it, the passengers were held to have been invited to get off in a dangerous place and it was decided that the company was liable. There is nothing similar here, for the train was still a quarter of a mile from the station when it was held up at St. Clair Avenue.\nIt is also said that the platform at West Toronto station was a short one and that the passengers in the rear cars would have had to alight on the cinders before reaching the platform. While this circumstance may have excused the respondent in stepping off in the place he did, it is not material to fix any duty on the appellant when the train stopped before reaching the station, nor would it reasonably lead the appellant to expect that the respondent would have thus alighted a quarter of a mile from the station.\nOn the whole, and placing the most favourable construction on the answer of the jury, I do not think it discloses any breach of duty of this appellant rendering it liable towards the respondent. The case is a very important one and I have given it all possible consideration. My conclusion is that the accident which befell the respondent was a pure misfortune for which in law the appellant is not responsible.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the action. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout if it sees fit to exact them from the respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.C.

C.C.\nThe appellant contracted to purchase from the respondent five car-loads of flour to be shipped in the month of November, 1920. On the 20th of November, the appellant notified the respondent that delivery of the goods would not be accepted, unless, in accordance with an alleged custom of trade, the contract price should be reduced to the market price at the time of delivery. The respondent refused to accede to the demand and had one car shipped on the 29th of November, two on the 30th of November and two on the 3rd of December. The appellant having definitely refused to take the flour on the 1st of December, the respondent held it in warehouse for a long time and resold it only on the 12th of January, 1921, on a falling market and at a price substantially lower than had been obtainable in the beginning of December. The respondent then brought an action against the appellant for breach of contract, claiming as damages the difference between the contract price and the price received on the re-sale.\nHeld that, in a contract of sale, if the buyer illegally refuses to accept the goods, the proper measure of damages arising from the breach of contract is the difference between the contract price and the market price on the date of the breach, and not the loss to the vendor on subsequent re-sale by him of the goods.\nHeld, also, that the refusal of the goods by the buyer for an unfounded reason did not, under the circumstances, prevent him from complaining, as to the goods shipped in December, that the shipment was too late.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, varying the judgment of the Superior Court and maintaining in full the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nC.

S. Dumont.\nIn the course of a week or so later the parties concerned agreed to substitute two cars of Reindeer flour for two cars of said Saskatoon flour, at a price agreed upon.\nThe respondent failed to ship, without any excuse I can find in the evidence, two of said cars, one of Reindeer flour and the other of the Saskatoon brand, within the month of November. I think, therefore, the appellant is not responsible for anything in way of damages for or in respect of said two cars which I eliminate from further consideration herein.\nThe appellant, on the 25th of November aforesaid, wrote a letter clearly indicating it did not wish to carry out the contract, and asserting a local custom of agreeing to reduce the price in certain cases and asking respondent to do likewise. I do not see proof of any general custom of the trade binding respondent to assent thereto and would therefore eliminate that from the consideration of this case further than to say that respondent should have inferred therefrom that it was quite unlikely to expect that appellant would accept any goods so bought and certainly was not justified in expecting it to extend the time for delivery.\nThe question is thus reduced to a question of damages for breach of contract in so far as regards the shipment made of three cars of flour in November.\nSo far I am quite in accord with the findings of the learned trial judge and inclined to hold that his judgment allowing $720, being the difference between the price agreed upon and the market price in Montreal on the 25th of November, 1920, must be the measure of damages.\nI cannot understand on what basis the freight and damage and commission are allowed by the Court of King's Bench.\nAs I read the contract the flour was to be delivered in Montreal, and if the word \"freight\" was not intended to include that it was such an ambiguous term in above contract as to call for explanation from the respondent, claiming same as part of its damages.\nI am more puzzled as to the question of whether interest on the damages from the date of the breach of the contract should not have been added by the learned trial judge to said sum allowed by him.\nSubject thereto I would allow this appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with whose reasoning I agree.\nDuff J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored. The point of substance appears to be whether the Court of King's Bench was right in holding that, the appellant having refused to accept the cars delivered on the 3rd December for the reasons given in its letter of the 25th November and repeated in its letter of the 1st December, in which the delay is not relied upon as respects the cars in question, it can now set up and rely on that delay in answer to the respondent's action. I think there is nothing in the action of the respondent precluding the appellant from setting up in answer to the respondent's action non-performance of the contract on the respondent's part; consequently, for the purpose of determining the amount to which the respondent was entitled in the action, we may leave out of account the two cars sent on the 3rd December.\nThe case of Braithwaite v. Foreign Hardwood Co.[1] relied upon by Mr. Archambault cannot, in view of the comments upon it in the speeches of the Law Lords in British and Bennington Ltd. v. N.W. Cachar Tea Co.[2], be given effect to in the sense contended for.\nAs to the amount the respondent is entitled to recover, I concur in the reasons given by my brother Mignault for thinking that the view of the learned trial judge ought to prevail.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiffs sue for damages for non-acceptance by the defendant of five car-loads of flour which it had contracted to purchase. The contract provided that the flour should be delivered at Montreal in November. One car was shipped from Peterborough on the 29th f November, two on the 30th of November and two on the 3rd of December. A change in the quality of two of the car-loads and a reduction in price of 30 cents a barrel on the entire contract by mutual consent arranged during November did not, in my opinion, postpone the date of delivery fixed by the contract. In a mercantile contract such a term is always of the essence of the vendor's obligation and upon the expiry of the time fixed the obligor is in default. Article 1069 C.C.\nOn the other hand I fully agree with the view of the learned trial judge that the buyer's attempt to establish a right of rejection because the vendors had refused to accede to its demand, based on an alleged custom of trade, that the price named in the contract should be further reduced to the market price at the time of delivery, involved a variation of the terms of a written contract which the law does not permit. Art. 1235 (4) C.C. The evidence of such a custom, even if admissible, was quite inadequate. More- over, the defence based on that contention is not now open, the defendant having accepted the judgment of the Superior Court condemning it to pay $720 damages in respect of the three cars shipped on the 29th and 30th of November, while holding it not liable in respect of the two cars shipped on the 3rd of December on the ground that delivery of them was too late to meet the requirement of the contract. The defendant by its acquiescence is also precluded from relying on this latter defence in respect to the three cars first shipped. Its appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, which awarded the respondents damages in respect to the whole five cars and for the full amount claimed, $4,495 ($3,450 loss on re-sale, plus $1,045 demurrage and expenses), is therefore restricted to two points, viz: that recovery should be had only in respect of the three cars shipped in November and that the measure of damages applied on appeal was erroneous. In fact the appellant asks that the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nHaving elected not to treat the contract as terminated by the buyer's intimation of the 25th November that it should be cancelled if its demand for reduction in prices were refused, the vendors, insisting on the contract being carried out, were bound to observe its terms. The Braithwaite case[3], was relied on by Mr. Archambault in support of his contention to the contrary. As I read that case the Court of Appeal inferred an election by the buyers not to make the defence they sought to set up (p. 552). In so far as it may involve the proposition for which respondents' counsel cited it, I would, with respect, decline to follow it. Lord Sumner, who had been counsel in it, says in British and Benington, Ltd. v. N.W. Cachar Tea Co.[4],\nin my opinion the case as reported either does not lay down this proposition, or, if it does so, is wrong.\nThere can be no doubt that the two cars shipped on the 3rd of December were not delivered as contracted for. The Court of King's Bench does not suggest that the term of the contract requiring November delivery was ever varied. Its judgment is rested on \"waiver\" of the breach in this respect by the buyer said to arise from the facts that it based its rejection of the flour on the vendors' refusal to accept for it the market price at the time of delivery and that its manager, in his testimony, stated that the only reason for rejection was that the market price had gone down when the flour reached Montreal.\nWith great respect, I cannot accede to that view. The ground of rejection assigned by the buyer may have been quite untenable. Yet if it had another good ground for refusing to accept, though it was not communicated at the time of rejection, it is not thereby debarred from setting it up as a ground of defence in answer to a claim for damages. The evidence of the buyer's manager amounts to no more than this, that the only ground of rejection present to the mind of the buyer when refusing to accept the flour was the vendors' refusal to take for it the then current market price\u2014or perhaps merely that it had not stated any other ground in its letter of rejection. As to the two barrels shipped in December, the judgment of the learned trial judge, in my opinion, was right and should not have been disturbed. I find that the reasoning on which I have reached this conclusion has been fully stated by my brother Mignault There is no object in my repeating it. There is no evidence, on which a finding of renunciation or acquiescence, such as would operate as a fin de non recevoir excluding the defence based on dilatoriness in delivery, can be supported.\nThe vendors' recovery must therefore be restricted to damages in respect to the three car-loads shipped in November. What should be the measure of such damages? The Court of King's Bench has said the loss on re-sale plus demurrage and expenses; the learned trial judge, the difference between the contract price and the market price at the date of breach.\nArticles 1073 and 1074 C.C. declare that the debtor is liable for the amount of the loss sustained by the creditor and of the profit of which he has been deprived, so far as they have been, or might have been foreseen. Ordinarily the difference between the contract price and the market price (Chouillou v. Johnson Co.[5]; Genest v. L\u00e9ger[6]), plus any out-of-pocket expenses necessarily incurred is what is recoverable. Chapman v. Larin[7]. Only in exceptional cases, as where there is no market for the goods, should any other basis of damages be considered. In such a case for the market price should be substituted the actual value of the goods at the date of the breach to be ascertained by the best means available. Samuel v. Black Lake Asbestos and Chrome Co.[8].\nThe vendor is not entitled to re-sell the goods on account of the purchaser and to charge him with the deficiency. His right is to recover damages. Article 1065 C.C. The price realized on a re-sale is at the most some proof of the market price or value of the goods at the time of the breach, provided it is shown that the price realized was the best obtainable, the sale being properly conducted and taking place as soon as reasonably possible after the breach. Chapman v. Larin7, at p. 359.\nThe buyer definitely refused to take the flour on the 1st of December, 1920. Dissolution of the contract of sale in favour of the sellers immediately ensued. Article 1544 C.C. Yet they held the flour until January, 1921, without making any attempt to dispose of it and re-sold it only on the 12th of that month. Notwithstanding what is now urged as to the difficulty created by the special branding of the bags, there is not evidence that that fact affected the sale-ability of the flour (though it may perhaps be inferred that to some extent it did), and certainly none that it entailed the delay of six weeks in effecting the re-sale. The evidence rather indicates that the re-sale of January was made on a falling market and that the current prices of flour were then substantially lower than they had been in the beginning of December. The re-sale price on the 12th January therefore does not afford satisfactory evidence of the value of the flour in question at the date of the breach.\nOn the other hand, I am not satisfied that the full market prices of Reindeer Flour and Saskatoon Flour at that date could have been obtained for this shipment because of the special branding of the bags; and the learned trial judge should, I think, also have made some allowance to cover such expenses as the respondents would necessarily have incurred in handling and effecting a re-sale of the flour with reasonable promptitude. The evidence does not enable me to determine what was the market value of the flour, branded as it was, on the 1st of December, or what price could with due diligence then have been obtained for it. If it could be sold to better advantage re-bagged, we are not informed as to the cost of re-bagging; neither does the record furnish the material requisite to fix a proper allowance for necessary expenses. The plaintiffs should have put in evidence all these matters, the burden being on them to prove their damages. Having failed to do so they cannot complain if this appeal be simply allowed with costs here and in the Court of King's Bench and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nWhile not dissenting from that disposition of the case, as an indulgence I would have been disposed, if the respondents should elect to take such an order within ten days, to direct that the action be remitted to the Superior Court for a new assessment, on the basis above indicated, of their damages in respect of the three cars shipped in November, the respondents to pay the costs of the appeal to this court to be set off pro tanto against the amount ultimately allowed for damages and their costs in the Superior Court and neither party to have costs in the Court of King's Bench; the costs of the new assessment of damages to be disposed of by the trial judge.\nMignault J.\u2014Il n'est question dans cet appel que du montant des dommages que l'appelante doit payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e pour l'inex\u00e9cution d'un contrat\nLe 3 novembre, 1920, l'appelante a achet\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e cinq \"chars\" de farine Saskatoon en sacs, \u00e0 $11.60 le baril, chaque baril contenant deux sacs, les sacs devant porter l'\u00e9tiquette ou marque de l'appelante conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une esquisse \u00e0 \u00eatre fournie par elle, et la farine devant \u00eatre exp\u00e9di\u00e9e en novembre. Cette commande fut subs\u00e9quemment chang\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re a comprendre deux \"chars\" de farine Reindeer co\u00fbtant cinquante cents de plus par baril et trois \"chars\" de farine Saskatoon, et le prix fut r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $11.80 pour la farine Reindeer et \u00e0 $11.30 pour la farine Saskatoon. Le 25 novembre l'appelante \u00e9crivit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e lui demandant, en raison d'une baisse consid\u00e9rable du march\u00e9, de r\u00e9duire le prix en cons\u00e9quence, ou si elle ne voulait pas faire cette r\u00e9duction, d'annuler la vente. L'intim\u00e9e ne voulut pas consentir \u00e0 cette r\u00e9duction, et le 29 novembre envoya un \"char\" de farine Saskatoon et, le 30 novembre, deux \"chars,\" l'un de farine Saskatoon et l'autre de farine Reindeer, \u00e0 l'appelante qui refusa, par lettre du 1er d\u00e9cembre, de les accepter pour les raisons donn\u00e9es en sa lettre du 25 novembre. Le 3 d\u00e9cembre, l'intim\u00e9e exp\u00e9dia deux \"chars,\" l'un de farine Saskatoon et l'autre de farine Reindeer, \u00e0 l'appelante qui ne voulut pas les accepter.\nL'intim\u00e9e, pr\u00e9tendant avoir revendu les cinq \"chars,\" le 12 janvier, 1921, au nomm\u00e9 Strachan, au prix de $9 le baril pour la farine Saskatoon et $9.50 pour la farine Reindeer, r\u00e9clame de l'appelante \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats la diff\u00e9rence de prix, soit $3,450, et, pour le charroyage, les frais de surestarie pay\u00e9s au chemin de fer du Pacifique Canadien, les frais d'entrep\u00f4t et la commission sur la revente, la somme de $1,045, faisant en tout $4,494.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure accorda \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e $720 de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix de vente et le prix du march\u00e9, \u00e0 la date du refus de l'appelante, sur les trois \"chars\" exp\u00e9di\u00e9s en novembre. Quant aux deux \"chars\" envoy\u00e9s le 3 d\u00e9cembre, elle d\u00e9cida que cet envoi \u00e9tait tardif et non conforme au contrat et que l'appelante n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e de les accepter. Elle refusa de condamner l'appelante \u00e0 payer les frais d'entrep\u00f4t et de surestarie jusqu'au 12 janvier, 1921, comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 encourus sans n\u00e9cessit\u00e9.\nLa cour du Banc du Roi accorda \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e le plein montant de sa r\u00e9clamation, jugeant que le refus des deux \"chars\" exp\u00e9di\u00e9s en d\u00e9cembre avait eu pour motif non pas l'envoi tardif, mais la baisse dans le prix du march\u00e9, et qu'il y avait eu renonciation ou waiver \u00e0 se plaindre du retard. Elle d\u00e9cida en outre que la seule base des dommages \u00e9tait la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix du contrat et le prix obtenu sur la revente de la marchandise et que l'intim\u00e9e avait us\u00e9 de toute diligence voulue pour op\u00e9rer cette revente. Elle accorda tous les frais accessoires r\u00e9clam\u00e9s. De l\u00e0 l'appel. Il n'y a qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quelle est la base des dommages qui doivent \u00eatre accord\u00e9s \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et aussi \u00e1 d\u00e9cider si cette derni\u00e8re peut r\u00e9clamer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les \"chars\" qu'elle a exp\u00e9di\u00e9s en dehors du d\u00e9lai du contrat.\nPour juger le diff\u00e9rend, nous devons appliquer, quant au droit du cr\u00e9ancier de r\u00e9clamer des dommages lorsque le d\u00e9biteur refuse d'ex\u00e9cuter son obligation et aussi quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de ces dommages, les r\u00e8gles contenues dans le code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Cependant, je regrette d'avoir \u00e0 le dire, les avocats de l'intim\u00e9e, lors de l'audition de la cause, ont persist\u00e9 \u00e0 ne citer, outre les articles du code, que des autorit\u00e9s tir\u00e9es du common law. Ce n'est pas ainsi que l'on conservera dans toute son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 le droit civil dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Et j'ajoute qu'il est grandement temps que l'on se convainque que ce droit est assez riche en doctrine et en jurisprudence pour fournir une solution conforme \u00e0 son g\u00e9nie \u00e0 toutes les difficult\u00e9s qui se rencontrent dans la pratique.\nIl n'est pas douteux que lorsque l'appelante \u00e9crivit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, le 25 novembre, lui demandant de r\u00e9duire le prix stipul\u00e9 au contrat pour le faire correspondre au prix du march\u00e9, ou si elle ne le voulait pas, d'annuler le contrat, il y a eu de sa part contravention \u00e0 l'obligation r\u00e9sultant du contrat. C'\u00e9tait une d\u00e9claration de l'appelante qu'elle ne remplirait pas son obligation contractuelle, et elle a donn\u00e9 effet \u00e0 cette d\u00e9claration lorsqu'elles refus\u00e9 d'accepter la farine. Or l'article 1065 C.C. explique en ces termes les cons\u00e9quences de cette contravention:\n1065. Toute obligation rend le d\u00e9biteur passible de dommages en cas de contravention de sa part; dans les cas qui le permettent, le cr\u00e9ancier peut aussi demander l'ex\u00e9cution de l'obligation m\u00eame, et l'autorisation de la faire ex\u00e9cuter aux d\u00e9pens du d\u00e9biteur, ou la r\u00e9solution du contrat d'o\u00f9 na\u00eet l'obligation; sauf les exceptions contenues dans ce code et sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son recours pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dans tous les cas.\nCela veut dire que lorsqu'il y a eu contravention \u00e0 l'obligation, le cr\u00e9ancier a en principe, et sauf les exceptions qui ne nous int\u00e9ressent pas ici, le choix ou bien de r\u00e9clamer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au d\u00e9biteur, en concluant \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du contrat, ou bien de demander l'ex\u00e9cution de l'obligation m\u00eame, sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son droit de r\u00e9clamer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 raison de la contravention du d\u00e9biteur.\nIl n'y a aucun doute \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans la doctrine. Nous lisons en effet dans Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9dition, t. 4, p. 128:\u2014\nLa partie envers laquelle l'engagement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu peut demander, \u00e0 son choix, contre celle qui y a manqu\u00e9, soit l'ex\u00e9cution, soit la r\u00e9solution du contrat.\nDans l'esp\u00e8ce, sur r\u00e9ception de la lettre de l'appelante, qui \u00e9tait un refus d'ex\u00e9cuter le contrat, l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9cida d'exiger l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat et d'exp\u00e9dier la farine \u00e0 l'appelante. Et sur le refus de l'appelante d'accepter cette farine et de la payer, l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait en droit de traiter le contrat comme r\u00e9solu de plein droit et de r\u00e9clamer des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. En effet, aux termes de l'article 1544 C.C.,\ndans la vente de choses mobili\u00e8res, l'acheteur est tenu de les enlever au temps et au lieu o\u00f9 elles sont livrables. Si le prix n'en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9, la r\u00e9solution de la vente a lieu de plein droit en faveur du vendeur, sans qu'il soit besoin d'une poursuite, apr\u00e8s l'expiration du terme convenu pour l'enl\u00e8vement, et s'il n'y a pas de stipulation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, apr\u00e8s que l'acheteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en demeure, en la mani\u00e8re port\u00e9e au titre Des Obligations; sans pr\u00e9judice au droit du vendeur de r\u00e9clamer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nCependant, si l'intim\u00e9e d\u00e9cidait d'ex\u00e9cuter le contrat elle devait suivre la loi de ce contrat et en observer toutes les conditions. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, toute la farine achet\u00e9e devait \u00eatre exp\u00e9di\u00e9e en novembre, et l'intim\u00e9e, choisissant d'ex\u00e9cuter le contrat, devait l'envoyer en novembre. Il y avait toutes les raisons de le faire ici, car le march\u00e9 \u00e9tait en baisse. Et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9, et je crois \u00e0 bon droit, que dans les march\u00e9s \u00e0 livrer portant sur des marchandises dont le prix est sujet \u00e0 de fr\u00e9quentes variations, le d\u00e9lai convenu pour la livraison forme une partie essentielle du contrat (Besan\u00e7on, 24 juin, 1919. Dalloz, 1921.2.115).\nMais le jugement dont est appel d\u00e9cide que l'appelante ayant refus\u00e9 d'accepter l'envoi tardif pour les raisons qu'elle avait donn\u00e9es dans sa lettre du 25 novembre et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es dans sa lettre du 1er d\u00e9cembre,\nil y a eu renonciation ou waiver de la part de l'intim\u00e9e (l'appelante devant cette cour) du retard dans l'exp\u00e9dition de ces deux chars, et qu'il \u00e9tait trop tard, partant, lors du proc\u00e8s, pour invoquer ce moyen.\nEcartons imm\u00e9diatement la doctrine anglaise du waiver, qui est \u00e9trang\u00e8re au droit civil, et demandons-nous si dans l'esp\u00e8ce il y a eu renonciation ou acquiescement, pour me servir du terme propre et bien fran\u00e7ais? Si la cour d'appel, dans le passage de son jugement que j'ai cit\u00e9, a entendu \u00e9noncer une r\u00e8gle de droit\u2014ce que du reste elle n'appuie d'aucune autorit\u00e9\u2014je suis tr\u00e8s respectueusement d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas de telle r\u00e8gle. Le fait qu'une partie \u00e0 une action justifie son acte par un motif, et lorsqu'on d\u00e9montre que ce motif manque de fondement, essaye de s'appuyer sur un autre motif qu'elle n'avait jamais invoqu\u00e9, peut quelquefois faire douter de sa sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 ou m\u00eame de sa bonne foi. En certaines circonstances, on peut y voir une raison de fait pour repousser la pr\u00e9tention de la partie, mais encore une fois il n'y a pas l\u00e0 r\u00e8gle de droit. La v\u00e9ritable r\u00e8gle de droit, c'est qu'on n'est jamais cens\u00e9 renoncer \u00e0 un droit, et alors que l'acquiescement peut \u00eatre tacite, il doit \u00eatre non-\u00e9quivoque, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'intention d'acquiescer ou de renoncer doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9e. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, l'acheteur pr\u00e9tend \u00e0 tort que le vendeur est oblig\u00e9 de r\u00e9duire le prix stipul\u00e9 au contrat, parce que le prix du march\u00e9 a baiss\u00e9, et il refuse d'accepter livraison. Est-ce que cela implique que l'acheteur consent \u00e0 recevoir la marchandise en dehors des d\u00e9lais du contrat (car l'acquiescement est un consentement) m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 l'acheteur n'aurait donn\u00e9 aucune raison de son refus d'accepter livraison, sinon la raison mal fond\u00e9e que le prix du contrat devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9duit? Il faudrait plus que cela pour dire qu'il y a eu acquiescement ou consentement \u00e0 l'envoi tardif. Si l'acheteur avait accept\u00e9 livraison de la marchandise en refusant de la payer plus que le prix du march\u00e9, je comprendrais qu'on pourrait dire qu'il avait acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'envoi tardif. Mais lorsqu'il refuse absolument de la recevoir, en invoquant si on veut une mauvaise raison, cela implique-t-il qu'il consent quand m\u00eame \u00e0 la recevoir en dehors des d\u00e9lais du contrat? Je crois que non, car il n'y a aucun consentement, m\u00eame tacite, \u00e0 recevoir la marchandise, il n'y a qu'un refus de la recevoir.\nD'ailleurs, je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, si l'intim\u00e9e choisissait d'exiger l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat, elle devait, si elle voulait r\u00e9clamer des dommages \u00e0 raison de la contravention de l'appelante, suivre la loi de ce contrat et exp\u00e9dier la marchandise dans le d\u00e9lai convenu. Ce serait bien \u00e9trange qu'\u00e9tant elle m\u00eame en faute par son envoi tardif, elle p\u00fbt encore s'autoriser de cette ex\u00e9cution fautive pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Voy. Baudry-Lacantinerie et Saignat, Vente et Echange,' no. 602; Aubry et Rau, 5e \u00e9d. tome 5, p. 143, note 4.\nJe crois, donc qu'on ne doit pas tenir compte des deux \"chars\" envoy\u00e9s le 3 d\u00e9cembre dans le calcul des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats que l'appelante doit \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. En cela je suis de l'avis du premier juge.\nMais comment doit-on \u00e9valuer ces dommages? Ici encore il n'y a qu'\u00e0 appliquer les articles 1073, 1074 et 1075 du code civil. Les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dus au cr\u00e9ancier sont en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le montant de la perte qu'il a faite et du gain dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9. Il importe peu que le d\u00e9biteur ait agi ici par dol\u2014mais il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si r\u00e9ellement il y a eu dol\u2014car les dommages dont il s'agit ont pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9vus et r\u00e9sultent directement de l'inex\u00e9cution du contrat.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure dit que pour d\u00e9terminer le montant des dommages il faut tenir compte de la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix du march\u00e9 au jour de la contravention et le prix du contrat.\nCette diff\u00e9rence est sans aucun doute l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le juge doit envisager lorsqu'il fixe le montant des dommages qui proviennent de l'inex\u00e9cution d'une vente, et surtout d'une vente commerciale. Les marchandises ou denr\u00e9es ont ordinairement un cours ou une valeur qui varie suivant les circonstances, et surtout d'apr\u00e8s les lois \u00e9conomiques de l'offre et de la demande. D'autre part, en vue du refus de l'acheteur d'accepter la marchandise vendue, le vendeur cherchera g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un autre acheteur, et son gain ou sa perte se mesurera d'apr\u00e8s le prix qu'il pourra en obtenir, c'est-\u00e0-dire par le prix courant au jour de la revente. De m\u00eame l'acheteur, qui a achet\u00e9 pour revendre et non pas pour garder la marchandise, se la procurera ordinairement ailleurs et son gain ou sa perte se mesurera \u00e9galement par le prix qu'il devra la payer, soit le prix du march\u00e9 au jour de son nouvel achat. Dire donc que la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix du march\u00e9 et le prix du contrat en mati\u00e8re commerciale est la mesure de ces dommages, c'est \u00e9noncer une r\u00e8gle qui s'applique \u00e9galement au vendeur et \u00e0 l'acheteur, et qui est conforme \u00e0 l'intention de l'un et de l'autre puisque tous deux ils faisaient une op\u00e9ration commerciale Sans doute, lorsqu'il n'y a pas de march\u00e9 ou de cours pour la marchandise, le juge devra n\u00e9cessairement chercher d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fixation des dommages, mais ordinairement la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix du contrat et le prix du march\u00e9 est le meilleur guide pour l'\u00e9valuation des dommages, Ceci me para\u00eet si \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire que je me contente d'indiquer une solution tir\u00e9e de la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise et qui s'applique ici.\nEn mati\u00e8re de vente de denr\u00e9es, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dus au vendeur, au cas de r\u00e9solution pour d\u00e9faut de retirement de la marchandise vendue, se r\u00e8glent par la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix de vente stipul\u00e9 et celui du cours au jour fix\u00e9 pour la livraison. Douai, 8 ao\u00fbt, 1896. Dalloz, 1897, 2. 69.\nOn trouvera plusieurs d\u00e9cisions d'esp\u00e8ce dans le r\u00e9pertoire de Fuzier-Herman, vo. Dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, nos. 247 et suiv.\nJe ne pense pas que la cour du Banc du Roi ait m\u00e9connu cette r\u00e8gle puisqu'elle a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e la diff\u00e9rence entre le prix de la revente et le prix du contrat. Je ne puis cependant m'emp\u00eacher de croire que l'application que le premier juge en a faite est plus conforme \u00e0 la justice. Il appert en effet que l'intim\u00e9e a attendu tout le mois de d\u00e9cembre et une partie de janvier avant de chercher \u00e0 revendre la farine. Son agent, Freeman, dit qu'il a re\u00e7u ses premi\u00e8res instructions de vendre la farine \u00e0 la fin de d\u00e9cembre ou au commencement de janvier. Et pendant tout ce temps le march\u00e9 baissait.\nJe ne crois pas que l'intim\u00e9e ait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l'absence de march\u00e9 ou de possibilit\u00e9 de revendre la farine. On a produit au dossier des listes de prix se rapportant \u00e0 diverses dates en d\u00e9cembre et janvier, et le t\u00e9moin Turgeon dit que la cote du march\u00e9 de fleur paraissait journellement dans la \"Gazette\" de Montr\u00e9al. L'agent de l'intim\u00e9e, Freeman, ne nie pas l'existence d'un march\u00e9 pour la fleur, mais il dit qu'en d\u00e9cembre et janvier ce march\u00e9 \u00e9tait \"brisky,\" mot d'argot am\u00e9ricain que je crois signifier \"incertain\" ou \"capricieux.\" S'il en \u00e9tait ainsi, c'\u00e9tait une raison de plus de presser la revente. L'intim\u00e9e s'est adress\u00e9e pour la revente \u00e0 un courtier qui n'achetait pas pour le commerce, mais seulement pour Strachan, qui \u00e9tait boulanger. C'est elle qui avait la charge de la preuve, et elle ne me satisfait pas qu'elle \u00e9tait justifiable d'attendre un mois et demi avant de revendre, et surtout de charger \u00e0 l'appelante la somme consid\u00e9rable qu'elle lui r\u00e9clame pour frais d'entrep\u00f4t et de surestarie pendant ce long d\u00e9lai.\nA l'audition l'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9tendu que cette farine \u00e9tant en sacs portant la marque et le nom de l'appelante, n'\u00e9tait pas aussi facile \u00e0 vendre que si ces sacs n'\u00e9taient pas ainsi marqu\u00e9s. La preuve est silencieuse sur cette circonstance qu'on dit maintenant avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 une entrave \u00e0 la revente. Tout ce que je trouve c'est une remarque de Freeman:\nwe were stuck with that mark on it, it was somebody else's mark, so we had to dispose of it.\nOn ignore cependant si cette circonstance a influ\u00e9 sur le prix, et on ne sait pas non plus quel aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le co\u00fbt du chargement de la farine dans d'autres sacs. L'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tant demanderesse avait la charge de cette preuve et elle ne l'a pas faite.\nSur le tout j'en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion de r\u00e9tablir le premier jugement. Je puis ajouter que j'aurais beaucoup h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 intervenir dans cette question de l'\u00e9valuation des dommages, si je n'\u00e9tais convaincu que dans cette cause on n'a pas eu suffisamment \u00e9gard au retard inexpliqu\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e de faire la revente. Je ne vois du reste aucune justification au sujet de la condamnation de payer des frais d'entrep\u00f4t et de surestarie encourus par suite de ce retard.\nMon opinion est donc d'accorder l'appel et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure avec les frais de cette cour et de la cour d'appel.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

A new trial was therefore necessary.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and Fraser Grant for the appellants. The cheque given by an appellant was at most a conditional payment and when payment was stopped it was as though it had never been given; Elliott v. Crutchley[1]; In re National Motor Co[2].\nThe doctrine of caveat emptor is not applicable. See Redgrave v. Hurd[3].\nThe appellants were not getting what they contracted for and the doctrine applied in Kennedy v. Panama, etc. Mail Co.[4] and Freear v. Gilders[5] is applicable. In any event there should, at least, be a new trial. The trial judge should have left to the jury the question submitted by the counsel for appellants.\nSheard and A.C. Reid for the respondent. In this country the usual custom is to make payments by cheque and the appellants having followed that custom cannot afterwards claim that it was not payment. See Johnston v. Boyes[6]; Downey v. Hicks[7].\nAn executed contract cannot be set aside for innocent misrepresentation. Milch v. Coburn[8]. Nor for any reason except fraud. Wilde v. Gibson[9]; Brownlie v. Campbell[10].\nNo objection was made of non-direction at the close of the trial and it cannot be argued now. Neville v. Fine Arts[11].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons stated by my brother Anglin I am of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed and a new trial granted with costs here and in the Appellate Division, the costs in the abortive trial to abide the result.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants made an offer in writing to the respondent to buy from her \u201cpremises\u201d so described as if trying to buy the fee simple of lands therein described, contents of house to be included, for $3,100, and paid therewith to respondent\u2019s agent a deposit of $100.\nThe loose and unbusinesslike ways of the parties concerned throughout the whole of the negotiations in question is well illustrated by the very erroneous description in said offer of what was being bargained for. It clearly was an offer intended (as appears from late evidence) for the purchase of an assignment of a lease, but how long that had to run, or what building rights acquired thereby, or indeed anything relative thereto, was not presented in evidence.\nI may infer from what counsel tells us that both parties understood something of what rights they were bargaining about, dependent on the terms made with the city of To- ronto. We are not supposed to know all these things as if we resided on the Toronto Island.\nThe island, we may infer, is, generally speaking, a place for summer residence. Why should a court, even one having headquarters in Toronto, be expected to take judicial notice of all such matters when trying a case like this?\nThis offer which was accepted and then slightly amended by respondent, apparently with appellants\u2019 assent, or that of one of them, was made on the 26th of January, 1923, and to be accepted by the 29th of January, 1923, and the sale to be completed on or before the 15th of February, 1923, and time was declared to be of the essence of the contract.\nThe 15th of February had come and gone before it was capable of completion. The date of respondent\u2019s acceptance is left a complete blank unless we try A.D. 192 as the true date thereof.\nThis offer, if accepted, shall with such acceptance constitute a binding contract of purchase and sale\nis among the last of the provisions.\nThe foregoing presents enough of loose methods, but the appellants (the purchasers) never, until after the execution of the assignment of lease by respondent, according to the verbal evidence, got the keys to visit and inspect the premises. The excuse for not doing that earlier is the condition of the approach.\nIt is said that in course of time ice grew on the lake and formed easy means of approach, not so serviceable when negotiations began.\nAgain it is said on one side that the keys for inspection had been offered but refused, and on the other side that later they were asked for and refused until assignment executed, and then delivered therewith.\nAll these peculiarities of this case are recited in order that the final act in respect of this case upon which the decision herein must turn may be properly and as accurately as possible appreciated if justice is to be done according to law.\nThe assignment in question is not in evidence in this case and all we have in regard thereto is verbal allusion thereto in course of the oral evidence by different witnesses from which it has been inferred that the lease was duly assigned and consented to by the city counsel after the 15th of February and an adjustment made as to taxes and insurance.\nThen, upon being told all was completed in these respects, one of the appellants gave the following cheque,\nAccount No.12085.\nToronto, Ont., February 23, 1923.\nTHE DOMINION BANK\nCity Hall Branch\nSavings Department\nPAY to the order of Russell Nesbitt\nThe sum of twenty-nine hundred and sixty-nine................... 74\/100 Dollars.\n$2,969.74.\nKatie Redican\non a Friday when she got some papers, probably the assignment, and the keys of the house and, on the following Sunday, went over on the ice to inspect the house and contents.\nShe found much to disappoint the expectations she had entertained as result of the misrepresentations of the agent of respondent and on Monday morning stopped payment at the bank and telephoned the payee, who was the husband of respondent, what she had done and the reason therefor founded upon said misrepresentation.\nThe said Russell Nesbitt telephoned her that he would issue a writ in five minutes and seems to have lost no time in doing so as it was issued on the 26th of February, and she was handed the keys of said house along with the copy of writ served on her.\nThe indorsement of claim on the writ was as follows:\u2014\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim is against the defendants for the sum of two thousand nine hundred and sixty-nine dollars and eighty-four cents ($2,969.84) being the amount owing by the defendants to the plaintiff as balance of amount owing under an offer to purchase by the defendants from the plaintiff on lots 4 and 5, plan 336, in the city of Toronto.\nThe following are the particulars:\u2014\nThe balance owing under a contract for the sale by the plaintiff to the defendants of lots 4 and 5, plan 336, in the city of Toronto, which said contract has been signed by the defendants.\nAt the opening of the trial after all the pleadings and usual proceedings in such a case had been taken, counsel for respondent asked the learned trial judge to allow the writ to be amended by adding to said particulars of claim the following\nbeing the amount of a cheque given by the defendants to the plaintiff. The appellants\u2019 counsel said he had no objection and supposed the like treatment would be afforded him in an amendment he desired, and then the matter was left to the learned trial judge to consider.\nIt is said now that the amendment never was made, yet it appears in the case before us.\nAll this would be quite immaterial but for the very narrow ground to be considered, as will presently appear upon which this case may have to be disposed of.\nThe trial proceeded and much evidence was given in presence of the jury hearing the case.\nThe learned trial judge at the close of this evidence and before counsel addressed the jury stated to counsel that he intended to submit to the jury questions which he then read to counsel. There ensued a long discussion but he could not agree with the counsel for appellant and persisted in presenting his own form of question, despite the protest of said counsel, in the course of his charge.\nI most respectfully submit he should have adopted the amendment suggested by counsel and this case might have been much simplified.\nThe amended form of question suggested by appellants\u2019 counsel was as follows:\u2014\nMr. Grant: I would suggest that you put it: Were there untrue statements made by Wing, whether intentional or not, which induced the making of the contract?\nWere there any statements made by Wing that were untrue that he knew to be untrue, or which he made without caring whether they were true or false, to induce the contract?\nAnswers got to such questions would have solved both the question of simple misrepresentation vitiating or not, as the answers might have indicated, the contract if not completely executed, and alternatively if so executed, have determined the question of whether or not there was fraud or misrepresentation entitling appellants to rescission of the contract, even if completely executed.\nInstead thereof we have got rather dubious results to deal with.\nThe questions actually submitted, and the answers returned by the jury thereto, are as follows:\u2014\n1. (a) Did Mrs. Nesbitt\u2019s agent, Ving, knowingly, make any untrue statement as to the house or its contents for the purpose of deceiving the defendants in any material way and inducing them to make the offer to purchase? and\n(b) Did they make the offer relying upon such statements?\n(a) A. No.\n(b) A. Refer to question (a).\n2. If you find there were any such statements, what were they?\nA. (a) We find that there is no evidence that such statements were made knowingly.\n3. Did Wing make any untrue statements without knowing they were untrue but relying upon which defendants signed, and without having such statements they would not have signed their offer to purchase?\nA. Yes.\n4. If so, what were such innocent misrepresentations?\nA. (a) That the house was lighted by electricity.\n(b) That there were five bedrooms.\nUpon these answers the learned trial judge entered judgment for the plaintiff, against both defendants, for the sum of $3,005.53, and dismissed the counter-claim of the appellants, and ordered that they pay the respondent her costs of action and of the counter-claim.\nFrom this judgment the defendants, now appellants, appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario. That court dismissed said appeal with costs, the majority holding that the conveyance by the respondent herein having been executed there could be no rescission of the contract in the absence of actual fraud.\nThis was dissented from by Mr. Justice Magee who held that the action should be dismissed with costs upon defendants executing a reassignment of the property to the respondent herein.\nThe opinion of the majority of said court was written by the late lamented Chief Justice of Ontario, concurred in by Maclaren J.A. and Ferguson J.A. This appeal is taken therefrom and the argument has not been confined within the narrow limits upon which said judgment in appeal proceeded.\nI will, however, deal with the latter first.\nThe cases cited by the late Chief Justice in support of said holding are, in not a single instance, on all fours with this case.\nThe case of Wilde v. Gibson[12], shews by the head-note, which does not misrepresent what follows, that the deed and payment of price had both preceded the suit seeking to set aside same as based on fraud. Indeed the inference I draw is that such had been the case for many years.\nThe next case, Brownlie v. Campbell[13], turned upon features of that case none of which are apparent or possible of being so in this case.\nNext is cited Seddon v. North Eastern Salt Co[14], wherein payment would clearly seem to have been made, as well as execution of the deeds required, before the bill filed therein seeking relief. I submit that is not a case much like that in question herein and cannot help us.\nThe judgments in that case are well worth being perused to appreciate what is involved in such like cases.\nThe Irish case of Lecky v. Walter[15], is clearly the case of an executed contract, for the plaintiff was suing to recover the price he had paid for the bonds sold and delivered to him long before.\nIn the case of Debenham v. Sawbridge[16], the last cited in said judgment, to maintain same on the ground of the contract having been completely executed I find the sale was under the order of the court in 1897 and the purchase price paid in October following, of that year, and it was only in February, 1900, that the plaintiff commenced his action against the trustee.\nIndeed, I most respectfully submit that, there is nothing in the decision of that case which should be held to support the dismissal of the appeal to the court below, though much worthy of consideration in other respects.\nI am just now dealing with the single narrow point of whether or not a conveyance of property purchased, whether the purchase money had been paid or not, is a conclusive bar to relief founded upon the charge of misrepresentation made by the appellants under the circumstances herein.\nIf the purchase price had actually been received by the respondent from the appellants then the conveyance having been, I assume for argument\u2019s sake, duly made and received by appellants, though we are left in the dark as to much that should have been presented in evidence relative thereto, then the objection upon which the court below pro- ceeded might well have been maintained as insuperable for the appellants herein.\nI have looked not only at all the cases cited herein but as well those cited below to find if there is any case wherein the execution of the deed of conveyance intending to carry out the contract has, in the absence of payment of the purchase price either in goods, lands or money, been held conclusively a bar to the vendee who has not paid, setting up other defences such as set up herein, and have been unable to find such a case.\nWhen I consider that neat point herein it seems quite clear that it is because the purchase money has not been paid that the present action is brought, and it is founded on such fact.\nHow can a plaintiff so suing be heard to say the money price has been paid?\nAnd again if she or her counsel had the courage to think so why did she not sue the party who made such cheque, instead of suing, as she has done, two people instead of one? Simply because Byles on Bills has taught counsel and us that only when a cheque is paid can it be said to be possible of being pleaded as payment. The form of this suit seems to me a most conclusive answer to all that is urged herein as to the contract being fully executed.\nThe attempt of the respondent to shift on to the cheque, calls for the remark that the suit and judgment are against two, and that the cheque was signed by one only. Another curiosity in a very queer case.\nI have therefore reached the conclusion that this appeal must be allowed.\nBut is a new trial necessary? Thoroughly convinced, as I am, that appellants have much to complain of in the rulings and directions of the learned trial judge, I am inclined to hold that the answers to the questions submitted at the trial, read in light of the evidence in the case, furnish clear ground upon which this court can, as I submit most respectfully the learned trial judge should have done, proceed to enter judgment for the defendants, now appellants.\nThere is much in the way of misrepresentation vitiating the right to recover, though falling short of such fraud as must exist on which to found an action of deceit. And within that class the findings of the jury, in answering questions three and four, seem to me to fall.\nFor the relevant law therein I may be permitted to refer those concerned to the 4th ed. of Leake on Contracts, pp. 229 et seq. and the cases cited therein. And illustrative of the law exemplified by cases therein, I may refer to the case of Freear v. Gilders[17], and cases cited therein.\nI think a difference of a few acres, as therein, is no more important than the four rooms instead of five as misrepresented and electric light in this case to the appellants.\nThe only way in which the class of cases and legal propositions therein dealt with can escape from such findings of fact as made above, are by reason of the contract having been wholly executed and, as I have already said, I cannot so find in this case.\nI may, in parting with this feature of the case and the exception thereby created, quote the following from Williams on Vendor and Purchaser, page 578:\u2014\nCompletion of the contract consists on the part of the vendor in conveying with a good title the estate contracted for in the land sold and delivering up the actual possession or enjoyment thereof; on the purchaser\u2019s part it lies in accepting such title, preparing and tendering a conveyance for the vendor\u2019s execution, accepting such conveyance, taking possession and paying the price.\nI may also cite the disposition given in the case of Kettle-well v. Refuge Assurance Co[18].\nI would for the foregoing reasons allow the appeal with costs throughout and direct the action to be dismissed.\nBut if there is not a majority of the court holding this view I would allow the appeal with costs of this appeal and of the court of appeal below to the appellants in any event and direct a new trial, costs thereof to abide the event.\nBut in the event of a new trial, I submit that the holdings of the learned trial judge in refusing to frame the question relative to fraud in the way asked by counsel for the appellants at the trial there was grave error which ought to be avoided in any possible future trial, as there has, I fear, arisen much misapprehension of law and fact which has led, possibly, to unfortunate results arising from the jury not being properly instructed. DUFF J.\u2014I shall first refer to the contention that the doctrine of Redgrave v. Hurd[19] applies and that consequently the appellants are entitled to rescission, even assuming the representations to have been innocent.\nIn the 14th edition of Sugden on Vendors and Purchasers, vol. 2, at p. 193, this passage appears:\u2014\nIf the conveyance has been actually executed by all the necessary parties and the purchaser is evicted by a title to which the covenants do not extend, he cannot recover the purchase money either at law or in equity.\nThe principle appears to be that, save in exceptional cases to which reference will be made, the maxim caveat emptor applies, and that the purchaser, if he wishes to protect himself in respect of the absence of title or defect in the title or in the quantity or quality of the estate, must do so by covenants in the conveyance. Legge v. Croker[20]; Bree v. Holbech[21]; Johnson v. Johnson[22]; Clare v. Lambe[23]; Seedon v. N.E. Salt Co[24]; Cole v. Pope[25]. The rule does not apply where there is error in substantialibus, where, for example, it turns out that the vendee has purchased his own property; nor does it apply where the transaction has been brought about by the fraud of the vendor. The law is summed up to that effect in the judgment of Lord Selburne in Brownlee v. Campbell[26].\nThe question whether the non-payment of the purchase money affects the operation of the rule is one upon which there is not very much explicit authority. The ratio of the rule being that the purchaser can and ought to protect himself except in the two cases mentioned by covenants in the conveyance, one naturally expects to find that the execution of the conveyance, the acceptance of it by the purchaser, and the vesting of the estate in him are in themselves sufficient to bring the rule into play. The payment of the purchase money and the preparation and settling of the conveyance, including the execution of the conveyance by some of the parties, are not in themselves sufficient. Cripps v. Reade[27]. This, however, is not logically decisive and it may be arguable on principle that until the purchase money is paid or secured by something which is accepted as the consideration for the transfer the transaction is still in fieri.\nIn Hitchcock v. Giddings[28], there was a grant of the supposed interest of the vendor in a remainder in fee expectant on an estate tail, of which it afterwards proved that the tenant in tail had suffered a recovery, both parties being ignorant of this until after the conveyance had been executed and a bond had been given for the payment of the purchase money. The Court of Exchequer, in exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, relieved the purchaser from the bond on the principle above mentioned that cases of error in substantialibus are outside the rule. LordSt. Leonards (Vendors and Purchasers, 14th edition, vol. 1, p. 376) expresses some doubt as to the validity of this decision, which, he says, was in a later case doubted by Lord Eldon thinking apparently that it was rather a simple case of absence of title. He observes, however, that there could be no distinction between the case in which the money is actually paid and that in which it is only secured. The decision, he says, must be the same in both cases. That is not the view which was taken by the Court of Common Pleas in Clare v. Lambe[29]. Strangely enough, there, Mr. Justice Grove (p. 341) in discussing the case of Hitchcock v. Giddings28 says that the vendor was there seeking to enforce performance of the contract by compelling the purchaser to pay for a thing that he had not got. But in fact the proceeding in Hitchcock v. Giddings28 was a proceeding of a different character. The case arose on a bill for relief against a bond given by the vendee.\nThe interpretation of that case in Clare v. Lambe29 must, I think, give way to the opinion expressed by Lord St. Leonards just referred to, and it must be taken, I think, that an executed conveyance containing covenants for payment of purchase money, for example, stands in precisely the same position as an executed conveyance where the money has been actually paid in cash or where it has been secured by a bond or by a mortgage. Indeed the doctrine has more than once been applied to a lease. Legge v. Croker[30]; Angel v. Jay[31]. The question of substance is, of course, whether at that stage the vendee on the ground of mistake or innocent misrepresentation is entitled to rescind. If he is entitled to rescind, then he is entitled, under the system established by the Judicature Act, to set up in answer to a claim by the vendor for the purchase money the facts which entitle him to rescind.\nNor can it, I think, in principle make any difference that the conveyance has been executed on faith of a promise made by the vendee that he will pay the purchase money, or in exchange, for example, for a promissory note. In the present case, the cheque was accepted as conditional payment. There was an implied promise to pay arising out of the delivery and acceptance of the transfer, and the delivery of the cheque was a conditional performance of this promise. I do not think the subsequent repudiation of the promise can take away from the transaction its character as an executed transaction.\nThe whole point is: At what stage does caveat emptor apply?\nThe vendee may rely after completion upon warranty, contractual condition, error in substantialibus, or fraud. Once the conveyance is settled and the estate has passed, it seems a reasonable application of the rule to hold that as to warranty or contractual condition resort must be had to the deed unless there has been a stipulation at an earlier stage which was not to be superseded by the deed, as in the case of a contract for compensation. Bos v. Helsham[32], Representation which is not fraudulent, and does not give rise to error in substantialibus, could only operate after completion as creating a contractual condition or a warranty. Finality and certainty in business affairs seem to require that as a rule, when there is a formal conveyance, such a condition or warranty should be therein expressed, and that the acceptance of the conveyance by the vendee as finally vesting the property in him is the act which for this purpose marks the transition from contract in fieri to contract executed; and this appears to fit in with the general reasoning of the authorities.\nAll this applies, I think, to a case like the present where the representation relates to the physical state of the property as well as to the case where the subject of the representation is the existence or non-existence of some encumbrance or legal burden, such as a right of way.\nBut I see no escape from granting the application for a new trial. The learned trial judge overlooked the settled doctrine based upon the plainest good sense that an affirmation of fact made for the purpose of influencing people in the transaction of business involves an affirmation of belief in the existence of the fact stated. If there is no belief, if the mind of the proponent has never been applied to the question and if he is in truth consciously ignorant upon the subject of his affirmation there is obviously a false statement and, if made with intent that it shall be acted upon in the way of business in a matter involving his own interests, a fraudulent statement. This ought to have been explained to the jury. Mr. Grant explicitly requested the learned trial judge to do so and his refusal was so decisive as to preclude the necessity of further reference to the matter. There should be the usual order as to costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendants entered into a contract to purchase a leasehold property from the plaintiff represented by one Wing, her agent. In due course an assignment of lease executed by the plaintiff and assented to by the landlord (the city of Toronto) was delivered to the defendants\u2019 solicitor with the keys of the property, the cheque of one of the defendants for the purchase money being simultaneously handed to the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor. The defendants also took an assignment of insurance and paid some arrears of taxes. On inspecting the property two days later\u2014which is said to have been their first opportunity of doing so\u2014they discovered, as they allege, that it had been misrepresented to them by Wing in several particulars, which they claim are of such importance that, had they known the truth in regard to them, they would not have purchased. On learning of these matters they stopped payment of the cheque given for the purchase money having first notified the vendor\u2019s husband that that would be done. An action by the vendor was at once begun, the writ bearing the following special indorsement:\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim is against the defendants for the sum of $2,969.84 being the amount owing by the defendants to the plaintiff as balance of account owing under an offer to purchase by the defendants from the plaintiff on lots 4 and 5, plan 336 in the city of Toronto.\nThe following are the particulars:\nTo balance owing under a contract for the sale by the plaintiff to the defendants of lots 4 and 5, plan 336, in the city of Toronto, which said contract has been signed by the defendants (being the amount of a cheque given by the defendants to the plaintiff), $2,969.84.\nUnder the Ontario practice this indorsement constituted the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim. The words in brackets were added by amendment at the trial.\nThe action was tried by a jury. The judgment of the trial court, affirmed by the Appellate Division, upheld the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The defendants appeal to this court.\nThat this is not an action on the cheque referred to in the amendment of the special indorsement allowed at the trial, as the plaintiff now seeks to maintain, is made clear by the facts that the claim and the judgment are not against the maker of the cheque alone but are against her and her co-purchaser jointly. The amendment made at the trial should not therefore be regarded as having changed the cause of action as originally stated. It merely added an allegation facilitating proof of the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as a sum liquidated. The action remained one for money due and owing upon the contract.\nIt is, however, equally clear that it is in no sense the equitable action for specific performance. The plaintiff asserted a purely common law claim for payment of a sum of money due under a contract, perfectly valid, Rutherford v. Acton-Adams[33], subject to any defence to which such a claim is open. He did not require the aid of a court of equity to be relieved of the leasehold with its burdens; the defendants by taking the conveyance had assumed them. For the recovery of the purchase money the common law remedy was adequate and there was no ground for the plaintiff invoking the interference of a court of equity. Ord v. Johnston[34]; Bagnell v. Edwards[35]. It follows that the defendants will not necessarily succeed by establishing a case which would have disentitled the plaintiff to specific performance in a court of equity. That remedy is so distinctly discretionary that the court may withhold it although a case for rescission has not been made out.\nBut innocent misrepresentation, such as will support a demand for rescission in equity, though unavailing at common law, will serve as a good equitable defence to a claim for payment under the contract as well as afford ground for a counter-claim for rescission. Rescission is, of course, destructive of the basis of the plaintiffs claim; the right to rescission when established is an effective defence. But whether misrepresentation is set up by way of equitable defence or as the basis of a counter-claim for rescission, the burden on the defendant is the same. If the case made by him would not warrant a decree for rescission it will not avail as a defence to the claim for payment. In preferring this defence a defendant assumes the role of actor and a plea which, if established, would defeat a counter-claim for rescission is equally effective by way of reply to the defence of misrepresentation if set up by the plaintiff. 20 Hals. Laws of Eng., pp. 756, 746, 750.\nIn the present case the defendants plead misrepresentation as a ground both of defence and of counter-claim. They assert that it was fraudulent and, alternatively, that if innocent it was so material as to afford ground for rescission.\nThe jury negatived fraud and on this branch of the case, if they are not entitled to have the action dismissed on the other, the defendants ask for a new trial on the ground of misdirection and refusal by the learned trial judge to submit an essential element of it to the jury. I defer dealing with that aspect of the appeal.\nThe jury found that innocent misrepresentations inducing the contract had been made by the plaintiff\u2019s agent, and upon them the defendants maintain they are entitled to rescission. The trial judge rejected this claim on the ground that the contract for sale had been fully executed by the delivery of the deed and the acceptance of the cheque in payment, and that rescission of a contract after execution cannot be had for mere innocent misrepresenta- tion unless it be such as renders the subject of sale different in substance from what was contracted for (Kennedy v. Panama, etc.[36]). The suggestion that the property differed so completely in substance from what the defendants intended to acquire that there was a failure of consideration is not borne out by the facts. Neither is there any foundation for a suggestion of mutual mistake as a basis for rescission. Debenham v. Sawbridge[37]. The trial judge regarded the handing over of the cheque as absolute payment and as a completion of the contract by the defendants just as the delivery of the conveyance and possession constituted completion on the part of the plaintiff.\nIn the Appellate Divisional Court this judgment was sustained, the late Sir W.R. Meredith C.J.O. giving the judgment of the majority of the court, on the ground that the contract became \u201cexecuted\u201d upon delivery and acceptance of the conveyance, whether the giving and taking of the cheque should or should not be regarded as payment of the purchase money.\nAlthough Mr. Pollock in his treatise on the Law of Contracts (9 ed. p. 593) would seem to imply the existence of some doubt as to the doctrine enunciated in Lord Campbell\u2019s dictum in Wilde v. Gibson[38], that\nwhere the conveyance has been executed * * * a Court of Equity will set aside the conveyance only on the ground of fraud,\npointing out that it has not been uniformly followed (see Fry on Specific Performance, 9th ed., p. 312) it is too well established to admit of controversy, assuming that his Lordship meant where the contract had been fully carried out. Brownlie v. Campbell[39]; Soper v. Arnold[40]; Seddon v. North Eastern Salt Co.[41]; Lecky v. Walter[42].\nBut on the question when a contract will, for the purposes of this rule, be deemed to have ceased to be \u201cexecutory\u201d and to have become \u201cexecuted\u201d the authorities are not so clear. I have not found any reported case in which it has been determined whether or not after delivery and acceptance of the conveyance and taking of possession a contract of sale remains \u201cexecutory\u201d until actual payment of the purchase money then due; nor indeed have I found any authority in which the contrary has been categorically determined. In many of the cases it is broadly stated, as it was by Lord Campbell, that after conveyance rescission will not be granted for innocent misrepresentation. But, on examination of the facts in such cases, it is clear either that payment of the purchase money had been made or as in the case of a contract for a lease, Legge v Croker[43]; Milch v. Coburn[44], that all that the plaintiff seeking rescission was required by the contract to do had been done. On the other hand we find in the leading text books such statements as that\ncomplete execution on both sides must be established\u2014that the contract has been completely executed and exhausted on both sides;\n17 Hals. Laws of Eng., p. 742 and note (o); that the doctrine of the court of equity is that a contract for the sale of land will not be set aside for innocent misrepresentation \u201cafter it has been completed by conveyance and payment of the purchase money;\u201d Williams on Vendor and Purchaser (3rd ed.) p. 796; and again\ncompletion of the contract consists, on the part of the vendor in conveying with a good title the land sold and delivering up the actual possession or enjoyment thereof; on the purchaser\u2019s part it lies in accepting such title, preparing and tendering the conveyance for the vendor\u2019s execution, accepting such conveyance, taking possession and paying the price. Ibid pp. 545, 546.\nAfter a conveyance has been executed, the court will set aside a transaction only on the ground of actual fraud;\nKerr on Fraud, 5 ed., p. 407. Mr. Dart\u2019s statement of the rule, however, is that the principle on which courts of equity rescind contracts for innocent misrepresentation\ncould not be extended to the taking away after completion the price of the property, which at law had become absolutely the vendor\u2019s. * * * Misrepresentation is no ground for setting aside an executed contract.\nVendors and Purchasers (7 ed.) 808. Mr. Snell (Principles of Equity (18 ed.), p. 436) says\nthe contract cannot be avoided after conveyance of property has taken place thereunder.\nMorrison in his work on Rescission says (p. 143), that\nthe term \u201cexecuted contract\u201d is properly applied only when what has been performed is what was agreed to be performed. The foundation of the rule that an executed contract will not be rescinded for innocent misrepresentation appears to be somewhat obscure. In Angel v. Jay[45], Darling J. states, apparently without disapproval, the contention of counsel that \u201cthe foundation of the doctrine\u201d is that\nwhen property has passed the persons concerned cannot be placed in the same position as they were in before the estate became vested.\nIn numerous cases the vesting of the property has been referred to as a serious obstacle to rescission. In other cases the supersession of the contract for sale by the executed conveyance accepted by the purchaser and the resultant restriction of his rights to those assured by the latter instrument appears to be the ground upon which rescission of the contract after acceptance of conveyance is refused. So far does the court go in maintaining this doctrine that, where under a court sale the purchase money was still in court, the purchaser who had accepted the title and taken his conveyance was refused relief in respect of subsequently discovered incumbrances. Thomas v. Powell[46]; McCulloch v. Gregory[47].\nIn the case now before us it is probably unnecessary to determine the effect on the right of a purchaser to rescission of his acceptance of a conveyance and taking of possession without making payment. What might have been a formidable obstacle to the granting of rescission to the defendants was suggested by the trial judge, namely, the inability of the court to compel the landlord\u2019s assent to a re-assignment of the leasehold to the plaintiff. The effect of the acceptance of the conveyance assented to by the lessor and of the taking of possession of the property by the defendants may have been to give to the lessor rights against them as tenants the relinquishment of which the court could not exact.\nAlthough the execution of the contract does not afford an answer to a claim for rescission in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation, inability to effect restitutio in integrum, unless that has become impossible owing to action of the wrong-doer, will ordinarily preclude rescission. Kerr on Fraud (5 ed.) 387-90. A fortiori is this the case where inno- cent misrepresentation only is relied upon. See, however, Lagunas Nitrate Co. v. Lagunas Syndicate[48] for an instance of circumstances under which the court will grant relief in a case of fraud which it would withhold if fraud were not established. But\nthe court has full power to make all just allowances * * * the practice has always been for a Court of Equity to give relief by way of rescission whenever by the exercise of its powers it can do what is practically just, though it cannot restore the parties precisely to the state they were in before the contract.\nHulton v. Hulton[49].\nHere, however, neither the impossibility of restitutio in integrum nor the intervention of a jus tertii has been pleaded by the plaintiff, as it should have been if she meant to rely upon it either by way of reply to the defence or of defence to the counter-claim. Had that issue been raised on the pleadings the defendants might have produced at the trial and tendered for the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance a reassignment of the lease duly assented to by the landlord or other satisfactory assurance that such assent would be forthcoming; or, if not, a judgment might have been pronounced in terms similar to those of the decree made in Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd[50]; Twigg v. Greenizen.[51]\nBut I strongly incline to the view that, while the acceptance of the cheque as payment was in this sense conditional that, if it should be dishonoured, the right to sue for the money due under the contract would revive, the transaction was, nevertheless, intended to be closed and the contract completely executed so far as the purchasers were concerned by their taking of the deed and the keys and handing over the cheque. They had obtained the full consideration for which they contracted and, if the vendor saw fit to accept the cheque they tendered in payment in lieu of cash, they should not be heard to say that the contract had not been fully executed. I cannot think that the vendor\u2019s right to have the contract treated as executed and completed can be defeated by the fact that she took a cheque as the equivalent of a cash payment, and still less by the accident that the cheque was not presented for pay- ment during the two days which intervened between the closing of the sale and the stopping of payment. Bearing in mind the well established custom of solicitors with regard to the closing of sales of real estate, when delivery of conveyance and possession was given and accepted and a cheque (then good) for the purchase money was tendered and taken, what was performed was what the parties intended should be done when they contracted.\nWithout, therefore, necessarily affirming the position taken in the judgment of the majority of the learned judges of the Appellate Divisional Court, I am of the opinion that, under all the circumstances of this case, the contract for sale was executed and that, according to a well settled rule in equity, rescission for innocent misrepresentation is not an available remedy for the defendants.\nI am clearly of the opinion, however, that a new trial must be directed because the issue of fraud was not properly presented to the jury. In substance the learned trial judge charged that, in order to establish fraud, the defendants must show that Wing actually knew his representations were false. He did not tell the jury that the representations would be fraudulent if they were false and were made without belief in their truth, or recklessly, careless whether they were true or false. Derry v. Peek[52]; Angus v. Clifford [53]. Wing denied having made the statement that the house was lighted by electricity and added that he \u201cdid not know how it was lighted.\u201d The jury found that he had made the statement. If adequately instructed, or if a properly framed question had been submitted to them, they might have found that it had been fraudulently made. The only questions put on this branch of the case read as follows:\nDid Mrs. Nesbitt\u2019s agent, Wing, knowingly make any untrue statements as to the house or its contents for the purpose of deceiving the defendants in any material way and inducing them to make the offer to purchase? And did they make the offer relying upon such statements?\nIn charging the jury the learned judge said to them\nwas there a deliberate lie told by Wing? * * * You have to decide whether Wing deliberately told an untruth in order to earn a commission.\nThere was no qualification of this direction. He added, what the defendants are entitled to will depend on your answers to the questions as to whether there was deliberate intention to defraud or innocent misrepresentation. The word \u201cinnocent\u201d is used in law to convey \u201cnot knowingly,\u201d and it may be that she should not be relieved from her bargain, but if there was intent, and an untrue statement made, there might be relief.\nAt the close of the charge to the question of a juror,\nthe one question we have to decide is whether the mis-statements that it is claimed were made, were made intentionally or not?\nthe learned judge replied \u201cYes.\u201d\nThe Appellate Divisional Court refused the defendants relief on this branch of the case because \u201cno objection was made to the charge\u201d on this ground, and because\nthe finding that the misrepresentations were innocent implies that they were not made recklessly careless of whether they were true or false.\nHad the jury been properly instructed upon the distinction between innocent and fraudulent misrepresentation their finding that the misrepresentations had been innocent would, no doubt, cover the ground. But how can that be said in view of the explicit instruction given them that \u201cthe word \u2018innocent\u2019 is used in law to convey \u2018not knowingly\u2019\u201d and that only a deliberate and intentional lie would justify a finding that the misrepresentations had been fraudulent?\nAt the close of the evidence the trial judge handed to counsel the questions he proposed to submit to the jury. Thereupon the following discussion ensued, Mr. Grant representing the defendants:\nMr. Grant: They were made intentionally, my Lord, but whether they were intentionally fraudulent or wrong is another question.\nHis Lordship: I will leave out those words. I have divided the case first as to whether there was intention to deceive the defendants, and secondly, innocent misrepresentations, which may have the effect of giving the defendant what you want, or may not.\nMr. Grant: I would suggest that you put it: \u201cWere there untrue statements made by Wing, whether intentional or not, which induced the making of the contract?\u201d\nThen: \u201cWere there any statements made by Wing that were untrue, that he knew to be untrue, or which he made without caring whether they were true or false, to induce the contract?\u201d\nI think that would be a better form in which to put the questions, if I may so suggest, my Lord.\nHis Lordship: No; there must be intention in an action for deceit.\nMr. Grant: No, my Lord; there need not be intention. If he makes the statements recklessly, not caring whether they were true or false, it is as fraudulent as though he knew they were false. Perhaps after your Lordship has charged the jury on that point, we may have something to say. His Lordship: In the meantime I think I have covered the case.\nMr. Grant: Your Lordship is putting the first question as to whether the statements were fraudulent or not?\nHis Lordship: Yes.\nMr. Grant: And, secondly, whether they were innocently made, although untrue?\nHis Lordship: I do not use the word \u201cfraudulently\u201d because the jury does not know the exact meaning of \u201cfraudulently\u201d but they do know the meaning of \u201cintentionally.\u201d\nThe attention of the trial judge was thus pointedly drawn to the feature of fraudulent misrepresentation which his question did not cover. Counsel expressly asked that it should be covered. The learned judge distinctly stated his view that intention to deceive was essential and impliedly that a false statement made with reckless carelessness as to its truth or falsehood would not be fraudulent. He declined to amend the questions as suggested, stating that he had \u201ccovered\u201d the case.\nCounsel is not obliged to quarrel with the judge or to press an objection ad nauseam. Having stated his position and his request for the submission of a proper question having been refused Mr. Grant had, I think, sufficiently discharged his duty and was not called upon to renew the same objection at the close of the charge. The learned judge had definitely expressed his purpose to adhere to an adverse view of the law. Lex neminem coget ad vana seu inutilia. The refusal to put to the jury the question whether Wing\u2019s statements were made without caring whether they were true or false coupled with the instruction that, although so made, they were innocent and not fraudulent, unless there was an intention to deceive\u2014to tell a deliberate lie\u2014was clearly misdirection and entitles the defendants to a new trial. Lynam v. Dublin United Tramways Co[54]; Brenner v. Toronto Railway[55].\nWhile the costs of the abortive trial may properly abide the result, I see no good reason why the appellants should not have their costs in this court and the Appellate Division.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I am of opinion that a new trial must be ordered in this case for the reasons fully stated by my brother Anglin, whose carefully prepared judgment I have had the advantage of reading.\nThe point to be determined in the new trial is whether Wing, the respondent\u2019s agent, was guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation of material facts in connection with the purchase by the appellants of the respondent\u2019s cottage on the island in Toronto bay. These misrepresentations would be fraudulent if made\nknowingly, or without belief in their truth, or recklessly, careless whether they be true or false.\nPer Lord Herschell in Derry v. Peek[56]. See also the distinction made by Lindley L.J., in Angus v. Clifford[57], between a representation made carelessly and a representation made recklessly.\nUnfortunately the learned trial judge left the jury under the impression that to be fraudulent the misrepresentations had be to be made wilfully and without belief in their truth, in other words that Wing deliberately lied when he made them. Where misrepresentations are made recklessly, with indifference whether they be true or false, they are fraudulent and this was not explained to the jury. On the contrary, there was, if I may say so with great respect, a confusion between innocent and fraudulent misrepresentation, of a nature to mislead the jury, when the learned trial judge said to them:\nWhat the defendants are entitled to will depend upon your answer to the questions as to whether there was deliberate intention to defraud, or innocent misrepresentation. The word \u201cinnocent\u201d is used in law to convey \u201cnot knowingly,\u201d and it may be that she should not be relieved from her bargain, but if there was intent, and an untrue statement made, there might be relief. However, that is not for you to say. We will deal with that problem when you return with your answers.\nThe questions put to the jury were also misleading. The first question was whether Wing had knowingly made an untrue statement as to the house and its contents, and the answer was no. The third question was whether Wing had made untrue statements without knowing that they were untrue, and the answer was yes. The fourth question was: \u201cIf so, what were such innocent misrepresentations?\u201d This was assuming that unless Wing knowingly made an untrue statement as to the house and its contents, his misrepresentation was an innocent one.\nIn my opinion, the transaction was a fully completed one, and therefore rescission cannot be granted unless the misrepresentations were fraudulent, but the burden of the appellants was unduly increased when the jury were told that they must find that \u201cthere was a deliberate intention to defraud\u201d to prevent the misrepresentations from being innocent. This was misleading because if the jury were of opinion that Wing had recklessly, that is to say with indifference to the truth or falsity of his statements, misrepresented the facts which the jury found were misrepresented, they could not answer that these misrepresentations were innocent.\nI therefore conclude that the issue in the new trial must be whether Wing\u2019s misrepresentations were fraudulent in the sense I have explained. If, properly instructed, the jury still find that Wing\u2019s misrepresentations were innocent the appellants cannot succeed in their demand for rescission. If, on the contrary, the appellants succeed because the jury find that the misrepresentations were fraudulent they will have to reconvey the property and obtain the lessor\u2019s consent to the reconveyance.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the appellate court, the costs of the abortive trial to abide the event.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

Katzman.\u201d Mrs. K. who signed had no interest in the property but her husband had. A sale was effected and in an action by the broker for his commission:\u2014\nHeld, that parol evidence was not admissible to contradict the statement in the document as to ownership by showing that Mrs. K. in signing it was acting as agent of her husband.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondent.\nThe only question for decision on this appeal is whether or not there was a memo in writing signed by the party to be charged or his agent sufficient to satisfy the addition made in 1916 to the Ontario Statute of Frauds. The trial judge allowed evidence to be admitted to show that Mrs. Katzman who signed the memo did so as agent of her husband the appellant, which would be sufficient if established. The appellant contends that such evidence should not have been received. F. Davis for the appellant referred to Keighley v. Durant; Barry v. Stoney Point Canning Co.\nZeron for the respondent cited Toulmin v. Millar[1]; Stratton v. Vachon[2].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed. I concur in the reasons for so doing stated by my brothers Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an action to recover a commission claimed by the respondent by way of remuneration for the sale of real estate.\nThe action falls within section 13 of the Ontario Statute of Frauds, as amended by the addition of said section in 6 Geo. V, [1916], c. 24, sec. 19, which reads as follows:\u2014\nNo action shall be brought to charge any person for the payment of a commission or other remuneration for the sale of real property unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\nThe only writing presented herein and claimed by the respondent to comply with said provision is a listing of the property in question, which reads as follows:\u2014\nDescription of property to be sold by Ownahome Realty Construction, King George Hotel.\nPrice, $125.000.\nCash, $25,000.\n$3,000 every 6 months.\n40 Rooms.\nSize of Lot, 60 by 130.\n2 Stores on Sandwich, Bar on corner, 1 on Goyeau.\nRents now at $12,000.\n(On back of card).\nOwner\u2019s name, Mrs. B. Katzman.\nProperty for sale at Sandwich St. at Goyeau.\nAddress, 24 Hall Ave. Border Cities, 7th June, 1921.\nIn the event of the Ownahome Realty finding a purchaser for the property described herein, I agree to pay them a commission of 3 per cent. on the selling price.\nB. Katzman.\nThe signature is that of the wife of appellant whose full name is \u201cMorris Katzman\u201d and her\u2019s is \u201cBecky Katzman.\u201d\nThis was given without any authority from the husband who is sued herein along with one Orechkin and the said wife of appellant. It is to be observed that she therein professes to be owner and in fact contracts in no other sense.\nShe is clearly proven not to have been the owner of any interest therein, and her husband to have only owned an equity therein along with said Orechkin. Some expressions used in the evidence might lead one to believe that he and Orechkin were equally interested and others indicate that they were not equally interested.\nIt is quite clear that they had only an equity altogether of about sixty thousand dollars in said property, and that she had no interest whatever in the property.\nFrom the fact that this action was brought, as the result of a search in the Registry Office, after the property had been conveyed to one Davis, it seems that the respondent was rather puzzled to know who had become under any such obligation as it sets up in regard to it.\nI assume that, as has been held under the Statute of Frauds, a principal may, under immediately attendant or preceding circumstances leading up to the signature of such a contract as falls within the meaning of the statute as amended by the new section, be held to have signed by an agent.\nBut I can find, after diligent search, no decision which converts a contract made by any one pretending to sell as his or her own, as this contract clearly does, into a contract by the actual owners.\nThe pretence that this contract was so converted by the acts of the husband, or of him and the other joint owner, seems to me to be without any foundation in law.\nAnd still more remote from giving any legal operation under said statute as against the appellant is the reliance by respondent upon what transpired between the respondent, the appellant and one Molley leading ultimately, respondent alleges, to a sale to one Davis.\nThe respondent had, some weeks after the signing of the above quoted contract with it by the appellant\u2019s wife, discovered that the said Molley lived in and owned an apartment house in Detroit, on the opposite side of the river, which he was disposed to exchange for the hotel now in question.\nRespondent\u2019s managing agent, Pyne, induced the appellant and Orechkin, his joint owner, to accompany him to look at said apartment house, and consider it on an exchange basis. Having done so they at once decided against the said proposal and all connected therewith. Some weeks or a month later Molley, who it is alleged, besides being engaged in looking after his said apartment house, ran a theatre or something of that kind, mentioned this incident to one Davis, a large real estate owner on both sides of the river who had employed Molley to assist him in his affairs.\nThe mention of it to Davis seems to have set him thinking that he might by trading some of his properties acquire from appellant and Orechkin their King George hotel now in question. Ultimately Davis made such a deal with them, and some months later the respondent\u2019s managing agent heard of it and conceived the idea that as result thereof he could rest an action thereon.\nThe said Davis had died we are told before this action came to trial and Molley was not called as a witness, and the evidence of Molley\u2019s proposal and the resultant report thereof is relied upon for the conclusions sought to bring this case within the principles acted upon in the cases of Toulmin v. Millar[3], and Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries[4].\nI cannot see any resemblance between the meagre facts presented herein and those respectively acted upon in said cases cited to us.\nI cannot see how or why, as held by the learned trial judge herein, the agent\u2019s act in each case was, by what he did, the efficient cause of the sale, or more correctly on the facts, the mere use by Davis of the knowledge of what was going on, can be said to have been an efficient cause produced by the respondent, upon the facts presented as bringing about the exchange and entitling it to claim compensation.\nMoreover I am not prepared to hold, in face of the requirements of the statute above quoted, such remote and far from being necessary results of the respondent\u2019s acts as within the meaning of the said Act\u2019s requirements, even if the above quoted contract of the appellant\u2019s wife could have been looked at otherwise than I have set forth above. Independently of a written contract by the seller with the agent there is nothing in all that is relied upon to render appellant liable.\nI therefore am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the respondent\u2019s action be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I think Mr. Davis\u2019 point is well taken that the memorandum of the 22nd February, 1922, cannot avail the respondent in answer to the objection based upon the statute (6 Geo. V, c. 24, sec. 19). Mrs. Katzman in the memorandum describes herself as the proprietor because the property which was the subject of the arrangement is described as \u201cmy property.\u201d The respondent cannot allege that Mrs. Katzman was signing as the agent of her husband without contradicting the statement implied in this description, that she is the owner of the property for which the agent is to find a purchaser. Formby Bros. v. Formby[5].\nThe objection having been raised for the first time at this stage, I think there should be no costs of the appeal to the Appellate Division.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff (respondent) seeks to recover from the defendant (appellant), Morris Katzman, a commission on the sale for $115,000 of an hotel property in the city of Windsor to one John Davis, a resident of the city of Detroit. The property in question belonged to the appellant and one Jake Orechkin. In addition to asserting that action by the plaintiff was not the efficient cause of the sale being brought about, the defendant invokes the protection of the statute 6 Geo. V (1916), c. 24, sec. 19, as amended by 8 Geo. V (1918), c. 20, s. 58, whereby there was added to section 13 of the R.S.O. 1914, c. 102, the following clause:\nNo action shall be brought to charge any person for the payment of commission or other remuneration for the sale of real property unless the agreement upon which said action shall be brought shall be in writing separate from the sale agreement, and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\nTo meet the requirements of this section the appellant produces the following contract: Description of property to be sold by Ownahome Realty Construction, King George Hotel.\nPrice, $125.000.\nCash, $25,000.\n$3,000 every 6 months.\n40 Rooms.\nSize of Lot, 60 by 130.\nTwo stores on Sandwich, Bar on corner, 1 on Goyeau.\nRents now at $12,000.\n(On back of card).\nOwner\u2019s name, Mrs. B. Katzman.\nProperty for sale at Sandwich St. at Goyeau.\nAddress, 24 Hall Ave.\nBorder Cities, 7th June, 1921.\nIn the event of the Ownahome Realty finding a purchaser for the property described hereon, I agree to pay them a commission of 3 per cent. on the selling price.\nB. Katzman.\nThe learned trial judge held that Morris Katzman had authorized his wife, Becky Katzman, to sign the document which I have quoted, that she did in fact sign it and that her doing so was subsequently ratified by her husband. Subject to a question of law as to the possibility of ratification by an undisclosed principal of an act which his agent has purported to do not as agent but as principal, these findings of fact appear to be sufficiently supported by evidence; but in any event, in the view I take of the appeal, they need not be questioned.\nIt will be noted that in the contract produced and sued upon Mrs. Becky Katzman describes herself as the owner of the property\u2014\u201cOwner\u2019s name, Mrs. Becky Katzman.\u201d In addition to signing the document in her own name without any indication that in doing so she was acting as agent for her husband, she expressly purported to contract for payment of the commission as owner of the property to be sold, thus distinctly negativing such agency. Under these circumstances I am of the opinion that parol evidence was not admissible to shew that she was in fact contracting as agent for her husband; Humble v. Hunter[6]; Formby Bros. v. Formby[7]. Such evidence would necessarily tend to contradict a material statement in the writing in which the contract is embodied and upon which the plaintiff must rely to satisfy the statute. I am therefore of the opinion that the contract produced does not satisfy the requirements of the statute so as to enable the plaintiff to maintain this action as against the present appellant, Morris Katzman.\nThe action was originally brought against Morris Katzman, Jake Orechkin and Mrs. Morris Katzman. It was properly dismissed at the trial as against Orechkin, no attempt having been made to shew agency for him on the part of Mrs. Katzman. Judgment was given against the two Katzmans. In the Divisional Court the plaintiff was put to its election whether it would treat Mrs. Katzman as a principal or as an agent for her husband in making the contract for commission. Desiring to hold Morris Katzman it determined to treat his wife as agent in the transaction. The appeal of the defendant, Mrs. Morris (Becky) Katzman, was accordingly allowed and the action against her dismissed, the judgment against her husband being maintained. This may have been a misfortune for the respondent as its present failure to succeed as against Morris Katzman may leave it without redress in respect of a commission for which it might possibly otherwise have been entitled to hold Mrs. Katzman personally liable.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The respondent could not bring its action against the appellant claiming a commission for the sale of real property, unless there was an agreement in writing to pay it, separate from the sale agreement, and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. 6 Geo. V (Ont.) c. 24, sec. 19, as amended by 8 Geo. V, c. 20, sec. 58.\nThe agreement on which the respondent\u2019s right to bring this action is based is however signed not by the appellant but by the latter\u2019s wife who describes herself and signs as owner of the property to be sold.\nThe learned trial judge nevertheless found on parol evidence that the appellant authorized his wife to sign the agreement as his agent and subsequently expressly ratified her act. He gave judgment for the respondent and his judgment was unanimously affirmed by the Second Appellate Divisional Court of Ontario.\nThe appellant, for the first time, raised the objection in this court that the respondent cannot by parol evidence contradict the agreement in writing produced by it in support of its action and shew that the appellant\u2019s wife made this contract on the appellant\u2019s behalf.\nTo my regret, because this objection should have been made earlier, I find myself constrained to hold that it is well taken. In other words, where a plaintiff produces and relies upon an agreement which was entered into by a third person as principal, parol evidence is not admissible to shew that such person contracted merely as the defendant\u2019s agent. Humble v. Hunter[8]; Formby Brothers v. Formby[9].\nThere is no possible doubt that the appellant\u2019s wife signed the agreement as principal, and only by contradicting it could the respondent establish its right of action against the appellant. This it cannot do.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the respondent\u2019s action dismissed with costs. No costs to either party in the Appellate Divisional Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davis & Healy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Zeron & McPhee.\n[1] 58 L.T. 96.\n[2] 44 Can.

Raymond v. Bosanquet (59 Can. S.C.R. 452) dist.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (53 Ont. L.R. 266) affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] affirming with a variation as to the damages, the judgment at the trial in favour of the respondents.\nJust after dusk on the 18th day of September, A.D. 1921, the respondents, Dr. George Clinton, his wife Lillie M. Clinton, and their daughter Jean M. Clinton, travelling in a Ford coupe driven by the doctor, fell into a small gully or ditch over which was a culvert or bridge, on a road maintained by the County of Hastings, and under its jurisdiction. The culvert or bridge has a length of about 11 feet, and a driving width of about 12 feet, being about the same width as the via trita adjoining it on either end.\nThe culvert rests on stone abutments built up from the bottom of the ditch upon which are placed beams or stringers, and on these is laid a plank floor with a second plank floor on top. On each side of the culvert floor are secured wheel guards consisting of beams 6 inches by 6 inches, between which is the driving space. The perpendicular bank of the gully was concealed by small shrubs growing at the edge and from the bottom of the gully.\nThe doctor was driving very cautiously and when he was a short distance west of the culvert he saw by their lights that cars were coming towards him from around the slight bend in the road. He thereupon turned off the travelled portion of the road almost entirely on to the level grass and proceeded very slowly until the two cars passed him. At this point he was about 30 feet, or a little more, from the culvert. He was proceeding slowly and very cautiously back to the roadway when he came to the culvert or bridge, which he did not see and of which he was entirely unaware. The wheels on the right side of the coupe failed to gain the floor of the culvert securely, if at all, and the car dropped flat on its right side to the bottom of the gully, about five feet below, and lay parallel with the culvert, the left wheels being approximately at the south edge of the culvert.\nThe occupants of the car were all badly injured, the daughter especially so. Separate actions were brought against the county and each plaintiff was given damages. The Appellate Division sustained the judgment and increased the amount awarded to the daughter.\nTilley K.C. and Mikel K.C. for the appellant. The municipality cannot be expected to keep all its roads in the same state of repair. The nature of the country, the character of the roads and various other matters must be taken into account. Castor v. Uxbridge[2] per Harrison C.J. And see Delaney v. City of Toronto[3]; Wilson v. Lambton[4].\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and F.E. O\u2019Flynn for the respondent referred to Foley v. Township of Flamborough[5]; Kelly v. Township of Carrick[6]; Homewood v. City of Hamilton[7].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014At the close of the argument in this appeal I entertained grave doubts of the appellant\u2019s liability. A subsequent reading of the evidence and the record did not result in the removal of my doubts.\nI do not feel, however, that the judgment appealed from is so clearly wrong that I would be justified in reversing it, and for this reason I will not dissent from the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondents sued the appellant county, which had for forty years or more assumed jurisdiction over the road in question, and was, at the time here in question, responsible therefor, to recover damages they respectively had suffered by reason of the motor car in which they were driving having capsized over the side of a bridge on said road five or six feet above the bottom of the creek or gully it crossed. It was a running brook but dry at seasons. The bridge was about sixteen feet in length, and in width of roadway over it about twelve to fourteen feet. There never had been erected thereon at either side thereof any hand railing, such as an engineer of long experience testifies it should have had, two or three feet high\u2019 with projecting wings on the sides of the road beyond the bridge to warn and protect travellers. Indeed common sense alone, and what it usually dictates, would seem to me to have required appellant to furnish such protection. Calling this bridge, five to six feet high, a culvert, I respectfully submit, cannot change its real character.\nThe only pretence of such a guard was what appellant\u2019s counsel call a \u201cwheel guard,\u201d consisting of a scantling six inches by four, nailed to the planks on top of the bridge, about a foot on either side thereof, and about a foot from the end of the planks covering the bridge. This six by four-inch scantling was probably nailed with the six-inch side to the floor of the bridge.\nThere was thus left about twelve feet of road to travel upon across the said bridge.\nMr. Justice Mowat the learned trial judge, on the invitation of counsel for the parties concerned, after the evidence was all in went with them to see and inspect said bridge and all relative thereto that could enable him to appreciate, correctly, the said evidence.\nThe immense advantage he thereby had, I respectfully submit, is, or ought to be held, hard to overcome.\nIn a full and able judgment dealing with all the points raised before him, and here, the learned trial judge concluded that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the respondents, or either of them, and that there was evidence, as given by said engineer, of negligence on the part of the appellant, and gave judgment for each of the respondents and assessed their respective damages.\nOn appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario that judgment was maintained save as to the assessment of damages to be allowed a daughter of the other respondents which were increased by adding $6,000 to what the learned trial judge allowed.\nFrom this finding Mr. Justice Masten dissented as to the question of the responsibility of the appellant but, if responsible at all, agreeing with the majority of the court that the increased damages to the daughter should be allowed.\nIn his dissenting judgment he cites a large number of Ontario cases having little resemblance to this and of which but two came to this court and would bind us, one being Raymond v. Bosanquet[8].\nIn regard thereto the circumstances there in question were quite distinguishable from those in question herein, and turned largely on the contributory negligence of those for whom the appellant there was responsible. Indeed it turned largely, if not entirely, upon questions of fact and I assented with much doubt, and I see two of my brother judges did also.\nWe must be sure of our facts before overruling a court below.\nIn the other case of Magill v. Township of Moore[9], which came here and is relied upon by Mr. Justice Masten, I dissented here, but the circumstances in evidence, I respectfully submit, as any one reading the case must see, did not turn upon anything like what is involved herein, but were complicated by the actions of a local telephone company.\nI agree with the finding of facts by the learned trial judge save as to those bearing upon the assessment of damages due the daughter respondent herein, and with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Rose, writing the chief judgment of the majority in the court of appeal below, relevant to the facts in question herein and the increasing of damages already referred to.\nI must therefore hold that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The very fact that the accident which occurred befell a careful driver almost establishes a case of res ipsa loquitur in regard to the necessity for a wing fence or railing on the approach to the bridge where it happened and consequent negligence on the part of the county in failing to provide that safeguard. That such a guard would have prevented the accident seems reasonably clear. That it could have been provided at a comparatively small expense is conceded, although it is claimed that the expendi- ture involved in placing such fences at all places in the county where similar conditions exist would be considerable. Assuming that to be the case, however, the county cannot, on that account, be relieved if it was its duty to have furnished the guard suggested at the bridge in question.\nThe facts are fully and accurately stated by Mr. Justice Rose in delivering the judgment of the majority in the Appellate Divisional Court and it is quite needless to repeat them here. There is no ground for doubting that Dr. Clinton drove cautiously in approaching the bridge. It is certainly unquestionable that he did not see the 5-inch or 6-inch timber wheel-guard or kerb which lay along the outside. He could scarcely have failed to see a whitened wing fence or railing if placed along the approach to the bridge to mark the narrowing of the highway to the width of the bridge.\nOn the whole evidence I am of the opinion that the danger of some such accident as befell the plaintiffs would have been manifest to the officials in charge of the maintenance of the road had they given the situation such attention as it should have received. Fences along the sides of country highways at dangerous places are very familiar. Railings to mark any sharp narrowing of the travelable portion of the road are quite common where there is risk of vehicles passing from it to rough or dangerous ground. Wing fences guarding the approaches to bridges, especially where they are narrow, can be seen on almost any highway. After giving to all the facts in evidence much thought and consideration I am of the opinion that the approach to the bridge in question was not\nin such a reasonable state of repair that those requiring to use the road (might), using ordinary care, pass to and fro upon it in safety. Foley v. Township of East Flamborough[10];\nthat, on the contrary, a condition existed dangerous for persons travelling by night, which proper attention on the part of the overseers would have discovered and against which reasonable diligence on the part of the county authorities would have provided. The following language of Mr. Justice Teetzel in Kelly v. Township of Carrick[11], cited by counsel for the respondent, correctly states the law and is much in point:\u2014\nWhile it is difficult to define by any general proposition the exact extent of the obligation of municipal corporations to erect railings along their highways, a practical test is, whether there is a dangerous object or place so near to the line of travel as to make the use of the highway itself unsafe in the absence of a railing. If there is such an object or place so located, the municipality is bound to maintain sufficient guards to protect travellers from the dangers incident to it. Williams on Municipal Liability, pp. 190-194. In other words, a corporation is bound to erect barriers or railings where a dangerous place is in such close proximity to the travelled part of the highway as to make travelling upon it unsafe, whether by day or by night, in sunshine or storm.\nIt is not possible to define at what distance in feet or inches a dangerous place must be from the travelled part in order that it should be held to be in such close proximity that it must be guarded. It is in every case a practical question, to be determined by the good sense of the trial court, in the light of the evidence and of the principles of law applicable, whether the highway is or is not reasonably safe for public travel.\n* * *\nWith a quiet horse and in daylight, a traveller using ordinary care would not be in any peril from the unguarded embankment in question; but at night time, with a storm raging, the ground covered with snow, and the tracks obliterated, as they were on this occasion, I think a traveller would be in serious danger of driving over the embankment.\nIf the highway is dangerous under the above conditions, which are to be expected in this country\u2014and I think it is, although it may be free from danger in broad daylight, the corporation has failed in its duty.\nAs put by Mr. Justice Rose:\u2014\nToo much must have been taken for granted; too little consideration must have been given to the needs of travellers.\nI agree with that learned judge that\nthe trial judge who heard the witnesses and inspected the road was quite warranted in finding as he did, that the defendants were negligent, and that their negligence was the cause of the disaster.\nRaymond v. Bosanquet[12], much relied on by the appellants is clearly distinguishable on its facts. The accident there happened by day. Had that been the case here it would have been very difficult for the respondents to maintain that neglect of duty by the appellants was the cause of the injuries they sustained.\nI see no ground for interfering with the assessment of the damages made in the Divisional Court, which unanimously increased the amount awarded by the trial judge to Miss Jean Clinton, in whose case that learned judge had entirely omitted to take into account a most important element of loss. MIGNAULT J.\u2014The locus where the accident occurred can be briefly described.\nA country road leads up to a wooden bridge or culvert which spans a small ditch, five and a half feet deep. The road is practically level, including the part covered by grass on either side of the travelled portion. It is about forty feet wide, and the bridge is twelve feet in width, which is practically the width of the travelled part of the road or the via trita. The ditch, often dried up, has walls, or abutments on both sides made of rough stones on which the bridge rests, and which extend a small distance on either side of the bridge. The result is that the roadway, including the grassy portion, narrows down at the bridge from about forty feet to twelve feet. There was at the time of the accident a piece of scantling four by six inches on each side of the platform of the bridge. There was no railing on the bridge nor were there wing rails or fences along the side of the ditch. The advantage of having such wing rails or fences, especially when whitewashed so as to be visible at night, is obvious; and when as here a roadway crossed by a ditch is narrowed down where the ditch intersects to the width of a narrow bridge or culvert, and nothing shows that it is so narrowed, there is at night a danger that the driver of a carriage or automobile, unaware of the narrowing of the road, and unable to see the bridge and ditch on account of the darkness, may drive into the ditch and sustain injury. This danger is increased where, as is shown in this case, the bed and sides of the ditch are covered with bushes or shrubbery so that a person approaching the ditch, especially at night, might be unable to see the break in the roadway.\nSuch was the situation when on the evening of September 18th, 1921, between 7 and 8 o\u2019clock, the respondents, Dr. George Clinton, his wife, Lily Clinton, and his daughter, Miss Jean M. Clinton, approached this bridge in a Ford motor car which Dr. Clinton drove, the three sitting on the same seat and Dr. Clinton being to the left. Earlier in the day they had passed over this same road, which for some time had been used as a detour on account of repairs being made on the main highway. They had gone to Madoc and were returning from Madoc to Belleville where they resided. None of them knew that they were approaching a place where the roadway narrowed and where they had to cross a bridge. Their car lights were burning because it was almost dark, and they were proceeding cautiously, being on the look-out for a defective bridge which they had observed on the way to Madoc. When near the bridge, of the position of which he was unaware, Dr. Clinton saw the lights of two motor cars approaching from the direction of Belleville. Being a timid driver, instead of keeping to his half of the travelled portion of the road as was his right he drove partially on to the grassy part which, as I have said, was on the same level as the travelled part, and moving slowly he allowed the two cars to pass him. When they had gone he moved in a slanting direction so as to gradually come back on the via trita, but in so doing, not knowing that there was a bridge there, his right front wheel failed to get on to the bridge, or if it did it got outside the scantling and the car fell into the ditch, its right side down. All three respondents were badly injured, the greatest sufferer being Miss Clinton who was on the right side of the car.\nThe learned trial judge found that the bridge itself was in good condition but that it should have been guarded by a wing rail, indicating the narrowing of the roadway and the approach to the bridge. He therefore condemned the appellant to pay as damages $1,000 to Dr. Clinton, $600 to Mrs. Clinton, and $4,000 to Miss Clinton. It is proper here to state that Miss Clinton\u2019s claim was much the largest for, as the learned trial judge finds, she sustained a permanent injury to her right shoulder causing it to sink. This was a disfigurement and, as Miss Clinton had received a very expensive musical education and proposed to go on the concert stage, it was claimed that the accident would prevent her from following her chosen career.\nThe Appellate Divisional Court, Mr. Justice Masten dissenting, confirmed the award of damages as to Dr. and Mrs. Clinton, but increased the amount given to Miss Clinton from $4,000 to $10,000. Mr. Justice Masten, who dissented on the question of liability, agreed with the other members of the court that, if the appellant was liable, Miss Clinton was entitled to $10,000 for the injuries she suffered. It is from this judgment that the appellant appeals to this court on the ground, first, that there was no legal liability on its part for the accident, and secondly, that assuming liability existed Miss Clinton\u2019s damages should not have been increased.\nThe whole case was exhaustively and very ably argued, and we were furnished plans and photographs so that the contentions of the parties could be easily followed.\nIt is urged that Dr. Clinton and his co-plaintiffs are not entitled to succeed by reason of their contributory negligence. I need not consider whether Dr. Clinton\u2019s alleged contributory negligence would be an answer to the action of his wife and daughter, because I am of the opinion that Dr. Clinton was guilty of no such negligence. If anything he was too prudent, and as he was unaware of his proximity to the bridge, and as the learned trial judge believed him when he said he did not know there was a bridge there, although the car lights were burning I must hold that the plea of contributory negligence is not made out. He was within his rights in driving on to the grassy portion of the road to avoid an accident.\nOn the question of the liability of the appellant I have no hesitation in agreeing with the judgments of the two courts below. Notwithstanding the good condition of the bridge, as found by the learned trial judge, my opinion is that the situation where the road narrowed was a dangerous one at night, and that the appellant should have guarded against this danger by placing wing rails or a fence on the side of the ditch and leading up to the bridge, which being painted white or coloured white would have been visible at night and would have served as a warning of the approach to the bridge. This is very frequently done on country roads, and its necessity is illustrated by the present case.\nThe decision of this court in Raymond v. Township of Bosanquet[13], has been referred to.\nThere is, however, a difference between the two cases. In the Raymond Case13 the accident happened in broad daylight, and the driver of the car saw the turn in the road when several hundred yards away from the narrow bridge. It was shewn that a large number of cars crossed the bridge every day in perfect safety, and there was some ground for suspecting that the driver had approached what he knew to be a sharp turn in the road at an unreasonable rate of speed under the circumstances.\nIn this case it is quite possible that a person driving along this road during the daytime and seeing the bridge ahead would have no recourse against the county municipality had he failed to so drive his vehicle as to cross the bridge in safety. To such an accident the decision in the Raymond Case[14] could well be applied. But the situation is different at night. It does not follow that because a narrow bridge and a narrowing highway as it approaches a bridge may be perfectly safe for a reasonably careful driver in the daytime, they would not be dangerous during the night time to the same driver not seeing them in time to avoid an accident. I think that liability can be predicated here because the situation was a dangerous one after dark and the danger could have been easily guarded against by erecting a whitened railing or fence along the edge of the ditch leading up to the bridge. It is true that there might not have been a danger to a person travelling along the via trita even at night, but the situation was dangerous for a driver who, like Dr. Clinton, left the via trita to avoid a collision with crossing cars and in returning to it fell into the unguarded ditch. The expense of guarding such places would seem a trifling one when compared to the liability the appellant has incurred in this case, and without such a guard my opinion is that this road was not reasonably safe for travel at night.\nI am therefore of opinion that the judgments below should be affirmed on the question of liability.\nAs to the increased amount awarded to Miss Clinton by the appellate court, on the ground that the damages claimed by her for the loss of the career she proposed to follow were not too remote to be considered in an action of this kind, without in any way dissenting from the proposition laid down by Mr. Justice Rose in the appellate court it appears to me sufficient to say that no reason exists in the present case for departing from the practice of this court not to entertain appeals questioning the quantum of damages.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mikel & Alford.\nSolicitors for the respondents: O\u2019Flynn, Diamond & O\u2019Flynn.\n[1] 53 Ont.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nLeon Prescesky (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1923: November 19, 20; 1923: December 4.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nNegligence\u2014Railway\u2014Level crossing\u2014Absence of statutory signals\u2014 Proper lookout\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Questions for the jury.\nIn an action against a railway company for injuries sustained through a collision of appellant's train with respondent's automobile at a railway crossing, it was established that appellant failed to give the statutory signals; and the respondent declared in his evidence that if the whistle had been sounded and the bell rung, he would have heard and thus avoided the accident. He also detailed circumstances which led to his not giving greater attention to the possibility of a train coming. The trial judge found negligence on the part of appellant but withdrew the case from the jury and dismissed the action on the ground that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in not keeping a proper lookout for approaching trains. On appeal, a new trial was ordered.\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that, it was a question for the jury to determine, having regard to all the circumstances, whether there was a reasonable excuse for the respondent's failure to perceive the approach of the train by which he was injured.\nCanadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Smith (62 Can. S.C.R. 134) and Canadian National Railways v. Clark ([1923] S.C.R. 730) discussed.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1923] 2 W.W.R. 1141) affirmed, Davies C.J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge which had dismissed the respondent's action and ordering a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and D. O. Owens for the appellant. A person crossing a level railway crossing must act as a reasonable person should act and not attempt to cross without looking for an approaching train; and where the evidence is conclusive that he did not look, the trial judge is justified in withdrawing the case from the jury, on the ground of contributory negligence.\nP. Makaroff for the respondent. It is within the province of the jury to determine whether the negligence of the plaintiff or the defendant was the direct and effective cause of the accident.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and D. O. Owens for the appellant.\nP. Makaroff for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014As a majority of this court has dismissed this appeal and determined that a new trial must be had, I will refrain from discussing at any length the facts as proved at the trial already had.\nThe learned trial judge nonsuited the plaintiff at the close of his case on his own evidence to the effect that he had driven on to the railway crossing for eighty yards before reaching it without looking along the track to see if any train was approaching from the eastward, that is in the direction the plaintiff was travelling, toward the crossing. Plaintiff stated that at about this distance of eighty yards from the crossing he had looked eastwardly along the tracks and did not see any train and that he had not looked afterwards. The evidence was that the nearer he approached the crossing the further along the track he could see and that if he had looked he could and would have seen the train from many places in the road between the eighty yards where he says he did look and the crossing itself.\nThe substantial question to be determined at the close of the plaintiff's case was whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in not having so looked before attempting to pass over the level crossing.\nI have gone very carefully into the evidence and have reached the conclusion that in so neglecting to look for an: approaching train along these eighty yards he was clearly guilty of such negligence as contributed to the accident on the crossing from the train crashing into his auto; and that there was nothing in the evidence which would excuse the neglect of this plain duty of looking and no evidence from which the jury could find such excuse.\nI would, therefore, allow this appeal concurring with the nonsuit granted by the learned trial judge and his reasons for granting it.\nIdington J.\u2014This action was brought by the respondent against the appellant for damages to himself and his automobile, Which he was driving, and in which he was alone, when struck by a special train of the appellant at the intersection of the appellant's railway and the public highway on which respondent was travelling.\nThe action was rested upon the failure of the appellant to either ring the bell or blow the whistle, as required by statute to do when approaching a public highway.\nThe respondent swore that neither was done and that when he was approaching the said crossing he looked towards the east along the railway, saw no train and, owing to the angle of his approach he was facing westerly rather more than if approaching the railway at right angles, and that the regular train from the west was due about that time and, owing to the growth of trees and shrubs, and the shape of the land alongside the railway track to the west (and the train likely to come therefrom) it required close attention watching for the said train.\nThere was, according to the evidence, only one train a day each way and the one from the west passed the point in question about nine o'clock in the forenoon, and the other, going westerly, about five o'clock in the afternoon.\nCounsel for respondent, if I understood him correctly, said that indeed there was only one of these trains each day.\nThis part of appellant's road seems to be a branch line far north and over which there is not much traffic.\nThe respondent had lived near the point in question for five or six years and knew the condition of things I have just adverted to, and hence paid more attention to the probabilities of a train coming from the west than the possibilities of a special train coming from the east at that time of day.\nI cannot see how he was blameworthy for so doing.\nUnfortunately there was a special train from the east coming at a higher rate of speed than usual on that road, carrying only the engine with its tender, and a single coach; and respondent, depending upon such a possibility giving due warning, according to statute, was thus taken unawares.\nThe learned trial judge upon motion for a nonsuit granted same and refused to submit the case to the jury. It was eminently a case for the jury to have passed upon.\nHence the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan unanimously reversed that ruling and directed a new trial, costs of the first to abide the event.\nFrom that decision the appellant has appealed to this court.\nI agree in all essential features with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Martin writing the judgment for said court, and therefore am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs here and in said Court of Appeal.\nThe respondent submits, by way of cross-appeal, that the costs of the last trial should be allowed also instead of being made to abide the event.\nIn a case of this kind, I respectfully submit, that the proper course is to try it out (subject to the motion for non-suit) and thus avoid the costs of a new trial and, as is often done by the learned trial judge who can, if clearly holding that the plaintiff must, by reason of contributory negligence, fail, at the close enter judgment for the defendant and trust to the appellate courts finally determining all involved therein.\nI would therefore, seeing counsel for appellant pressed for the contrary course, allow said cross-appeal.\nRepeated trials are undesirable, and can be avoided by the method I have suggested in such cases as this; and especially when as I respectfully submit they often come so close to the line as apparent in the recent cases of The Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Smith[2], and Canadian National Railways v. Clark[3], recently decided by this court.\nDuff J.\u2014It is necessary, in my judgment, that there should be a new trial in this case. It is, of course, important to avoid unnecessary comment upon the facts. It will be sufficient to say, I think, that in my opinion the point for decision on the appeal put concretely cannot be better stated than in the argument of Mr. McCarthy. The question is this: Was there in the facts which the jury was entitled to find on the evidence anything which the jury, acting judicially, might consider to be a reasonable excuse for the failure of the respondent to see the approaching train? The infrequency of traffic on the line, the fact that the respondent's attention was fastened on the possibility of the approach of a train which was expected in the usual course from the west and the respondent's statement that he actually listened for the statutory signals were circumstances which I think should not have been withheld from the jury.\nThere is some misapprehension, I think, a misapprehension which to me, I must admit, is unaccountable, of the purport of the decision in Smith's Case2. In that case the evidence adduced by the plaintiff himself established conclusively that if the plaintiff had given his attention to the matter at all he must have seen the train by which he was struck, a train which he knew would by the usual rule be passing at that time. As to excuse for failing to look, there was no suggestion of an excuse in the respondent's own evidence. It was suggested by his counsel that his attention was distracted by the horn of a motor following him, which indeed, was blown for the purpose of awakening his attention to his surroundings and the danger he was running into. This suggestion had no support in the respondent's own testimony and was not one to which, in the opinion of the majority of the court, the jury, acting judicially, could, in view of the undisputed facts and the respondent's silence upon the point, have given effect by holding the circumstances to constitute a reasonable excuse for the respondent's conduct.\nIn Clark's Case[4], on the other hand, the respondent stated that as he approached the railway track, which was hidden by a bluff, knowing a train was due to pass about that time, he listened for the bell and the whistle and looked for the smoke, and that hearing nothing and seeing nothing, he surmounted the bluff with the conviction that the train was not approaching. These circumstances, in the opinion of the court, were circumstances which might properly be considered by the jury in the inquiry whether or not there was a reasonable excuse for the failure of the respondent to see the train by which he was injured.\nThe elaborate discussion of facts in such cases as this does, no doubt, involve some risk of evidence being shaped to fit into the frame of some headnote or dictum; but questions of credibility are peculiarly for the jury, and such evidence as that given in Clark's Case4 and in this case cannot properly be withheld from them by the trial judge.\nAnglin J.\u2014For the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Martin when delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal with costs, merely adding a reference to the language of Lord Sumner in The King v. Broad[5], and to the recent judgment of this court in Canadian National Railways v. Clark4.\nThe costs here were not materially increased by the plaintiff's cross-appeal in regard to the disposition made by the Court of Appeal of the costs of the abortive trial. While the cross-appeal must be dismissed, I think it may properly be without costs.\nMignault J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal without costs for the reasons stated by my brother Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Borland & McIntyre.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Makaroff & Bates.\n[1] [1923] 2 W.W.R. 1141.\n[2] [1921] 62 Can.

Shields Deceased (Defendant) Respondent.\n1923: November 15; 1923: December 4.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nStatute of Limitations\u2014Possession of land\u2014Interruption\u2014Proceedings for partition\u2014Declaratory judgment.\nIn 1916 proceedings were taken for partition and sale of land which had belonged to the deceased father of the parties. S., one of the parties thereto and a tenant in common with the others, had then had exclusive possession of the land for less than ten years. The proceedings resulted in a judgment declaring five of said parties, including S., to be the owners of the land and the partition and sale were not proceeded with. In 1922 proceedings were again taken for partition in which S. claimed a statutory title by possession of the whole land.\nHeld, that the former judgment had interrupted the continuance of possession by S. and his title had not accrued.\nWhether or not a summary proceeding for partition and sale shall be fully tried by a judge in chambers or an issue be ordered to try some important matter raised is a question of practice and procedure with which the Supreme Court will not, as a rule, interfere.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ. It is also a matter of judicial discretion and it cannot be said that the order of the Appellate Division in this case, that it should be tried in chambers, was a wrongful exercise of such discretion.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment of a judge in chambers directing the trial of a question of law and ordering the partition and sale of land as applied for.\nProceedings by originating summons were taken for the partition and sale of land. When the case came before the judge in chambers the appellant claimed title to the whole land by virtue of the Statute of Limitations and the judge directed a trial to determine the title. On appeal his order was set aside, the Appellate Division directing that the case should be tried summarily and also deciding the question of title in favour of the respondent and directing a reference to take the necessary proceedings for partition and sale. From that judgment the appeal was taken to this court.\nBetts K.C. for appellant.\nJohn C. Elliott K.C. for respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I think this appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nI am inclined to think that the judgment of the Divisional Court from which this appeal has been taken dealt substantially with matters of procedure and practice of the courts of Ontario and in accordance with our practice would not be interfered with by this court, unless some manifest injustice was shown of which there is here no evidence whatever.\nWithout, however, basing my judgment upon that ground, I am of the opinion, on the substantial question in this appeal, as to whether the Statute of Limitations ceased running in favour of the appellant and his mother and sister by reason of the judgment for administration and partition or sale pronounced in the proceedings of 1916-1919, that it did and that consequently the appellant\u2019s claim that a statutory title by possession had subsequently ripened and accrued to him cannot be upheld.\nThat judgment for administration and partition of sale was one for the benefit of all parties interested (including the present appellant) and they were all bound by it. Appellant\u2019s claim to add the years of his possession of the lands and premises in question previous to that judgment in order to make up his statutory possessory claim cannot, therefore, be allowed in my view of the effect of the 1916-1919 proceedings and judgment.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant raises very many points relative to the correct practice and procedure to be taken in Ontario courts by those seeking partition of real estate held by tenants in common as respondent does herein as administrator of the estate of one William B. Shields, deceased, and one of five who had been duly declared owners of the equity of redemption in certain lands.\nIndeed on a motion of the four surviving owners, including the appellant, and respondent as representative of said deceased, the said equity of redemption had been declared to be vested in the appellant and his said co-owners.\nThe uniform jurisprudence of this court has been to refuse to exercise its jurisdiction in such matters unless some grave violation of natural justice has been involved in the departure from the correct practice or procedure.\nTherefore the appellant has no grounds of complaint herein, in his vain attempt to get a very serious injustice done to the respondent, one of his co-tenants.\nHis attempt to set up the Statutes of Limitations is rather absurd as well as unjust in face of the past history of the property in question and the litigation it has gone through.\nAnd in face of his repudiation of any claim thereunder for himself in his answer by affidavit to the originating motion below, it seems rather absurd.\nI think the judgment of Mr. Justice Middleton speaking for the majority of the court below is right.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014The appellant has failed to advance adequate reasons for interfering with the decision of the Appellate Division on the ground principally relied upon in support of the appeal, namely, that the procedure followed is not a procedure sanctioned by the Ontario practice. The procedure approved by the majority of the Appellate Division seems to be a convenient one, and the controversy raised in relation to it is not a controversy as to rights or as to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ontario, but one as to whether this or that mode of bringing the points in dispute up for adjudication is the correct one. It would not be in consonance with the principles which have governed this court in dealing with such matters to examine questions of this character in the absence of some very special circumstances such as are not present in this case.\nAnother ground of appeal is set up, and that is that the Appellate Division is wrong in its conclusion that the appellant has failed in his contention based upon the Statute of Limitations. A judgment for administration and partition was pronounced in 1916, and a vesting order was granted on the 29th May, 1919. I am not satisfied, having regard to what took place before the Master in 1917, that by virtue of the master\u2019s report in that year a new starting point did not arise for the running of the statute. It is at least arguable that the case is within the last paragraph of Lord Cairns\u2019 judgment in Pugh v. Heath[1], where it is laid down that sec. 6 of the Act\nin defining when the right shall be deemed to have accrued is not necessarily exhaustive.\nI do not read the judgment of Middleton J. as proceeding upon the ground that what took place amounted to a statutory acknowledgment of title. However that may be, I am satisfied that in effect what was done amounted to the bringing of the action within the meaning of sec. 5, \u201caction\u201d being defined by the first section as including \u201cany civil proceeding.\u201d\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The Ontario Consolidated Rule of Practice No. 615 reads, in part, as follows:\u2014\n615. (1) An adult person entitled to compel partition of land or any estate or interest therein may, by originating notice served on one or more of the persons entitled to a share therein, apply for partition or sale. (2) The Master shall proceed in the least expensive and most expeditious manner for partition or sale, the adding of parties, the ascertainment of the rights of the various persons interested, the taxation and payment of the costs and otherwise.\nRule 606 reads, in part, as follows:\u2014\n606. (1) The judge may summarily dispose of the questions arising on an originating notice and give such judgment as the nature of the case may require or may give such directions as he may think proper for the trial of any questions arising upon the application.\nRule 615 confers a special summary jurisdiction. The conditions of its exercise are:\u2014\n(a) that the applicant shall be \u201can adult person entitled to compel partition.\u201d\n(b) that the notice of application shall be \u201cserved on one or more of the persons entitled to a share\u201d in the land, estate or interest sought to be partitioned.\nBy an originating notice of motion, served only on the appellant, the respondents, as administrators of the estate of the late William B. Shields, applied in November, 1922, to a judge of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario for a judgment for the partition or sale of the north part of lot 6, Con. 9, Tp. Mosa, Co. Middlesex, containing about 100 acres and said to be worth some $4,000 or $5,000. This farm had belonged to the late James Shields, father of the appellant and of the late William B. Shields. James Shields died intestate in 1895, leaving him surviving a widow, now dead, and eight children.\nIn 1916 a judgment for the administration and partition or sale of the estate of the late James Shields was pronounced on the unopposed application of two of his sons, Andrew J. and George Shields. Upon the reference then directed the Local Master at London reported that the persons entitled to the equity of redemption in the lands formerly owned by the intestate James Shields were\nJessie Shields, John J. Shields, James Shields, the estate of William B. Shields and Catherine Leitch, as tenants in common, subject to the dower interest of Annie Shields, widow of the intestate.\nAndrew and George Shields, the applicants for administration and partition, were found to have no interest in the lands of their deceased father. This report was upheld on appeal by Mr. Justice Kelly, the Appellate Divisional Court and eventually by this court. Subsequently on the 29th of May, 1919, Mr. Justice Sutherland, on the application of the several heirs so found entitled, including the present appellant and Annie and Jessie Shields, made an order (suggested to have been inofficious) confirming the report of the local master and vesting inter alia the lands now in question in the persons who had been found entitled by the local master. No further steps appear to have been taken in those proceedings.\nOn the return of the application now before us made by the present respondents, the appellant filed an affidavit in which he deposed in part as follows:\u2014\n4. Since the death of my said father, the occupation of the said land has been as follows:\nEver since the death of my said father and up to the month of September, 1921, I and my sister Jessie, and my mother, Annie C. Shields, resided continuously upon the said lands as our home and farmed the same in conjunction with the remaining lands constituting the farm of my said late father and adjoining the land in question herein. Up to the year 1909, various other members of the family also resided upon the said farm and helped to do the work thereon.\n5. Since the year 1909 the said farm, including the lands in question herein have been occupied and farmed exclusively by myself and my said sister, Jessie Shields, and my said mother, Annie C. Shields, up to the present time, with the following exceptions:\n(a) My mother, Annie C. Shields, died on the said farm in the month of September, 1921.\n(b) My brothers, William Shields and James Shields, paid occasional visits in the winter months to the vicinity of the said township of Mosa and on such occasions stayed with me at the said farm, but never on such occasions exercised any acts of ownership over the said farm or any part thereof or claimed to be the owners thereof.\n6. It was always the understanding in the family, with the exception perhaps of my brothers Andrew J. and George, that the lands and premises in question herein were to be the property of my said sister Jessie, and my said mother, Annie C. Shields.\n7. I claim that my sister, Jessie Shields, and my said mother, Annie C. Shields, and myself, if I desired to assert such a claim, which I do not, have by reason of the exclusive occupation by our three selves of the said farm for a period exceeding the last ten years, have acquired an absolute title by possession to the said lands.\n8. My said sister, Jessie Shields, and myself are at present in exclusive possession of the said farm, including the lands in question herein.\nNotwithstanding this disclaimer, however, the appellant in his factum says:\u2014\nThey (the respondents) are aware that the land in question has been the home of the present appellant and his sister, Jessie Shields (to the exclusion of all other members of the Shields family), for a long series of years and that these two claim absolute ownership of the said lands and deny any title whatever thereto in the applicant.\nAnd again:\nThe said appellant and the said Jessie Shields have continued in exclusive possession of the said lands as owners thereof, and they claim that in or about the year 1920 * * * the ten years prescribed by the Statute of Limitations expired and that they became forthwith invested with the absolute title to the said lands.\nI take it, therefore, that the disclaimer of the appellant was intended to operate only in favour of his sister, Jessie Shields, and that, if possessory title in her should not be established, he intends to retain and assert his interest as a co-owner. Service on him was, therefore, probably a sufficient compliance with the requirement of Rule 615 that the notice of the application for partition or sale should be \u201cserved on one or more of the persons entitled to a share.\u201d\nThe substantial objection raised to the application is that the applicants\u2019 title to the land has been extinguished since the former administration proceedings were had, by the expiry of the ten years\u2019 period prescribed by the Statute of Limitations, which was running when those proceedings were taken. The question for determination was whether they stopped the running of the statute and established a new point of commencement.\nWhen the application came on for hearing before Mr. Justice Smith, in chambers, he took the view that the allegation of the appellant challenging the title of the respondents as barred by the Statute of Limitations raised a question that should not be disposed of on a summary application. He accordingly dismissed the motion for partition and directed that the costs of it should be costs in any action to be brought by the appellant for the determination of the question that had arisen.\nOn appeal this order was reversed by a Divisional Court which held (the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas dissenting) that the question of title was purely one of law and could readily and conveniently have been disposed of by the judge in chambers, all the necessary material having been before him, and could then be so dealt with by the Divisional Court\u2014in fine, was such a question arising on the originating notice as r. 606 contemplates should be so dealt with.\nThe court held that the possession of the appellant and Annie C. Shields and Jessie Shields had been so interrupted by the proceedings for administration and the investigation and the determination of title therein, that the running of the Statute of Limitations in their favour had been thereby stopped. Mr. Justice Middleton, de- livering the reasons for judgment of the majority of the court said:\u2014\nI regard this (the Master\u2019s report in the earlier proceedings determining the interests of several parties, confirmed on appeal) as a judicial declaration of the rights of the co\u2011owners, which is not now subject to review. It is true that nothing is said in the report as to the actual occupation of the lands and that it is quite consistent with the Master\u2019s finding that some one or other of the tenants in common may have been in exclusive possession and that if nothing had intervened this possessory title would in the end have ripened into a title under the statute good as against other tenants in common. But I think this gave a new starting point for the statute for no more effective acknowledgement of title can be imagined than a declaratory judgment of a court having competent jurisdiction.\nSpeaking of the vesting order, the learned judge added:\nMuch might be said as to the necessity of the application for this order or as to its operative effect, but at any rate it is an acknowledgement by John J. Shields of the title of his co-tenants for he was a party to the application.\nThe Chief Justice dissented from the judgment on both points.\nSo far as the present appeal challenges the propriety of the Divisional Court determining the issue under the Statute of Limitations, the question presented is purely one of the discretion to be exercised under r. 606. It is essential to the summary jurisdiction conferred by r. 615 that the applicant should be \u201can adult person entitled to compel partition.\u201d Whether the respondents met that requirement was controverted by the present appellant setting up title by possession in himself and his mother and sister. That question had to be determined before the special jurisdiction conferred by r. 615 could be exercised. Should the determination of it be by the judge applied to or the court hearing an appeal from his order, or should a trial to decide it be directed? Obviously the matter was one for the exercise of judicial discretion and, having regard to all the circumstances, it is impossible to hold that the discretion of the Divisional Court was wrongly exercised, if, indeed, the matter be not one of practice and procedure on which we are not accustomed to entertain an appeal.\nBut I entirely agree with the view, which I understand to be held by Mr. Justice Middleton, that if there be any serious difficulty in ascertaining the applicant\u2019s status to apply under r. 615 or the rights of the parties, and especially if material facts are controverted (Lewis v. Green[2],) the discretion given by r. 606 would be properly exercised by directing that an action be brought or an issue tried to determine these matters. To such cases the practice approved in Smith v. Smith[3], and Stroud v. Sun Oil Co.[4], is still applicable\u2014Rule 606 (1) was in force as Rule 941 of the Consolidation of 1897, when those cases were before the court.\nAs to the substantial question whether the Statute of Limitations ceased running in favour of the appellant and his mother and sister by reason of the proceedings of 1916-19 for administration, etc., with the utmost respect, I am inclined to think that an affirmative conclusion cannot be based on anything in the nature of an acknowledgment. The only acknowledgment recognized by the Statute of Limitations (R.S.O. [1914], c. 75, s. 14) is an acknowledgment in writing signed by the person in possession. Because the answer to a Bill in Chancery required to be signed by the defendant it was accepted as a sufficient acknowledgment. Goode v. Job[5]; and so with an affidavit, Tristram v. Harte[6]. The notice of motion for the vesting order in the present case does not serve as such an acknowledgment because not signed by the applicants in person. The signature of it by their solicitors, as agents, is insufficient. Ley v. Peter[7]. I fail to find in the administration proceedings anything in the nature of an acknowledgment which would satisfy the statute.\nBut the judgment for administration and partition or sale, pronounced in 1916, I think stopped the running of the statute. Admittedly the appellant\u2019s mother and sister had not then acquired title by possession. The present respondents and the other persons found entitled by the master still owned their respective interests in James Shields\u2019 estate. The judgment for administration, etc., was, when pronounced, a judgment for the benefit of all parties interested and they were all bound by it. Any action which the present respondents could have brought to recover possession of their interest in the land or to try the question of title thereto would have been stayed by the court on application, because such matters were proper subjects for determination in the administration proceedings and full relief could be had under the existing order, r. 615 (3) Williams on Executors, 11 ed. pp. 1624-6. The administration judgment operated not only in favour of the applicants for it and of creditors but also in favour of the estate\u2014that is, of the personal representative. Re Ballard[8]. It was effective as a judgment in favour of all the heirs of James Shields who might substantiate their respective rights and interests in his estate in the course of the proceedings. The present respondents\u2019 interest was so established and in their favour the statute ceased running when the judgment for administration was pronounced. Finch v. Finch[9]; Uffner v. Lewis[10],\nThe order for sale, likewise for the benefit of all parties interested, was quite inconsistent with the Statute of Limitations continuing to run in favour of one or more of them. In re Colclough[11]; In re Nixon\u2019s Estate[12]; Irish Land Commission v. Davies[13].\nRather, therefore, because the administration proceedings of 1916-19 should be regarded as an action (In re Fawsitt[14], brought for the assertion and establishment of the present respondents\u2019 interest in the lands in question and that interest was therein established, than because any acknowledgment of their title by the appellant and his mother and sister was involved in them, I am disposed to agree with the conclusion of the Appellate Divisional Court that it sufficiently appears that possessory title in Annie and Jessie Shields, such as would destroy the respondents\u2019 status as applicants for partition, does not exist.\nHowever, any adverse determination by the present judgment of the claim to a possessory title put forward on behalf of Jessie Shields and of whoever is now entitled to represent her dead mother would not be binding upon them. They are not, as yet, parties to the proceedings and, when brought in in the master\u2019s office, will be at liberty to assert whatever rights they may be advised to claim and to require their determination under clause 3 of r. 615. For these reasons the appeal in my opinion fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons stated by my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cronyn, Betts & Black.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ivey, Elliott, Weir & Gillanders.\n[1] 7 App. Cas. 235, at page 238.\n[2] [1905] 2 Ch. 340.\n[3] 1 Ont.

[1914] c. 183, Insurance Act\u20145 Geo. V, c. 20, s. 19 (O).\nThe Ontario Insurance Act Co., sec. 156 (5), provides that no inaccuracy in the statements contained in an application for insurance shall avoid the policy unless it is material to the contract. A policy of life insurance declared that \u201cthe policy and the application * * * constitute the entire contract between the parties\u201d and that the statements made by the insured should \u201cbe deemed representations and not warranties.\u201d In his application the insured declared that the statements and answers to the Medical Examiner were true and were offered to induce the company to issue the policy. The Medical Examiner by question 17 asked: What illnesses, diseases, injuries or surgical operations have you had since childhood. Give the number of attacks, dates, duration, severity, etc., of each? 18. State every physician who prescribed for you or treated you or whom you consulted in the preceding five years, and the nature of the complaints with full details under question 17. In reply to questions 19 and 20 the insured declared that he had answered the first two questions fully.\nHeld, that questions 17 to 20 must be read together; that the insured was only required by Q. 18 to state what physicians had prescribed for or treated him or had been consulted in respect to the illnesses, etc., to be specified under Q. 17 which did not comprise those which could be termed trivial ailments. APPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the appellant.\nThe facts are stated in the above head-note.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. and Lionel Davis for the appellant.\nHellmuth K.C. and Arnoldi K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow this appeal with costs here and in the Division Court, and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nI concur in the reasons stated by my brother Anglin J.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I so, in the main, agree with the reasoning of the learned trial judge and his conclusion of fact in light of the relevant law to be applied thereto,, and so entirely with the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, presiding in the Second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario from which this appeal is taken, that I see no useful purpose to be served by repeating same here, but would allow this appeal with costs here and below, and restore the judgment of the said learned trial judge.\nOn the preliminary objection that the said learned Chief Justice takes (as to dropping the jury) I am, though inclined to think the jury could, by reason of common sense, have reached the same conclusion as the learned trial judge, yet, owing to some rulings of his in the course of the trial admitting, against objection of counsel, evidence respondent\u2019s counsel pressed for, it might have led to a new trial, if unfortunately the jury had decided otherwise than he has done. Apart from that minor and perhaps trivial exception I accept without reservation his entire reasoning.\nI may be permitted to submit with great respect to each of the members of the majority of the court below, that the conception expressed by them in varying terms that the deceased had consulted, and that his treatment had been prescribed by, Dr. Fierheller, is, I submit, not quite accurate.\nThe said doctor expressly declares he had made no examination of deceased and seems to me to have merely assented to administering a treatment the deceased desired because his wife had been the better of some such like treatment, using probably the same, but it is not clear whether exactly the same, elements by way of injection instead of taking them through the mouth.\nThe deceased evidently thought he was entitled to be his own doctor directing a medical man to do as he (the deceased) desired, and hence the mistaken answer inadvertently given to Dr. McCullough who however says, if known to him, it would not have changed his recommendation to accept respondent\u2019s application but would have led him to set forth in different terms the answers he wrote down for deceased to sign and which are the basis of all the trouble.\nIt is for the court here to decide and not for Dr. Merchant whether or not that is good defence.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal, in my opinion, should be dismissed. The evidence is, I think, conclusive that any competent medical examiner, if he had been informed of the facts of the treatments of Mr. Schuch by Dr. Fierheller, would have reported those facts to the head office, as it would have been his duty to do, with every probability that the policy would not have issued without a further examination.\nMaterial facts, in the relevant sense, are facts which might influence the mind of a reasonable man in deciding upon the acceptance or rejection of the risk or the rate of premium. In determining the question it is not the state of mind of the particular insurer which is to be considered, but\nthe probable effect which the statement might naturally and reasonably be expected to produce on the mind of the underwriter in weighing the risk and considering the premium.\nNova Scotia Marine Ins. Co. v. Stevenson[1].\nThat is material which a reasonable man would regard as material.\nJoel v. Law Union and Crown Ins. Co.[2] The misstatements were consequently mis-statements material to the risk and sufficient to avoid the policy unless there is something in the statutory law through which the appellants can escape that result. The appellants\u2019 argument proceeded upon the assumption that we must apply our minds to a consideration of the probable results of a further examination of the applicant; the law, I am quite satisfied, does not require us to enter upon any such speculation. The applicant, stating that he had not only had no illness, disease, injury or surgical operation other than those mentioned, but that no physician or practitioner had prescribed for him or treated him or been consulted by him within the preceding five years, placed before the company a mis-statement of the facts which precluded the very line of inquiry which, as I have already said, the evidence, I think quite conclusively, shews would have been pursued.\nThe next question concerns the effect of section 156 (5) of the Ontario Insurance Act. The policy provides that\nthis policy and the application, a copy of which is indorsed hereon or attached hereto, constitute the entire contract between the parties hereto;\nand the application so made part of the contract contains the declaration:\nAll the following statements and answers and all those I make to the Company\u2019s Medical Examiner in continuation of this application are true and are offered to the company as an inducement to issue the proposed policy.\nThe appellants argue quite cogently that if these provisions stood alone they would, if no statutory enactment intervened, have the effect of making the policy conditional upon the truth of the statements in the application irrespective of their materiality. Then it is said that by force of section 156 (5) this implied condition\u2014implied by law\u2014cannot take effect; that section requires that the condition should be expressly limited in its operation to statements material to the contract. The answer given by Mr. Hellmuth is, I think, conclusive. The same clause which contains the sentence just quoted qualifies it by the stipulation,\nall statements made by the assured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties.\nThe concluding sentence of the clause shews that \u201cstatements\u201d here includes statements in the application.\nThat stipulation, quite apart from statutory enactment, would clearly have the effect of limiting the implied condition to cases in which the representations are in relation to something material to the contract, and is consequently, in my opinion, a sufficient expression within the meaning of section 156 (5) that the implied condition is so limited. ANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs sue as beneficiaries under an insurance policy for $50,000 on the life of the late Frederick Joseph Schuch. The sole defence to their claim is based on alleged misrepresentation and suppression in the application for the policy by the insured of material facts in regard to his health and to his medical attendance during the five years immediately preceding the date of the application. This misrepresentation or suppression is charged to have been wilful. Three issues are thus presented: Was there misrepresentation or concealment of facts? If so, was such misrepresentation fraudulent? And: Were such facts material to the risk?\nA judge of great experience, and who is always exceedingly painstaking, tried the action and in a carefully considered opinion determined that there had been no misrepresentation or suppression of material facts and accordingly gave judgment for the plaintiffs. In the Appellate Divisional Court the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas presiding reached the same conclusion upon an independent examination of the evidence. The contrary view, however, was taken by a majority of the court, who were of the opinion that material facts had been wilfully suppressed and that the insurance was thereby avoided. Under these circumstances, I have thought it my duty to examine the entire record with more than ordinary care in order to make up my own mind upon the issues involved. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. Proctor[3].\nThe insurance policy contains the following provision:\nThis policy and application herefor, copy of which is indorsed hereon, or attached hereto, constitutes the entire contract between the parties hereto. All statements made by the insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties and no such statement of the insured shall avoid or be used in defence to a claim under this policy unless contained in the written application herefor, and a copy of the application is indorsed on or attached to this policy when issued.\nThe misrepresentations of fact relied upon are found in a portion of the application, thus made part of the contract, under the heading, \u201cStatements to Medical Examiner.\u201d This heading is immediately followed by the note:\nThese must be recorded in the handwriting of the Medical Examiner, who should satisfy himself that the applicant\u2019s statements and answers are full and complete. This portion of the application was subscribed by the applicant, below the words,\nI certify that each and all the foregoing statements and answers were read by me and are fully and correctly recorded.\nIn order to determine whether there was the misrepresentation by the insured charged against him (having regard to the form of the questions, concealment or suppression of material facts would amount to misrepresentation) it is essential, first, to ascertain the effect of the questions put to the insured, to which it is said he gave untrue answers, and then to form a correct appreciation of the evidence in regard to the facts relied on to support the allegation that the answers were untrue. These questions and answers are numbered 17 to 21 inclusive and I think it advisable to set them out in full and in the form in which they are found in the printed application. Their true purport and effect will thus be more readily apparent. The italics are mine and indicate the answers filled in in the handwriting of Dr. McCullough, the Medical Examiner, the rest of the extract consisting of printed matter in the document furnished by the insurance company.\n17. What illnesses, diseases, injuries or surgical operations have you had since childhood?\n18. State every physician or practitioner who has prescribed for or treated you, or whom you have consulted, in the past five years.\n19. Have you stated in answer to question 17 all illnesses, diseases, injuries or surgical operations which you have had since childhood? (Answer yes or no.)\nYes.\n20. Have you stated in answer to question 18 every physician and practitioner consulted during the past five years, and dates of consultations? (Answer yes or no.)\nYes.\n21. Are you in good health?\nYes.\nIn the first place in regard to the answer to question No. 21, the finding of the trial judge that the insured was in good health when he applied for and received the policy is abundantly supported by the evidence. Dr. McCullough, the defendant\u2019s examiner, so found him and says that nothing deposed to during the trial by Dr. Fierheller would change his opinion. Dr. Clarkson, a leading expert witness. for the defence, when the result of Dr. Fierheller\u2019s testimony was stated to him on cross-examination, was prepared so to assume. He admitted that\nit would be fair to assume that he had got well over whatever he had been treated for in those earlier years.\nThe weight of the medical testimony is that the cancer, of which Schuch died in 1920, probably did not exist in December, 1918, when the insurance was taken, and all the witnesses agree that Schuch would then have been entirely unaware of it if it did exist. As the learned trial judge put it, the death of the insured by cancer\ncan be eliminated from the case just as would be a death by railway accident.\nThe actual truth, and certainly the perfect good faith, of the answer made by the applicant to question no. 21 cannot, upon the evidence before us, admit of any doubt. See Yorke v. Yorkshire Ins. Co.[4]\nThe group of questions\u201417 to 20 inclusive\u2014must be read together and effect given to them in the sense in which a layman so reading them would understand them. It is well established law that the preparation of the form of policy and application being in the hands of the insurers, it is but equitable that the questions to which they demand answers should, if their scope and purview be at all dubious, either in themselves or by reason of context, be construed in favour of the insured, especially after his death when we are deprived of the advantage of his version of what occurred upon the medical examination and of any explanation by him of his understanding of the questions and of his reasons for giving the answers to them recorded by the medical examiner. The insurers put such questions and in such form as they please, but they \u201care bound so to express them as to leave no room for ambiguity.\u201d To such a case the rule contra proferentem is eminently applicable. Thomson v. Weems[5]; Life Association of Scotland v. Foster[6]; Fowkes v. Manchester and London Life Assur- ance Association[7]; Joel v. Law Union and Crown Ins. Co.[8]; In re Etherington and The Lancashire, etc., Ins. Co.[9]; Condogianis v. Guardian Assurance Co.[10]\nThe company put two general questions, nos. 17 and 18, followed in each instance by particulars or details indicative of a limitation on their scope. Thus under no. 17 the \u201cName of Disease, etc\u201d is asked, the \u201cNumber of Attacks,\u201d the \u201cDate of Each,\u201d its \u201cDuration,\u201d \u201cSeverity,\u201d \u201cResults,\u201d and \u201cDate of Complete Recovery,\u201d indicating that the question, notwithstanding the generality of its terms, \u201cdiseases, injuries, or surgical operations,\u201d was intended to be restricted to what might be regarded as specific diseases or specific injuries of a serious nature or which entailed surgical operations, diseases, etc., in respect of which such particulars as are asked might reasonably be expected to be demanded.\nAgain under question no. 18 the applicant is asked to state the \u201cName of the physician or practitioner,\u201d \u201cAddress,\u201d \u201cWhen consulted,\u201d and \u201cNature of complaint. Give full details above under Q. 17\u201d\u2014thus affording fair ground for the assumption that it is only when the applicant had \u201cconsulted\u201d a physician and in regard to a complaint which he was required to specify under question no. 17 that the name and address of such physician need be given under question no. 18. Moreover, in question no. 20 the applicant is asked\nhave you stated in answer to question 18 every physician and practitioner consulted during the past five years and dates of consultations,\nthus confirming the impression which the particulars given under question no. 18 were calculated to create and may actually have given to both the examining doctor and the assured, that it was only when he had \u201cconsulted\u201d a physician that the insured was expected to give his name and address. Noscuntur a sociis applies. Beal on Cardinal Rules of Interpretation (2nd ed. p. 162); Ystradyfodwg Pontypridd Main Sewerage Board v. Bensted[11].\nIn Connecticut Mutual Life Assurance Co. v. Moore[12], the trial judge, dealing with general questions in a form of medical examination somewhat similar to those now before us, said to the jury (p. 650):\u2014\nThey have stipulated that his answers shall form part of the contract which he is about to enter into. They say to him in effect, \u201cYou must answer these questions correctly; if from forgetfulness or inadvertence you answer a question incorrectly, we hold the policy void.\u201d They have a right to make that stipulation; but it is, in my judgment, a stipulation that should be construed with great strictness. When they put a very general question under a stipulation of that kind, it is only reasonable and just to put on that general question a fair construction; for instance, take the question they put with reference to any other illness, local disease, or personal injury; I think that question must be read in a fair and common-sense way. If the applicant had had a headache the very day before, and had not stated it in his application, it could not be said that this policy was good for nothing simply because he had not stated that; and yet a doctor would tell you that a headache was an illness, and that it came, strictly speaking, within that term. Subject to that limitation, that the questions are to be read in a fair and common-sense way, having regard to all the circumstances surrounding the man, and all the information that the company may reasonably expect to receive, I tell you that, in my view, the company have required the applicant to give correct answers to the questions they put.\nAnd again, referring to a question as to medical attendance and the evidence in regard to it, the judge said (p. 651):\u2014\nNow the term \u201cattended\u201d in a policy of this kind, must be read in a reasonable manner. The mere circumstance that a man had gone to a physician for some trifling ailment, and had received some care or attention from him, would not, it appears to me, render him the attendant of the applicant in such a sense that it would be necessary to state that he had been his last medical man, or that he had last attended him. It appears to me that the attendance meant is an attendance for something that deserves consideration, and might be expected to be present to the mind of a man when he was making an application of this kind. The object of the question, I presume, is to enable the company to communicate with the last medical man of the applicant, so that if he pleases to give them information they may get it. At any rate they would know who he is then, and have an opportunity of seeing him; but they would not require that, if the applicant had got from him a piece of sticking plaster for a cut finger, his name should be in the application.\nTheir Lordships (p. 654)\nafter carefully considering the summing-up of the learned judge * * * are unable to say that the jury was in any way misdirected or misled\nand a new trial was refused.\nReading questions nos. 17 to 20 together and with the particulars and details asked in respect of them, and having regard to the fact that they were prepared by the company, they should, in my opinion, be construed as requiring the assured to state only diseases, illnesses or injuries of a somewhat serious kind and to give the names and addresses only of physicians whom he had consulted and who had prescribed for or treated him for some such matters.\nNow let us consider briefly the matters the non-disclosure of which is said to establish the untruth of the insured\u2019s answers. At intervals during the years 1915, \u201916 and \u201917 a physician administered to the late Frederick Joseph Schuch a series of hypodermic injections consisting of a mixture of iron, arsenic and strychnine. Baldly stated, this no doubt looks formidable and would bespeak somewhat important medical treatment, probably warranting an inference that the insured had been suffering from recurrent attacks of a serious disease or illness. But the circumstances must be carefully considered before such a conclusion is reached. For them we must resort to the evidence of Mrs. Schuch, the widow of the insured, and of Dr. Fierheller, who administered the injections and was a witness for the defendants\u2014and the evidence of the latter must be taken as a whole. The learned trial judge in his carefully considered judgment said:\u2014\nThe witnesses on both sides gave evidence, as I thought, honestly and with the desire to give their sincere views.\nWhile Dr. Fierheller\u2019s use of terms may not at times have been quite precise, the substance of his evidence is clear and I respectfully but emphatically dissent from the animadversion upon his credibility implied, if not expressed, in the judgment of Mr. Justice Latchford and also from the conception of the tenor of his testimony indicated by Mr. Justice Riddell in the Appellate Divisional Court.\nIn the first place the medicine taken by Schuch was not a specific for any disease. It was a tonic suitable for a person in a nervous run-down condition ascribable to strain from over\u2011work. The medical evidence is practically in accord on that point. It is likewise common ground that in the case of a person who manifests such a decided aversion to taking medicine through the mouth, as Schuch did, hypodermic administration is devoid of any significance indicative of the existence of serious trouble. It is also stated by Dr, Magner and conceded by Dr. Clarkson that the conditions that led to Schuch\u2019s taking this tonic in 1915 and again in \u201916 and \u201917 were independent one of the other. It was not a continuous condition of which outbreaks were intermittent. He had no chronic trouble. The only disease for which it is suggested by the defendants that Schuch was treated by Dr. Fierheller was an\u00e6mia; and the sole basis for that suggestion is an unfortunately loose use of the phrase \u201can\u00e6mic condition\u201d by Dr. Fierheller. More than once Dr. Fierheller explained that he did not intend to suggest that Schuch had an\u00e6mia, either pernicious or secondary\u2014that he was satisfied he had neither\u2014that he meant nothing more than that\nhe was a little pale as a man might be from overwork and being tired\u2014purely that he was pale and had not a very robust appearance. He was a spare, sallow-complexioned fellow.\nMuch of the medical evidence for the defence is based on the assumption that Schuch in fact had an\u00e6mia\u2014notably that of Dr. Merchant and to some extent that of Dr. McMahon.\nIt is undisputed that Schuch took his business very seriously, that he was a hard-working man at all times and very attentive to business. Mrs. Schuch tells us that he \u201cfelt he had to do everybody else\u2019s work.\u201d In 1915, \u201916 and \u201917 his factory was engaged in the manufacture of munitions which entailed a great deal of extra work. During that time Schuch was rarely at home, his wife tells us, leaving early in the morning and returning at midnight. She saw him only on Sundays and he was then unusually tired after the week\u2019s work. Yet he never missed a day at the factory and he did not think it necessary to have a medical examination. He did not \u201cconsult\u201d a physician during this period.\nMrs. Schuch was under the care of Dr. Fierheller for bronchitis in January, 1915, and, as she \u201cdid not pick up,\u201d the doctor in February prescribed for her as a tonic the mixture of iron, arsenic and strychnine and he administered it hypodermically. Schuch learned of this treatment and its beneficial effect. Mrs. Schuch describes him as \u201cfussy\u201d about his health and disposed to try any medicine that was in the house. \u201cHe took all my cough medicines and that sort of thing.\u201d He also took any patent medicines that were about. She adds that he had no illness\u2014\u201cnothing beyond coming home very tired.\u201d\nDr. Fierheller made no examination of Schuch. He had never attended him. He cannot remember whether on the first occasion, in March, 1915, he prescribed for Schuch the treatment of iron, arsenic and strychnine, which his wife had been taking, or whether Schuch did not ask for it and he did not merely accede to his request. He says Schuch\u2019s condition did not call for any examination. He was \u201cnervous, tired and run-down,\u201d and \u201cthat was all.\u201d The doctor is quite clear, however, that in 1916 and 1917 Schuch simply came back and said something to the effect\u2014\u201cI am feeling a bit run-down and would like some more of those treatments\u201d; and the doctor again acceded to his wish. There was no consultation, no advice and no prescription. Schuch responding to these treatments, the doctor adds, showed that he had no chronic trouble but that it was merely a case of an overworked man tired and run down\u2014so it appeared to him. Dr. Magner thought the improvement devoid of significance. Dr. Fierheller adds:\u2014\nHe was the sort of man who fussed about himself a bit when he was not just feeling up to the mark and liked the doctor to give him something as a \u201cpick-me-up\u201d\u2014something as a tonic.\nThat, I think, is a fair synopsis of the circumstances under which Schuch received the hypodermic tonic injections from Dr. Fierheller in 1915, \u201916 and 17. On the evidence before us he then had no disease. Dr. Clarkson, a leading expert witness for the defendants, said that there was nothing in Dr. Fierheller\u2019s evidence as to Schuch\u2019s condition and the treatments given him to indicate that he was sick. Even Dr. McMahon, the most uncompromising of the defendants\u2019 medical experts, admits that if on examination he found Schuch a healthy man, as Dr. McCullough did, he might have regarded him as \u201call right\u201d as an insurance risk although informed that he had been taking a mixture of iron, arsenic and strychnine as a tonic.\nIn my opinion, Schuch might very well, as a reasonable man, Joel v. Law Union and Crown Insurance Co.[13] have considered that during these years he had not an illness, Yorke v. Yorkshire Ins. Co.[14], which the insurance company would expect him to mention in answering question no. 17 and that he had not consulted or been prescribed for or treated by a physician within the meaning of question no. 18. Under the circumstances the hypodermic injections might well have been deemed as of no greater significance than would have been the taking of any well- known tonic bought at a pharmacy and self-administered\u2014not \u201ctreatments\u201d within the purview of question no. 18. Schuch, I think, almost certainly regarded his condition in each of those three years as due entirely to overwork and at most a \u201ctrivial ailment\u201d which he was not required to particularize.\nDr. McCullough was quite unable to recall certain matters that Schuch had mentioned to him which he had covered by the term of his own choosing \u201ctrivial ailments.\u201d Schuch probably did not mention Dr. Fierheller\u2019s name to Dr. McCullough; but it is quite likely that he did allude to having been run down from overwork and, with Meredith, C.J.C.P. (notwithstanding Dr. McCullough\u2019s denial), I am not entirely satisfied that he was not told about Schuch\u2019s having taken a tonic and that the doctor did not forget that incident. He would, quite properly in my opinion, if fully informed as to the taking of the tonic and the attendant circumstances, have described the conditions for which it was taken as \u201ctrivial ailments.\u201d Dr. McCullough himself tells us that if he had had before him all that Dr. Fierheller deposed to his examination of Schuch would have been just the same, and he would have sent in his report with a recommendation of acceptance. Drs. Magner, King and Rolph agree that if on examination they had found Schuch to be in good health, as Dr. McCullough did, nothing in Dr. Fierheller\u2019s testimony would have affected their judgment that he was a good insurance risk. Upon the whole of Dr. Fierheller\u2019s evidence, Schuch, during 1915, \u201916 and \u201917, in my opinion, did not have an illness or disease which he was obliged to disclose under question no. 17 and it does not appear that he consulted or was prescribed for by a physician.\nI am at a loss to understand how Mr. Justice Middleton received the impression that Schuch\nhad consulted and had been prescribed for and treated by Dr. George Fierheller on many occasions during the five years.\nThe only evidence on this aspect of the case is that of Dr. Fierheller. Whatever doubt may exist as to Schuch having been \u201ctreated\u201d (I entertain none), there can be no question that neither consultation nor prescription has been shown. Dr. Fierheller distinctly negatives both for 1916 and 1917\u2014and as to 1915, while he at first said that it was partly true that he had acted on Schuch\u2019s suggestion in giving him the hypodermics, he was not clear whether they began by his prescribing them or by Schuch\u2019s asking for them. Yet Mr. Justice Middleton\u2019s judgment against the plaintiff is based on \u201cthe matter (to him) of moment\u201d that Schuch\nhad during the five years consulted and been treated by Dr. Fierheller at least seventy times,\nbecause he says\nit may well be that the physical condition described by Dr. Fierheller would not amount to \u201cillnesses, diseases, injuries or surgical operations\u201d within the meaning of question No. 17, and if the case depended upon that and that alone, I do not think I should have come to the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nFor reasons already fully stated question no. 18, in my opinion, does not cover the \u201ctreatments\u201d which Dr. Fierheller administered. The burden of proving the untruth of the answers made by Schuch rested upon the defendants who alleged it. Taylor on Evidence (11th ed.) Vol. 1, par. 367; Joel v. Law Union and Crown Ins. Co.[15]; Dillon v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association[16]; Elkin v. Janson[17]. That burden, they have not discharged.\nWhether if the answers should be regarded as untrue in the sense that they were inaccurate, the facts not disclosed should be held to be material is perhaps not quite so clear. With the trial judge I strongly incline to think that\nif the facts as stated in the evidence by Dr. Fierheller with relation to the condition of Schuch and his treatment had been known to the defendant company it is not at all probable that they would have refused the premium and the issue of the policy, nor do I think that they would even have required the examination which the officials now think they would have required.\nThe evidence of Drs. McCullough, Magner, King and Rolph, to which allusion has been made, goes far to support these views. If in order to find materiality the court or jury should be satisfied that the matter not disclosed would, if disclosed, have led to the risk being declined, I would be disposed to find against materiality. If, on the other hand, it is sufficient that it might have led to that result (Brownlie v. Campbell[18]; but see Smith v. Chadwick[19]), non-materiality is not so obvious. In Nova Scotia Marine Is. Co. v. Stephenson[20], Mr. Justice King delivering the judgment of this court said:\nThe test of materiality is the probable effect which the statements might naturally and reasonably be expected to produce on the mind of the underwriter in weighing the risk and considering the premium.\nIn 17 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Eng. at p. 550, the question is stated to be\nwhether the matter represented or concealed was such as would influence the mind of a reasonable and prudent insurer in accepting or declining the risk.\nSee 6 Edw. VII (Imp.) ch. 41, s. 18, s.s. 2.\nWhat a reasonable man would regard as material is not necessarily what the assured so regarded, Joel v. Law Union and Crown Ins. Co.[21] See also Pickersgill, etc. v. London and Provincial, etc. Ins. Co.[22]; Traill v. Baring[23]. In the view I have taken, however, that by its requisitions for information the company elected to relieve the insured from any duty to disclose matters in regard to his past health which its questions did not cover (having by an express provision of its policy agreed that only the statements contained in the written application should avail it as matter of defence; Joel v. Union and Crown Ins. Co.21; Ayrey v. British Legal and United Provident Ass. Co.[24]), and that there was in fact no misrepresentation or concealment of anything required to be disclosed by questions nos. 17, 18, 19 and 20 it would seem to be unnecessary to pass upon the question of materiality.\nBut, whatever should be held on that issue, I agree with the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas that the evidence did not warrant the finding of the majority in the Appellate Divisional Court that there had been fraudulent misrepresentation or suppression by the insured. The trial judge, who saw and heard Dr. Fierheller and Dr. McCullough give evidence and was in the best position to pass upon that issue, distinctly held that Schuch had\n\u201ceffected the insurance in good faith.\u201d\nThat finding in my opinion should not have been disturbed. Nocton v. Lord Ashburton[25]. I would for these reasons allow this appeal with costs here and in the Divisional Court and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Much turns in this case on the proper construction to be placed on the questions and answers contained in the medical examination of the insured, the late Frederick Joseph Schuch, on December 3, 1918. The questions are on a printed form and the answers, as they were required to be, are in the handwriting of the medical examiner, who was Dr. J.S. McCullough of Toronto where the contract of insurance was made. At the end of the examination paper, the insured certified that his answers to the questions were fully and correctly recorded by the medical examiner.\nThe questions and answers on which the respondent relies to dispute liability are the following. (See statement by Mr. Justice Anglin at page 40.)\nThese answers were written by Dr. McCullough. Schuch had told him of a surgical operation he had had eight years before for hernia, as appears by the answer to question 28, but the medical examiner did not note it under question 17. Dr. McCullough is unable to tell what statement Schuch made that he described as \u201ctrivial ailments since childhood,\u201d which were Dr. McCullough\u2019s own words.\nThe respondent contests its liability under the insurance policy on the ground that these answers were untrue, and it also alleges fraud on the part of Schuch. The insurance was effected in December, 1918. Schuch died in the beginning of April, 1920, after an operation for intestinal cancer. It is not pretended that this cancer existed, or if it did that it could have been discovered, at the time of the medical examination. But it is said that in 1915, 1916 and 1917 Schuch consulted, and was treated by, Dr. George Fierheller, of Toronto, for a nervous, run-down and somewhat an\u00e6mic condition which fact he should have disclosed, and that consequently the policy is void.\nThe evidence is almost exclusively of a medical character. Dr. Fierheller described the condition of Schuch at the time of the alleged treatments. Dr. McCullough spoke of his examination of the insured, and then each side called the regulation number of medical experts who testified on the basis of the evidence given by Dr. Fierheller. There were only three lay witnesses, the agent who solicited the insurance, Schuch\u2019s widow, and an employee of the assured.\nSchuch, during the years 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918, was a very busy man engaged in a large business and making out of it more than $25,000 the year previous to the insurance, according to information secured by the respondent\u2019s inspector. During a part of this time he manufactured munitions for the government. He never took a holiday. In appearance, he was a rather tall, thin man, with a pale or sallow complexion and had been so for years. His exact weight, at the time of the insurance, was 148 pounds and his height 5 feet and 10\u00bd inches.\nDr. Fierheller states that in the spring of 1915 he was in attendance on Schuch\u2019s wife for bronchitis. He prescribed a tonic for her, consisting of a mixture of arsenic, iron and strychnine, known as Zambellatti\u2019s preparation, which is a well recognized tonic medicine, and it was administered to her hypodermically. Whether at the doctor\u2019s or Schuch\u2019s suggestion the witness is unable to say, but at the same time as Mrs. Schuch received these injections they were given to the insured. He received this tonic during March, April and May, about very third day. In 1916 there were four similar treatments in April, three in May, six in August, seven in September and ten in October, the insured going to the physician\u2019s office for these injections. In 1917, from August 29th to October 28th, Schuch received an injection of this tonic about every three days. From October 28th, 1917, until August, 1919, there were no more treatments. It is to be observed that Schuch had these tonic injections administered to him entirely at his own request and without having consulted Dr. Fierheller, as the latter expressly says.\nDr. Fierheller, in his examination in chief, described Schuch\u2019s condition at the time he received this tonic as \u201cvery nervous, run-down and somewhat an\u00e6mic.\u201d But in his cross\u2011examination he says he used the word an\u00e6mic loosely, as signifying that Schuch was a little pale. He did not suggest for an instant that he had an\u00e6mia, either secondary or pernicious, or of any kind whatever. Nor is there a word of evidence pointing to Schuch ever having had an\u00e6mia in any shape or form. He was very nervous and run-down, which can be explained by the fact that he was a very hard working man, and his worries would be increased during the war because he was by birth an Austrian although a Canadian citizen. And these treatments did him good.\nBefore going further, it should be stated that, according to the medical evidence on both sides, no significance is to be attached to the fact that this tonic mixture was taken by means of hypodermic injections instead of by the mouth.\nThe effect of Dr. Fierheller\u2019s evidence, to my mind, is correctly summed up by Dr. Edmund King, when he said:\nWell, after taking all Dr. Fierheller\u2019s evidence into consideration, I simply came to the conclusion that this was an overworked man, and after so much hard work he became exhausted and run-down, as we all do and want our holidays, and that he took his holidays in this particular manner by going and getting a boost-up, if I use that expression properly, a boost or a tonic, and whether he had it by the stomach or had it hypodermically, it is of no importance whatever.\nThe question now is whether, the onus being on it to make out a sufficient case of non\u2011disclosure to avoid the policy, the respondent has discharged this onus. The trial judge thought that it had not; the members of the Appellate Divisional Court, with the exception of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas who agreed with the trial judge, were of the contrary opinion. To answer it, I have read every word of the evidence most carefully, and I cannot help feeling that the incidents referred to by Dr. Fierheller have been somewhat grossly exaggerated. I think we are entitled, inasmuch as in a case of this nature the judge discharges the duty of a jury, to look at the whole matter in a common-sense way and as a reasonable juryman would, using our knowledge of the world and of men, for it would be news to me that a man who had occasionally taken a tonic, when he felt tired or run-down from overwork, should, when examined for insurance, state this fact to the medical examiner. Certainly a reasonable man would not consider it material to tell the medical examiner that he had taken a tonic from time to time as many thousands do without any reference whatever to their physician.\nMoreover the true meaning of the questions submitted by the medical examiner must be considered, especially as they would impress the person examined, assuming him to be a reasonable man, before coming to the conclusion, as the Appellate Court did, that the answers were untrue and fraudulent.\nIn my opinion, questions 17 and 18 must be read together. The insured is, by the latter question, asked to state every physician or practitioner who has prescribed for or treated him or whom he has consulted in the past five years. Obviously what is meant here\u2014and any reasonable man would so understand it\u2014is prescription, treatment or consultation in connection with the illnesses, diseases, injuries or surgical operations which the insured was asked to mention by question 17, the more so as the last words of question 18 refer back to question 17. Then consultations are emphasized by the heading \u201cWhen consulted\u201d under question 18, as they are emphasized in question 20, and here there is no evidence that Schuch ever consulted about any illness Dr. Fierheller, who cannot say that he did. Clearly if a man consulted a physician to find out whether he could safely drink the city water, he would not be required to state that under any reasonable construction of question 18. It must be consultation in connection with the illnesses, etc., enumerated in question 17, and there is no evidence that Schuch was ill, or what is more material, that he knew he was ill.\nDealing now with the duty of disclosure incumbent on the insured under a contract of life insurance at common law, I may refer to the often quoted dictum of Lord Blackburn in Brownlie v. Campbell[26].\nIn policies of insurance, whether marine insurance or life insurance, there is an understanding that the contract is uberrima fides (sic), that if you know of any circumstance at all that may influence the underwriters\u2019 opinion as to the risk he is incurring, and consequently as to whether he will take it, or what premium he will charge if he does take it, you will state what you know. There is an obligation there to disclose what you know; and the concealment of a material circumstance known to you, whether you thought it material or not, avoids the policy.\nThe dictum of Lord Blackburn may be further supplemented by what Fletcher Moulton L.J., said after quoting it in Joel v. Law Union and Crown Insurance Co.[27]\nThere is, therefore, something more than an obligation to treat the insurer honestly and frankly, and freely to tell him what the applicant thinks it is material he should know. That duty, no doubt, must be performed, but it does not suffice that the applicant should bona fide have performed it to the best of his understanding. There is the further duty that he should do it to the extent that a reasonable man would have done it; and if he has fallen short of that by reason of his bona fide considering the matter not material, whereas the jury, as representing what a reasonable man would think, hold that it was material, he has failed in his duty, and the policy is avoided.\nAnd at page 884, Fletcher Moulton L.J. adds:\u2014\nThe question always is: Was the knowledge you possessed such that you ought to have disclosed it? Let me take an example. I will suppose that a man has, as is the case with most of us, occasionally had a headache. It may be that a particular one of these headaches would have told a brain specialist of hidden mischief. But to the man it was an ordinary headache undistinguishable from the rest. Now no reasonable man would deem it material to tell an insurance company of all the casual headaches he had had in his life, and, if he knew no more as to this particular headache than that it was an ordinary casual headache, there would be no breach of his duty towards the insurance company in not disclosing it. He possessed no knowledge that it was incumbent on him to disclose, because he knew of nothing which a reasonable man would deem material or of a character to influence the insurers in their action. It was what he did not know which would have been of this character, but he cannot be held liable for non-disclosure in respect of facts which he did not know.\nBoth the Dominion Parliament and the Ontario Legislature have enacted statutes (7-8 Geo. V (Can.), 1917, ch. 29; R.S.O., 1914, ch. 183, as amended by 5 Geo. V (Ont.), ch. 20, sect. 19) concerning the contract of insurance.\nSubsections 5 and 6 of section 156 of the Ontario Act are as follows:\u2014\n(5) No contract of insurance shall contain or have indorsed upon it, or be made subject to any term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso, providing that such contract shall be avoided by reason of any statement in the application therefor, or inducing the entering into the contract by the corporation, unless such term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso is and is expressed to be limited to cases in which such statement is material to the contract, and no contract shall be avoided by reason of the inaccuracy of any such statement unless it is material to the contract.\n(6) The question of materiality in any contract of insurance shall be a question of fact for the jury, or for the court if there is no jury; and no admission, term, condition, stipulation, warranty or proviso to the contrary contained in the application or proposal for insurance, or in the instrument of contract, or in any agreement, or document relating thereto shall have any force or validity.\nBy the policy issued to Schuch, it is stipulated (reproducing paragraph (d) of section 91 of the federal Act) that\nthis policy and the application herefor, copy of which is indorsed hereon or attached hereto, constitute the entire contract between the parties hereto. All statements made by the insured shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties, and no such state- ment of the insured shall avoid or be used in defence to a claim under this policy unless contained in the written application herefor and a copy of the application is indorsed on or attached to this policy when issued.\nWhether or not this condition and the enactments I have mentioned add anything to the common law, it appears clear that if the insured performed his duty of full disclosure to the extent that a reasonable man would have performed it, if he knew of nothing which a reasonable man would have deemed material or of a character to influence the insurers in their action, the insurance policy cannot be avoided for non-disclosure. Measured by this test, the answer made by Schuch to the question (question 21) whether he was in good health cannot be attacked, because Dr. McCullough, after a careful examination, came to the same conclusion. And the failure to mention that he had taken this tonic at different intervals when he felt tired or run down, does not, if no reasonable man would have deemed it material to tell an insurer of the tonics he had taken under such circumstances, amount to sufficient non\u2011disclosure to avoid the policy.\nI do not attach any importance to the ex post facto statement of the medical officers of the respondent that, if they had known that Schuch had had this tonic administered to him as stated by Dr. Fierheller, they would have refused to accept the risk. The test is not what they now say they would have done, but what any reasonable man would have considered material to tell them when these questions were put to the insured.\nMy conclusion is that Schuch disclosed everything which a reasonable man would have deemed material, and even more when he mentioned the small-pox he had had in infancy, and consequently I entirely share the opinion which the learned trial judge formed after hearing all the evidence.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs here and in the Appellate Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Lionel Davis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Arnoldi, Grierson & Parry.\n[1] [1894] 23 Can.

[1920], c. 199, ss. 4, 21, 22.\nThe respondent is a company incorporated by authority of the Parliament of Canada with its head office in Winnipeg. Its agent obtained in the province of Saskatchewan from the appellant Lukey an application for shares in the respondent company for which he gave the promissory notes sued on. This application was forwarded to Winnipeg where it was accepted and the shares allotted to him. Section 4 of \"The Sale of Shares Act\" of Saskatchewan (R.S.S. [1920] c. 199) provides that \"no person shall sell or offer or attempt to sell in Saskatchewan any shares * * * of a company * * * without first obtaining from the Local Government Board a certificate; and in the case of an agent a licence.\" No such certificate or licence had been obtained by the respondent company or by its agent.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting and Anglin J. expressing no opinion, that the provisions of section 4 of \"The Sale of Shares Act,\" in so far as they purport to apply to the sale of its own shares by a Dominion company, are ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nHeld also, Duff and Anglin JJ. contra, that there had been an attempt by the respondent to sell its shares in Saskatchewan within the meaning of section 4 of \"The Sale of Shares Act.\"\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1923] 3 W.W.R. 138) affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge[2] and maintaining the respondent's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. Blackwood for the appellant Lukey.\nF. Heap and Geo. F. Macdonnell for the respondent.\nA. Blackwood for the appellant Lukey. The shares have been offered for sale or attempted to be sold in Saskatchewan within the meaning of section 4 of \"The Sale of Shares Act.\"\nCross K.C. for the Attorney General for Saskatchewan. This provincial legislation falls primarily within the jurisdiction of the legislature under s.s. 13 of s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act over \"property and civil rights in the province,\" and also under s.s. 16 of s. 92 \"matters of a merely local or private nature.\" Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons[3]; Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada[4]; Attorney General of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence-Holders' Association[5].\nThis legislation does not interfere with the status and powers of a Dominion company within the meaning of the decisions in the John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[6] and Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[7]. See Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney General for Quebec[8]; Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[9].\nBayley K.C. for the Attorney General for Ontario. The legislation in question is validly enacted under section 92 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe Sale of Shares Act does not touch upon any subject matter reserved exclusively for the Dominion Parliament by section 91 of the B.N.A. Act.\nF. Heap and Geo. F. Macdonnell for the respondent. The prohibition of the statute as to selling, etc., without a licence is expressly limited by section 4 of \"The Sale of Shares Act\" to selling, etc., in Saskatchewan; and it is submitted that no act of the prohibited kind took place in that province.\nThe Sale of Shares Act is ultra vires of the provincial legislature. Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King7. The Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal raises two questions: first, whether as a fact there was an \"attempt\" by the respondent company to sell its shares in the province of Saskatchewan contrary to section 4 of the Saskatchewan Sale of Shares Act (R.S.S., c. 19) and, if so, does the statute apply to Dominion corporations and compel them, before selling or attempting to sell their own shares, to obtain a certificate or licence as provided in the statute?\nOn the questions as to their having been an \"attempt to sell\" its own shares without having obtained such certificate as the statute provides for, I have no doubt that, under the facts, there was such an attempt, although it did not become effective until ratified in Manitoba where the respondent company had its head office.\nAs to the other question which is one of grave and great importance, namely whether the statute applies to Dominion companies selling or attempting to sell their own shares in the province of Saskatchewan without first having obtained a provincial licence, I am of the opinion that the statute while broad enough in its terms to include Dominion-companies selling or attempting to sell their own shares, should not in such cases be construed as including Dominion companies; because it was not within the powers of the provincial legislature to prohibit the sale within the province by a Dominion company of its own shares, or to compel the company to take out such a licence to do so as the statute in question provided for. In other words, I hold it not to be within the power of the legislature either to prohibit the sale by a Dominion company of its own shares within the province, or to require such a company to take out from the Local Government Board a certificate or, in the case of an agent, a licence before making or attempting to make any such sale.\nIn my judgment the power of a Dominion company to sell its own shares throughout the Dominion goes to the root of its essential powers and capacities and any attempt by a provincial legislature to prohibit altogether the sale by a Dominion company of its own shares in a province, or to make the legality of such sale depend upon the company's first obtaining a licence, or a certificate from a Local Government Board, must necessarily be beyond the powers of a provincial legislature.\nI have read the many cases cited at bar by counsel, notably John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[10], and Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[11], decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the reasoning in those cases of Lord Haldane, who delivered the judgments of their Lordships, has served to confirm me in the conclusions I have reached as to the powers of the provincial legislature on the sole question we have now to determine.\nI have carefully read and studied the ably reasoned opinion of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan and concurring generally as I do in those reasons I do not feel it necessary to repeat them over again in detail.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by respondent upon two promissory notes given by the defendant appellant, each for the sum of one hundred dollars, in payment of shares in the respondent company obtained through an agent in Saskatchewan.\nThe said agent is alleged to have acted in his sale of said shares and taking said promissory notes on behalf of the respondent in violation of the provisions of the \"Sale of Shares Act\" of Saskatchewan.\nThe action was tried by Judge Ross, a district judge of the said province of Saskatchewan, and decided upon an admission of facts appearing in the case.\nHe held that upon said admission of facts the plaintiff, now respondent, could not succeed; and upon the authorities he cites and others cited by counsel for appellants before us, he was right, assuming that the statute of Saskatchewan in question was not ultra vires.\nIt was suggested in the court below by counsel for the company then appellant, now respondent, that the notes having been accepted by the respondent in Manitoba there is no basis for invoking the Act now in question. What actually transpired might have been made clearer but in any event I would infer that all that is really involved in the case, and the real foundation of the claims, took place in Saskatchewan, and was only ratified by the company, and that its rights are tainted by the illegality charged, if any.\nThe important feature of this appeal is the question raised as to whether or not the Saskatchewan Act which is involved was ultra vires or not.\nThere would seem to be a very serious evil prevalent in the methods adopted for selling such securities as mentioned in the Act, and need of a remedy therefor.\nAt least each of the respective legislatures of Manitoba, Alberta, and Ontario has enacted an Act more or less similar to that in question, for the purpose of protecting the public and frustrating the object of those pursuing such undesirable methods.\nWe are not referred to any similar legislation by the Dominion Parliament, or effective measures taken by it having the like object in view.\nWhat is urged by the respondent is that the Dominion \"Companies Act\" enacted under and by virtue of the residuary powers which Parliament has under the B.N.A. Act, enabled the respondent to acquire, by its incorporation, powers such as set forth in its charter obtained under said Companies Act, and these can in no way be impaired by any more provincial legislation.\nIf the Act under which respondent had become incorporated had been enacted under the enumerated powers given Parliament by section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, as, for example, the banking incorporation powers given by item no. 15 of said section 91, or under item no. 27 of said section 91 and excepted, by item no. 10 of section 92, from the expressly enumerated powers, given by that section to local legislatures, then the local legislature of a province perhaps could not interfere in any way.\nBut these corporations of Parliament are all expressly excepted, or intended to be, from the operation of the Saskatchewan Act now in question, as I read it.\nThe respondent could not have been incorporated by Parliament under any of these specific powers I have just referred to.\nThe decision in the case of The Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[12], seems to me expressly in point or so nearly so as we can hope to find on such a question as raised herein. To make that clearer I may recall the history of the provincial legislation there in question. A serious public evil became prevalent in Ontario by reason of trivial objections taken in insurance cases by which such companies often escaped unjustly payment of losses suffered by the insured and against which the insurer was supposed to have agreed to indemnify.\nThe misleading nature of the conditions and the kind of printing used to express them was the basis of the evil.\nThe local government of Ontario appointed a commission to inquire into the evil and recommend a remedy. That commission of very able men, of whom at least two were judges, reported that what are now known as \"statutory conditions\" should be indorsed on every insurance policy, and recommended that if the insurance company desired to be protected by further conditions, such must be printed in red ink.\nSurely if ever there was a case of interference by a local legislature with the supposed powers conferred by the Dominion Parliament in the charter it had issued or adopted and affirmed, that was.\nThe insurance companies challenged its being intra vires the powers of the Ontario legislature. Hence The Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons Case[13].\nIt was also tested at the same time by an action of Parsons v. The Queen Ins. Co.13. Both cases were argued together, at all events in the last court of resort.\nThe history of The Citizens Ins. Co. Case13 is briefly outlined in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council delivered by the late Sir Montague Smith and reported at page 104 of said report, as follows:\u2014\nIt will only be necessary to premise that \"The Citizens Insurance Company of Canada,\" the defendant in the first action, was originally incorporated by an Act of the late province of Canada, 19-20 Vict., c. 124, by the name of \"The Canada Marine Insurance Company.\" By another Act of the late province, 27-28 Vict., c. 98, further powers, including the power of effecting contracts of insurance against fire, were conferred on the company, and its name was changed to \"The Citizens Insurance and Investment Company;\" and, finally, by an Act of the Dominion Parliament, its name was again changed to the present title, and it was enacted that, by its new name, it should enjoy all the franchises, privileges, and rights, and be subject to all the liabilities of the company under its former name.\nThat there should be no question of what the lastly referred to Act enacted I may say that I find it was assented to 12th April, 1876, and is c. 55, in vol. 11, of the Acts of the Dominion Parliament passed in the 39th year of the reign of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria, and is as follows:\u2014\n1. The name of the said company is hereby changed to The Citizens Insurance Company of Canada, by which name in future the said company shall enjoy all the franchises and privileges, and shall hold all the rights and assets, and shall be subject to all the liabilities heretofore held, enjoyed and possessed, or which have heretofore attached to The Citizens Insurance and Investment Company; and no suit now pending shall be abated by reason of the said change of name, but may be continued to final judgment in the name under which it shall have been commenced.\nI submit that this enactment is quite as specific an enactment by Parliament, when read in light of the previous enactments, recited in the foregoing extract from the judgment as quoted above, and confers by all the relevant powers Parliament had, quite as substantial a status and extensive grant of incidental powers, resting upon the power of Parliament, as anything the respondent ever received therefrom by its incorporation under the Dominion Companies Act.\nYet the judgment in said case to test the validity of such provincial legislation as I have referred to, varying its most essential power of framing its own contract, and imposing thereon a limitation until then undreamed of, stands good law to-day and better expresses what all those concerned in the B.N.A. Act meant, than we hear urged by those born in later days when forced to argue otherwise.\nI am quite unable to reconcile the interpretation given by the learned judges in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to the opinion judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[14], with the decision in the said cases of The Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[15], and The Queen Ins. Co. v. Parsons15, heard together, and treat that in the latter as if overruled thereby. For my part any opinion judgment must be read in light of the question at issue and therein decided and all else obiter dicta be simply given the weight due to opinion.\nThe John Deere Plow Case[16], so much referred to by said learned judges, involved simply this: Could a provincial legislature by its enactments insist that the corporate creation of Parliament, or its enactments, must go out of existence? Such an attempt as the authorities in British Columbia then and thus tried to enforce was quite unjustifiable.\nI eliminate from my consideration of that case all else but that single point, save due respect to the obiter dicta in the reasons given.\nWhen we come to the Great West Saddlery Case[17] and what was raised therein and the results reached, what are they?\nIn the final paragraph of the judgment of the court above therein, the net result seems to be covered by the following quotation:\u2014\nHere again their Lordships think that the provincial legislature has failed to confine its legislation to the objects prescribed in s. 92, and has trenched on what is exclusively given by the British North America Act to the Parliament of Canada. If the Act had merely required a Dominion company, within a reasonable time after commencing to carry on business in Saskatchewan, to register its name and other particulars in the provincial register and to pay fees not exceeding those payable by provincial companies, and had imposed upon it a daily penalty for not complying with this obligation, it could (their Lordships think) be supported as legitimate machinery for obtaining information and levying a tax. But the effect of imposing upon such a company a penalty for carrying on business while unregistered is to make it impossible for the company to enter into or to enforce its ordinary business engagements and contracts until registration is effected, and so to destroy for the time being the status and powers conferred upon it by the Dominion. Further, if it is the intention and effect of the Act that a Dominion company when registered in the province shall be subject (by virtue of the definition section or otherwise) to the general provisions of the Saskatchewan Companies Act or shall become liable to dissolution under s. 28, the Act would be open to question on that ground; but it is right to say that such a construction was disclaimed by counsel for the Attorney general of Saskatchewan and (as regards the liability to dissolution) has been excluded by an amending Act passed while these proceedings were pending. Section 25 of the Saskatchewan Act, which requires a Dominion company to obtain a licence, stands on the same footing as the enactments in Ontario and Manitoba which have been held void as ultra vires; and in this case also the restrictions on the holding of land are not severable from the licensing provisions and are invalid on that ground.\nThe pith and substance of that judgment as I read it is that if a reasonable time had been given to furnish the material required for purposes of taxation or otherwise, perhaps much could not be complained of as matter of law especially as to the Saskatchewan statute therein in question.\nThe temporary suspension of the exercise of its corporate rights was more than the court above felt it could justify and hence held ultra vires, though the individual citizen exercising as such all the business rights that any corporate body could exercise, was left liable to pay the taxing licence fee before actually beginning to carry on business.\nIn other words, if instead of insisting upon prepayment of the taxing licence fee, as usually done in many other instances in common use in Canada, a reasonable time had been allowed, the company could not be held to have been held up, or the Act ultra vires.\nSuch at least is my view of what may be reasonably taken of the net result of basis of complaint in that case, so far as Saskatchewan was concerned.\nThe reasoning for that purpose, or far beyond it, does not lead me to infer that either Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons; Queen Ins. Co. v. Parsons[18], or The Colonial Building & Investment Association, v. Attorney General of Quebec[19], have all, or any of those three just named decisions, been overruled. And until they are, I cannot see why the legislature of Saskatchewan cannot (to protect its citizens against evil practice of even a creation of the Dominion Parliament, unless possibly one brought into existence by virtue of the exclusive powers assigned Parliament by subsections of section 91 of the British North America Act) enact such provisions as are directly in question herein and so far as relevant to the disposition of the issues raised thereby as to render it necessary for the court passing thereon to hold that the enactment on the facts stated invalidates the plaintiff's claim.\nWhether the power to do so be rested upon the power over property and civil rights, or upon local conditions or as against local evil arising from dishonest methods to be combatted it seems to me so far as necessary for the disposition of, and maintenance of the defence in this case, to fall within one or other of such powers, and hence intra vires.\nWhy should a corporate entity have greater rights than the individual citizen? And how far?\nThe Colonial Building & Investment Association v. The Attorney General of Quebec[20], shews how the right to enforce provincial mortmain Acts has been recognized as valid even against Dominion corporations.\nI most respectfully submit that a prevalent gross dishonesty such as the Act in question aims at checking, and thereby preventing the ruin of possibly thousands of helpless people, ignorant of financial schemes of our so-called enlightened days, is quite as well within the powers of our local legislatures, as the several provincial Acts forbidding the sale to any one of a glass of beer, even by a legal entity, clothed, indeed created, by the residuary Dominion powers of incorporation.\nSee the cases of The Attorney General for Ontario v. The Attorney General for the Dominion[21]; The Attorney General of Manitoba v. The Manitoba Licence Holders Association[22].\nTurning from that aspect of the relevant facts to another presented by the case of Attorney General for the Dominion and the Attorney General for the Province of Alberta and others, and the Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia[23], not that it is directly in point herein, but is illustrative of what limitations exist as to the power of Parliament, conversely as it were, and worth considering.\nIf the very simple method of getting incorporation from the Dominion had ever been thought of as fraught with the consequential freedom from all interference on the part of provincial legislatures such as now set up herein and otherwise, why was it not resorted to? Why was the item of \"Trade and Commerce\" in section 91 of the British North America Act so frequently resorted to as a means of giving the Dominion power to exercise exclusive power sought?\nAnd when our old acquaintance \"trade and commerce\" seemed at last exhausted as means to such an end, why are we troubled anew with Dominion incorporating means of giving the Dominion Parliament a power hitherto, at least since the decision of Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[24], unknown?\nIt seems rather late in the day to argue that a mere corporate body has any greater power or rights than any ordinary citizen in the way of overriding and escaping the operation of the exclusive powers assigned to the provincial legislatures over all property and civil rights, over direct taxation, or means of enforcing same, or over all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province. The ordinary citizen if possessed of the necessary means is entitled to embark in anything save those subject matters specifically assigned by the British North America Act to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe evil aimed at by the legislation now claimed to be ultra vires existed long ago, as exemplified by the case of Scott v. Brown, Doering, McNab & Co.[25], and certainly needed a remedy within the powers of each local legislature where the evil existed.\nThe legislation now attacked is simply an attempt to protect the innocent confiding mass from such like schemes as by the court dealing with said case demonstrated to be illegal, in short an illegal means of rendering fraud possibly successful, unless when the wealthy man was the victim and chose to fight it out.\nIf this case fell within its true meaning then the entire scheme was fraudulent (as in the case just cited) and no room exists for setting up the pretence of a delivery of a note in Winnipeg which in fact was delivered into the mail in Saskatchewan by respondent's agent after breach of the Act in question at every angle thereof and tainted with illegality. I should have said above that the illustrations of counsel for the Attorney General for Ontario given in his factum, of the necessity for Dominion corporations created under the I residual powers of Parliament complying with local statutes as the Statute of Frauds, Bills of Sale, and Chattel Mortgages, and Conditional Sales Acts, and similar legislation yet never questioned but observed, are well worth considering herein.\nThese requirements vary in different provinces and possibly in some they do not all exist.\nThe legislation here in question simply goes a step further and is somewhat more complicated but in principle, I submit, the same.\nNearly all are to prevent fraud or wrongdoing; and as the business of the commercial world becomes more complicated the necessary legislation becomes, of necessity, more so also.\nI desire to say that in referring to \"The Sale of Shares Act\" as if to the whole, I by no means am to be taken as holding that there is nothing in it ultra vires for I have only carefully considered the provisions actually necessary for the disposition of the issues necessarily raised for the determination of the defence herein.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nDuff J.\u2014The defendant's contract with the respondent company originated in an offer to purchase shares addressed to the directors of the respondent company, whose head office was in Winnipeg. That offer was accepted by allotment at Winnipeg and notice of allotment given there. The contract of sale was a contract concluded in Manitoba, and therefore was not a sale in Saskatchewan within the meaning of section 4 of the Act; nor do I think there was any offer or attempt \"to sell in Saskatchewan\" within the meaning of section 4. The offer, in point of fact, was an offer made by the defendant, and was an offer to purchase, and it was also an offer which contemplated completion at the head office in Manitoba. The acts of the company's agent may have amounted to an attempt in Saskatchewan to bring about a sale of the shares by a contract to be completed in Manitoba, but there was no attempt to sell in Saskatchewan; that is to say, there was no attempt to bring about the making of a contract of sale in Saskatchewan, which, I am disposed to think, is necessary in order to constitute an attempt within the section. Again, such attempt as there was did not enter into the contract sought to be enforced as one of the constitutive elements of it; and the contract would appear to have been a good contract, even assuming it to have been in fact brought about by a solicitation on part of the agent of the company which was an unlawful solicitation and under the ban of the statute.\nThere has been, however, some difference of judicial opinion upon this point, which is, perhaps, not quite free from doubt, and in view of the fact that the court below have based their decision upon the conclusion at which they arrived, that it was not competent to the Saskatchewan Legislature to enact the statute upon which the defendant relies, I think it is advisable to express my opinion upon the question raised by the appellants' attack upon this view.\nThe question is: Does the statute apply to sales of shares, stocks, bonds or securities of a Dominion company? And the answer to that question admittedly depends upon the answer to the question whether the Saskatchewan Legislature has power to control by such legislation the sale of such objects by a Dominion company. The plan of the Act is to require every company desiring to sell any stocks, bonds, debentures or other securities to apply to the Local Government Board for a certificate to the effect that the company is complying with the Act as a condition of a lawful sale. On the application the company is required to furnish certain information specified in the Act, and it is the duty of the Board to examine the statements and documents filed, and further if deemed desirable, to make a detailed examination of the company's affairs. The Board is then under the duty to issue a statutory certificate if it finds that the company is solvent, that its constitution and by-laws and its proposed plan of business and its proposed contracts provide a fair, just and equitable plan for the transaction of business and appear to indicate a probability of a fair return on the shares, stocks, bonds or other securities * * * proposed to be offered for sale.\nIf it finds otherwise its duty is to refuse the certificate. The Board has authority to revoke the certificate on discovering that the assets of the company have ceased to be equal to its liabilities or that it is conducting its business in an unsafe, inequitable or unauthorized manner or is jeopardizing the interests of its stockholders or investors in shares, stocks, bonds or other securities offered for sale by it.\nThe prohibitions of the Act are comprehensive. Sales, offers to sell, attempts to sell in Saskatchewan are forbidden by section 4 in the absence of a certificate subject to the qualification that this does not apply when (section 21) the\nsale or attempted sale is not made in course of continued or successive acts.\nThe issue, putting forth and distribution of any advertisement in any newspaper or other periodical of any circular letter or other paper containing\nan offer to sell, solicitation or purchase or intimation of the facts of shares, stock, bonds or debentures being open to subscription or purchase, shall be evidence of an attempt to sell in the course of continued and successive acts in violation of the Act.\nBy section 5,\nno person shall print, publish, issue or distribute any advertisement, prospectus, circular, letter or other document containing an offer to sell or request to purchase any of such shares, stocks, bonds or other securities unless the company whose shares, stocks, bonds or other securities are offered for sale shall first have obtained from all the board the required certificate.\nIt is perhaps not easy to attach a precise meaning to the qualification of section 21; but although section 4 might not affect a company carrying out a distribution of shares arranged prior to incorporation among the promoters of the company or among existing shareholders according to mutual arrangement, it seems clear enough, having regard to sections 5 and 22, that in the absence of a certificate a company to which the Act applies is debarred from issuing any document bringing the opportunity of subscribing for its shares or purchasing its debentures to the attention of possible subscribers or purchasers. It is convenient to consider the operation of the Act by reference to a company having its head office in the province, so that the allotment of stock to shareholders\u2014in other words, sales of its shares by the company\u2014would in the ordinary course take place in the province. Such a company, being minded to obtain capital by the sale of its shares through a general subscription, becomes, if governed by the Act, subject to the necessity of submitting its constitution, its by-laws, its plan of business, as well as its assets, to the Local Government Board and (if required) of modifying these to meet the views of the Board as to what is fair and equitable and likely to be commercially successful, as a condition of lawfully proceeding with its plans for obtaining capital by the sale of its shares. As regards the borrowing of money within the province through sale of its bonds and debentures, it is in the like case.\nThe general principles governing the respective authorities of the Dominion and the provinces in relation to the subject of Dominion companies, in so far as presently relevant, are stated by Lord Haldane on behalf of the Judicial Committee in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[26]. The view there expressed may be summarized for our present purposes thus: The power of legislating with reference to the incorporation of companies with other than provincial objects belongs exclusively to the Dominion Parliament as being a matter not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces within the initial meaning of the words of section 91, and as being a matter affecting the Dominion generally and covered by the expression, \"the peace, order and good government of Canada.\" Moreover, the power to regulate trade and commerce covered by the second head of section 91 upon the Dominion enables the Parliament of Canada to prescribe to what extent the powers of companies, the objects of which extend to the entire Dominion, should be exercisable and what limitations should be placed on such powers. This is not to say that the power to regulate trade and commerce is lawfully capable of execution in such a way as to trench on the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures over civil rights in general within the provinces but a province in exercise of its jurisdiction cannot legislate so as to deprive a Dominion company of its status and powers. It was also laid down that the Parliament of Canada had power to enact certain sections of the Dominion Companies Act and the Interpretation Act.\nIn Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[27], their Lordships in applying these general principles observed that even in the case of provincial laws competently enacted and applicable to Dominion companies they had carefully refrained from saying, in the judgment just referred to, that the sanctions by which such provincial laws might be enforced\ncould validly be so directed as indirectly to sterilize * * * if the local laws were not obeyed * * * the capacities and powers which the Dominion had validly conferred.\nAnd their Lordships added that\nwhere one had legislative power, the other has not, speaking broadly, the capacity to pass laws which will interfere with its exercise.\nI think that, for our present purpose, the implications of these two judgments receive valuable illustration by reference to the provisions of the Dominion Companies Act and the Dominion Interpretation Act, which were held to be within the legislative authority of the Dominion. Section 5 of the Dominion Companies Act, which was held to be intra vires, gives authority to constitute certain subscribing shareholders a body corporate and politic for any of the purposes or objects to which the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends; and by force of section 30 of the Interpretation Act, this imports authority to vest in such a corporation the power to sue and be sued, to contract and be contracted with in its corporate name, to have a common seal, to have perpetual succession, to acquire and hold personal property or movables and to alienate the same at pleasure, to vest in the majority the power to bind other members by their acts and to exempt individual members of the corporation from personal liability for its debts or obligations.\nThis is an express decision that the authority of the Dominion under the residuary clause fortified by that under section 91 (2) embraces authority to provide for the constitution of companies falling within the class of joint stock companies as that phrase is commonly understood, companies, that is to say, having capital divided into shares owned by shareholders who are the members of the company, whose liability in respect of the debts and obligations of the company is limited, possessing independently of provincial legislation in each of the provinces the status of a juridical person, having the right to contract, and having the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts, subject always, of course, to the measures passed by provincial legislatures of general application in relation to such civil rights. And I think upon principle no distinction can be drawn between the provisions of the Act dealing with these subjects and those which imply power to acquire capital by selling the company's shares; nor do I think any sound distinction can be drawn between such provisions and those which expressly authorize the company to borrow money on its own credit and to give as security for the money so borrowed its bonds and debentures charged upon its property.\nIt is indisputable I think that if the restrictions established by the statute be validly enacted it is equally within the power of the province to prohibit entirely, in the absence of a certificate, the sale of shares. There cannot I think be any distinction in principle from the constitutional point of view between sale by isolated acts and sale in course of continuous and successive acts. And the learned judges of the court below have rightly considered I think that the true question is whether to create such a prohibition is competent to a provincial legislature.\nThe authority to incorporate companies and endow them with status and powers, maintainable and exercisable independently of provincial sanction, would appear at least to involve the authority to dictate the constitution of the company including the procedure by which membership in the corporation is acquired, as well as to prescribe the character of relations which shall obtain between the corporation and its members. And legislation defining this procedure and creating powers expressly or impliedly to enable it to be carried out, is strictly not within the scope of legislation on the subject of \"civil rights\" as contemplated by 92 (13) but belongs to the class of legislation on the subject of \"incorporation of companies\" and therefore is not within the scope of section 92 when governing companies with objects other than \"provincial rights\" within the meaning of 92 (1).\nThe enactments of the impugned statute necessarily have as already mentioned the immediate effect of preventing Dominion companies with head offices in Saskatchewan exercising in the normal way the power' to obtain capital through subscription for their shares. Not only is that the effect of the legislation, it is of the essence of its design. For by its provisions the exercise of the powers of such a company is made conditional upon submission by the company to a provincial control which would deprive it of the free right of exercising its capacities according to the constitution validly imposed upon it by the Dominion; the constitution, the arrangements between the company and its members, between different classes of members, between the members and the management as touching the control of its affairs, and the distribution of profits are all subjected to the supervision of the provincial Local Board.\nThe legislation in question no doubt has for its purpose, its principal purpose at all events, the protection of those who are properly the objects of the care of the legislature of Saskatchewan, the inhabitants of that province, from the allurement of attractive offers of investment by bubble companies or companies engaged in improvident enterprises, or companies operating according to plans designed for the enrichment of promoters and managers, at the expense of investing shareholders.\nIt is quite true that the provinces have a large authority in relation to the suppression of local evils and the prevention of them and although legislation devoted to such purposes almost invariably affects civil rights, such legislation as a rule falls under section 92 (16) or under one of the more specifically defined categories of section 92 and not under 92 (13) as legislation in relation to civil rights. Russell v. The Queen[28]; Attorney General of Manitoba v. Manitoba Licence Holders Association[29]; Quong-Wing v. The King[30]. But provinces exercising such authority must in doing so observe the constitutional limitations to which they are subject and not effect their objects by means of enactments which both in necessary result and in purpose constitute regulation of Dominion companies in the exercise of powers which belong to them as essential and characteristic.\nThis is not to say that such companies are withdrawn from the operation of provincial laws dealing generally with matters that may be embraced in whole or in part within the objects of the company. Dominion companies empowered to deal in intoxicating liquors for example are subject to provincial laws regulating or suppressing the sale of liquor; but such laws are not laws aimed at Dominion companies as such or at joint stock companies as such and do not in effect or in purpose prohibit or impose conditions upon the exercise of powers of Dominion companies which are essential in the sense that they are necessary to enable them in a practical way to function as corporations according to the constitutions imposed upon them by the Dominion.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellant, Lukey, is sued upon two promissory notes given by him for the purchase price of shares in the respondent company, which is incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act and has its head office in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Lukey's subscription was solicited and the notes sued on were obtained in Saskatchewan by an agent of the respondent company in the course of a general campaign to dispose of its stock. As was intended, they were forwarded by him to the company's head office and the application was there accepted and the shares subscribed accordingly alloted. The appellants (Lukey, and the Attorney General of Saskatchewan and the Attorney General of Ontario, who both intervened), assert that the transaction above outlined was in contravention of section 4 of the Saskatchewan Sale of Shares Act (R.S.S. ch. 199) which reads as follows:\n4. No person shall sell or offer or attempt to sell in Saskatchewan any shares, stocks, bonds or other securities of a company other than the securities hereinbefore excepted without first obtaining from the Local Government Board a certificate, and in the case of an agent a licence, as hereinafter provided, and that this illegality vitiates the notes sued upon. It was admitted that at the time of Lukey's subscription the company was uncertified and its agent unlicensed under the Saskatchewan statute.\nThe respondent maintains that there was no sale of shares in Saskatchewan or any offer or attempt to sell shares in that province in violation of section 4 and it also contests the validity of that legislation in so far as it affects Dominion corporations. Both grounds were relied upon in answer to this appeal.\nThe trial judge (Ross J.D.C.) held that the solicitation of the subscription in Saskatchewan was within the prohibition of section 4 above quoted and that that section was intra vires of the Saskatchewan legislature. He accordingly dismissed the action.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, holding unanimously that section 4 is ultra vires in so far as it affects Dominion corporations. Turgeon J.A. (with whom Haultain C.J.S. concurred) also agreed with the trial judge that the transaction fell within the statutory prohibition. On this latter question Lamont, MacKay and Martin JJ.A. expressed no opinion, the latter observing that the only ground of appeal pressed in the argument was the unconstitutionality of section 4.\nWith the utmost respect, I am of the opinion that what took place in Saskatchewan was neither a sale in that province of, nor an offer or attempt to sell therein, shares of the respondent company. The sale was undoubtedly made when Lukey's application was accepted in Winnipeg. Up to that time there had been merely an application for shares accompanied by a proposition to make payment, should the application be accepted and the stock allotted, by giving two promissory notes for the purchase price tendered with the application for that purpose. The company's agent did not sell its shares in Saskatchewan; neither did he attempt or offer to do so. He did attempt to secure an application for shares there to be forwarded to Winnipeg for acceptance by the company and he did offer to take and forward such application. But neither of those acts falls within the prohibition of section 4, if its language be read in its ordinary and grammatical sense, the adverbial phrase, \"in Saskatchewan,\" modifying the verb \"sell\" and \"to sell\" in the respective clauses; and I know of no reason why it should be given any other construction. There is no ground for construing the section as if its second member read\u2014shall \"offer or attempt in Saskatchewan to sell.\"\nTaking this view of the nature of the transaction and of the scope and effect of the legislation, I am not disposed to canvas academically the question whether the legislature transcended its constitutional powers. Their Lordships of the Judicial Committee have frequently intimated that such questions should be dealt with only when the disposition of the case before the court requires it.\nI would for these reasons dismiss this appeal. The respondents' costs should be paid by the appellants.\nMignault J.\u2014The first question is whether on the admitted facts the case comes within the statute, chapter 15 of the statutes of Saskatchewan for the year 1916 and amendments.\nSection 4 of the statute is as follows:\n4. No person shall sell or offer or attempt to sell in Saskatchewan any shares, stocks, bonds or other securities of a company, other than the securities hereinbefore excepted, without first obtaining from the board a certificate, and in the case of an agent a licence, as hereinafter provided.\nIt is to be noticed that what is prohibited here is to sell, or offer, or attempt to sell, in Saskatchewan, shares of a company which has not obtained a certificate from the board.\nThe respondent is a Dominion company incorporated by letters patent under the Dominion Companies Act, with its head office in Winnipeg, province of Manitoba. It had not obtained the certificate referred to in section 4.\nThe respondent's agent obtained in Saskatchewan from the appellant Lukey an application for shares in the respondent company, for which Lukey gave the promissory notes sued on. This application was forwarded to the head office of the company in Winnipeg where it was accepted and the shares were allotted to him.\nThe sale of the shares no doubt did not take place in Saskatchewan, or at least not wholly in Saskatchewan. I will assume it took place in Manitoba. But was there in Saskatchewan an attempt to sell these shares? The words of section 4 are \"attempt to sell in Saskatchewan.\" Does that mean attempt to make a sale which sale is to be effected in Saskatchewan, or does it mean an attempt in Saskatchewan to sell these shares, or in other words to get somebody in Saskatchewan to buy them?\nThe statute was enacted for the protection of the inhabitants of the province of Saskatchewan. The legislature of that province could not control or prohibit anything done out of the province and it must be assumed it did not intend to do so.\nBut it could, if otherwise this legislation can be sustained, deal with matters happening in Saskatchewan, and I will assume it intended to prohibit not only the sale but also the attempt to sell such shares (treating the words \"attempt to sell\" as a compound verb), if it occurred in Saskatchewan.\nDid the respondent, through its agent \"attempt to sell,\" in this sense, the shares in question, and was this done in Saskatchewan?\nI would answer yes, just as much as an order for the purchase of goods, solicited in Saskatchewan by a commercial traveller, the order to be filled in another province, would be an attempt to sell these goods in Saskatchewan. And it was in furtherance of this attempt to sell the stock of the respondent company that its agent obtained the notes sued on in this case.\nI think therefore the case before us comes within the statute.\nOn the second question, the validity of the Saskatchewan statute as applied to the sale of its shares by a Dominion company, my opinion is that the appeal fails.\nI have already quoted section 4 which shows what the purpose and effect of this statute really is. I may add that section 4 is followed by provisions which carry out this purpose in minute detail. Thus the company whose shares it is desired to sell shall file with the board (which is the local government board of Saskatchewan) a statement showing the plan on which it proposes to do business, a copy of all contracts which it proposes to make with or sell to its contributors and a statement of its actual financial condition and of its property and liabilities (section 6). The board examines the statements and documents filed and if deemed advisable makes a detailed examination of the company's affairs (section 8). If the board finds that the company is solvent, that its articles of incorporation, constitution and by-laws, its proposed plan of business and proposed contracts provide a fair, just and equitable plan for the transaction of business, and appear to indicate the probability of a fair return on the shares, stocks, bonds and other securities, it shall issue a certificate to the company reciting that the company has complied with the Act and is permitted to sell its shares, stocks, bonds and other securities (section 9). If, however, the board finds otherwise than as mentioned above, it shall refuse the certificate (section 10). A company shall not, nor shall any person, either as principal or agent, transact business in form or character similar to that set forth in section 4, until such company or person has obtained a certificate, as provided by section 9 (section 13). If any alteration or amendment is made in the charter, memorandum of association, articles of incorporation, constitution or by-laws of the company after a certificate has been granted under section 9, such alteration or amendment shall in every case operate as an immediate revocation of the certificate (section 14). Should the company transact business on any other plan than that set forth in the statement required to be filed by section 6, or make contracts other than those shown in the copy of the proposed contracts required to be filed by section 6, the certificate granted upon the faith of such statement or proposed contracts so shown shall become ipso facto null and void, and no business thereby authorized shall be transacted until a new certificate has been obtained (section 14a). The statute provides for the obtaining of a new certificate and for the appointments of agents who must be licensed by the board. It also requires the filing with the board of an annual statement of the financial condition of the company, failing which the company shall forfeit the right to continue the business of selling its shares, bonds or other securities in Saskatchewan (sections 16 and 17).\nNo matter how praiseworthy may be the object which the legislature had in view, the question to be decided is whether in attempting to attain this object it has transcended its powers, in so far as these enactments apply to a Dominion company.\nThe test or crucial question, the answer to which determines whether legislation of this character is within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislature, in so far as it affects Dominion companies, was stated by Lord Haldane in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King[31], as follows:\nDo these provisions interfere with such powers are are conferred on a Dominion company by the Parliament of Canada to carry on its business anywhere in the Dominion, and so affect its status?\nI think the answer should be in the affirmative. The selling of its stock or bonds in order to obtain the capital necessary to carry on its business, is an act connected with the very life of a company. Capital is for the company seeking to obtain it what blood is for the human body. Without it the company cannot live and carry on its business and capital can be obtained by the company only by selling its stock or by borrowing money. The Saskatchewan statute prevents the Dominion company from selling its stock and bonds or other securities unless and until a certificate of approval is obtained from the local government board. This is an interference with the powers conferred on the company by the Parliament of Canada to carry on its business in the province of Saskatchewan, and so affects its status. And the legislation cannot be sustained as coming within property and civil rights, or as being a matter of a merely local or private nature in the province. It really conflicts with the right of the Dominion Parliament to incorporate companies, and to grant them power to carry on their business throughout the Dominion.\nThe statute therefore is not a defence to the respondent's action.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant Lukey: Alex.

On the first instalment falling due, the appellant negotiated for an extension of time for payment which was granted by the respondent, on condition that the appellant should do certain development work not mentioned in the option. The appellant failed to pay; he subsequently relinquished possession of the mine and surrendered the option, but without having done the work. The respondent sued for an account and for damages amounting to the cost of the work.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the respondent was entitled to recover.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014Upon the assumption of a finding by the trial judge that the work was part of a scheme the execution of which the respondent regarded as essential to the proper development of the mine, the respondent had the right to ask as damages resulting from the breach of agreement the cost of performing the development work which the appellant had agreed to do and the measure of damages ought not, as is usual, to be restricted to the pecuniary value of the advantage the respondent would have obtained by performance of the agreement.\nPer Idington J., dissenting,\u2014The undertaking to do the work in question and consideration therefor were not a collateral independent contract but by the express terms thereof declared to be a mere \"modification of the terms and conditions \" of the optional agreement for purchase, and should therefore be construed as if same had conditionally formed a clause therein, and thus subject to the effect to be given the pivotal and predominant provision thereof which entitled appellant at any time to terminate the whole agreements by the relinquishment, as happened, of his option, involving therewith the surrender to respondent of all machinery, implements and equipment by and with which it was contemplated the work in question was to have been done and thus creating such a situation as basis for estimating damages as never could be properly held to be the actual cost of the work, and thus within the reasonable contemplation of the parties which must ever form, according to our long settled rule of law, the basis for awarding damages for breach of such like contracts.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming the judgment of the trial judge and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe respondent, a banker owning a group of mines called Hewitt (which had previously been operated) gave the appellant an option to purchase it for the sum of $175,000 payable in two instalments of $87,500 each in one and two years respectively. The appellant had the right to mine and ship ore but was obliged to pay 15 per cent of the net smelter returns to the credit of the respondent at the Bank of Montreal to be applied on account of the purchase price. The appellant was also required to do certain development work in no. 7 tunnel. When the first instalment of $87,500 became due, the appellant negotiated for an extension of time for payment of part of it, $37,500. This was granted in consideration of the appellant agreeing, besides paying interest on the deferred payment, to do certain further development work not mentioned in the option, viz., to drive no. 8 tunnel ahead and continue same without interruption until reaching the ore shoot then being mined in no. 7 tunnel, an estimated distance of 1,200 feet and then constructing a raise from no. 8 to no. 7 level, a distance of 350 feet. This no. 8 tunnel had been driven as a drift on the vein by the former operators, and the further development agreed to be done by the appellant was for the purpose of continuing this tunnel and thus developing the downward continuation of the ore theretofore being mined in the no. 7 tunnel above and making a connection therewith. The appellant did not do more than 25 feet of this work, and ten days prior to the due date for payment of $37,500, he requested a further extension of time. The respondent notified the appellant that his proposals were not acceptable and demanded possession of the premises, declaring the option at an end. The appellant relinquished possession of the mines and surrendered his option without doing the development work above referred to. The respondent took action for an account of ore mined, milled, shipped or treated by the appellant, and for damages for failure to do the development work. The trial judge gave judgment for the respondent for an account; and as to the action for damages, he directed a reference to ascertain the quantum of such damages at the rate of $15 per foot for all work not done by the appellant, thus involving a determination that the proper measure of damages was what it would cost the respondent to do the work the appellant failed to perform. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nLafleur K.C. and Hamilton K.C. for the appellant. The damages which the respondent ought to receive, in accordance with the settled rule, are those which may fairly and reasonably be considered to arise from the breach, according to the usual course of things. Applying this rule, the respondent is only entitled to recover the pecuniary value of the advantage he would have obtained by a performance of the agreement which would in this case be the equivalent of any increase in the value of the mine to arise therefrom.\nTilley K.C. for the respondent. The respondent has the right to recover as damages the cost of doing the work, as this work formed a necessary part of a plan of exploration or development requisite, from a miner's point of view, for developing the property as a working mine.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014After reading as much of the evidence as I considered material and giving much consideration to the arguments at bar and the judgments in the courts below, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nI substantially concur with the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Galliher in the court below.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent covenanting with the appellant that he, the respondent, was entitled to certain mining properties in British Columbia, agreed to give the appellant an option to buy same, for the sum of $175,000 of which one half was to be paid by the 15th of August, 1918, one year after the date of the said agreement.\nThe agreement further provided that the appellant should be given possession of the said mining properties and certain appliances theretofore used in developing same and be entitled to enter into said possession immediately and operate same on a basis of making no payments, save only the payment for certain taxes, insurance, etc., not now in dispute, and for so-called royalties, if any, out of the proceeds of the shipments of ore or concentrates from the said mineral claims of which 15 per cent was to go to the credit of the respondent and the balance to the credit of the appellant.\nAs the 15th of August, 1918, when the due date of the first instalment of purchase price was to fall due, was approaching, the appellant seems to have had some conversation with the respondent upon the rather discouraging situation presented to appellant as a possibly intending purchaser.\nHe had already, in development, spent far more than expected, having regard to the results, which would fall far short of making up the first payment.\nThat was followed by a correspondence drawn out till November, and the object of it all was a negotiation for an extension of six months for the payment of the balance of the first instalment of the optional purchase price which the royalties did not cover.\nThe basis of the result of that correspondence appears in a letter from appellant to respondent, quoted in full by Mr. Justice McPhillips in his opinion dissenting from the judgment now being appealed from.\nThe respondent's letter of acceptance dated 26th October, 1918, begins thus\nI received your letter of October 19, proposing the following as modifications to the terms and conditions of our agreement for the purchase by you of the Hewitt group of mining claims in the Slocan District,\nand after reciting the proposed modifications, adds one or two minor suggestions which he couples with his assent.\nAnd thereupon by the letter of appellant dated 2nd November, 1918, he accepts same and adds, however, a warning note as to the mine not proving as promising as at one time, and the effect the Spanish influenza epidemic was having upon the available man power.\nThe appellant seems, therefore, to have done his best, and, long before the 5th of February, had paid the sum of $50,000, applicable on account of the first option, and, in course of development work throughout, was already very largely out of pocket. It was clearly evident to both at the time of this modification that he would be by the expiration of the extension granted, getting nothing but three and a half months' time to pay, at the utmost, the sum of $37,500, and probably less. In other words, for that extension of time of payment, he would (by the construction put by the courts below upon \" the modification of the terms and conditions \" of the agreement, as respondent aptly phrased what was agreed upon) be paying, or practically be made to pay, from $20,000 to $30,000 for such privilege.\nIt is sworn by appellant that it would take seven or eight months to a year to do the tunnelling provided for by said modification, and admitted by a witness for respondent seven or eight months.\nThe learned trial judge held that notwithstanding the appellant's absolute relinquishment in June, 1919, of his said option, and the acquisition by respondent, as the result of appellant's expenses, of not only the said $50,000 but about $25,000 more, the appellant was bound to go on and complete the tunnelling contemplated by the modification in November of the original agreement.\nIn other words, though the respondent had cancelled, in April, 1919, so far as he could, the contract, and the appellant relinquished all right to exercise his option, the modifying clause had to be specifically performed by appellant, or the cost thereof paid by the appellant, and, in short, be treated as an independent document instead of a mere modification of the original agreement and thus part thereof.\nI entirely dissent from any view that entertains any such consequences as within the reasonable contemplation of the parties.\nIt is quite clear to my mind that the modification contained in the correspondence must be read merely as a modification, and as if the same had, conditionally and in anticipation formed a clause therein and hence subject to the operation of all the rest of the contract or any other of its many provisions, and harmonized therewith.\nI agree so entirely with the judgment of Mr. Justice McPhillips in the court below that I need not repeat, but adopt, what he has said therein. Indeed but for the purpose of bringing prominently forward the express view of the respondent, in his letter above referred to, as to the nature of what was agreed to be done and the rule of law applicable to the basis of, and measure of, damages, being what the parties can be held to have had within reasonable contemplation, I would not have felt impelled to add anything.\nThe appeal herein should, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and the second, third and fourth clauses of the judgment of the learned trial judge be stricken out.\nThe best consideration I have been able to give to the conduct of the parties relative to the respondent's cancellation, claimed by the respondent, is that there should be no costs allowed to either in regard thereto, or to the counter-claim herein.\nThe formal judgment of the learned trial judge when thus amended will, I assume, cover an account of what the appellant got during the period between the respondent's claim to cancel, and the appellant's relinquishment, which is to me rather in doubt on the evidence and treated on the same basis as the result of operations prior to the attempted cancellation.\nDUFF J.\u2014It is not necessary in the view I take of this case to decide the questions discussed as to the construction of the agreement of the 15th August, 1917. I think when the letter of the 26th October, 1918, is read with the correspondence which preceded it, it does establish a promise on the part of the appellant as a term of the extension of the option to drive tunnel no. 8 without interruption until reaching the ore chute in the no. 7 tunnel. The appellant's obligation was no doubt subject to the implied condition that the respondent should do whatever might be necessary on his part to enable the promise to be performed, and if the option had been brought to an end by the respondent, and the appellant in consequence had been excluded from working the mine, then a case would probably have arisen in which the appellant would have been relieved from his obligation. I am far from satisfied, however, that the implied condition did become operative in the circumstances which actually arose, the appellant retaining possession of the mine and insisting upon his right to do so. It is not strictly necessary to pass upon this point, although I confess the inclination of my opinion is decidedly in favour of the view that so long as the appellant remained in possession, asserting his right to be there under the contract, his obligation continued.\nI have come to the conclusion that the obligation was an absolute one, and that the difficulties which arose, assuming that they would have constituted an excuse under the terms of the contract of 1917, afford no answer to the respondent's claim under the subsequent contract.\nThe judgment of the learned trial judge is now for the first time challenged on the ground that the rule applied for the purpose of ascertaining the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled is not the correct rule. The learned trial judge in a word held the defendant to be responsible for the cost of completing the work he had agreed to do.\nMr. Lafleur on behalf of the appellant argues that in accordance with the settled rule the damages which the plaintiff ought to receive are those which may fairly and reasonably be considered to arise from the breach, according to the usual course of things, and that applying this rule the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and only entitled to recover, the pecuniary value of the advantage he would have obtained by a performance of the contract which would, in this case, be the equivalent of any increase in the value of the mine to arise therefrom.\nIt would be inadvisable, I think, to attempt to lay down any general rule for ascertaining the damages to which a mine-owner is entitled for breach of a covenant to perform development work or exploratory work by a person holding an option of purchase. Cases may no doubt arise in which the test suggested by Mr. Lafleur's argument would be the only proper test, and difficult and intricate as the inquiry might be, it would be the duty of the court to enter upon an examination of the effect of doing the work upon the value of the property.\nOn the other hand, cases must arise in which the plaintiff's right is plainly to recover at least the cost of doing the work. If it were conclusively made out, for example, that the work to be done formed part and a necessary part of some plan of exploration or development requisite, from the miner's point of view, for developing the property as a working mine, and necessary, from the point of view of businesslike management, so that it might fairly be presumed that in the event of the option lapsing the owner would in the ordinary course have the work completed, then the damages arising in the ordinary course would include the cost of doing the work and would accordingly be recoverable under the rule.\nIn the case before us I think no serious difficulty arises. The letters appear to afford abundant evidence that both parties were proceeding upon the footing that this work was necessary in the course of developing the mine according to the owner's plans and it is upon the basis of that being accepted as a fact, I think, that the learned trial judge proceeded. No suggestion appears to have been made at the trial that he was applying an erroneous rule or that he was proceeding upon an erroneous assumption of fact; his method of arriving at the damages was not impugned in the notice of appeal nor, so far as one can gather, on the argument before the Court of Appeal; indeed, it was not until the oral argument in this court that the point was raised. In the circumstances I do not think this court can be called upon to interfere on the ground that the evidence does not adequately establish the necessity of the work. An analogous rule has been applied for the purpose of ascertaining the damages recoverable for breach of a covenant to keep in good repair in a lease or a covenant in such an instrument to sink a mine shaft. As already intimated, however, I am not disposed to base my decision upon any supposed rule of law other than the general rule to which reference has been made. Having regard to the manner in which the case was conducted in the courts of British Columbia, I think the proper application of the general rule is that which I have indicated above.\nANGLIN J.\u2014At the close of the argument I was satisfied that the construction placed by the learned trial judge (affirmed on appeal) on the contract in regard to the driving of no. 8 tunnel and the upraise work was correct. Further consideration has not changed that opinion. I also remain convinced that the excuses for non-performance preferred by the defendant do not afford an answer to the plaintiff's claim. The opinions of the trial judge and of Mr. Justice Galliher cover this aspect of the case. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover such damages as are the natural and ordinary consequence of the defendant's failure to carry out his undertaking and will compensate for the breach. Watson v. Charlesworth[1].\nThe learned judge directed a reference to ascertain\nthe quantum of such damages at the rate of $15 per foot for all work not done which was stipulated to be done by paragraph 3 of Ex. 19\nthe letter containing the defendant's undertaking to do the work in question. This, I take it, involves a determination that the proper measure of damages is what it will cost the plaintiff to do the work the defendant failed to perform.\nI see no reason to question the learned judge's explicit finding that $15 per foot will be a fair amount to allow for the cost of that work.\nWe should also, I think, import findings that the work in question formed part of a scheme the execution of which the plaintiff regarded as essential to the proper development of his mine and fully intended, in any event, to carry out. There is evidence to warrant such findings. The defendant himself reported this work to the plaintiff as the first of several\nnecessary essential improvements to make the mine a success.\nActing on the advice of Mr. M. S. Davys, a mining engineer, the plaintiff insisted on the promise by Cunningham to undertake and prosecute this work immediately and continuously as the basis of any extension to be given him. Davys deposes that he and Mr. Moore had agreed that the work in question should be done, The plaintiff relied upon Davys, and it is a fair inference not only that he regards the work as essential but that it is work which he will have done. It is probably necessary to reach that conclusion in order to justify the departure made by the trial judge from the ordinary rule that the measure of damages for breach by a defendant of a contract to perform work on the plaintiff's land is the actual pecuniary loss sustained by the plaintiff as a result of such breach, i.e., the difference between what would have been the value of the premises had the work contracted for been done and their value with it unperformed. The question is by no means free from difficulty and, as presently advised, it is only because I think the learned trial judge must have dealt with it on the footing indicated and because his having done so was warranted by the evidence that I accept the measure of damages as determined.\nReference may be had to Pell v. Shearman[2]; Mayne on Damages (9 ed.), pp. 237-8; Sedgwick on Damages (9 ed.), s. 619; Wigsell v. School for Indigent Blind[3]; Joyner v. Weeks[4]. In the last cited case the Court of Appeal (p. 43) treated the breach of a tenant's covenant to yield up premises in good repair as subject to a convenient rule of inveterate practice ordinarly applicable specially to such cases and tantamount to a rule of law that the measure of the lessor's damages should be the cost of making the omitted repairs. A recent decision of an Appellate Divisional Court in Ontario may also be averted to, M. J. O'Brien Ltd. v. Freedman[5].\nThe appeal on the counter-claim also fails. The defendant's failure to pay relieved the plaintiff from the obligation of depositing a deed in escrow and his title papers.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014After carefully considering the evidence both documentary and oral, I do not think that the appellant has made out a case for disturbing the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nIn my opinion, on the construction of the agreement entered into by the parties, by their letters of October 19, October 26, and November 2, 1918, the carrying on of the development work mentioned in paragraph three of the appellant's letter of October 19, was the consideration of the extension of time granted by the respondent for the payment of the balance of the first instalment under the option contract between the parties. It was in no wise a condition of the original option to be unenforceable in case the option to purchase was not exercised by the appellant. On the contrary, the only possible interest the respondent could have in view when he stipulated for this develop- ment work, was in case the appellant relinquished his option. If he purchased the property, and paid for it, it would be a matter of indifference to the respondent what development work had been done. Moreover, the letter stated that the work should begin immediately.\nOn all the other grounds urged by the appellant, I am content to express my full concurrence in the judgment of Mr. Justice Galliher in the Court of Appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hamilton & Wragge.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lennie & Clark.\n[1] [1905] 1 K.B. 74, 88; [1906] A.C. 14.\n[2] [1855] 10 Ex. 766.\n[3] [1882] 8 Q.B.D. 357.\n[4] [1891] 2 Q.B. 31, 37-8\n[5] 25 Ont.

Act, s. 125\u2014\"The Town Act,\" R.S.S. [1909] c. 85, ss. 2 and 301.\nCertain land' had formed part of an Indian reservation and was surrendered in trust for disposal by the Crown. Under a contract with the Crown the respondent paid an advance of $10 per acre and the Indians were to share equally with it in the proceeds of sale of the townsite lots after the respondent had recouped itself for the advance and subdivision expenses; title to be retained in the Crown and patent to issue from it direct to each purchaser from the respondent.\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that the respondent had no beneficial or proprietary interest in the land which would render it liable to assessment under \"The Town Act.\" (R.S.S. [1909] c. 85); and that the land was at the time of the assessment Crown land and as such exempt from assessment.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (16 Sask. L.R. 429) affirmed, Davies C.J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge[2] and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nChrysler K.C. and J. G. Banks for the appellant.\nD. H. Laird K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014After hearing the argument in this case and reading the judgments in the Court of Appeal I incline to the opinion that the order in council, when properly read in connection with the existent facts when it was made, as I gather them from the record and from the exhibits and plans submitted, did convey some \"interest\"\u2014an interest in the land\u2014to Mackenzie & Mann, (to which the present respondents have succeeded) though the Crown did retain to itself the legal title to such lands as trustees for the Indians on whose behalf the lands were to be held. When sold one half of the proceeds of such sales were to be given to the Indians.\nI am inclined to agree with the trial judge and would concur in the argument and substantive contention of the plaintiff. So I come to the conclusion, though not without some doubt, that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant sued respondent to recover taxes alleged to be due by virtue of assessments made upon lands which, in my opinion, were clearly vested in the Crown at the time when such assessments were made and hence void, by virtue of section 125 of the B.N.A. Act; and as they were unoccupied lands and hence not assessable against anybody under the Assessment Act of Saskatchewan, which expressly exempts the interest of the Crown in lands, including any such held in trust for the Crown, could not properly be assessed against respondent.\nA fair way to test the arguments put forward by appellant would be, to see what the legal result would be of attempting to sell the lands for non-payment of the said taxes in question.\nLet any one try to follow out anything, probable or possible, in the way of the results of such an attempted sale and ascertain what they would be and, I submit, he must see how futile such a proceeding would be on the facts presented herein.\nPresumably it is because someone has applied that test to the facts in question and realized the absurd results such an attempt would produce, that resort has been had to this suit.\nOccupants such as Smith, a lessee of the Crown, in the case of Smith v. Vermilion Hills[3], might be assessed as such and become under such an assessment debtor of the municipality and be sued as Smith was. In the facts presented herein there is nothing resembling the facts there in question.\nThere is simply presented by the order in council relied upon by the appellant a recital therein of a proposed sale by the superintendent of Indian Affairs who had no authority to sell, nor did he pretend to have, and on these facts thus presented to the Minister he discarded any such proposition, as he had a perfect right to do, and proceeded to recommend something else constituting Mackenzie & Mann sales agents on the terms set forth, and that constitutes the order in council which did not give them any interest in the lands which would be taxable.\nThe other cases cited arising out of Alberta legislation are quite irrelevant herein.\nI agree so fully with the reasoning of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal below, reaching the conclusion that the lands never were assessable and hence the assessments void, that I need not repeat same here.\nI think, therefore, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal, I think, should be dismissed. I have been unable to come to the conclusion that the transaction evidenced by the order in council of the 28th September 1904, had the effect of constituting Messrs. Mackenzie & Mann either the purchasers or the holders of any beneficial interest in the lands. The fact which appears to me to be fatal to the contention of the appellants upon this point is that the price at which the lands were to be sold is not fixed, nor is there any evidence that the arrangement included any procedure for determining the price which Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann had a legal right to insist upon being followed. No doubt the arrangement was made in the full expectation that as the policy of selling the lands had been decided upon and as both the department and Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann were interested in selling them to the best advantage, no difficulty would be experienced in agreeing upon prices. I think it must be taken from the material before us that in this most important particular the parties proceeded upon reciprocal faith in one another's reasonableness. In the circumstances an agreement that the price should be such as a court of justice should regard as reasonable cannot, I think, be implied.\nThat being so there was not, I think, in point of law either a contract or a trust legally enforceable vesting in Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann any right which could be described as a right or interest in the land.\nI think there is nothing in the Saskatchewan Assessment Act which prevents this point being raised in answer to the appellants' action. Section 389 is in identical terms with section 65 of the Ontario Assessment Act (R.S.C. c. 193) that was in question in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[4] where that section was held to be without effect when the assessment is a nullity by reason of the absence of jurisdiction.\nAdmittedly the lands assessed are, as regards the legal title, vested in the Crown, and the evidence does not indicate that they were in the occupation of the respondents except, perhaps, as agents for the department of Indian Affairs. Prima facie, therefore, they were not subject to assessment, and I think it was open to the respondents to show that the lands were the property of the Crown within the meaning of section 125 of the British North America Act.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Court of Appeal unanimously held that the respondent had no such proprietary interest in the lands in question as would render it liable to assessment under the Saskatchewan Assessment Act. The lands are vested in the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada and, as such, are exempt from assessment under the Saskatchewan statute and by virtue of the paramount authority of section 125 of the British North America Act.\nThe reasons for these conclusions are so fully and so clearly stated by Mr. Justice Turgeon in his opinion, concurred in by the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan and Mr. Justice MacKay (Martin J.A. reached the same conclusions), that it is quite unnecessary to do more than say that I accept them as the basis of my judgment dismissing this appeal.\nMignault J.\u2014The validity of the assessment which the appellant seeks to enforce depends on the answer to the question whether the respondent or the Crown in the right of the Dominion is owner of the property assessed. The learned trial judge decided this question in favour of the appellant, holding that the ownership of these lands was vested in the respondent. This judgment was unanimously reversed by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, which was of the opinion that the Crown was the owner of the lands assessed. The appeal is from the latter judgment.\nTo determine this question of ownership, it is necessary to construe the order in council of the Dominion Government, dated the 28th of September, 1904. The lands assessed were part of an Indian reserve and were surrendered to the Crown by the Indians. An agreement was then made between the Government and Messrs. Mackenzie, Mann & Co., whom the respondent now represents, the terms of which\u2014for there is no other contract\u2014are set forth in the order in council.\nThis order in council is based on a memorandum from the superintendent of Indian Affairs stating that Messrs. Mackenzie, Mann & Co., representing the Canadian Northern Railway Co.,\nare purchasers from the Department of Indian Affairs of what is known as the Kamsack Townsite comprising an area of 241.94 acres in Cote's Indian Reserve in the Pelly agency, Assiniboia. An advance of ten dollars per acre has been paid by the company, and the Indians are to share equally in the proceeds of the sales of lots after the company has recouped itself $5,000 made up of the $2,419.40 advance, and the cost of laying out the townsite, dedicating streets, etc.\nThe Minister further states that the company has applied for patent for the land in the townsite; but as owing to the circumstances that the Indians are to share with the company in the proceeds of the sales and that the sale of the townsite is necessarily incomplete, patent cannot issue therefor, it is considered that it would be well to provide for the issue of a patent to each purchaser from the company of land in the townsite on report of the sales agent.\nNotwithstanding the use of the word \"purchasers\" in the order in council, I am of opinion that the ownership of these lands remained in the Crown. This is shown by the express statement in the order in council that\nthe sale of the townsite is necessarily incomplete\nand that patent cannot issue therefor. It was recognized that the Indians, for whom the Crown was trustee, were to share with the company in the proceeds of the sales to be made and it was proposed to issue a patent to each purchaser from the company of land in the townsite on report of the sales agent.\nThe Crown therefore remained the owner of the lands until patents were issued to purchasers from the company. Mr. Chrysler for the appellant referred to section 101 of the Indian Act (R.S.C. c. 81) excepting from the general exemption from taxation of Indian lands\nthose lands, which having been surrendered by the bands owning them, though unpatented, have been located by, or sold, or agreed to be sold to any person.\nThere is here no sale or agreement of sale of these lands to the company. The most that can be said is that the order in council gave selling rights as agents to Messrs. Mackenzie, Mann & Co., their remuneration to be one-half of the proceeds, after they had recouped themselves their expenses. The company had an interest in the price to be obtained on the sale of lots, but this is not an estate or interest in the lands themselves.\nMr. Chrysler also referred to the recent decision of the Judicial Committee in City of Montreal v. Attorney General for Canada[5]. The question there was as to a provincial statute, amending the Montreal charter and providing that persons occupying for commercial or industrial purposes Crown buildings or lands should be taxed as if they were the actual owners, and should be held liable to pay municipal taxes. It was held that as the tenant was only liable as long as his occupancy continued, the taxation was in respect of his interest as lessee and accordingly was not a tax on Crown lands so as to be ultra vires under section 125 of the British North America Act.\nReference was also made to the judgment of their Lordships in Smith v. Rural Municipality of Vermilion Hills[6], where it was held that persons holding Dominion land under grazing leases could be assessed in respect of their interest in the land under such leases, \"land,\" in the taxing statute, being defined as including any estate or interest therein.\nI do not think that these cases help the appellant. The lands in question were not sold or leased to the respondent, and it has no interest or estate therein under the order in council. When it disposes of lots, the necessary patent issues to the purchaser from it but the sale would be a direct purchase by the purchaser from the Crown, even though an agreement to purchase the lots might have been made between the purchaser and the company.\nI do not attach any importance to the numerous letters written in connection with the assessment of these lands by Mr. Nichol, the representative of the respondent. Although these letters refer to the respondent as owner of the land, it is obvious that no such expression could give it a title or interest which it did not possess under the order in council. And there is no room here for the application of the doctrine of estoppel.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Banks & Stewart.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Patrick, Doherty & Cumming.\n[1] [1922] 16 Sask.

The respondent, while backing his car from his residence to the public highway, ran over and injured his minor son. The respondent took the necessary steps to have a tutor appointed to enable an action to be brought by his son against himself for damages and was condemned to pay $5,000. The respondent paid this amount to the tutor before the delay for appealing had expired and while the appellant company was considering the advisability of so appealing. The liability of the appellant under the policy was subject to certain conditions amongst which were condition A. which provided that the assured should \"at all times render to the company all co-operation and assistance within his power,\" and condition E. which provided that \"the assured shall not * * * settle any claim * * * without the written consent of the company previously given.\" Upon an action by the respondent to recover from the insurers the amount of $5,000 paid by him to the tutor.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the respondent was not entitled to recover on the policy, as such payment by him without the consent of the company was a voluntary payment and constituted a settlement of the claim made in violation of condition E. of the policy.\nPer Davies C.J. and Duff J.\u2014Such payment was moreover made in violation of condition A. of the policy.\nHeld also that the respondent was guilty of actionable negligence against his own child for which he was liable under Art. 1053 C.C.

A minor son has no right of action against his father for damages caused by a quasi-d\u00e9lit (a tort) of the latter. Newton v. Seeley[2]; Clark v. Bonsal[3]; Hensley v. McDowell Furniture Co.[4]; Hewlett v. George[5]; McKelvey v. McKelvey[6]; Roller v. Roller[7]; Taubert v. Taubert[8].\nThe accident in question was not caused \"by reason of the use, ownership or maintenance of the automobile\" within the terms of the policy.\nConditions of the policy had been violated by the respondent, as he has not at all times rendered to the company all co-operation in his power, contrary to condition A. and he has paid the amount of the judgment to the tutor without the appellant company's consent, contrary to condition E. of the policy. P\u00e9lissier K.C. for the respondent. A minor child has the right to sue his own father for tort, as the general rule of liability contained in article 1053 C.C. is in as wide terms as possible and renders every person responsible for damage caused by his fault to another.\nThe respondent has complied with all his obligations under the policy.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is a very curious and unique case and nothing similar to it has occurred in my experience. The plaintiff respondent in the course of using his automobile while backing from his gate into the public highway ran over and seriously injured his own little son, aged five and a half years. The respondent was in my opinion clearly guilty of actionable negligence for which he was liable under the civil law of Quebec, article 1053 C.C. Respondent took the necessary steps to have a tutor appointed for his little boy to enable an action to be brought against the respondent for damages for his negligence. He had previously taken out an automobile assurance policy with the appellant company indemnifying him against loss \"from the liability imposed by law\" for damages on account\nof bodily injuries or death suffered by any person or persons as the result of an accident occurring by reason of the use, ownership or maintenance of any of the automobiles described in this policy.\n(which included the one in question).\nThe liability of the company under the policy was expressly subject to certain conditions amongst which were conditions \"A\" and \"E,\" the latter reading as follows:\nThe assured shall not voluntarily assume any liability nor interfere in any negotiations or legal proceedings conducted by the company on account of any claim; nor, except at his cost, settle any claim, nor incur any other expense without the written consent of the company previously given; except that he may provide at the time of the accident, and at the cost of the company, such immediate surgical relief as is imperative.\nThe tutor appointed for the injured boy was so appointed at the instance of the respondent plaintiff and brought an action against the latter to recover damages for the boys' injuries in which $5,000 was recovered against the respondent. I do not rest my judgment upon the action of respondent in causing a tutor to be appointed and bringing an action against himself for damages, but it seems to me beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff in settling the action and paying to the tutor the damages found in the action before the time for appealing the same had expired and while the matter of appeal from the judgment was being considered by the company, acted in violation of condition \"A\" which inter alia provided that the assured should\nat all times render to the company all co-operation and assistance within his power,\nand in direct violation of condition \"E\" as above set forth.\nThe question of the company's appealing from the judgment against the respondent for damages was under consideration by the company at the very time the respondent plaintiff paid the claim. It was a voluntary payment on his part and it was a settlement of the claim\nwithout the written consent of the company previously given.\nThe excuse put forward that the plaintiff respondent feared an execution might be issued against him cannot be considered for a moment in view of the fact that he himself while defendant in the action was really dominus litis and so controlled all the proceedings therein. The payment was made without the appellant company's consent and not only contrary to the provision in condition \"A\" that he should at\nall times render to the company all co-operation in his power,\nbut also to the express conditions of condition \"E\" above set forth.\nSo far from co-operating with the company he acted without their knowledge or written consent in paying the judgment recovered against him before the time for appealing such judgment had expired.\nOn these latter grounds I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge and those of the learned judges in the Court of King's Bench (save the items of dissent on the part of Mr. Justice Howard relative to the construction he puts upon the verdict of the jury in the case of Marchand v. Marchand) in their answer to the fourth question, and the conclusion reached by the trial judge to allow the respondent's claim, and by the Court of King's Bench to dismiss the appeal therefrom.\nI cannot agree with said dissenting item in Mr. Justice Howard's opinion judgment.\nIt is to be observed that the learned trial judge in that case was perhaps in a better position to interpret and construe that answer than any other judge who has had to consider it and hence his view should have great weight in that regard.\nThe several objections taken by the appellant before us seem to have been all taken in the courts below and so thoroughly dealt with as to cover everything involved in this appeal and furnish a complete answer thereto.\nCounsel for appellant before us seemed to lay more stress upon the payment, of the judgment in the case of Marchand v. Marchand, by the defendant therein and now respondent herein, before the expiration of the time for appealing had actually expired in that case, and hence deprived appellant of its rights under the conditions in its policy, than on some of their other objections.\nI may therefore be permitted to remark that anything and everything material in way of legal objection that could have been taken in such an appeal has been argued over again in this case both in the trial court determining this case, and in the Court of King's Bench, and decided against the present appellant's contention.\nAnd if the majority of this court take the view that I do, as expressed above, it will be thus demonstrated that the appellant never had anything in law or fact to appeal about and hence has in no way been damaged, but saved costs of an unfounded appeal\u2014if it ever had intended to appeal\u2014which I do not believe it ever had.\nOf course I am of the same opinion as some of those dealing with the point below who seemed inclined to hold that the payment made, under the circumstances, was not such an acquiescence in the judgment as to bar an appeal and hence if appellant had been sincerely desirous of appealing and believed to be so, it could have got an appeal therefrom notwithstanding such payment.\nI hold that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The claim of the respondent against the appellants was under a policy of insurance by which the appellants agreed to indemnify the respondent against loss from the liability imposed by law upon him for damages on account of bodily injuries or death resulting from an accident caused by reason of the use of the respondent's automobile. A most distressing accident having occurred, in which a young child of the respondent was injured by the respondent's automobile, proceedings were taken on behalf of the child and judgment recovered against the father, and the respondent's claim in the action out of which this appeal arises was for indemnity in respect of this judgment. One ground of defence was that in point of law an infant child has no right of action against his father by the law of Quebec in respect of injuries caused by the father's tort. As regards that contention, I will merely say that in face of the unrestricted terms of article 1053 I could not give my adherence to it in the absence of some text of law or some very decisive authority. No such text or authority has been referred to, and my conclusion is that the contention cannot be maintained.\nThe appellant company is, however, I think entitled to succeed on other grounds. By two conditions of the policy, (a) and (e), the assured is required, upon the occurrence of an accident, immediately to give the fullest information obtainable to the company, in writing, and if a claim is made on account of the accident, to give notice of it with full particulars. If a suit is brought, the assured is required to forward to the company every summons or other process as soon as the same has been served on him. It is expressly declared that the company \"reserves the right to settle any claim or suit.\" The assured is required, when requested by the company, to give aid in securing information, in affecting settlements, and in prosecuting appeals; and it is specifically declared that\nthe assured shall at all times render to the company all co-operation and assistance within his power.\nFurther, the assured undertakes not to assume voluntarily any liability, nor to interfere in any legal proceedings conducted by the company on account of any claim, nor,\nexcept at his own cost, to settle any claim * * * without the written consent of the company previously given. The respondent, acting as he conceived, no doubt, in pursuance of his duty to protect the interests of his child, took steps by calling a family council and obtaining the appointment of a tutor, and in instructing attorneys to have legal proceedings instituted; and it is not seriously disputed that in the course of these legal proceedings the respondent did all he thought he could honestly do to further the interests of the plaintiff in the litigation. The appellant company at an early date, before, indeed, filing a plea to the action, advised the respondent that it proposed to take up the defence of the tutor's action as entitled to do by the terms of the policy; that the company would appear and defend in the respondent's name, but that in doing so it had no intention of renouncing any of its rights as against the respondent under the terms of the policy. The respondent is notified that the company is entitled to expect from him the assistance guaranteed by him, and he is at the same time advised that in view of his conduct, the company is entitled by reason of breach of conditions of the policy on his part to repudiate responsibility, and that it reserves the right to do so after judgment in the action. Judgment was recovered, and while the appellant company was considering the advisability of appealing the respondent paid the amount of the judgment. I think it is not open to serious question that this payment was a voluntary payment. In form, no doubt, it was a payment made under pressure of execution or imminent execution, but that pressure was applied, not only with the consent of the respondent, but, one can have no manner of doubt, by his instigation. Pressure and payment were alike aimed at the same purpose, that of enabling the respondent to advance against the appellant company a claim for indemnity.\nThis transaction is within the letter of the conditions above mentioned as being a \"settlement\" of the plaintiff's claim without the written consent of the company, and it is within the object and the spirit of the conditions mentioned, in that it was an act of a kind plainly within the contemplation of those conditions, namely, a collusive act, having for its purpose to assist the recovery of reparation from the insurance company through means of a judgment against the respondent. It is of no relevancy that the claim against the respondent was a valid one, and one which, in the ordinary course, if the conditions of the policy had been complied with, the appellant company would ultimately have been obliged to pay. The conditions are perfectly reasonable conditions, framed with the object of protecting the insurance company against risk of collusion between the automobile owner and persons claiming damages for alleged torts. Such conditions would be robbed of nearly all practical value if in applying them the question of the validity of the professed claim must be investigated. For the purpose of protecting the company against collusion in relation to fabricated or unfounded claims, it is necessary that the conditions should exclude the possibility of such conduct in connection with any claim of any character.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am satisfied that the injury to the plaintiff's minor son was a \"bodily injury caused by reason of the use of\" the insured's automobile within the meaning of clause no. 1 of the policy sued upon.\nThe answer to the question whether a minor can maintain an action for an offence or quasi-offence against his father depends in this case upon the civil law of Quebec. The numerous American opinions cited by counsel for the appellant (to which I might add a reference to Eversley on Domestic Relations (3rd ed.), p. 578) are not authoritative. The case appears to fall within article 1053 C.C. and I am by no means convinced that considerations of public policy require the courts to refuse to entertain such an action. However, it is not necessary to determine that important question on this appeal.\nWhile I am not satisfied that the steps taken by the respondent to enable an action to be brought against himself on behalf of his son avoided the policy sued upon, his payment of the judgment recovered in that action before the time for appealing against it had expired was, in my opinion, the settlement of \"a claim * * * without the written consent of the company previously given\" in violation of condition (E) of the policy, which precludes recovery. I cannot think that the plaintiff stood in any real danger of a seizure being made in execution of the judgment against him. His obvious control of the proceedings in the action brought in the name of the tutor of his son makes it reasonably certain that he did not.\nOn this ground I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal must be allowed.\nMignault J.\u2014The case submitted for our decision is certainly an extraordinary one.\nThe respondent, owner of an automobile, obtained from the appellant an automobile liability policy, whereby the appellant agreed to indemnify him\nagainst loss from the liability imposed by law upon the assured for damages on account of bodily injuries or death suffered by any person or persons as the result of an accident occurring while this policy is in force by reason of the use, ownership, or maintenance of any of the automobiles described * * * while used * * * within the limits of the United States of America and Canada.\nThe appellant also agreed\nto defend in the name and on behalf of the assured any suit brought against the assured to enforce a claim, whether groundless or not, for damages on account of bodily injuries or death suffered, or alleged to have been suffered, by any person or persons within the limits designated in the preceding paragraph and under the circumstances therein described and as the result of an accident occurring while this policy is in force.\nThe policy was made subject to certain conditions of which the two following are material to the issue:\u2014\nA: Upon the occurrence of an accident the assured shall give immediate written notice thereof, with the fullest information obtainable at the time, to the company at its home office or to the agent who has countersigned this policy. If a claim is made on account of such accident the assured shall give like notice thereof with full particulars. If thereafter any suit is brought against the assured to enforce such a claim, the assured shall immediately forward to the company at its home office every summons or other process as soon as the same shall have been served on him. The company reserves the right to settle any claim or suit. Whenever requested by the company, the assured shall aid in securing information, evidence, and the attendance of witnesses; in effecting settlements; and in prosecuting appeals. The assured shall at all times render to the company all co-operation and assistance within his power. E: The assured shall not voluntarily assume any liability; nor interfere in any negotiations or legal proceedings conducted by the company on account of any claim; nor, except at his own cost, settle any claim, nor incur any other expense without the written consent of the company previously given; except that he may provide at the time of the accident, and at the cost of the company, such immediate surgical relief as is imperative. The amount of the policy was $5,000 for loss from an accident resulting in bodily injuries to or in the death of one person.\nWhile the policy was in force, on the 6th June, 1919, at St. Genevieve, Quebec, the respondent, when backing his car along a semi-private road leading from his residence to the public highway, and when moving reversely on the highway in order to turn the car in the direction of the village where he desired to go, had the misfortune to very seriously injure his minor son, Sarto, aged five and a half years, who was running or playing in the vicinity of the automobile. As required by his policy he promptly notified the appellant of the accident. Of course, the respondent secured medical and surgical care for his child and disbursed therefor certain sums of money. This he could do under the policy without admitting liability or affecting his recourse against the appellant. Some negotiations appear to have been carried on between the respondent and the appellant, the former seeking to have the latter pay the amount stipulated under the policy, but the appellant disputed its liability.\nThe respondent then conceived what I may describe, without using the term offensively, as a most extraordinary scheme in order to obtain from the appellant the amount of his policy. He took the initiative of having a tutor appointed to his minor son in the person of his brother, Alphonse Marchand, and had the family council summoned for that purpose and on its advice Alphonse Marchand was made tutor, and Adrien Marchand, another brother, subrogate tutor. This was clearly done in order that the respondent might have an action instituted against himself by the tutor acting for the child. And unnecessarily, because no judicial authorization is required by a tutor in order to take an action on behalf of his ward (article 304 C.C.), the tutor was authorized, on the advice of the family council, to institute an action claiming $5,000 from the respondent by reason of the injuries sustained by his minor son. The respondent assisted at the family council and took part in its deliberations.\nAction claiming $5,000 as damages was then taken by the tutor on behalf of Sarto Marchand against the respondent upon whom the action was duly served. The respondent, as required by the policy, sent the papers served on him to the appellant, and the latter decided to defend the action, as it was bound to do, and so notified the respondent in writing. Defence was entered by attorneys employed by the appellant in the name of the respondent and, option for a jury trial having been made, the trial took place in October, 1920. The respondent gave his testimony and the jury found that he had not taken the required precautions to avoid the accident, their answer being\nIl aurait pu \u00e9viter l'accident en \u00e9loignant l'enfant de l'auto de quelque mani\u00e8re.\nand they assessed the damages at $5,000.\nOn this finding, which was taken to be a finding of negligence, judgment was entered on the 7th of October against the respondent in favour of the tutor for $5,000. It may be added, because the appellant laid some stress on this point, that when the respondent desired to take advice as to these proceedings and his dealings with the appellant, he invariably consulted Mr. P\u00e9lissier K.C., who was the attorney of the plaintiff in the damage suit.\nThe legal delays for issuing execution on this judgment, fifteen days, expired on October 22, and, by the law governing the action, appeal could have been taken within two months from the date of the judgment. Nothing was done on either side until the 2nd of November, except that the attorneys employed by the appellant were asked if they intended to appeal, and the purport of the answer of a junior member of the firm, who was not charged with the case, is the subject of conflicting testimony.\nOn the 2nd of November, the respondent paid the amount of the judgment, with interest and costs, and on the same date a letter was written by Messrs. P\u00e9lissier, Wilson and St. Pierre, the attorneys for the tutor in the damage action, to the appellant advising it of this payment and stating that they were instructed by the respondent to take action against the appellant to recover the amount due under the policy. The answer of the appellant protested against this payment, which was made without notice, and at a time when, says the appellant, it was seriously considering the advisability of taking an appeal from the judgment The present action ensued, and the respondent succeeded before the Superior Court and the Court of King's Bench, Mr. Justice Howard dissenting in the latter ' court.\nMr. Lafleur, on behalf of the appellant, submitted three questions for the consideration of this court 1. Has a minor son a right of action against his father for damages caused by a quasi d\u00e9lit (a tort) of the latter? 2. Assuming that a right of action exists, does the accident in question come within the policy? 3. Assuming that both these questions are answered adversely to the appellant, has the respondent fulfilled his contractual obligation to co-operate with the appellant?\nI will deal with each of these questions in the order mentioned.\nFirst question. Before this case was submitted, I may frankly say that I had never heard of a civil action by or on behalf of a minor child against his father or mother, claiming damages for injuries caused by the negligence of the latter. In its factum, the appellant refers to a very recent decision by a North Carolina court in which, on grounds of public policy, it was held that such an action does not lie, and the judgment mentions some American cases apparently to the same effect Such decisions, however, are not authorities before our courts. In the absence of authority to the contrary, the question really is whether an exception founded on family relationship can be admitted in view of the very general rule of liability contained in article 1053 of the civil code. This rule is in as wide terms as possible and renders every person capable of distinguishing right from wrong responsible for damage caused by his fault to another. There is here no limitation, no exception of persons, and the class of those to whom compensation is due is as wide as that of the persons on whom liability is imposed. It seems, therefore, sufficient to say lex non distinguit, however repugnant it may seem that a minor child should sue his own father, although it would probably be equally repugnant that a child injured by his father's negligent act, perhaps maimed for life, should have no redress for the damage he has suffered. I think, therefore, that the first question must be answered in the affirmative.\nSecond question. This question calls for an examination of the terms of the policy and the circumstances of the accident. There is undoubtedly here a liability imposed by law, whether article 1053 C.C. be alone considered or whether it be supplemented by article 1406 R.S.Q. placing on the owner or driver of a motor vehicle the burden of proof that the loss or damage did not arise through his negligence or improper conduct. It is argued that the answer of the jury that the negligence of the respondent consisted in not having removed his minor child from the vicinity of the automobile shows that the accident was not caused \"by reason of the use of the automobile\" but by the failure of the respondent to take proper care of his child. The testimony of the respondent at the trial of the damage action is, however, to the effect that when he backed the car on the public highway, looking backwards to the left, he knew that his child was \"\u00e0 l'avant de ma machine, a droite.\" It was negligence of the grossest kind to turn his front wheels, as he says he did, knowing that his child was on the front of the car to the right while he looked backwards to the left. This undoubtedly was negligence in the use of the automobile, and the answer of the jury surely means that the respondent should not have moved his car when he knew that, instead of obeying his order to return to the house, the child was still in the vicinity of the front wheels, or, in other words, it was an act of negligence to set the car in motion without seeing that the child was away from the wheels. This question must therefore be answered in the affirmative.\nThird question. This is really the determining inquiry as to the right of the respondent to recover from the appellant the amount of the policy. It was the duty of the respondent, under conditions A. and E., in the event of a suit taken against him on account of an accident; (a) to immediately forward to the company every summons or other process as soon as served on him; (b) when requested by the company to aid in securing information, evidence and the attendance of witnesses, in effecting settlements and in prosecuting appeals; (c) at all times to render to the company all co-operation and assistance within his power; (d) not to voluntarily assume any liability or interfere in any negotiations or legal proceedings conducted by the company on account of any claim; (e) except at his cost, not to settle any claim, nor incur any other expense, except for immediate surgical relief at the time of the accident, without the written consent of the company previously given.\nAll these contractual obligations of the respondent may be summed up by stating that it was his duty to co-operate with the appellant in the event of a suit being taken against him on account of an accident in the use of his automobile. Has the respondent fulfilled this duty?\nHe undoubtedly sent to the company a copy of the summons and process served on him and he does not appear to have refused to give information when required. But he caused the suit to be taken against him, and paid the amount of the judgment without the consent of the appellant. Is that rendering to the company all co-operation and assistance within his power?\nIt is said that it was his duty as a father to protect his minor child and to indemnify him for the damage he had caused him (article 165 C.C.). It may be observed that the duty to indemnify a person injured by the negligence of the driver of an automobile would exist even towards a stranger, and the maxim of the Roman law, neminem laedere, quoted by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec, merely expresses the universal duty which is laid down in general terms by article 1053 C.C.\nBut granting that this duty is of a more cogent character in the case of a father who negligently injures his own child, nothing prevented the respondent, who is a man of considerable means, from repairing the injury out of his own moneys. But the point is that nothing was further from the intention of the respondent; his idea was to make the appellant pay the indemnity, and for that reason the action which the respondent caused to be taken against himself was limited to the amount of the policy, no more and no less. To succeed against the appellant on the policy, the respondent must have fulfilled his contractual obligations, and it is no answer to say that he preferred his parental duty to his contractual one.\nNo one would contend that if the respondent had negligently injured the child of a neighbour, he could, consistently with his obligation to co-operate with the appellant, take the initiative of the action instituted against him. In my opinion, his relationship to the victim of the accident does not alter his contractual obligation towards the appellant, if he desires to recover on the policy. It is not the respondent's son who was insured but the respondent himself, and the appellant's contract was to indemnify him subject to the conditions of the policy. If the respondent has violated these conditions he cannot recover the insurance, even if his only object was to fulfil his duty towards his child. It merely obscures the issue to say that the respondent did what any father would have done, what one of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench stated he would himself have done, had he negligently injured his child. The real question is whether the respondent has fulfilled his contractual obligation to co-operate with the appellant; and if he has not done so he cannot recover on the policy.\nBut even if the respondent's conduct in taking 'the initiative of the damage action instituted against him could be reconciled with his contractual obligations towards the appellant, I am of opinion that he clearly violated condition E when he paid the amount of the judgment without the written consent, or any consent, of the appellant. It is said that there was a judgment against him, that execution of this judgment was then due and that the respondent was not obliged to wait until his property was seized before settling it. It suffices to answer the respondent was in no danger of an execution or a seizure; he fully controlled the whole proceedings which he had initiated and was really the dominus litis, although nominally the condemned defendant. And a right of appeal still existed to which the voluntary acquiescence of the respondent put an end. The least that can be said is that the respondent should not have paid before notifying the appellant and giving it the opportunity to appeal from the judgment if it was so minded. It may be objected that where a person insured under a liability policy negligently injures one of his own minor children, it is difficult to fulfil the conditions of the policy as to non-interference in a damage action and co-operation with the insurer. Even if that be so, the conditions of the contract must govern the contracting parties. Here the initiative of having a tutor named to the minor could have been taken by any relative (article 250 C.C.). And I entirely fail to see why collusion with the plaintiff should be allowed when the latter is a blood relative and forbidden when he is a stranger. In every case the contract, and not the relations between the insured and the injured party, must determine the right of recovery.\nWith all possible deference therefore I cannot concur in the reasoning which prevailed in the courts below on this crucial question. In my opinion, the respondent has not fulfilled the conditions of the policy and has therefore no right of recovery against the appellant.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the respondent's action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Elliott & David.\nSolicitors for the respondent: P\u00e9lissier, Fortier & Thibaudeau.\n[1] [1923] Q.R. 35 K.B. 5.\n[2] [1919] 177 N.C. 528.\n[3] [1911] 157 N.C. 270.\n[4] [1913] 164 N.C. 148.\n[5] [1891] 68 Miss. 703.\n[6] [1903] 111 Tenn. 388.\n[7] [1905] 37 Wash. 243.\n[8] [1908] 103 Minn. 247.\n"}
