Machacek, [1961] S.C.R. 163\nDate: 1961-01-24\nHer Majesty The Queen Appellant;\nand\nJoseph Machacek Respondent.\n1960: December 2; 1961: January 24.\nPresent: Locke, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OP ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014False statements in returns\u2014Limitation of actions\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 693\u2014Income Tax Act, R.B.C. 1952, c. 148, s. 132(1)(a), 136(4)\u2014The Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 41.\nStatutes\u2014Whether repeal by implication of special enactment by later general enactment.\nThe respondent was charged under the Income Tax Act with having made false statements in his income tax returns for each of the years 1953 to 1956 inclusive. With the exception of the charge relating to the year 1953, the charges were laid after the six-month period provided in s. 693(2) of the Criminal Code for summary conviction matters, but within the five-year time limit provided in s. 136(4) of the Income Tax Act. The charge with respect to 1953 was laid more than six months after the subject-matter arose, but within one year from the day certified by the Minister as the day on which evidence, sufficient, in his opinion, to justify a prosecution for the offence, came to his knowledge.\nThe respondent was convicted on all four charges, which convictions were affirmed on appeal to the district Court. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, by a majority, allowed the respondent's appeal from this decision on the grounds that, contrary to the provisions of s. 693(2) of the Code, the proceedings had been instituted more than six months after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose. Leave was granted to the Crown to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the convictions restored.\nSection 136(4) of the Income Tax Act was properly applicable to the present proceedings. These were \"proceedings\" within the definition contained in s. 692(1) (d) of the Criminal Code. By virtue of s. 693(1), Part XXIV of the Code was applicable to them \"except where otherwise provided by law\". The words of this subsection meant not only that the application of the whole of Part XXIV may be excluded where it is otherwise provided by law, but also that, although Part XXIV may be generally applicable, any portion of it may be excluded from operation if otherwise provided by law. Subsection (2) of s. 693 is a part of Part XXIV and its application in these proceedings was excluded because s. 136(4) of the Income Tax Act otherwise provided with respect to the time for the taking of proceedings. Jorgenson v. North Vancouver Magistrate et al. 28 W.W.R. 265, referred to.\nThe contention of the respondent that s. 136(4) of the Act was repealed by implication by s. 693(2) of the Code (which took effect at a later date) was rejected.\nThe assessments of tax made by the Minister on the basis of the returns filed by the respondent had no bearing in relation to the charges laid and did not preclude the magistrate from trying them.\nThe two periods of time mentioned in s. 136(4) of the Act are alternative and the charges were properly laid within the five-year time limit provided in the subsection.\nThe final contention that this Court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the Supreme Court Act gives no right of appeal to the Attorney General of Canada from a judgment of a provincial court of appeal quashing a conviction for a non-indictable offence was also rejected.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, reversing a judgment of Feir C.J.D.C. Appeal allowed.\nS. Samuels, for the appellant.\nK. E. Eaton and P. Haljan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Martland J.:\u2014The respondent was charged on April 20, 1959, under the Income Tax Act, with having made false statements in his income tax returns for each of the years 1953 to 1956 inclusive. With the exception of the charge relating to the year 1953, the charges were laid more than six months, but less than five years, from the time when the subject-matter arose. The charge with respect to the year 1953 was laid more than six months after the subject-matter arose, but within one year from the day certified by the Minister of National Revenue as the day on which evidence, sufficient, in his opinion, to justify a prosecution for the offence, came to his knowledge.\nThe respondent was convicted on all four charges, which convictions were affirmed, on appeal, by the Chief Judge of the District of Southern Alberta. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, by a majority of two to one, allowed the respondent's appeal2 from this decision on the grounds that, contrary to the provisions of s. 693(2) of the Criminal Code, the proceedings had been instituted more than six months after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose. There were four other grounds of appeal raised before the Appellate Division, but the ground on which the majority decision was rested was the only one which was regarded as meriting consideration. Leave was granted to the appellant to appeal to this Court.\nThe ground on which the appeal was allowed raises the issue as to whether the time within which the proceedings had to be commenced was governed by subs. (4) of s. 136 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, or by subs. (2) of s. 693 of the Criminal Code. The relevant subsection of the Income Tax Act and s. 693 of the Criminal Code provide as follows:\n136. (4) An information or complaint under the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to summary convictions, in respect of an offence under this Act, may be laid or made on or before a day 5 years from the time when the matter of the information or complaint arose or within one year from the day on which evidence, sufficient in the opinion of the Minister to justify a prosecution for the offence, came to his knowledge, and the Minister's certificate as to the day on which such evidence came to his knowledge is conclusive evidence thereof.\n693. (1) Except where otherwise provided by law, this Part applies to proceedings as denned in this Part. (2) No proceedings shall be instituted more than six months after the time when the subject matter of the proceedings arose.\n\"Proceedings\", for the purpose of Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, are defined in s. 692(1)(d) as follows:\n(d) \"proceedings\" means\n(i) proceedings in respect of offences that are declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada or an enactment made thereunder to be punishable on summary conviction, and\n(ii) proceedings where a justice is authorized by an Act of the Parliament of Canada or an enactment made thereunder to make an order;\nThe provision of the earlier Criminal Code, which preceded s. 693, was s. 1142, which read as follows:\n1142. In the case of any offence punishable on summary conviction, if no time is specially limited for making any complaint, or laying any information, in the Act or law relating to the particular case, the complaint shall be made, or the information laid, within six months from the time when the matter of the complaint or information arose, except in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory, in all which Territories the time within which such complaint may be made or such information laid shall be twelve months from the time when the matter of the complaint or information arose.\nThe Income Tax Act, as part of the Revised Statutes of Canada of 1952, was proclaimed in force on September 15, 1953. The present Criminal Code received royal assent on June 26, 1954, and took effect on April 1, 1955. The contention of the respondent, which succeeded before the Appellate Division, was that subs. (4) of s. 136 of the Income Tax Act was repealed by implication by subs. (2) of s. 693 of the Criminal Code. The issue was defined and resolved in the majority decision of the Appellate Division as follows:\nIn relation to the points in issue in the present case, it does seem to me that there are two reasonable constructions to be placed upon sec. 693(2) of the Code, the first being that its meaning is governed by the expression appearing in sec. 693(1) \"Except where otherwise provided by law\", and the second, that the limitation period of six months is of general application and would apply to sec. 132(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 136(4) of the latter Act.\nThough I lean to the first construction as being the more reasonable, nevertheless I cannot say that the second construction is not reasonably possible. In other words, I have a reasonable doubt of the meaning of sec. 693, which the application of the canons of interpretation has failed to solve. I am in doubt whether the words of sec. 693(2) can have their proper operation without altering the effect of the limitation clause of the Income Tax Act. Such being the case, it seems to me that considering that the statute is a penal one, I should give the benefit of the doubt to the accused and adopt the construction which is the more lenient one. When the liberty of the subject is involved, it seems to me that the legislation pertaining thereto should be so clear as to leave no room for reasonable doubt.\nThe issue had been decided adversely to the respondent in the Courts below on the ground that the application of s. 136(4) of the Income Tax Act was preserved by virtue of subs. (1) of s. 693 of the Criminal Code. Johnson J.A., who delivered the dissenting judgment in the Appellate Division, rested his decision on the proposition that the two subsections could stand independently of each other and that s. 136(4) of the Income Tax Act had not been repealed by implication. He referred to the proposition stated by A. L. Smith J. in Kutner v. Phillips3:\nNow a repeal by implication is only effected when the provisions of a later enactment are so inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of an earlier one, that the two cannot stand together, in which case the maxim, \"Leges posteriores contrarias abrogant\" (2 Inst. 685) applies.\nUnless two Acts are so plainly repugnant to each other, that effect cannot be given to both at the same time, a repeal will not be implied, and special Acts are not repealed by general Acts unless there is some express reference to the previous legislation, or unless there is a necessary inconsistency in the two Acts standing together: Thorpe v. Adams (1871) L.R. 6 C.P. 125, 40 L.J.M.C. 52.\nThe conclusion of Johnson J.A., respecting this issue, was as follows:\nProsecutions for income tax offences, particularly of the kind we are considering, present particular problems. Because of the large number of returns which must be made before a certain date and because violations can only be detected after investigations which involve an examination of the suspect's books and records and other records (in the present case the records of banks and the wheat board provided some of the evidence) it becomes clear that a longer than ordinary limitation period must be required for such cases. To apply the limitation of the Code subsection to such cases would mean that few, if any, prosecutions could be laid under the summary trial provisions of the Code, and an accused could only be prosecuted, except in very few instances, by indictment with its heavier and mandatory penalties.\nThese are matters which we are entitled to consider in deciding whether or not sec. 136(4) has been impliedly repealed.\nMy opinion is that s. 136(4) of the Income Tax Act is properly applicable to the present proceedings. These were \"proceedings\" within the definition contained in s. 692(1) (d) of the Criminal Code. By virtue of s. 693(1), Part XXIV of the Criminal Code was applicable to them \"except where otherwise provided by law\". I have considered carefully the view expressed by Coady J.A. in Jorgenson v. North Vancouver Magistrate et al4, as to the effect of this subsection, but I construe those words as meaning not only that the application of the whole of Part XXIV may be excluded where it is otherwise provided by law, but also that, although Part XXIV may be generally applicable, any portion of it may be excluded from operation if otherwise provided by law. Subsection (2) of s. 693 is a part of Part XXIV and, in my view, its application in these proceedings was excluded because s. 136(4) of the Income Tax Act otherwise provided when it stated:\nAn information or complaint under the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to summary convictions, in respect of an offence under this Act, may be laid or made on or before a day 5 years from the time when the matter of the information or complaint arose \u2026\nIn addition, I also agree with the conclusions reached by Johnson J.A., for the reasons which he states, that this is not a case in which it can be said that there has been any repeal of s. 136(4) by implication.\nThe respondent raised other grounds to support the quashing of the convictions, which had previously been submitted to the Appellate Division, and also one additional ground relating to the jurisdiction of this Court.\nIt was contended that in summary conviction proceedings for income tax offences an assessment made under the Income Tax Act is binding on the court of criminal jurisdiction which deals with the matter. In the present case no re-assessment had been made of the income tax payable by the respondent for the years in question and it was, therefore, urged that the magistrate who tried the charges was bound by the assessments which had been made. There does not appear to be any substance in this contention. The charges were laid, under s. 132(1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, for unlawfully making false statements in the returns filed by the respondent. It seems to me that the assessments of tax made by the Minister on the basis of those returns had no bearing whatever in relation to these charges and certainly did not preclude the magistrate from trying them. It was also argued that, in so far as the charges relating to the years 1954 to 1956 inclusive were concerned, they were barred even under the provisions of s. 136(4) of the Income Tax Act. This argument rested on the proposition that the charges in question had not been brought within one year from the date when the Minister had sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution. No certificate as to the Minister's knowledge had been filed in respect of these three charges.\nAs I read s. 136(4), the charges could be laid within five years from the time when the matter of the information or complaint arose, irrespective of the day on which, in the Minister's opinion, there was sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution. It seems to me that the two periods of time mentioned in s. 136(4) are alternative and these charges were properly laid within the five-year time limit provided in the subsection.\nAs to the next point raised in argument, the material to which we were referred by counsel for the respondent does not justify the contention that the respondent had been deprived of a fair trial.\nFinally it was contended that this Court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, as amended, gives no right of appeal to the Attorney General of Canada from a judgment of a provincial court of appeal quashing a conviction for a non-indictable offence.\nIt is clear that under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act leave may be given for an appeal from a final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort of a province upon a question of law in relation to an offence other than an indictable offence. Leave was given in this case on a motion made on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, who had been described as the respondent in the notice of appeal filed by the present respondent, when he appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. In my opinion, leave could properly be given to the appellant named in the present appeal to appeal, on the questions of law stated, from the judgment which had been rendered by the Appellate Division. The case of Dennis v. The Queen 5, which was referred to in argument by the respondent, does not assist his contention. That case was concerned with the matter of the proper person to be served with a notice of appeal on an appeal under the provisions of Part XXIV of the Criminal Code. It was held that, on an appeal under that Part by the accused, the notice of appeal must be served upon the informant. I do not see how the decision has any application to the present issue.\nFor the foregoing reasons, in my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the convictions restored.\nAppeal allowed and convictions restored.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. A. Driedger, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Paul Haljan, Edmonton.\n1 (1960), 32 W.W.R. 73, 14 D.T.C. 1166.\n2 (1960), 32 W.W.R. 73, 14 D.T.C. 1166.\n3 [1891] 2 Q.B. 267 at 271, 60 L.J.Q.B. 505.\n4 (1959), 28 W.W.R. 265 at 267, 30 C.R. 333.\n5 [1958] S.C.R. 473, 28 C.R. 173\n"}

Respondents.\n1960: November 10; 1961: January 24.\nPresent: Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Revenue\u2014Decision of Tariff Board that \"Clorox\" is properly classifiable under tariff item 219a\u2014Earlier decision that product not so classifiable\u2014Whether estoppel per rem judicatam\u2014Product used as a bleach and as a disinfectant\u2014Customs Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58, ss. 44(3), 46(1)(2).\nThe Tariff Board found that Clorox, a product consisting of sodium hypochlorite in solution and imported into Canada by the respondent, Oppenheimer Brothers & Company, was properly classifiable under Tariff Item 219a. An appeal from this decision was dismissed by the Exchequer Court, and the appellants then appealed to this Court. In both Courts the question of law considered was whether the Tariff Board erred in holding that the product known under the trade mark \"Clorox\" imported into Canada was properly classifiable for tariff purposes under Tariff Item 219a.\nAppellants contended that the opinion of the Tariff Board in a former appeal (No. 363) that Clorox was not properly classifiable under Tariff Item 219a, formed an estoppel per rem judicatam to a consideration of the same issue in the present appeal (No. 398). They also argued that the principal and chief use of the product should be considered in determining whether the product could qualify as a preparation for disinfecting under Tariff Item 219a and that, as the principal use of Clorox was for bleaching and not for disinfecting, it did not so qualify.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe opinion expressed by the Tariff Board in Appeal No. 363 could not be said to be a judgment determining the status of a person or of a thing. When the Customs Act states that an order, finding or declaration of the Tariff Board shall be final and conclusive, subject to further appeal, it does not mean anything more than that it shall be final and conclusive in relation to the appeal which is before the Board. It does not mean that a decision rendered on one appeal can preclude some other person, not a party to that appeal, from appealing a decision of the Deputy Minister made in relation to an importation of specific goods by him, nor does it preclude the Board from dealing with such an appeal upon its merits. The Board does not have a jurisdiction under the Act to decide general questions as to the status of goods or of persons with that finality which is necessary to set up an estoppel by a judgment in rem. Society of Medical Officers v. Hope, [1960] 1 All E.R. 317, referred to.\nTherefore the opinion given by the Board to the Minister could not be regarded as being final and conclusive in relation to the appeal taken by the present respondents, who were not parties in Appeal No. 363. The principle of res judicata was not applicable in this case.\nIn deciding under which item Clorox should be classified, the choice was between Tariff Item 219a, which refers specifically to preparations \"for disinfecting\", and the so-called \"basket item\" 711, which contains no reference whatever to goods for bleaching or for disinfecting. Upon the facts found by the Tariff Board, as between these two items, the goods in question fell within Tariff Item 219a, the definition of which was properly applicable to them.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an appeal from the Tariff Board.

Lambert, for the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court2 which dismissed an appeal from the Tariff Board. The question of law considered in the Exchequer Court and in this Court was:\nDid the Tariff Board err, as a matter of law, in holding that the product known under the trade mark \"Clorox\", imported under Vancouver Entries Nos. 68405 of January 12th, 1956, 67200 of January 6th, 1956, 71357 and 71295 of January 26th, 1956, 70238, 70264 and 70292 of January 23rd, 1956, is properly classifiable for tariff purposes under Tariff Item No. 219a?\nThe Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise had decided that the product in question was dutiable under Tariff Item 711 and from that decision the respondents appealed to the Tariff Board, the appeal being numbered 398.\nThe relevant provisions of Tariff Items 219a and 711 are as follows:\nBritish Preferential Tariff.\nMost-Favoured-Nation Tariff.\nGeneral. Tariff.\n219a Non-alcoholic preparations or chemicals for disinfecting, or for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating fungi, weeds, insects, rodents, or other plant or animal pests, n.o.p.:\u2014\n(i) When in packages not exceeding three pounds each, gross weight\nFree\n20 p.c.\n25 p.c.\n(ii) Otherwise \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nFree\n7\u00bd p.c.\n15 p.c.\nBritish Preferential Tariff.\nMost-Favoured-Nation Tariff.\nGeneral.

Prior to the hearing by the Tariff Board of Appeal No. 398, the Board had considered, in Appeal No. 363, whether \"Clorox\" was properly classified under Tariff Item 219a and had expressed the opinion that it was not.\nAppeal No. 363 arose as a reference by the Deputy Minister to the Tariff Board for an opinion as provided in s. 46 of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58, which then provided:\n46. (1) The Deputy Minister may refer to the Tariff Board for its, opinion any question relating to the valuation or tariff classification of any goods or class of goods.\n(2) For the purpose of section 44 a reference pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be an appeal.\nThe reference was in the form of a letter written by the Deputy Minister to the Tariff Board, dated July 29, 1955, as follows:\nH. B. McKinnon,\nChairman, The Tariff Board,\nSussex and George Street,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir,\nThe Department has had for consideration a number of materials sold under different trade marked names, consisting of Sodium Hypochlorite in Solution. These products are generally described as bleaches, deodorizers, disinfectants and stain removers. They all have had an available chlorine strength of over 5% and they have been uniformly classified as non-alcoholic disinfectants under tariff item 219a.\nThis practice enables the manufacturers of similar products in Canada to import free of Customs duty under tariff item 791 \"materials of all kinds\" for use in producing or manufacturing their products in Canada. In this connection, a ruling has been made allowing empty glass bottles for use as containers for \"Javex\", a product manufactured in Canada by Javex Company Limited, under this tariff item.\nThe Canadian manufacturers of glass bottles who are affected by these rulings are disturbed thereby. I attach hereto a copy of a letter from Mr. Arthur May, Ottawa, acting on behalf of Dominion Glass Company Limited of Montreal.\nI have reviewed the Department's rulings and I concur with them, but I am placing the issue before the Tariff Board as an appeal under Section 46 of the Customs Act.\n(Signed) D. Sim\nDeputy Minister for Customs and Excise\nA hearing took place as a result of this reference, of which notice was published in the Canada Gazette. No specific notice was given to the respondents, who are importers of Clorox, or to Clorox Chemical Co. of Oakland, California, the manufacturer of Clorox, and they were not represented at the hearing.\nFollowing this hearing the Tariff Board expressed the following opinion:\nThe material involved in this reference is sodium hypochlorite having an available chlorine strength of not less than 5 per cent. It was admitted by all parties that such material is, inter alia, a disinfectant. It is nonalcoholic and is therefore, in appropriate circumstances, admissible under Tariff Item 219a, i.e., when used \"for disinfecting\".\nAs regards imports of this material in relatively small packages for general distribution, a reasonable presumption as to end use may be obtained by an examination of the description and recommendations attached to or accompanying the containers.\nOf the two imported brands submitted by the Deputy Minister, viz. \"Klenzade\" and \"Clorox\": the former is plainly aiming primarily at a commercial or agricultural market and the only use indicated is as a disinfectant; the latter product is for general distribution to the householder as a bleach, deodorizer or disinfectant.\nIt is therefore a very proper assumption that \"Klenzade\" is a \"nonalcoholic preparation or chemical for disinfecting\"; but no such assumption would be warranted in the case of \"Clorox\". On the contrary, such evidence as was adduced at the hearing in the matter suggests that \"Clorox\" is rarely used in such circumstances as would warrant classification under Tariff Item 219a.\nAccordingly, we are of opinion that \"Klenzade\" is properly classified under Tariff Item 219a and that \"Clorox\" is not.\nThe solicitors for Clorox Chemical Co., on February 21, 1956, wrote to the Tariff Board, pointing out that that company was affected by the opinion, that it had not had notice of the hearing and that it was seeking a re-hearing where it might have an opportunity to adduce evidence which would have an effect on the issue. Ultimately the respondents made an importation of Clorox which was classified by the Deputy Minister under Tariff Item 711, from which decision an appeal was taken to the Tariff Board as No. 398.\nAfter the hearing of the appeal the Board made a majority decision, which concluded as follows:\nIn the matter of the product \"Clorox\", which is at issue here, we believe the evidence establishes that it is ordinarily and regularly used in the family wash primarily as a bleach and, secondarily, as a disinfectant. Hence the appraiser must conclude that Clorox is, inter alia, \"for disinfecting\". Does the fact that it also bleaches have a bearing on its right to admissibility under tariff item 219a? There are no words in tariff item 219a which would warrant its exclusion on that ground. If it is a \"non-alcoholic preparation for disinfecting\", Clorox is admissible under tariff item 219a even though it may perform an additional function at the same time and\u2014 unless more specifically provided for elsewhere in the tariff\u2014is classifiable under tariff item 219a. There being no more specific provision for the product Clorox than under tariff item 219a, it is properly classifiable thereunder.\nTwo points were argued before the Exchequer Court. First it was contended that the opinion of the Tariff Board in Appeal No. 363 formed an estoppel per rem judicatam to a consideration of the same issue in Appeal No. 398. Second; it was argued that the principal and chief use of the product should be considered in determining whether the product could qualify as a preparation for disinfecting under Tariff Item 219a and that, as the principal use of Clorox was for bleaching and not for disinfecting, it did not so qualify.\nCameron J. decided both points in favour of the respondents and I am in agreement with his conclusions.\nThe first argument is based upon the provision contained in subs. (2) of s. 46 of the Customs Act above quoted, which states that for the purposes of s. 44 a reference pursuant to s. 46 shall be \"deemed to be an appeal\", and upon subs. (3) of s. 44, which provides:\n44. (3) On any appeal under subsection (1), the Tariff Board may make such order or finding as the nature of the matter may require, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, may declare\n(a) what rate of duty is applicable to the specific goods or the class of goods with respect to which the appeal was taken,\n(b) the value for duty of the specific goods or class of goods, or\n(c) that such goods are exempt from duty,\nand an order, finding or declaration of the Tariff Board is final and conclusive subject to further appeal as provided in section 45.\nReliance is placed upon the words \"an order, finding or declaration of the Tariff Board is final and conclusive \u2026\"\nThe appellants contend that an opinion expressed by the Tariff Board pursuant to s. 46, as also any order, finding or declaration made on any appeal under s. 44, is final and conclusive, not only in relation to the parties who are before the Board on the appeal, but as against everyone. The Board's decision, it is said, is a judgment in rem and not merely a judgment inter partes.\nHalsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 15, p. 178, para. 351, defines a judgment in rem as follows:\nA judgment in rem may be defined as the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction determining the status of a person or thing, or the disposition of a thing (as distinct from the particular interest in it of a party to the litigation). Apart from the application of the term to persons, it must affect the res in the way of condemnation, ferfeiture, declaration of status or title, or order for sale or transfer.\nIn my view the opinion expressed by the Tariff Board in Appeal No. 363 cannot be said to be a judgment determining the status of a person or of a thing. The Customs Act makes provision for appeals to the Board with respect to decisions made by the Deputy Minister in the administration of that Act. It confers a right of appeal on a person who deems himself to be aggrieved by such a decision in relation to certain specified matters and on such an appeal the Board may make an order, finding or declaration. When the Act states that such an order, finding or declaration shall be final and conclusive, subject to further appeal, I do not interpret it as meaning anything more than that it shall be final and conclusive in relation to the appeal which is before it. It does not mean that a decision rendered on one appeal can preclude some other person, not a party to that appeal, from appealing a decision of the Deputy Minister made in relation to an importation of specific goods by him, nor does it preclude the Board from dealing with such an appeal upon its merits. The Board does not have a jurisdiction under the Act to decide general questions as to the status of goods or of persons with that finality which is necessary to set up an estoppel by a judgment in rem. See Society of Medical Officers of Health v. Hope3.\nI do not think, therefore, that the opinion given by the Board to the Minister can be regarded as being final and conclusive in relation to the appeal taken by the respondents, who were not parties in Appeal No. 363. In my view the principle of res judicata is not applicable in this case.\nThe next question involves the merits in law of the actual decision made by the Tariff Board in Appeal No. 398. That decision is based upon an express finding of fact made by the Board that\nIn the matter of the product \"Clorox\", which is at issue here, we believe the evidence establishes that it is ordinarily and regularly used in the family wash primarily as a bleach and, secondarily, as a disinfectant. The issue is whether a product ordinarily and regularly used as a disinfectant, which otherwise meets the requirements of Tariff Item 219a, does not fall within it because that is a secondary and not its primary use.\nI agree with Cameron J. that, if there had been some other tariff item applicable specifically to preparations for bleaching, the Board would have had to consider the primary use as a bleach in deciding whether Clorox should be classified under that item or under 219a. Here, however, the choice is between Tariff Item 219a, which refers specifically to preparations \"for disinfecting\", and the so-called \"basket item\" 711, which contains no reference whatever to goods for bleaching or for disinfecting. It seems to me that, upon the facts found by the Tariff Board, as between these two items, the goods in question here fall within Tariff Item 219a, the definition of which is properly applicable to them.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the Tariff Board did not err on a matter of law in making the classification which it did and the appeal should be dismissed. The appellants should pay the costs of the respondents other than the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise. There should be no order as to the costs of that respondent.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants, Javex Company Ltd. and Dominion Glass Company Ltd.: Howard, Cate, Ogilvy,\nBishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Consumers Glass Company Ltd.: Holden, Hutchison, Cliff, McMaster, Meighen & Minnion, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the respondents, Mrs. Amy Oppenheimer et al.: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for The Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise: C.

The management and operation of this section was acquired by the appellant company. Certain other telephone facilities in northern British Columbia and in the Yukon, also owned by the Crown, were purchased by the respondent company. The latter agreed to route all traffic over the facilities of the appellant and also agreed not to interconnect, without consent, with any other facilities, which would result in bypassing the appellant's system.\nAppellant alleged that the respondent breached the agreement, resulting in damage to the appellant, and immediately after delivering a statement of claim launched a motion for interlocutory injunctions. The Exchequer Court dismissed the motion on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action. On behalf of the appellant it was argued that this was a case in which \"the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown\" within the meaning of s. 17 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nHeld: The appeal and the action should be dismissed.\nFrom a reading of s. 18 of the old Exchequer Court Act before it was replaced by the precursor of the present s. 17, the conclusion was inescapable that there was no intention to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court to adjudicate upon claims by the Crown arising out of contract,\u2014thereby excluding the jurisdiction of provincial courts, or to restrict the well-recognized privilege of the Crown to choose its own Court. Section 17 must be restricted to claims against the Crown in the same way that old s. 18 was restricted. Any different construction would have the effect of compelling the Crown to sue in contract in the Exchequer Court.\nSection 29(d) does not give jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court unless \"the Crown is plaintiff or petitioner\" eo nomine. Those words do not include an action in which the plaintiff or petitioner is not the Crown, but is an entity such as the appellant, even if the rights sought to be enforced may have been derived from the Crown.\nThe provisions of s. 44(1) and (3) of the Canadian National Railway Act did not assist the appellant because, while such a suit as that brought by the appellant may be brought and be heard in any court of competent jurisdiction, the question would still remain as to what is such a court,\u2014and that was already answered. APPEAL from an order of Cameron J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing a motion for interlocutory injunctions. Appeal and action dismissed.\nC. C. Locke, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nK. E. Eaton, for the defendant, respondent.\nD. S. Maxwell, for the Attorney General of Canada, intervenant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014By leave of a member of this Court Canadian National Railway Company appeals from an order of Cameron J. dismissing a motion for interlocutory injunctions in an action in the Exchequer Court of Canada in which the appellant is plaintiff and the respondent, North-West Telephone Company, is defendant. The motion was launched immediately after the delivery of the statement of claim, whereupon the respondent served notice that a preliminary objection would be taken that the Exchequer Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the action. When the motion came on for argument, counsel for the Crown in the right of Canada, with the consent of both parties, appeared as amicus curiae. He supported the respondent's preliminary objection which Cameron J. sustained. Leave was granted the Attorney General of Canada to intervene in the appeal; a factum was filed on his behalf and he was represented by counsel on the argument. Notice of the appeal was served upon the Attorneys General of the Provinces but none asked to intervene and none was represented before us.\nFor the purposes of this appeal the allegations in the statement of claim are taken as true and the relevant ones are set forth substantially in the language used by the draftsman.\nThe respondent is incorporated by a private Act of the Legislature of British Columbia. The appellant is a company duly incorporated and constituted according to the laws of Canada by special acts of the Parliament of Canada as more particularly set out in s. 3 of c. 29 of the Statutes of Canada 1955, which section reads:\nThe company incorporated under the name of Canadian National Railways Company by chapter 13 of the statutes of 1919, the company formed by the amalgamation of Canadian National Railways Company and the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada, and the Canadian National Railway Company referred to in chapter 33 of the statutes of 1932-33, are hereby declared to be and to have been one and the same company, and the said company is hereby continued under the name of Canadian National Railway Company.\nIn 1945 the Government of Canada had acquired title to a portion of a certain telephone and telegraph system running between Edmonton, Alberta and Fairbanks, Alaska, known as the Alaska Highway Telephone System. By Order in Council P.C. 4251, dated October 24, 1947, the management and operation of that portion of the system was turned over to the Canadian National Telegraph Company, a subsidiary of the appellant and the said portion was named the North-West Communications System. By Order in Council P.C. 1979, of April 26, 1949, the management and operation of that system by the Canadian National Telegraph Company was continued. On March 18, 1958, Order in Council P.C. 420 recited that it was proposed that the said system be placed on an entrustment basis similar to that of government railways entrusted to the Canadian National Railway Company in respect of management and operation, that is, title to remain in the Government of Canada, but the Canadian National Railway Company to assume direct responsibility for future capital requirements for any annual operating deficits out of its general revenues and retaining any profits that might develop. Order in Council P.C. 420 of March 18, 1958, revoked Orders in Council P.C. 4251 of October 24, 1947, and P.C. 1959 of April 26, 1949, and under the authority of s. 19 of the Canadian National Railways Act entrusted the North-West Communications System, as from and after April 1, 1958, in respect of management and operation thereof, to the appellant upon the terms specified in the last mentioned Act.\nFor some years prior to July 4, 1956, the Government of Canada owned certain telephone facilities in the northern part of British Columbia and in the Yukon, which were operated by an agency of the Crown known as \"Government Telephone and Telegraph Service\", including certain telephone facilities in Dawson Creek, Pouce Coupe and Fort St. John, all in British Columbia. On July 4, 1956, an agreement was entered into between Her Majesty the Queen in the right of Canada, represented by the Minister of Transport, and the present respondent, whereby Her Majesty sold and the respondent purchased those telephone facilities. By clauses 6 and 7 of this agreement the respondent agreed to route after July 1, 1956, by way of the facilities of the system between Dawson Creek and Edmonton all long distance telephone traffic and private wire leases which, in accordance with accepted routing and leasing practices, would normally be so routed; and by which the respondent undertook and agreed not to interconnect, without the previous consent in writing of the Minister, any telecommunication facilities extending from the Dawson Creek-Fort St. John area with any telecommunication facilities of the Alberta Government Telephone or others, which would result in by-passing the facilities of the North-West Communications System between Dawson Creek and Edmonton.\nGrande Prairie, Alberta, lies on the direct communication route between Dawson Creek and Edmonton and on or about December 20, 1959, the respondent set up telephone toll circuits between Dawson Creek, British Columbia, and Grande Prairie, Alberta, by connecting with the Alberta Government Telephones at a point on or near the British Columbia-Alberta border. From December 21, 1959, no long distance telephone traffic or private wire traffic has passed over the facilities of the plaintiff company.\nSince on or about December 21, 1959, the respondent has routed all telephone messages between the Fort St. John, Pouce Coupe and Dawson Creek areas and the Grande Prairie Telephone Exchange area over its own toll circuits or those of the Alberta Government Telephones by means of the connection referred to in the preceding paragraph and has by-passed the facilities of the North-West Communications System. This connection was made without the previous consent in writing of the Minister. By so doing the respondent is said to have breached clauses 6 and 7 of the agreement of July 4, 1956, and, after alleging damage as a result of these continuing breaches, the appellant claims restraining and mandatory injunctions. On behalf of the appellant it is argued that the present case is one in which \"the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown\", within the meaning of the last clause of s. 17 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, which section reads as follows:\nThe Exchequer Court has exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which the land, goods or money of the subject are in the possession of the Crown, or in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown.\nAs was pointed out in the Court below, the forerunner of this section was s. 18 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, as enacted by s. 1 of c. 5 of the Statutes of 1949 (2nd session). This last mentioned section repealed s. 18 of R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, which had provided:\nThe Exchequer Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which demand is made or relief sought in respect of any matter which might, in England, be subject of a suit or action against the Crown, and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it shall have exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which the land, goods or money of the subject are in the possession of the Crown, or in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown.\nWhen one looks at s. 18 of the old Exchequer Court Act before it was replaced by the precursor of s. 17 in 1949, the conclusion is inescapable that there was no intention to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the Exchequer Court to adjudicate upon claims by the Crown arising out of contract, \u2014thereby excluding the jurisdiction of provincial courts, or to restrict the well-recognized privilege of the Crown to choose its own Court. I agree with Cameron J. that s. 17 must be restricted to claims against the Crown in the same way that old s. 18 was restricted. Any different construction would have the effect of compelling the Crown to sue in contract in the Exchequer Court.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal and, therefore, nothing need be said as to whether the appellant's claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown.\nMany of the appellant's contentions based upon s. 29(d) of the Exchequer Court Act:\nThe Exchequer Court has and possesses concurrent original jurisdiction in Canada\n....................................................................................................................................\n(d) in all other actions and suits of a civil nature at common law or equity in which the Crown is plaintiff or petitioner. were abandoned on the argument of the appeal, but counsel did submit that, even if the appellant were not a Crown agent, there was a Crown vesting or statutory assignment of a right entitling the appellant to exercise the Crown's prerogative of choosing its forum and to sue for the enforcement of that right in its own name or in the name of the Crown. Even if that proposition is correct, as to which it is not necessary to express an opinion, s. 29(d) does not give jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court to deal with the matter unless \"the Crown is plaintiff or petitioner\" eo nomine. Those words do not include an action in which the plaintiff or petitioner is not the Crown, but is an entity such as the appellant, even if the rights sought to be enforced may have been derived from the Crown.\nReference was made by counsel for the appellant to s. 44 of the Canadian National Railways Act, c. 29 of the Statutes of 1955, subss. (1) and (3) of which read as follows:\n44. (1) Actions, suits or other proceedings by or against the National Company in respect of its undertakings or in respect of the operation or management of Canadian Government Railways, may, in the name of the National Company, be brought in and may be heard by any judge or judges of any court of competent jurisdiction in Canada, with the same right of appeal as may be had from a judge sitting in court under the rules of court applicable thereto.\n......................................................................................................................................\n(3) Any court having under the statutes or laws relating thereto jurisdiction to deal with any cause of action, suit or other proceeding, when arising between private parties shall, with respect to any similar cause of action, suit or other proceeding by or against the National Company, be a court of competent jurisdiction under the provisions of this section.\nThese provisions do not assist the appellant, firstly, because it is clear, in view of the definition of \"Canadian Government Railways\" in s. 2(b) of the Canadian National Railways Act, that that term includes the management and operation of the property, works or interests and the powers, rights or privileges, the management and operation of which are entrusted to the National Company,\u2014and which definition is certainly wide enough to include the management and operation alleged in the statement of claim,\u2014and, therefore, an action such as this might be brought in the name of the appellant; secondly, because, while any such suit by the appellant may be brought and be heard in any court of competent jurisdiction, the question would still remain as to what is such a court,\u2014and that has already been answered.\nThe appeal and the action should be dismissed with costs, except that there should be no costs to or against the Attorney General of Canada.\nAppeal and action dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Ladner, Downs, Ladner, Locke, Clarke & Lenox, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n"}

It was admitted that the parcel arrived by prepaid registered air mail at the Hamilton Post Office on or before Saturday, October 15, 1955, and was transferred to the Customs Postal Branch, where it was deposited in a bin to which members of the public were not permitted access. Notice of the arrival of the package of diamonds was sent to Levy Brothers Company Limited, and was received by it in due course. On October 18th it attended at the Customs Postal Branch to make due entry but the parcel could not be found. Levy Brothers brought a petition of right to recover from the Crown the value of the parcel of diamonds. The trial judge concluded that it was \"a fair inference that the parcel was unlawfully converted by some one or more of the Crown employees who had access to the bin during working hours\" and that \"\u2026 the preponderance of probability, though slight, favours the view that the conversion occurred on the Saturday or Monday, during a time when both the office and the bunks were open and access to the bins could be had by an employee without using a key\". He found that the Crown was liable to make good the loss. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nIn the course of dealing with the respondent's parcel of diamonds the employee or employees of the Crown converted them to his or their own use. The employee or employees concerned were thus doing fraudulently that which, under s. 44(3) of the Post Office Act, they were employed to do honestly and the theft was, therefore, committed under such circumstances as to render the employer liable for the loss. Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Company, [1912] A.C. 716; Lockhart v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company, [1941] S.C.R. 278; W. W. Sales Limited v. City of Edmonton, [1942] S.C.R. 467; R. v. Spence, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 517; Percy v. Corporation of the City of Glasgow, [1922] 2 A.C. 299; United Africa Company Limited v. Saka Owoade, [1955] A.C. 130, referred to. The liability of the Crown for the torts of its servants is now clearly established by ss. 3 and 4 of the Crown Liability Act.\nThe provisions of s. 40 of the Post Office Act were not applicable as at the time of the loss the diamonds in question were neither \"deposited in a post office\" nor \"in the course of mail\". In order to invoke the provisions of s. 23(1) of the Customs Act under the circumstances disclosed in this case, it is \"default of \u2026 entry \u2026 or payment of duty\" by Levy Brothers which must be shown. The fact that the statement of agreed facts disclosed no default of any kind by Levy Brothers was sufficient to exclude the application of this subsection.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, granting a petition of right. Appeal dismissed.\nC. R. O. Munro and J. D. Lambert, for the appellant.\nL. A. Fitspatrick, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Thurlow of the Exchequer Court2 whereby it is determined that the respondent, Levy Brothers Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Levy Brothers\") is entitled to recover the sum of $3,191 from the appellant in respect of the loss of a parcel of diamonds shipped to it from Antwerp by prepaid registered air mail and presumably stolen by a person or persons unknown from the office of the Customs Postal Branch of the Department of National Revenue at Hamilton. By the same judgment the claim of the Western Assurance Company was dismissed and no cross-appeal has been asserted in this regard.\nThis action was tried on the basis of a statement of agreed facts which was signed by counsel for the respective parties and which stipulated that the parcel of diamonds in question, shipped and valued in manner aforesaid, arrived at Hamilton on or before Saturday, the 15th of October, 1955, on which day the Customs Postal Branch was not open to the public and that a skeleton staff of four employees of that branch sorted 213 dutiable items of mail (including the parcel of diamonds) from the non-dutiable, and having entered these items on a form headed \"PACKAGES RECEIVED FROM POST OFFICE BY CUSTOMS POSTAL BRANCH\" transferred them to the Customs Postal Branch office which was not open at all on Sunday, October 16th, and where they were deposited in bins situate in two large steel bunks to which members of the public are not permitted access and which face each other and are covered with wires and enclosed at each end by wire doors with locks on them. It is further agreed that there was mailed to Levy Brothers on Saturday, October 15th, a printed notice over the name of the Collector of Customs and Excise describing the package in question and stating in effect that it was liable to duty and had arrived at the office of the Customs Postal Branch at the Dominion Government Building, King and John Streets, Hamilton, Ontario, there to be opened, formally entered for customs and delivered to the addressee or its attorney on receipt of payment of duty if any were found to be payable. Having received this advice notice, in due course on Tuesday, October 18th, Levy Brothers attended at the office in question for the purpose of making due entry of the parcel but the parcel could not be found, and in spite of a thorough search by the R.C.M.P. and officers of the Department of National Revenue it had not been found at the time of the hearing of this appeal and is presumed to have been stolen.\nWithout further recitation of the facts, it is enough for me to say that I agree with the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge that it is\n\u2026 a fair inference that the parcel was unlawfully converted by some one or more of the Crown employees who had access to the bin during working hours.\nand I also agree that\n\u2026 the preponderance of probability, though slight, favours the view that the conversion occurred on the Saturday or Monday, during a time when both the office and the bunks were open and access to the bins could be had by an employee without using a key.\nCustoms officers are required by s. 44(3) of the Post Office Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 12, to \"deal with\" dutiable mail in accordance with the laws relating to customs pending delivery to the addressee or return to the Canada Post Office, and it was in the course of so dealing with the respondent's parcel of diamonds that an employee or employees of the Crown converted them to his or their own use. The employee or employees concerned were thus doing fraudulently that which they were employed to do honestly and the theft was, therefore, in my view, committed under such circumstances as to render the employer liable for the loss. The law governing these circumstances has been stated in Story on Agency, 7th ed., para. 452, in terms which have been approved in this Court on more than one occasion. It is there said:\n\u2026 he (the principal) is held liable to third persons in a civil suit for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences, and other malfeasances, or misfeasances, and omissions of duty, of his agent, in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or participate in, or, indeed, know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts, or disapproved of them.\nThis language was adopted as applicable to the relationship between master and servant by Lord Macnaghten in Lloyd v. Grace, Smith & Company3, and by this Court in Lockhart v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company4, per Duff C.J., W. W. Sales Limited v. City of Edmonton5, and The Queen v. Spence6. See also Percy v. Corporation of the City of Glasgow7, and United Africa Company Limited v. Saka Owoade8.\nThe liability of the Crown for the torts of its servants is now clearly established by the Crown Liability Act, Statutes of Canada, 1952-53, c. 30, ss. 3 and 4, by which it is provided that:\n3. (1) The Crown is liable in tort for the damages from which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be liable\n(a) in respect of a tort committed by a servant of the Crown, or\n(b) in respect of a breach of duty attaching to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property.\n4. (2) No proceedings lie against the Crown by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (i) of section 3 in respect of any act or omission of a servant of the Crown unless the act or omission would apart from the provisions of this Act have given rise to a cause of action in tort against that servant or his personal representative.\nIt is, however, argued on behalf of the appellant that the Crown is exempt from liability under the present circumstances by reason of the provisions of s. 40 of the Post Office Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 12, and s. 23(1) of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 58.\nSection 40 of the Post Office Act provides that:\n40. Neither Her Majesty nor the Postmaster General is liable to any person for any claim arising from the loss, delay or mishandling of anything deposited in a post office, except as provided in this Act or the regulations. It was pointed out by counsel for the appellant that by s. 2(1) (c) of the same Act the words \"deposit at a post office\" are defined as meaning \"to leave in a post office or with a person authorized by the Postmaster General to receive mailable matter\" and that s. 2(2) provides that \"an article shall be deemed to be in the course of post from the time it is deposited at a post office until it is delivered\".\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that the application of s. 40 should not be limited to articles which are actually \"in a post office\" or in the custody of a person authorized by the Postmaster General to receive mail, but that it should be construed as referring to an article from the time it is deposited in a post office until it is delivered and that the parcel here in question, having been deposited in a post office and having been lost before it was delivered to the addressee must be taken to have been lost \"in the course of post\" and that the loss is, therefore, one for which the Crown is not liable by reason of the provisions of s. 40.\nSection 44(1) of the Post Office Act requires that:\nAll mail from a country other than Canada containing or suspected to contain anything subject to customs or other import duties \u2026 shall be submitted to a customs officer for examination.\nand by s. 44(3) it is provided that:\nA customs officer shall, in accordance with the laws relating to customs and the importation of goods, deal with all mail submitted to him under this section, and upon compliance with such laws, may deliver such mail to the addressee, subject to the payment of any postage due thereon, or may return it to the Canada Post Office for transmission through the post in the usual way.\nThe parcel in question contained goods subject to duty, and at the time of its conversion it had been submitted to the Customs Postal Branch and had not been returned \"to the Canada Post Office for transmission through the post in the usual way\", but was in the course of being dealt with by customs officials pending delivery to the addressee upon payment of duty. In my view, at the time of the loss the diamonds in question were neither \"deposited in a post office\" nor \"in the course of mail\" and, accordingly, I agree with the learned trial judge that the provisions of s. 40 of the Post Office Act have no application to the present case. It was submitted, however, that the parcel in question was being kept in the Customs Postal Branch \"at the risk and charge of the owner\", and in this regard reliance was placed upon s. 23(1) of the Customs Act which reads:\nIn default of such entry and landing, or production of the goods, or payment of duty, the officer may convey the goods to a customs warehouse, or some secure place appointed by the Collector for such purpose, there to be kept at the risk and charge of the owner.\nThe application of this subsection is, in my view, limited by its opening words to cases in which there has been a \"default\" in one or more of the ways specified therein. The words \"landing, or production of the goods\" appear to be referable to goods imported by sea or by inland navigation as will be seen by reference to s. 19 of the present Customs Act and s. 15 of the Customs Act, 1877, 40 Vict., c. 10, and it is \"default of \u2026 entry \u2026 or payment of duty\" by Levy Brothers which must be shown in order to invoke the provisions of this subsection under the circumstances here disclosed. The fact that the statement of agreed facts discloses no default of any kind by Levy Brothers is, in my view, sufficient to exclude the application of this subsection.\nIn its petition of right Levy Brothers did not base its claim on a conversion by a servant of the Crown in the course of his employment, but as the learned trial judge granted it leave to make the amendment necessary to include such a claim, and as the appellant in this Court agreed that the case should be treated as if such an amendment had been made, it becomes unnecessary to express any view as to the validity of the contention made by the respondent in the Court below that the provisions of s. 3(1) (b) of the Crown Liability Act have the effect of making the Crown liable as a bailee of goods in its possession under the circumstances here disclosed.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

IV, Para. 2(a) and (c).\nThe plaintiff company claimed for damage to a cargo of flax seed shipped by it from Port Arthur to Montreal. The cargo was trans-shipped at Port Colborne to the defendant's vessel \"David Barclay\". The plaintiff claimed that the defendant in breach of its undertaking and in dereliction of its duty failed to deliver the cargo in the same good order and condition in which it was received, but on the contrary on arrival in Montreal it was found to be wet, short and damaged. The defendant pleaded the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, and alleged that the damage resulted from the fact that the \"David Barclay\" rubbed the starboard bank of the Soulanges Canal very heavily on its voyage from Port Colborne to Montreal.\nThe trial judge concluded that the damage to the ship resulting from the collision was occasioned or brought about by peril, danger or accident of the sea or navigable waters within the meaning of para. 2(c) of Article IV of the schedule to the Water Carriage of Goods Act and that it was negligence which related principally to the navigation or management of the ship under para. 2(a) of Article IV. The action was dismissed and the plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The principle, approved by the House of Lords in Gosse Millerd Ltd. v. Canadian Government Merchant Marine, [1929] A.C. 223, of distinguishing between want of care of cargo and want of care of vessel indirectly affecting the cargo was applicable in the present case. The Glenochil, [1896] P. 10; Hourani v. Harrison (1927), 32 Com. Cas. 305; Kalamazoo Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co., [1950] S.C.R. 356, referred to. The steps taken by the master of the \"David Barclay\" related primarily to the safety and preservation of the vessel.\nThe contention that after the collision the ship's owners had intervened and taken over control of the vessel from the master was rejected. The defendant's assistant marine superintendent who, following receipt of a message reporting the accident, instructed the captain of the ship to proceed to Montreal was not the alter ego of the defendant. It must be the fault or privity of somebody who is not merely a servant or agent for whom the company is liable upon the footing respondeat superior, but somebody for whom the company is liable because his action is the very action of the company itself. Lennard's Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd., [1915] A.C. 705, applied. The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in The Isis (1934), 48 LI. L. Rep. 35, is quite distinguishable, even if the decision might otherwise be relevant.\nPer Locke J.: The failure, following the collision, to take steps to prevent the ingress of further water and also to get rid of the accumulation in the bilge was negligence in the management of the ship on the part of the master and, accordingly, the case fell within the exception in Article IV, para. 2(a) of the schedule of the Act. The Rodney, [1900] P. 112, referred to; Kalamazoo Paper Co. v. CPU., supra, applied.\nThe Isis, supra, had no application to the facts of this case, because there the question was whether the company had not by its action relieved the master of his responsibility for the voyage and taken charge. Lennard's Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd., supra, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of A. I. Smith D.J.A.1, dismissing the plaintiff's action. Appeal dismissed.\nC. Russell McKenzie, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant. L. Lalande, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff, Leval & Company Inc., from a judgment of the District Judge in Admiralty for the District of Quebec2, dismissing the appellant's action against Colonial Steamships Limited, for damage to a cargo of 96,599.3 bushels of No. One Canada Western Flax Seed. This cargo was part of a total of 422,038.8 bushels shipped by the appellant on November 1, 1955, from Port Arthur, Ontario, to Montreal, Quebec, pursuant to a Canadian Lake Grain Bill of Lading, with \"trans-shipment Port Colborne &\/or Kingston &\/or Prescott, Ont.\". The bill of lading provided that all the terms, provisions and conditions of the Canadian Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, and of the rules comprising the schedule thereto, were, so far as applicable, to govern the contract contained in the bill of lading, which was to have effect, subject to the provisions of the rules as applied by the said Act. In due course the cargo of 96,599.3 bushels was trans-shipped at Port Colborne on the respondent's vessel \"DAVID BARCLAY\".\nThe relevant provisions of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, and the schedule thereto of Rules Relating To Bills Of Lading are the same as are contained in the Water Carriage of Goods Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 291, and schedule. Section 2 of that Act enacts:\n2. Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Rules relating to bills of lading as contained in the Schedule (hereinafter referred to as \"the Rules\") have effect in relation to and in connection with the carriage of goods by water in ships carrying goods from any port in Canada to any other port whether in or outside Canada.\nRule 2 of Article III of the schedule provides:\n2. Subject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried.\nRule 2, paras, (a) and (c) of Article IV of the schedule read as follows:\n2. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from, (a) act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship,\n.....................................................................................................................\n(c) perils, danger, and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters.\nThe statement of claim contained no allegation of negligence on the part of the respondent, but claimed that the respondent, in breach of its undertaking and in dereliction of its duty in the premises implied by law, failed to deliver the 96,599.3 bushels of flax seed in the same good order and condition as received by it at the time of shipment, which said goods arrived in Montreal wet, short and damaged. In its defence the respondent alleged that any alleged damage arose or resulted from the fact that the \"DAVID BARCLAY\" rubbed the starboard bank of the Soulanges Canal very heavily on its voyage from Port Colborne to Montreal and the respondent invoked all of the terms, conditions and provisions of the Act and Rules and, in particular, Rule 2, paras, (a) and (c) of Article IV.\nAdmittedly the \"DAVID BARCLAY\" was in seaworthy condition when she sailed from Port Colborne. The evidence led on behalf of the respondent shows that when the vessel reached a point about two miles east of Lock No. 5 in the Soulanges Canal she sheered suddenly and struck a stone on the starboard bank of the canal. The particulars of the collision and of what transpired thereafter are correctly set forth in the following extracts from the reasons for judgment at the trial:\nThe collision with the canal-bank occurred at about 2:00 A.M. on November 10th and the mate Fournier, who was on the bridge at the time, immediately sent a man to take soundings in No. 2 bilge, where water was found to an approximate depth of 14 feet. The pumps were put in operation and the Master, who was asleep in his cabin, was called.\nIt was noted that the ship had a slight list to starboard. She proceeded however to Lock No. 4 where it was ascertained that her draft had not altered since the first soundings taken and she therefore continued down to Lock No. 3, where the Master communicated with the Canal Superintendent and requested the services of a diver. The vessel then descended to Lock No. 1, where she was joined by a diver and the Assistant Canal Superintendent who ordered her to proceed to the foot of the canal. These instructions were complied with and the vessel on reaching the Eastern end of the canal was turned about and moored to the bank. Her draft was again checked and it was found not to have altered.\nA driver descended and went along the entire length of the vessel in an effort to locate the hole through which the water had entered the bilge. At the end of one hour he surfaced and reported that he had been unable to find any hole or break in the vessel's skin. Captain Sauvageau however was not satisfied and requested him to go down and make a second examination which he did and after an hour and a half he reported that he had again failed to find any hole or break in the vessel's side. A further check of the vessel's draft satisfied the Master that it remained unchanged. He had two or more telephone conversations with the Defendant's Assistant Marine Superintendent, Captain Walton, in the course of which the collision and the results of the diver's exploration were reported. On the basis of these reports the Master was instructed by Walton to proceed to Montreal.\nThe vessel left Cascades around noon on the 10th of November and tied up at Elevator No. 2 in the Harbour of Montreal around 10 o'clock that evening. It was found that her draft had not altered and around 8 o'clock the following morning she commenced to discharge cargo. However, in the afternoon, it was notice for the first time that water was finding its way from No. 2 bilge into No. 2 cargo hold and a tarpaulin was hung against the starboard side of the vessel with the hope that the suction created by the pressure of the water through the hole in the ship's side might draw the tarpaulin against the break and thus prevent the further entry of water.\nThere is evidence to the effect that little water had actually gained access to the cargo prior to the commencement of unloading and this is accounted for by the fact that so long as the cargo maintained pressure against the \"limber boards\" at the top of No. 2 bilge water could not enter the hold but as soon as this pressure was removed water was permitted entry.\nIn rebuttal, the appellant called two expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the failure to locate and stop immediately the hole which was finally discovered in the vessel and the fact that the \"DAVID BARCLAY\" continued on to Montreal, although it was known that the vessel was leaking, amounted to negligence and lack of good judgment.\nA consideration of the evidence suggested to me that at no time was there any negligence in the navigation or management of the ship on the part of those in charge of her. The trial judge was inclined to the opinion that there was such negligence subsequent to the collision with the bank of the canal, but he concluded that in any event the damage to the ship resulting from the collision was occasioned or brought about by peril, danger or accident of the sea or navigable waters within the meaning of para. 2(c) of Article IV of the Schedule to the Act and that it was negligence which related principally to the navigation or management of the ship under para. 2(a) of Article IV. The contention on behalf of the appellant is that the damage to her cargo was not the direct result of the collision but was caused by the failure and negligence of those in charge of the vessel following the collision to properly care for and protect the cargo in compliance with Article III (2).\nIn Gosse Millerd Limited v. Canadian Government Merchant Marine3, it was held by the House of Lords that negligence in the management of the hatches was not negligence in the management of a ship, but they referred to a number of earlier decisions and approved the principle laid down by a Divisional Court in The Glenochil4. That principle was accepted by the Supreme Court of the United States in cases arising under the American Harter Act and was affirmed and applied by the Court of Appeal in Hourani v. Harrison5.\nTheir Lordships pointed out in the Gosse Millerd appeal that there might be cases on the border line \"but if the principle is clearly borne in mind of distinguishing between want of care of cargo and want of care of vessel indirectly affecting the cargo, as Sir Francis Jeune puts it, there ought not to be very great difficulty in arriving at a proper conclusion\".\nThe same principle was applied by this Court in Kalamazoo Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co6, in an action by the insurers of the cargo of a ship damaged by striking a rock and later beached to prevent sinking. The action was to recover damages alleged to have been suffered by the cargo after the beaching, owing to the failure on the part of the captain to direct the use of all available pumping facilities to prevent the entry of further water into the hold and away from the cargo. It was held that this was neglect of the master in \"the management of the ship\" within the meaning of para. 2(a) of Article IV of the rules.\nThat principle is applicable in the present case. I agree with the trial judge that the steps taken by the master of the \"DAVID BARCLAY\" related primarily to the safety and preservation of the vessel. As he points out the ship's no. 2 starboard bilge filled rapidly and remained filled, notwithstanding the operation of the vessel's pumps; the ship developed a list which caused the master concern for the safety of his vessel; and the testimony of one of the experts called on behalf of the appellant shows that in his opinion the ship was in jeopardy following the collision.\nAfter the conclusion of the trial counsel for the appellant referred the trial judge to a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, The Isis7, and raised the contention for the first time that after the collision the ship's owners had intervened and taken over control of the vessel from the master. As the trial judge points out there was no such allegation even though in its reply the appellant included the following general averment:\nThe Plaintiff specifically states that at the appropriate and material times the Defendant failed to satisfy and discharge all its statutory duties and obligations required to be performed and discharged by the Defendant under the terms of the said Water Carriage of Goods Act, and puts the Defendant upon the strict proof of any defence afforded thereunder.\nThis was not a sufficient pleading within Admiralty Rules 70 and 215 and Exchequer Court Rule 93 and the point might well be disposed of on that ground alone. However, I proceed, as did the trial judge, to consider the general proposition and its applicability. I agree with him that the circumstances in The Isis case are quite distinguishable from those with which we are concerned, even if the decision might otherwise be relevant.\nCaptain James S. Walton, called on behalf of the respondent, was its assistant marine superintendent stationed at Port Colborne where the respondent had its head office. He had received a message from Captain Sauvageau reporting the accident and what had been done and Captain Walton instructed the captain of the ship to proceed to Montreal, in view of the fact that there had been no change in the list or the draft. Captain Walton was not the alter ego of the respondent and as the decision of the House of Lords in Lennard's Carrying Company Limited v. Asiatic Petroleum Company Limited8, shows, it must be the fault or privity of somebody who is not merely a servant or agent for whom the company is liable upon the footing respondeat superior, but somebody for whom the company is liable because his action is the very action of the company itself.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Locke J.:\u2014It is common ground that the \"David Barclay\" was seaworthy when she sailed from Port Col-borne, and the finding of the learned trial judge that the damage caused to the ship by striking the canal bank while passing through the Soulanges Canal was occasioned or brought about by a peril or accident of the sea, within the meaning of Art. IV, para. 2(c) of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 291, is not questioned.\nThe evidence shows that the diver employed to examine the hull following the accident, but before the ship left the Canal for Montreal, failed to find the hole caused by the collision which allowed water to enter the no. 2 starboard bilge to a depth of 14 ft. Subsequent examination of the hull after the discharge of the cargo, as declared by the protest and the survey report, showed that the bilge strake on the starboard side had been holed. According to the witness Walton, the assistant marine superintendent of the respondent, it was a crescent-shaped hole about 6 inches long and 3 inches wide. The appellant called two experienced ships' masters who gave evidence to the effect that, in view of the obvious fact that the hull had been holed and there being 14 ft. of water in the bilge, temporary repairs, either by blocking the hole externally by wedges or by placing a tarpaulin around the approximate position of the leak, should have been made before the ship sailed from the Canal for Montreal. Nothing, however, turns upon this since the appellant's case is that the damage to the grain was suffered after the ship had docked at the elevator in Montreal harbour and during the process of unloading.\nAccording to the records, there was 14 ft. of water in the bilge at 23.30 o'clock on November 10, 1955. The \"David Barclay\" was then moored at the elevator where it was intended to discharge the cargo of flax. The unloading commenced on the following morning at 8 o'clock. Since it was evident that the hull had been holed to permit the water to enter the bilge in such quantities, it is, in my opinion, clear that a duty rested upon those in charge of the ship to take steps to prevent the ingress of further water and also to get rid of the accumulation in the bilge. It had already been demonstrated on the previous night, following the collision, that the bilge pumps on the vessel were insufficient to pump out the bilge but this, presumably, would not have been so if, as suggested by the witness Crocker with whose evidence the witness Finch agreed, a tarpaulin had been stretched across that portion of the hull where it was holed. If the bilge pumps were found to be insufficient, additional pumps could have been employed. However, nothing was done and the evidence shows that after the operation of moving the flax commenced, relieving the pressure upon the limber or bilge boards, the water escaped from the bilge into the no. 2 cargo hold damaging the flax. While there may have been some trifling damage to the grain before the unloading commenced, practically all of it was caused in this manner.\nIn my opinion, the failure to take these steps was negligence in the management of the ship on the part of the master and, accordingly, the case falls within the exception in Art. IV, para. 2(a) of the schedule. To fail to do so was, in my opinion, \"improper handling of the ship as a ship\", to adopt the language of Gorell Barnes J. in The Rodney9, which affected the safety of the cargo.\nThe conditions existing as the \"David Barclay\" lay at the elevator dock were very similar to those which existed after the second stranding of the \"Nootka\" in Kalamazoo Paper Co. v. C.P.R.10. The facts dealing with that aspect of the matter are stated at pp. 372 and 373 of the report. The cargo there was pulp and the ship first ran aground on Cross Island and remained there until the following tide and, as she was making a small amount of water when she became free, it was decided to proceed to Quatsino Wharf and run her aground there. The trial judge found that only a comparatively small amount of water had entered the vessel at the time of the second grounding and it was after this that the water entered the vessel which caused the damage to the cargo. The negligence in failing to employ other available pumps, in addition to the bilge pump, to prevent this was held to be negligence in management within the meaning of the article in question. The judgments in that case consider the authorities at length and, in my opinion, the principle upon which it was decided applies to the present matter. In the reasons for judgment delivered by the learned trial judge, reference is made to an argument advanced on the part of the plaintiff based upon the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in The Isis11, where, after the vessel had grounded in the course of its voyage, the ship owners had resumed control of the ship relieving the master from responsibility during the continuance of the voyage. The contention made on behalf of the appellant was that the act of Walton, the assistant marine superintendent of the defendant, in directing the master to proceed after the collision amounted to a resumption by the owners of the direction of the ship. The point was not argued in this Court, though in the appellant's factum it is said that the learned trial judge had misconstrued the decision in The Isis.\nHad it been the intention of the appellant to raise this point, it should have been distinctly raised by way of a reply to the statement of defence and this was not done. But, apart from this, the case has no application to the facts of the present matter since nothing in the nature of a resumption of control of the ship by the owners took place. The master communicated with Walton and informed him of the condition of the ship and Walton instructed him to proceed. But, so far as the evidence disclosed, Walton was simply another servant of the respondent company and if he was negligent in giving these instructions the exception applies.\nThe learned trial judge referred in dealing with this aspect of the matter to the judgment of the House of Lords in Lennard's Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd.12 In that case the question was whether a loss at sea had happened without the actual fault or privity of the owners, a limited company, within the meaning of s. 502 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. This case has recently been considered in this Court in Marwell Equipment Ltd. et al. v. Vancouver Tug Boat Co. Ltd.13 In Lennard's case Lord Haldane, at p. 713 of the report, said that the fault referred to must be that of somebody who is not merely a servant or agent for whom the company is liable upon the footing respondeat superior, but somebody for whom the company is liable because his action is the very action of the company itself. The principle acted upon in The Isis, while in some respects similar, was not the same, but rather whether the company had not by its action relieved the master of his responsibility for the voyage and taken charge.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: C.

In June 1956, the parties entered into a separation agreement, which provided that during their minorities the son would remain with his father and the two girls with their mother. In June 1957, the plaintiff commenced an action against his wife for the dissolution of the marriage on the ground of her adultery with Richard Kruger. A decree nisi was granted on March 5, 1958, and custody of the daughters was awarded to the defendant upon her undertaking to discontinue any associations by her with Kruger.\nIn September 1958, the plaintiff instructed his solicitor to apply for an order rescinding the custody order in the decree nisi and giving him the custody of all three children, on the ground that the defendant had failed to carry out her undertaking to the Court. This application was later withdrawn. On November 6, 1958, an agreement was arrived at whereby the two girls would remain with the defendant and the son with the plaintiff. The plaintiff agreed to apply for judgment absolute forthwith, consented to the marriage of the defendant and Kruger following judgment absolute and agreed that the defendant\u2019s association with Kruger, following the judgment absolute, would not be raised by him as a ground for further application for custody of the children. The decree was made absolute on November 12, 1958. In the following month the defendant married Kruger and the plaintiff re-married.\nOn a further application by the plaintiff in May 1959 to vary the judgment of March 5, 1958, on the ground, inter alia, that the defendant had not adhered to her undertaking given at the trial, an order was made directing the trial of an issue as to who should have custody of the daughters. The trial judge directed that the custody of the two girls should be awarded to the plaintiff with rights of access to the defendant. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, dismissed an appeal from this order, and the defendant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The trial judge in dealing with the effect of the breach of the defendant\u2019s undertaking to discontinue associating with Kruger failed to give due weight to the complete change in circumstances resulting from the marriage of the defendant and Kruger, and to the fact that with full knowledge of that breach the plaintiff had signed the agreement of November 6, 1958. That agreement was a proper one and in the best interest of the daughters. The express power given to parents of an infant who are not living together to enter into a written agreement as to which parent shall have the custody of the infant is not abrogated by the circumstance that an order of the Court dealing with the custody is in effect.\nProof of a very real change of circumstance would be required to warrant the Court disregarding the agreement of November 6, 1958. The evidence fell far short of shewing any such change in circumstances as would enable the Court to say that in the best interests of the daughters their custody should be taken from their mother.\nIt was not a question whether Kruger or the plaintiff should have custody of the girls, but rather whether they were to be brought up by their mother or their step-mother. The record was replete with evidence that the defendant was a good and affectionate mother well fitted to care for and bring up her daughters.\nPer Kerwin C.J., dissenting: There was evidence that the mother breached her undertaking given to the Court and that the breach affected the welfare of the children to their detriment. The agreement of November 6, 1958, could not tie the hands of the Court in considering the position of the mother who, wilfully and flagrantly, violated her promise to the Court, and in considering what was best for the children. It was impossible to say that the mother, now married to the man responsible for the wrecking of a home and family, was a proper person to have custody of the two girls.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke J., dissenting: The agreement entered into by the parties on November 6, 1958, which ignored the interest of the children, was of no legal effect. While s. 2(2) of The Infants Act permits parents who are divorced to agree as to the custody of their children, this could not mean that they may do so when an order made in the divorce proceedings, whether before or after the decree absolute, is in effect. To construe it otherwise would be to say that, at the will of the parents, the jurisdiction of the Court could be ousted. The same principles applied to the exercise of the powers given by s. 5 of The Matrimonial Causes Act, under which the order for custody embodied in the decree nisi was made, as applied to the exercise of the powers given by s. 1 of The Infants Act.\nIt was unrealistic to suggest that in awarding custody to the mother the girls would not also be for all practical purposes in the custody of Kruger who, having married their mother, would stand in loco parentis to them. The Courts below were correct in finding that it was contrary to the interests of these children that they should be permitted to associate with Kruger.\nThe judges who decided this matter had rightly directed their attention to the paramount consideration in questions of custody (the welfare and happiness of the infant) to which all others yield. McKee v. McKee, [1951] A.C. 352, referred to. But if the matter were to be considered as merely a determination of the rights of the parents inter se without regard to this paramount consideration, the result would inevitably be the same. Section 1 of The Infants Act requires the courts in matters of custody to have regard, inter alia, to the conduct of the parents. Unless otherwise ordered by the court the parents are joint guardians and equally entitled to custody by virtue of s. 2. Section 3 requires that in questions relating to custody the rules of equity prevail.\nThere was no equitable principle which would justify an order to have these children taken from the home and custody of the father whose conduct was blameless throughout, so that they might be brought up by the defendant in the home maintained by the man whose adulterous conduct with her was the cause of the breaking up of the plaintiff\u2019s home.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Spence J. Appeal allowed, Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. dissenting.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and R.D. Wilson, for the defendant, appellant.\nMalcolm Robb, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014We had a very complete argument in this appeal at the conclusion of which I was satisfied that the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal had come to the right conclusion. Further consideration has confirmed that view.\nWe are asked to make an order directly opposed to concurrent findings of fact. That places a heavy burden upon the appellant,\u2014particularly in a case relating to the custody of children. However, I do not rest my judgment upon the failure of counsel for the appellant to satisfy me that both Courts below were wrong, but proceed affirmatively upon a review of all the evidence and of the reasons for judgment in the Courts below. Laidlaw J.A., who dissented in the Court of Appeal, considered that the trial judge did not give proper consideration, weight or effect to a certain agreement between the parents; that the trial judge ought to have found that there was no evidence whatsoever that the breach of an undertaking given by the mother to the Court at the trial before the Chief Justice of the High Court in any way affected the welfare of the children to their detriment; that the trial judge ought to have held that the father entered into an agreement in writing with the mother that the latter\u2019s association with Kruger would not be raised by him as a ground for further application by him for custody of the children and that in the particular circumstances he was precluded from so doing; that the trial judge ought to have held that there is no evidence whatsoever of any circumstances subsequent to the order made by the Chief Justice whereby the custody of the two girls was awarded to the mother which in any way was detrimental to the welfare of the children or that would justify a reversal of the order made by the Chief Justice or that would support an order removing the children from the custody of their mother.\nWith respect I disagree with the learned Justice of Appeal. There was evidence that the mother breached her undertaking given to the Chief Justice of the High Court and that breach did and does affect the welfare of the children to their detriment. Any agreement entered into by the father was to avoid publicity, if possible. In any event such an agreement cannot tie the hands of the Court in considering the position of the mother who, so wilfully and flagrantly, violated her promise to the Court, and in considering what is best for the children. My brother Locke deals with all the circumstances in the case and I entirely agree with his reasons which I have had the opportunity of reading. I find it impossible to say that the mother, who is now married to the man responsible for the wrecking of a home and family, is a proper person to have custody of the two girls.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the appeal of the present appellant from an order made by Spence J. on October 22, 1959, which awarded the custody of the two younger infant children of the parties to the respondent. Laidlaw J.A. dissented and would have allowed the appeal.\nThe parties were married at the city of Toronto on July 16, 1943, and three children were born to them: a boy on October 21, 1945, a girl on October 27, 1951 and a girl on November 3, 1953.\nOn July 5, 1957, the respondent commenced an action against his wife for the dissolution of the marriage on the ground of her adultery with one Richard Kruger. The acts of adultery alleged were said to have been committed during the years 1951, 1952, 1954, 1955 and 1956, variously at the city of Toronto, at Cove Island in the District of Muskoka, and at the city of Miami, Florida. The said Kruger to whom the appellant has been married since December 1958 was named as the co-respondent. Both parties entered defences to the action.\nA decree nisi was granted by McRuer C.J. on March 5, 1958, directing that the marriage be dissolved by reason of the adultery of the defendant with Kruger, unless sufficient cause be shown to the court within three months as to why the judgment should not be made absolute. A term of the formal judgment which is of importance in considering the question of custody of the two female children read:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the defendant, Vera Leona Booker, upon her undertaking to this Court to discontinue any associations by her with the defendant, Richard Kruger, be and she is awarded the sole custody and control of the infants Susan Clair Booker, born on the 27th day of October, 1951 and Jennifer Lynn Booker, born on the 3rd day of November, 1953, subject however to the right of the Plaintiff, Ernest William Booker, to have access to the said infants on Saturday of each week from 9.00 A.M. to 6.00 P.M. and for three days during Easter vacation and for three weeks during summer school-vacation in each and every year.\nOn November 12th this decree was made absolute by a judgment delivered by Aylen J. In the following month the appellant married Kruger and the respondent married Ulrike Ehlers.\nBy a notice of motion dated May 8, 1959, the respondent gave notice of an application to be made before the Chief Justice of the High Court for an order varying the judgment of March 5, 1958, so as to provide that Booker should have custody of all three of the children, or alternatively for an order directing the trial of an issue as to the custody of the two younger children on the grounds that the present appellant had not adhered to the undertakings given by her at the trial, upon which she was awarded custody of the two young girls, that she had shown herself unfit to have the custody of these children and that it was not in their interest that she should have their custody and that, for all practical purposes, access to the children could not be obtained by Booker.\nBy order made on May 14, 1959, the Chief Justice directed that there should be a trial of an issue as to who should have the custody of the two girls, that pleadings be delivered upon this issue and that it be set down for trial before the Chief Justice during the week commencing June 15, 1959.\nBy a further order dated June 15, 1959, it was directed that the issue should be tried on September 8, 1959, and that the present respondent should have interim custody of the two young girls until that date, subject to any order that the judgment at the trial might make. The order contained provision for access by the mother. These children have remained since then in the custody of their father.\nThere was a lengthy hearing before Spence J. at which the appellant and the respondent gave evidence at length. Kruger was called by counsel for the present appellant, it was said for the purpose of submitting him to cross-examination and gave no evidence in chief. In a most carefully considered and exhaustive judgment Spence J. directed that the custody of the two girls should be awarded to the present respondent.\nSection 1(1) of The Infants Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 180, provides that the Supreme Court may on the application of the father or mother of an infant make such order as the court sees fit regarding its custody and the right of access thereto of either parent:\nhaving regard to the welfare of the infant and to the conduct of the parents and to the wishes as well of the mother and of the father. This section has been considered several times in this Court and was relevant to the issue to be determined in McKee v. McKee[1], where Lord Simonds, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said in part (p. 365):\nIt is the law of Ontario (as it is the law of England) that the welfare and happiness of the infant is the paramount consideration in questions of custody\u2026 To this paramount consideration all others yield.\nThe evidence taken at the proceedings for divorce before the Chief Justice of the High Court, and also the exhibits, were made part of the record in the trial of the issue by Spence J. by consent. In view of the fact that it is the moral as well as the physical welfare of the infants which must be considered, a thorough examination was made of the relations between the then Mrs. Booker and Kruger during the years preceding the divorce. This is not the ordinary case where a wife has been found guilty of adultery with another on a single occasion and where, after divorce, she has married some other person than the adulterer. Rather is this a case of a wife, confessedly an adulteress, marrying the adulterer who has been responsible for the breaking-up of the home.\nI have read with care the lengthy record of both of these hearings and, having done so, I am in complete agreement with the conclusion of Spence J. as well as with the opinion expressed at the trial of the divorce proceedings by the Chief Justice of the High Court as to the undesirability of permitting these young girls to associate with the man who was the co\u2011respondent.\nWhile the fact that there had been adultery committed by the appellant and Kruger had been established to the satisfaction of the Chief Justice, the investigation at the hearing of the issue before Spence J. properly extended to matters that had occurred in the years preceding the adultery which was admittedly committed in Florida in March of 1956.\nKruger is the son of a German father and a Russian mother and was born in Russia and brought to Canada when he was four months old. When he was about 16 years of age, he and Booker became friends and the latter, who is some 8 years older, interested himself in the boy\u2019s welfare, lending him substantial sums of money on various occasions for the purpose of assisting him to become established in life. Over the period of years between 1951 and the spring of 1956, the evidence shows that Kruger was constantly associating himself with the respondent and his wife in their home and, until the events to be hereafter referred to, Booker regarded Kruger as a trustworthy friend of both of them and treated him as such.\nDuring the year 1947 Booker left for Venezuela as the representative of a Canadian life insurance company and his wife lived there with him but came to Canada when each child was born. Booker returned to Toronto to live in the year 1953. As pointed out by the Chief Justice in his oral reasons for judgment, Booker devoted himself to his business and his wife appears to have felt neglected, a situation which appears to have been favourable for Kruger\u2019s plans. On Booker\u2019s return from Venezuela he and his wife and children lived for a while with Kruger in the latter\u2019s home at 28 Ashley Park. In December 1954 Booker bought a house, 5 Darlingwood Crescent, and moved his family there. Relations between husband and wife became strained in the year 1955, Booker complaining of his wife being frequently out late at night and it would appear that, at least towards the end of that year, he became suspicious of his wife\u2019s association with Kruger. Booker says that he and his wife ceased to live as man and wife in October 1955.\nIn January 1956 the appellant, taking the two young girls with her, moved from their home to that of her mother claiming that her nerves were very bad. They remained away until the month of March and the husband, in June 1956, received an account from the Doctors\u2019 Hospital in Toronto for services rendered to his wife on March 14th and 15th. According to the hospital account, the diagnosis taken from the records was a threatened abortion. The wife had not told her husband that she was pregnant and he knew nothing of the matter until he received the account and, when he demanded an explanation, she refused to give it. It was while Mrs. Booker was staying with her mother that the first dispute arose between Booker and Kruger as to the latter\u2019s association with Mrs. Booker. During the month of March 1956 Booker had telephoned one evening to the house where his wife was staying with her mother, wishing to speak to her, and was told by the mother that Mrs. Booker was going to bed early. Being suspicious, he went to the house and found that this was untrue and that his wife was out. He waited there and she returned at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning with Kruger. A violent scene ensued, Booker assaulting Kruger. He then accused his wife of adultery with Kruger, which she denied.\nBooker then decided, in an endeavour to prevent the break-up of his marriage, that it would be advisable if he and his wife and the children had a holiday together in Florida and took them there. In April 1956 Kruger also went to Florida and after a few days Booker returned to his business in Toronto. It was during the time that the wife was in Florida with the children that she admittedly committed adultery on various occasions with Kruger. The latter had been in Florida on one occasion but, unknown to Booker, made a second trip there.\nIn June of 1956 Booker received information to the effect that in the year 1952, when he was living in Venezuela and had come with his wife to Toronto on business, leaving her there, after he had returned she had gone on a motor trip for three weeks with Kruger, leaving the children with her mother. Believing this information which, apparently, confirmed his suspicions of his wife and Kruger, he rented a fiat and moved his wife\u2019s belongings there, informing her by telephone to Florida that they were to live separate from each other thereafter. On the return of the wife to Toronto, a separation agreement was drawn which bears date simply June 1956 which provided, inter alia, that the boy John should remain with his father and the two girls with their mother during their respective minorities, the husband agreeing to pay a monthly amount for their maintenance. The agreement further provided that both parties should have reasonable access to the children.\nIn July 1956, at a time when Booker was at Cove Island with his son, he found several letters written to his wife by Kruger when she was in Florida which made it perfectly clear that while in Florida and prior to that time the two had been carrying on an adulterous relationship. Mrs. Booker was on the island when these letters, which are referred to in some detail in the judgment delivered by the Chief Justice in the divorce action, were found, and when Booker left the island taking them with him he was pursued by her in the company of Kruger, his wife using vile and abusive language to her husband in the presence of the little boy and demanding the return of the letters. Booker, however, retained possession of them and delivered them to his solicitor for safe-keeping. The wife thereafter went to the solicitor\u2019s office while her husband was there and again used abusive language of the same nature without result. Thereafter admittedly she, accompanied by Kruger, broke into her husband\u2019s house causing material damage in doing so, in an endeavour to recover the letters. The nature of the letters justified her perturbation.\nFor about a month after her return from Florida the appellant, together with the two younger children, lived in the flat which had been rented for her by her husband. After the separation agreement was made, the appellant and these children went to Kruger\u2019s place on Cove Island and spent the summer there, and it was during this time that the letters had been found.\nThe respondent issued a writ for the dissolution of the marriage on August 23, 1956, but this action was later discontinued and the action of July 5, 1957, commenced.\nThe respondent had been advised after the making of the separation agreement of June 1956 that he could not object to the action of his wife in living in Kruger\u2019s properties and was a consenting party to her going with the younger children to Cove Island. I disagree with the opinion upon which the respondent relied. The respondent took the precaution, however, of employing a man and wife to go to Cove Island and to live in the cottage to be occupied by the appellant but, shortly after their arrival there, they were moved out and during the summer Kruger occupied a room in the cottage with the appellant and the children on the frequent occasions that he was there.\nThe finding of the letters altered the situation. When the appellant and the children left Cove Island they, contrary to the wishes of the respondent, moved into Kruger\u2019s house at 28 Ashley Park and lived there until the trial of the divorce action in March of 1958. The respondent was paying to his wife under the terms of the separation agreement an ample monthly allowance for the maintenance of herself and the two younger children, and the appellant claimed that he was paying Kruger a rent of $100 a month for the house. This was shown to be mere pretence, Kruger having given her the money with which to pay it. Kruger took roofs elsewhere when the appellant and the children moved into his house and, from the Fall of 1956 until the trial of the divorce action, the respondent, either alone or in the company of a witness, observed that Kruger constantly came to 28 Ashley Park in the evening, frequently leaving there in the early hours of the morning and that on many occasions the lights of the house were turned out. On January 9, 1958, for example, he arrived at 6 o\u2019clock in the evening and stayed until after 3 o\u2019clock the following morning. This was just two months before the trial of the divorce action.\nAt the time of the trial before the Chief Justice, Booker expressed his willingness to have the interim custody of the two younger children awarded to his wife, he having no facilities then to properly care for them, and it was on that footing that the Chief Justice made the order referred to. He, however, expressed his opinion as to the necessity of ensuring that the children were not permitted to associate with Kruger. In the reasons for judgment delivered orally at the conclusion of the trial, dealing with this aspect of the matter the learned Chief Justice said in part:\nUnfortunately early in their married life Mr. Booker made the acquaintance of Mr. Kruger, the Co-defendant, and he made a friend of him, taking him to his house and treating him as a friend for many years. Mr. Kruger appeared to respond to this friendship but all the while was developing an affection for Mrs. Booker, and that situation developed to the extent that it is quite clear to me that he, Kruger, was seeking to get rid of Mr. Booker so that he could marry Mrs. Booker. That becomes evident in some letters that I shall refer to in due course.\nAnd after quoting some passages from the letters indicating an adulterous relationship it was said:\nIn addition, Kruger had been acting as a companion, a very close companion, of Mrs. Booker for years. She was a guest at his cottage at Cove Island, where she would stay for periods of time. Mr. Booker foolishly concurred in this. He went there himself. The whole thing is a tangled mess and in some circumstances perhaps wouldn\u2019t raise too much suspicion but in the circumstances we have here it seems to me to be perfectly clear that there was a very definite affinity between Mrs. Booker and Kruger and that Kruger was ingeniously conniving to appear to be a friend of Mr. Booker while at the same time having the sort of relationship with Mrs. Booker that these letters indicate. These letters are not the scribblings of an adolescent child; they are the writings of a mature man. The words were written contemporaneously with the events as they were developing and as they ultimately did develop, to the extent of the frequent visits to the house during the late hours. I cannot conceive that a man who desired the body of a woman as Kruger clearly showed he desired the body of Mrs. Booker could remain in the house with her night after night during these later hours for any other purpose than having sexual intercourse with her.\nI think on the whole course of conduct the inference to be drawn is irresistible and I draw the inference that adultery has been proved. I hope that Kruger will realize that he has been a party to destroying a home with all the incidents that will flow from it and the handicaps these little children will have as a result of his selfish sexual desires.\nDealing with the custody of the two young girls, the learned Chief Justice said:\nNow as to the custody of the children, Mrs. Booker has given an undertaking to the Court which is recorded in the evidence, and I will not make any attempt to repeat it because it was specific, and I incorporate it in my judgment as it was given; I will ask the Reporter to do so:\nHIS LORDSHIP: If the custody of these two little girls is awarded to you, are you willing to undertake that any associations that have been carried on between you and your co-defendant Kruger will be discontinued:\nMRS. BOOKER: Yes, sir, I do.\nHIS LORDSHIP: The little girls won\u2019t come under his influence at all?\nMRS. BOOKER: No, sir.\nHIS LORDSHIP: You will undertake that?\nMRS. BOOKER: Yes, sir, I do.\nI trust and hope that Mrs. Booker has learned by now that there are more valuable things in life than the affections of a deceitful man, a man that would steal the wife of another man. His affections are of no value to any woman, and I am anxious that these children will not come under his influence.\nThe reasons for judgment pointed out to both of the parties that the order for custody was not final and that if there was a change of circumstances the order might be changed. The order made permitted the parents access to the children not in their custody at defined times.\nOn March 10, 1958, following the granting of the decree nisi, the respondent arranged for a lease of a suitable house property for the appellant and the two girls but she refused to sign the lease or to live there.\nDespite the undertaking given to the Chief Justice by her and the terms of the custody order, the appellant promptly resumed her association with Kruger and, shortly afterwards with $5,000 lent to her by him, made the first payment on the purchase of a house property in Oakville. At the trial before Spence J. the appellant admitted that she was aware that this conduct jeopardized her right to custody under the terms of the order.\nOn June 13, 1958, Kruger filed a notice of intervention in the divorce action. This document which did not bear the name of any solicitor said that Kruger could show cause why the judgment in the action should not be made absolute, the causes of the intervention being, inter alia, that Booker had committed perjury at the trial and that collusion existed between the plaintiff and the defendants. An affidavit made by Kruger was filed in support of the intervention, the document bearing no solicitor\u2019s name, stating certain facts intended to indicate that the obtaining of the decree nisi had been collusive and containing also the grave charge that, to Kruger\u2019s knowledge, Booker had been having illicit relations with Ulrika Ehlers, a woman whom he intended to marry. No attempt was ever made to support this statement. The appellant knew that this notice of intervention was to be filed and said that she informed Booker of the fact.\nAccording to the appellant, however, Kruger had told her that he had been advised by counsel that after filing the notice of intervention it was unobjectionable for them to associate with each other. Kruger who gave evidence before Spence J. did not support this statement and Spence J. did not believe it. It appears to me to be inconceivable that any such advice had been given.\nAccording to the respondent, he became aware of the filing of the notice of intervention in July 1958 some weeks after it had been filed. The judgment of the Chief Justice had granted temporary custody of the two girls to the wife on the conditions above mentioned and, save in this respect, the separation agreement of June 1956 remained unchanged. The respondent was aware that his wife had resumed her association with Kruger, in disregard of the order of the Court, and instructed his solicitor to apply to the Chief Justice for an order rescinding the custody order in the decree nisi and giving him the custody of all three of the children. The motion was made returnable on September 5, 1958, and was supported by two affidavits of the respondent showing that the appellant had promptly resumed her association with Kruger and in premises where the two young girls were in her custody under the judgment. This was followed by negotiations between the solicitors for the parties and a solicitor on Kruger\u2019s behalf. It is clear from the evidence that the respondent was most unwilling to agree to his wife having custody of the two girls, knowing that she intended to marry Kruger. According to his evidence, however, being advised that his chances of obtaining an order for custody of these two children were very slight and acting on that advice, he authorized his solicitor to agree that the appellant should have the custody of the two girls. I do not agree with the opinion upon which the respondent relied. A memorandum to this effect was signed by the respondent and his solicitor and a formal agreement was drawn, though it was not signed. This was done without reference to the Chief Justice, the solicitors, apparently overlooking the fact that once the court had assumed jurisdiction over the children and had made an order for temporary custody, the provision could not be changed without its approval. The solicitor acting for the appellant, however, in advance of the application for the decree nisi informed the Chief Justice of what had been done.\nBy the terms of the separation agreement made in June 1956 it was agreed that the respondent should have the custody of the boy, the eldest of the children, and the appellant that of the two girls during their respective minorities. The agreement provided in general terms that both parties should have reasonable access at all times to each of the children and, with the approval of one another, to take any of the children for week-ends or holidays on giving reasonable notice to the other. This was before the discovery of the Kruger letters and the commencement of the first divorce action. Difficulties arose thereafter in the arrangements for access. On one occasion, the date of which is not made clear in the evidence, the respondent had arranged with his wife to take the two girls for the week-end but, when he arrived at Kruger\u2019s place where the appellant was then living, he found that his wife and Kruger had taken them away for the week-end. On their return, apparently a violent scene ensued between the respondent and Kruger, the respondent threatening him with violence, as a result of which Kruger laid a charge in the police court and the respondent was bound over to keep the peace.\nIn the summer of 1957 when the appellant and the two girls were at Cove Island, the respondent was having great difficulty in obtaining access and accordingly applied in chambers to Treleaven J. on July 24, 1957, the latter directing that the respondent should have access for defined periods during the months of July and August 1957, and thereafter on Saturday and Sunday of each week between the hours of 9.00 a.m. and 6.00 p.m. The appellant had taken the position that the respondent had no right to see the young girls at all and, when the order was made, the respondent sent a telegram informing the appellant of the making of the order and that he proposed to call for the children, and it was shown that this telegram was received by the appellant. However, when the respondent arrived at Cove Island to take the children away, the appellant informed the respondent that no judge could tell her whether she could have her children or not.\nIn September 1958, after the decree nisi when the two girls were living with their mother at the house at Oakville and, at or about the time when the above mentioned application was launched, the respondent went there to take the two younger children with him when the appellant, in the presence of the little boy, attacked her husband using foul language and damaging the respondent\u2019s car to the extent of about $300. The two younger children were in the house at the time of this occurrence.\nThe decree absolute for divorce contained no provision for custody.\nAfter the remarriage of both parties there was further trouble in carrying out the arrangements for custody. The respondent, who had evidently changed his mind as to the wisdom of having authorized his solicitor to make the agreement above mentioned, advised the appellants solicitors that he did not propose to be bound by it. At the end of the year 1958 the appellant, having married Kruger, went with him for a holiday to the West Indies, leaving the two young children in the custody of some friend at Oakville, without informing the respondent of her intention to do so or of the whereabouts, of the children. For several days he was unable to exercise his right to custody since he did not know where the children were. He was, however, able to locate them and take them to his home. In April 1959 the respondent called at Kruger\u2019s place at Oakville for the purpose of taking the two young girls into his temporary custody, having wired to the appellant saying he wished to do so and asking her to wire if she disagreed with the proposal. The respondent drove his car, in which his son was a passenger, and stopped at the front door of the place and, shortly afterwards, Kruger drove his car into the driveway blocking the exit and informing the respondent that he was going to leave his car there as long as was necessary and that he would call the police. The young girls were in the house at the time watching this. As they were not given into the respondent\u2019s custody and as there was no other means of exit from Kruger\u2019s property, the respondent drove his car across the lawn to enable him to leave the property. Kruger then prosecuted him in the police court for doing wilful damage to his property. The charge was dismissed.\nThe evidence of the respondent is that as the Easter holidays were approaching the situation in regard to the custody of the children was wholly intolerable and he thought that it was in their best interests that he should stay away altogether rather than to expose them to these recurring scenes. Having done this, he consulted another solicitor and the motion above mentioned was launched on May 8, 1959.\nThe trial of the issue before Spence J. lasted seven days during which there was a most extensive examination of the behaviour of the appellant and respondent during the years of their married life.\nThe evidence was most carefully and exhaustively examined by Mr. Justice Spence in his considered reasons for judgment. After having referred to what had been said by Roach J.A. in Bell v. Bell[2], as to the desirability of small girls being entrusted to the custody of their mother, the learned trial judge said:\nIt is, therefore, the unpleasant duty of the Court to find whether in its opinion the present Mrs. Kruger is or is not an improper party to have the custody of these two little girls. That investigation must be carried on in light of the fact that I have already found that Mr. Booker is an excellent character and that his present wife, although only 24 years of age, is a calm, serene, capable young woman.\nSpence J. did not believe the evidence of the appellant who had said that the only occasions on which she had committed adultery with Kruger was during her stay in Florida in the early summer of 1956. It was made quite clear by the letters written by Kruger to the appellant in 1956 that the affair between them was one of long standing. Referring to the occasion in 1952 when, in the absence of her husband, the appellant had driven with Kruger to Boston and New York, the learned judge said that he did not believe her explanation and did not believe her when she said that the trip was taken with her husband\u2019s knowledge. Cross-examined as to this, she said that she and Kruger had driven to Boston and thence on to New York and returned by air. Later she said, in answer to a question asked by the learned trial judge, that she had been away four or five days. She said she could not remember what hotel she had stayed at in New York. The information obtained by her husband was that it had been of some three weeks\u2019 duration, during which time she had left the children with her mother. The learned trial judge said as to this:\nThe defendant in the issue and her co-defendant Kruger knew of her husband\u2019s information on this trip to the east coast as early as June of 1956 and in the intervening 3\u00bd years they have done nothing to refute the evidence which tends to show that it was far from an innocent trip made at the request of the husband. I agree with the view expressed by counsel for the plaintiff upon the argument that even if Mrs. Booker\u2019s version of the Boston or New York trip was one which should be accepted, then not one woman in a thousand would put herself in the position of making such a trip. I am convinced, however, that her version is not to be accepted and that rather the trip to the east coast was substantially that described to the plaintiff by the witness Barrett, that it was not innocent and that it constituted a most disturbing disregard for her marital vows or for the continued happiness of the home in which she and her husband and her then two children resided. It seems more than probable that the defendant in the issue and her co-defendant Kruger continued their surreptitious association, at any rate not infrequently, after 1952.\nDealing with a matter occurring in 1955, he said:\nIn 1955 the plaintiff left Cove Island expecting his wife, the defendant in the issue, and her co-defendant Kruger, to follow him down in an automobile within a very short time. Instead, they only arrived the next day with protestations of innocence. The learned judge further said:\nUpon the plaintiff and the defendant in the issue returning from Florida with their children she was installed in an apartment which her husband had rented for her and it was abundantly plain to her at that time that the marriage was a broken one and it must have been plain to her that the custody of her two daughters was in considerable jeopardy\u2026 From that time until the trial of the action in March of 1958 the defendant in the issue and her co-defendant Kruger associated openly in a district in which she and her husband, the plaintiff, had always lived and in front of their many mutual friends so that there could be no mistake in the view of all persons as to the relationship between the two defendants. The view taken by the Chief Justice of the High Court of such an association was made abundantly clear to the defendant in the issue and the defendant in the issue has acknowledged that when she left the courtroom she was in no doubt as to the danger which her continued association with her co-defendant Kruger would be to her retention of custody of the two infant daughters. Despite this as I have found that association continued unabated and in fact she accepted the bounty of the defendant in the issue firstly by living in his home at 28 Ashley Park for some months at a rent which if paid was ridiculously small, and it would appear that the alleged payment of rent was another mere sham, and thereafter moving to a house which she purchased with his money, some $5,000 in fact. All of this conduct I cannot help but feel, goes far to show that the defendant in the issue is such a person as would put the gratification of her own pleasures ahead of her interest in her two infant daughters and show that she would be ready to sacrifice that interest at any time it collided with her own personal pleasure.\nAfter referring to the various violent displays of temper on the part of both parties and their effect on the children, the learned judge said:\nSome instances which follow the trial for dissolution are particularly disturbing. As I have said, the defendant in the issue then realized her conduct was under constant scrutiny by her husband or by his agents. I am of the opinion that this realization caused her and her co-defendant Kruger to take the most picayune methods of annoying the plaintiff. Among such instances were the departure of the defendant in the issue and her co\u2011defendant to the Barbados after their marriage without any notification to the plaintiff of where they had left the two infant girls so that he might have them for the access to which he was entitled and the writing of such information to him from the Barbados only in such a fashion as would cause it to arrive some days after he was supposed to have access; and again, the ridiculous incident upon the plaintiff driving into the driveway at 1037 Lakeshore to pick up the children and having with him his son John at the time the defendant Kruger drove his automobile in back of the plaintiff blocking his exit and causing the plaintiff to drive across the lawn in order to leave and then charging the plaintiff with wilful damage to the lawn and shrubs. The latter incident occurred only in April of this year. Such instances may in themselves appear to be and be unimportant. They do exhibit a smallness of mind and a bitterness. The putting of their own selfish interests ahead of the interests of the children would tend to indicate that the defendant in the issue is not a proper person to have the custody of these young children. There is, moreover, the most important circumstance that to award the defendant in the issue the custody of the two infant daughters, Susan and Jennifer, would be in effect awarding such custody to the defendant Kruger. Counsel for the plaintiff on the argument put it that Kruger was the moving spirit in this alliance and that he was the person who was in control and directed the conduct of the defendant in the issue throughout. Everything in the trial would seem to indicate such a conclusion to be the sound one. The defendant Kruger was a close friend of the plaintiff for ten years prior to the action for dissolution of marriage and what is more was an object of the plaintiff\u2019s bounty on more than one occasion. The plaintiff advanced the defendant Kruger large sums of money, which were subsequently repaid, and yet the Chief Justice of the High Court in the dissolution action and I in this action have found that the conduct of the defendant Kruger throughout was, in reference to the plaintiff, about as disgraceful as can be imagined. It would be with some very considerable misgiving that I would make an order which would have the practical effect of giving him the custody of the plaintiff\u2019s two infant daughters. Therefore, and for these reasons and despite the fact that it is with the utmost reluctance that I award the custody of the infant daughters to anyone but their mother. I must find that as between the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff is the more proper person to have the custody of Susan and Jennifer Booker.\nAylesworth and LeBel JJ.A. agreed with the learned trial judge and the appeal was dismissed. Both of these learned judges held that the trial judge had proceeded upon the proper principles and, upon evidence, agreed with his conclusion that it was in the interests of the two little children that they should be given into the custody of their father.\nThere are thus concurrent findings upon this question of fact.\nLaidlaw J.A. dissented. That learned judge said in part that McRuer C.J. had the same full opportunity as had Spence J. of seeing the parents and the children and that it was certain that he had given full effect to this before reaching his decision to award the custody of the children. This observation appears to me to overlook the evidence that it was with Booker\u2019s approval and consent that the Chief Justice awarded temporary custody to the appellant and that the reason for the consent was that, since the parties were separated, the father had no means at that time of properly caring for these little girls. It is also to be remembered that the learned Chief Justice expressed himself forcibly as to the undesirability of the children being permitted to have any association with Kruger and that this was a term of the order. Laidlaw J.A. was further of the opinion that Spence J. had erred in treating the hearing before him as a trial de novo. This he considered to have been error and held that it was not open to Spence J., in view of the order of the Chief Justice, to consider all of the facts and circumstances. With this conclusion I disagree.\nThe whole issue as to what was in the interest of the two little children was referred to Spence J. and every fact and circumstance necessary for the determination of that issue was relevant and admissible before him. That this was the view of the learned and experienced counsel who appeared for the present appellant in those proceedings is shown by the fact that he raised no objection to this being done. Laidlaw J.A. was further of the opinion that, by reason of the agreement made in advance of the making of the decree absolute, the respondent was precluded from making an application based on the ground of the wrongful association between the appellant and Kruger after the decree nisi. But this, with respect, is to misconceive the issue which Spence J. was required to try. This is not an ordinary law suit for the determination of legal rights, but an issue to decide what order for custody is in the best interests of these two little children. That is the primary consideration to which, as was said by the Judicial Committee in McKee\u2019s case[3], all other considerations are subservient. The rights of the mother and the father given to them by s. 2 of The Infants Act were merely matters to be considered in determining the real issue.\nThe learned judge further attached weight to the fact that the intervention filed by Kruger was withdrawn or abandoned on the faith of the agreement. The evidence as to the filing of this notice of intervention in June of 1958 shows that it was done by Kruger with the approval and consent of the then Mrs. Booker. The notice was supported by an affidavit made by Kruger to the effect that during the summer of 1956 an agreement had been made by him with Booker that he\u2014Kruger\u2014\u201cwould allow evidence of adultery to be established\u201d but that Booker had brought the action for divorce in July, and accordingly he (Kruger) had \u201crefused to commit the act of adultery necessary to support the action.\u201d The fact was that the action referred to was commenced on August 23, 1956, a month after the letters had been discovered by Booker. In view of the evidence afforded by the letters, the statement was patently untrue. Booker denied that there was any such agreement and Spence J. believed him. The filing of the notice of intervention containing the false statement that Kruger had evidence of misconduct between Booker and Miss Ehlers was apparently done by Kruger for the purpose of bringing pressure to bear upon Booker to agree to his wife having custody of the two younger children. It was apparently thought that he would do this rather than face the publicity attendant on a contest at the time of the granting of the decree absolute. No solicitor cared to put his name on the notice or the affidavit. Why any weight should be assigned to the withdrawal of this baseless intervention I cannot understand.\nThe learned judge of appeal further dealing with the facts said that the trial judge had given undue weight to the breach of the undertaking given by the appellant to the Chief Justice, having regard to the fact that, in his opinion, the breach became of little or no importance, in the absence of evidence that it affected the interest or welfare of the children while in her possession and under her care. This appears to overlook the fact that the renewed association with Kruger immediately after the decree nisi was a breach of an order of the court, and thus a contempt for which the appellant might have been committed, and that throughout the summer of 1958 the appellant constantly associated with Kruger, that he stayed late at the house in Toronto in which she and the two little girls were living, this being in the neighbourhood where she and her husband were well known and where the fact was known that she and Kruger had been found guilty of adultery, and in his summer place on Cove Island in his company together with the children. That such conduct by a parent having custody of children in such circumstances is not detrimental to their welfare is not, in my opinion, a tenable proposition.\nIt must be rarely, if it is ever the case, that decisions by other courts in questions of this nature, decided upon different facts, are of any assistance as precedents. Laidlaw J.A., after stating that the learned trial judge had clearly acted upon some wrong principle and had disregarded material evidence, referred to the cases of Philpott v. Philpott[4], and Bell v. Bell[5], as authority for the proposition that upon these grounds the Court of Appeal may reverse the judgment of a trial judge. I would not have thought that any authority was necessary for this. As the trial judge acted upon the principle enunciated by the Privy Council in McKee\u2019s case[6] and by this Court on many occasions, I think it cannot be said that he acted on some wrong principle. As to the statement that he disregarded material evidence, the majority of the members of the Court of Appeal were of the contrary opinion and, having read all of the evidence at both hearings with great care, I respectfully agree with them.\nIn Philpott v. Philpott4 as the head note shows, the evidence did not establish moral misconduct on the part of the wife and it was held that the custody of the twin infant children, one a boy and the other a girl some three years of age, should be given to the mother. Pickup C.J.O. was of the opinion that the trial judge had erred in not giving due consideration to the welfare of the infants. Hogg J.A., with whom the Chief Justice agreed, after reviewing the facts and saying that there was no satisfactory evidence of misconduct on the part of the mother, was of the opinion that they would be properly cared for and that it was in their best interest that they should be with the mother. The decision enunciates no new principle and is simply a judgment on the facts.\nIn Bell v. Bell[7] there was no evidence or moral misconduct on the part of either the husband or the wife, both of whom were deeply religious. The child, a girl, was four years old and the Court of Appeal considered upon the facts that it was in her interest that she should be in the custody of the mother.\nLaidlaw J.A. also referred to a judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in Allen v. Allen[8]. In that case, decided under the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1925, which, by s. 1. provides that in deciding the question of the custody of an infant the court shall regard its welfare as the first and paramount consideration, after a decree of divorce had been granted to a husband on the ground of the wife\u2019s adultery, the custody of the daughter of the marriage, 8 years old, who had lived with her mother from birth, had been given by Wallington J. to the husband. The assigned ground for this was that the wife, who had married the co-respondent, having once committed adultery was likely to do so again and that, as the husband was remarried to a wife against whose moral conduct no charge could be made, he was more fit to have the child. Wrottesley and Evershed L.JJ., after reciting the facts, were of the opinion that the fact that a woman had once committed adultery did not prove that she was unfit to look after a child. In that case, the father was a soldier and the adultery had been committed during his absence from England.\nThe only other case relied upon is Willoughby v. Willoughby[9]. In that case the husband had been unable to support his wife and she had to go out to work and it was shown that during this period she had committed adultery with the co-respondent and that she had lived with him until the husband divorced her in the following year. The child was not with the mother during this period, having been sent to the country to live with the mother of the husband. While the trial judge, Wallington J., who gave the custody of the child to the father gave no written reasons, it was agreed by counsel that the main reason which he gave for not giving custody to the mother was that a woman who had committed adultery once might commit it again. This was the opinion which the same judge had expressed in Allen\u2019s case. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment. Cohen L.J. referred to the decision in Allen\u2019s case and said that apparently it had not been drawn to the attention of Wallington J. Upon the evidence he said there was no suggestion that the mother was promiscuous or a bad mother and accordingly considered that the child, a little girl, should be entrusted to her care until further order. The child was two years of age and Singleton L.J. agreed that it was better that she should be with the mother, at least for the present. With great respect, I think none of these cases touch the matter for decision in the present case.\nThe order for custody embodied in the decree nisi was made under the provisions of s. 5 of The Matrimonial Causes Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 226, which reads:\n5. (1) In any action for divorce the court may from time to time and either before or after the judgment absolute, make such provision as appears to be just with regard to the custody, maintenance and education of the children of the marriage and may direct payment by either the father or the mother of such sum as may be necessary for the due care, maintenance and education of the children of the marriage.\n(2) An application under this section may be made by either husband or wife or by the children by their next friend either at the hearing of the case or upon summary application therein.\nIt is to be noted that under subs. (2) the right is given to the children to apply by their next friend recognizing, if any recognition is necessary, their interest in the matter.\nThe action was still pending at the time the respondent, acting upon legal advice, signed the memorandum of November 6, 1958, which purported to change the terms of the order. In my opinion, this agreement which ignored the interest of the children was of no legal effect. While s. 2(2) of The Infants Act permits parents who are divorced to agree as to the custody of their children, this cannot mean that they may do so when an order made in the divorce proceedings, whether before or after the decree absolute, is in effect. To construe it otherwise would be to say that, at the will of the parents, the jurisdiction of the court may be ousted.\nThis was the view forcibly expressed by McRuer C.J. when the application to change the order for custody was made before him in September 1958, at which time he directed the delivery of pleadings and the trial of an issue. The learned Chief Justice then pointed out to the parties that the children were not to be treated by the parents as though they were chattels and that the custody order of March 1958 was still in effect. This was also the view of Spence J. with whom the majority of the members of the Court of Appeal agreed. The application which resulted in the trial of this issue was made in the divorce action. In my opinion, the same principles apply to the exercise of the powers given by s. 5 of The Matrimonial Causes Act, as applied to the exercise of those given by s. 1 of The Infants Act.\nThe two little girls are now nine and seven years old, respectively, and for the past year and a half have been in their father\u2019s custody at his home in Toronto. His second marriage has been a happy one. Spence J. found his wife to be a calm, serene, capable and very responsible young woman. As to Booker, he found him to have a scrupulous regard for the truth and \u201ca fine citizen\u2026 who is normally of a calm and equitable temperament\u201d and very fond of the children. The evidence is that they are very happy with their stepmother. They are going to a school nearby and to the Sunday school of the United Church in their neighbourhood. Booker is a successful business man with a substantial income and supports his family in comfort.\nThese findings as to the respondent and his wife are to be contrasted with those made by McRuer C.J. and Spence J. as to the appellant and Kruger. In one of the letters written by Kruger to the then Mrs. Booker when she was in Florida in the spring of 1956 he said that \u201cthe last ten years have been longing ones for both of us.\u201d Whether the adulterous relationship between the two had lasted as long as this is uncertain but the contents of these letters make clear that it had existed for some time prior to the time when they were written, probably as far back as 1952 when, after Booker had left Toronto to return to Venezuela, the appellant and Kruger went on the trip together, professedly to Boston and New York.\nBooker apparently had complete trust in his wife and in his friend Kruger up to the fall of 1955, when he became suspicious of her relations with Kruger. When she left home in January 1956 and went to live with her mother, professedly on the ground that she was not well, he found his suspicions confirmed by the incident at her mother\u2019s house when she returned in the early hours of the morning with Kruger. It was not until July that he received the bill from the hospital with the details of the treatment given to his wife. She had not told him that she was pregnant and her account of this was obviously untrue, she having said that she went there for a blood transfusion.\nThe parties had not lived as man and wife since October, 1955. The conduct of the appellant in Florida at a time when the children were in her custody, living with her in a motel, afford some indication of her unfitness as custodian. After her husband had stayed with them there and returned to Toronto she engaged in a series of adulteries with Kruger in another motel nearby.\nOn her return to Toronto she lived with the two girls for a short time in the apartment provided by her husband, then at Kruger\u2019s place at Cove Island, and later in Kruger\u2019s home in Toronto. Their constant association continued up to the time of the trial. McRuer C.J., after referring to the fact that she had lived in Kruger\u2019s house between the fall of 1956 until the trial of the divorce action in March 1958 and after referring to the terms of Kruger\u2019s letters, said that he could not conceive that a man who desired the body of a woman as Kruger clearly showed he desired the body of Mrs. Booker could remain in the house with her night after night during these late hours for any other purpose than having sexual intercourse with her.\nHer conduct following the granting of the decree nisi in continuing to associate with Kruger was a flagrant contempt of court committed at a time when, under the order of the Chief Justice, she had custody of the two little girls in Kruger\u2019s house. Spence J. indicated his view of her conduct in the summer and fall of 1958 when he said in the passage above quoted that she was such a person as would put the gratification of her own pleasures ahead of her interest in her two daughters.\nThese two young girls are now of an age when, if they are entrusted to the custody of their mother, they will undoubtedly ask why they are separated from their father and from his home where they are living so happily, and why their father and mother are not living together. It is scarcely to be expected that the appellant will tell them the truth, that being that her marriage to their father was broken up by her continued adultery with Kruger in whose home they would then be living. There would thereafter be over the years these further deceptions practised by the appellant until a few years hence when it would be impossible to conceal the truth from the two children.\nIt is, in my opinion, unrealistic to suggest that in awarding custody to the mother these two young girls would not also be for all practical purposes in the custody of Kruger who, having married their mother, would stand in loco parentis to them (21 Hals., 3rd ed., 189; Stone v. Carr[10]). It is quite clear from the letters written and from the evidence given by the appellant at the trial that she had come completely under the domination of Kruger for some time prior to the bringing of the divorce action and, while in Florida, she knew and was a party to Kruger having her husband watched by private detectives in the vain hope of finding some impropriety by him which would enable her to secure a divorce. This was in advance of the discovery of Kruger\u2019s letters by Booker. On her own evidence, Kruger actively directed the negotiations on her behalf between the granting of the decree nisi and the decree absolute.\nKruger was befriended by Booker in his youth and assisted in getting a start in life by very considerable loans of money. While posing as Booker\u2019s friend, he was obviously engaged for years before March 1956 in an adulterous relationship with his wife and in an endeavour to break up the marriage of the man who considered him to be his friend and trusted him. His behaviour can only be described as contemptible throughout. McRuer C.J. said:\nI hope that Kruger will realize that he has been a party to destroying a home with all the incidents that will flow from it and the handicaps these little children will have as a result of his selfish sexual desires.\nMcRuer C.J. and Spence J. who have had the advantage of seeing these people were firmly of the opinion that it was contrary to the interests of these little children that they should be permitted to associate with Kruger. The majority of the members of the Court of Appeal have concurred in the opinion of Spence J. that it is in their best interests that they should remain in the custody of their father, and we are asked to reverse these concurrent findings. It would; in my opinion, be a grave injustice to these children to award their custody to their mother. They are now being brought up in the home of an honest clean-living man and his wife, are being properly educated and instructed in religious matters which will include instruction in the virtues of truthfulness and chastity. Much of the influence that all parents have upon their children is attributable to the example furnished by their own characters and conduct and these, in the case of Booker and his second wife, are unimpeachable. The character of the appellant and of the man to whom she is now married have been demonstrated to be such as to make neither of them a desirable custodian of these two small girls.\nThe learned judges who have decided this matter have rightly directed their attention to the paramount consideration in questions of custody to which, as stated by Lord Simonds, all others yield. But if the matter were to be considered as merely a determination of the rights of the parents inter se without regard to this paramount consideration, the result must inevitably, in my opinion, be the same. Section 1 of The Infants Act requires the court in matters of custody to have regard, inter alia, to the conduct of the parents. Unless otherwise ordered by the court the parents are joint guardians and equally entitled to custody by virtue of s. 2. Section 3 requires that in questions relating to custody the rules of equity prevail.\nThe contention of the appellant is that it is her right to have the children taken from the home and custody of the father whose conduct has been blameless throughout, so that they may be brought up by her in the home maintained by the man whose adulterous conduct with her was the cause of the breaking-up of the respondent\u2019s home. If there is any equitable principle which would justify such an order in these circumstances, we have not been referred to it and I am not aware that there is any.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to an order of this Court granting leave to appeal made on June 20, 1960, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, pronounced on May 6, 1960, whereby an appeal from a judgment of Spence J. pronounced on October 22, 1959, was dismissed; Laidlaw J.A. dissenting would have allowed the appeal.\nThe effect of the judgment of Spence J. was to award the custody of the two infant daughters of the appellant and the respondent, hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cthe daughters\u201d, to the respondent and to give rights of access to the appellant. These infants are Susan Claire Booker born on October 27, 1951, and Jennifer Lynn Booker born on November 3, 1953. There is one other child of the parties John Scott Booker born on October 21, 1945, but his custody is not in question in this appeal; he is in the custody of the respondent and the appellant has rights of access to him.\nIt will be convenient to set out certain undisputed facts in chronological order.\nThe appellant and respondent were married on July 16, 1943.\nThree children were born of the marriage as set out above.\nIn June 1956, the appellant and respondent entered into a separation agreement whereby during their minorities the custody and guardianship of John was given to the respondent and the custody of the daughters was given to the appellant. Paragraph 7 of this agreement read as follows:\n7. The wife, in performing and observing the stipulations on her part stated herein, and provided she remains chaste shall have the custody and guardianship of the two girls, Susan and Jennifer during their respective minorities.\nBy writ issued on August 23, 1956, the respondent commenced an action for divorce against the appellant and Richard Kruger, hereinafter referred to as Kruger, but this action was discontinued in June 1957.\nIn September 1956, the appellant and respondent entered into a further agreement which provided as follows:\n1. The Husband, Plaintiff in an action for divorce against the Wife, hereby WAIVES all claims for costs in connection with such action and to a complete release of any and all claims either against the Wife or the co-Defendant in the said action, Richard Kruger.\n2. The Husband further AGREES to pay monies due under a Separation Agreement between the parties to the credit of a bank account in the name of the Wife as and where she shall designate. 3. The Husband further AGREES to turn over to the Wife for her sole ownership, the following articles\u2014Vibrator; Washer and Dryer;\u2014out-board motor boat.\n4. The Wife in turn RELINQUISHES all claim to any furniture presently in the possession of the Husband.\n5. The Wife further AGREES that in the event of her remarriage in the event of a divorce being granted that she will agree to reduce the amounts payable under the Separation Agreement entered into between the parties to $100.00 per month, subject to increase as the children get older to an amount to be agreed upon.\n6. The boy John is to be left in care of the mother in the absence of the father at any time.\nAt the time of signing this agreement the agreement of June 1956 was amended by striking out the words \u201cand provided she remains chaste\u201d which appeared in paragraph 7 quoted above. This alteration was initialled by the respondent.\nBy writ issued on July 9, 1957, the respondent commenced a new action for divorce against the appellant and Kruger. In this action Mr. Gerard Beaudoin Q.C., acted as solicitor and counsel for the respondent.\nOn March 4 and 5, 1958, this action was tried before McRuer C.J.H.C. and at the conclusion of the trial, he pronounced a judgment nisi of divorce by reason of the adultery of the appellant with Kruger. Paragraph 3 of the formal judgment provided as follows:\n3. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the defendant, Vera Leona Booker, upon her undertaking to this Court to discontinue any associations by her with the defendant, Richard Kruger, be and she is awarded the sole custody and control of the infants Susan Clair Booker, born on the 27th day of October, 1951 and Jennifer Lynn Booker, born on the 3rd day of November, 1953, subject however to the right of the Plaintiff, Ernest William Booker, to have access to the said infants on Saturday of each week from 9.00 A.M. to 6.00 P.M. and for three days during Easter vacation and for three days during Christmas vacation and for three weeks during summer school vacation in each and every year.\nParagraph 4 of the judgment ordered the respondent to pay $350 per month to the appellant for the support of the daughters so long as they should remain in the custody of the appellant and until they should attain 16 years of age or until the Court should otherwise order.\nOn June 13, 1958, Kruger served a notice of intervention.\nOn September 5, 1958, Mr. Beaudoin served a notice of motion on behalf of the respondent returnable before McRuer C.J.H.C. asking that the judgment of March 5, 1958, be varied to give sole custody of the daughters to the respondent, the ground alleged in the respondent\u2019s affidavit filed in support of the motion was that the appellant had failed to carry out her undertaking given to McRuer C.J.H.C. to discontinue any association by her with Kruger. The respondent deposed to his belief that the appellant was \u201cstill in constant association\u201d with Kruger. The hearing of this motion was adjourned.\nBetween September 10, 1958, and November 6, 1958, negotiations were carried on between the solicitors for the parties.\nOn November 6, 1958, an agreement was arrived at following a discussion at which the following persons were present: the respondent, his counsel Mr. Beaudoin, the appellant, her counsel Mr. Brooke, and Mr. Hughes counsel for Kruger. This agreement was reduced to writing and is as follows:\nPRESENT. G. Beaudoin, Q.C.\nWm. Booker,\nR. Hughes,\nMrs. Booker\nJohn W. Brooke\nAgreed as follows John Brooke Office\nNov. 6th, 1958.\n1. Custody of the 2 girls to Mrs. Booker and custody of the son to Mr. Booker with mutual access in alternate weekends and at Christmas Easter Summertime as per Minutes of Settlement attached.\n2. Mr. Booker will pay 250 per month for November and December 1958. The claims of Mr. Booker for rent paid 642.00 is considered as satisfied against the claim of Mrs. Booker for allowance for September and October 1958. The claim of Mr. Booker 300.00 for his car is settled.\n3. Mr. Booker will apply for Judgment Absolute forthwith, and following Judgment absolute he consents to Mrs. Booker seeing Mr. Kruger pending marriage, and he consents to their marriage and that the association referred to in this paragraph shall not be raised as a ground for a further application for custody by Mr. Booker. It is understanding of the parties that marriage will take place in the immediate future. (Jan. 1, 1958)\n4. If by Jan. 1st 1959 Mrs. Booker has decided against marriage to Kruger then Mr. Booker, Mrs. Booker and their solicitors shall meet to consider what financial arrangements are necessary for the welfare of the children and their future.\n7A.

Provision as to telephone calls to children agreed per draft.\n10. Provision as to removing the children from the jurisdiction agreed as per draft. 11. Re item 4D pages 3 and 4 draft, upon return the spouse shall have that weekend with the children and thereafter weekends alternate once more.\n(Signed) \u201cWm. E.

Brooke\u201d\nBetween November 6 and November 12, 1958, the notice of intervention filed by Kruger and the notice to vary the judgment of March 5, 1958, served by Mr. Beaudoin were withdrawn.\nOn November 12, 1958, judgment absolute of divorce was granted by Aylen J.\nOn December 13, 1958, the appellant and Kruger were married.\nOn December 23, 1958, the respondent and Miss Ulrike Ehlers were married.\nOn May 8, 1959, the respondent served a notice of motion returnable before McRuer C.J.H.C. for an order varying the judgment of March 5, 1958, so as to give custody of the daughters to the respondent on the grounds that:\n1. The said Vera Leona Booker, now Vera Leona Kruger, did not adhere to the undertakings given at the trial upon which she was awarded custody of the two youngest children.\n2. Since trial the said Vera Leona Kruger has shown herself unfit to have the custody of the two youngest children and it is not in their interest that she have their custody.\n3. The right to access was an integral part of the judgment at trial but for all practical purposes access cannot be exercised by this applicant.\n4. Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and the court may permit.\nOn May 14, 1959, McRuer C.J.H.C. made an order directing the trial of an issue as to who should have the custody of the daughters.\nOn June 15, 1959, the issue came on for trial before McRuer C.J.H.C. but the learned Chief Justice decided that the issue should not be tried at that time. Some viva voce evidence was heard and it was directed that the issue should be tried on September 8, 1959, and that in the interim, commencing with July 1, 1959, the respondent should have the custody of the daughters with rights of access to the appellant. The issue was tried before Spence J. on September 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15 and 16 and judgment was reserved.\nOn October 22, 1959, Spence J. delivered judgment.\nFrom time to time during the course of the trial Spence J. appeared to rule that he was concerned only with events subsequent to March 5, 1958, the date of the judgment nisi. For example on the first day of the trial during the examination in chief of the respondent who was the first witness called the learned judge said:\nJust a moment. I am wondering what is the relevancy of all the evidence we have been having here. You have the Chief Justice of this Court has held a trial in which he considered the conduct of the parties up to the date of the judgment which he gave. I am not by any means a Court of Appeal to consider whether his findings would have been made by me. Surely we have to consider the conduct of the parties only in relation to the undertakings given at that time and the conduct of them both subsequently.\nOn the fourth day of the trial Mr. Williston, counsel for the appellant, asked a question relating to an occurrence in 1956; Mr. Robb, counsel for the respondent, intervened and the record proceeds:\nMr. Robb: Excuse me, my lord. Just so that there can be no misunderstanding as to my position on these aspects, I do think that the Judgment of the Chief Justice cannot be gone behind. This matter was gone into there, and I think the Chief Justice expressed his opinion on the evidence, with respect. I cannot object to my friend, as it were proceeding with it if he says it has some other relevance, but I do wish to make it clear that on the argument we cannot go behind the Chief Justice.\nMr. Williston: I don\u2019t suppose it is going to be necessary for my lord to make any specific finding of adultery or not; but I believe, if my lord is going to decide who the children should go to, he should have a certain background, even though possibly incidentally some of these matters were touched on before.\nHis Lordship: Touched on? They were ruled on, surely, and I have no jurisdiction to arrive at any different conclusion if I had any intention of doing so.\nMr. Williston: I am not asking my lord to.\nIn his reasons for judgment, however, the learned trial judge says:\nI think a critical review of the conduct of the defendant in the issue from 1952 up to the time of the trial of the issue is necessary in order to determine her fitness to be the custodian of her infant daughters as against the claim of her former husband, the plaintiff in the issue. The apparent inconsistency between these views may be explained by the need felt by the learned trial judge to determine how large a part the undertaking given by the appellant had played in bringing McRuer C.J.H.C. to the conclusion that the daughters should be committed to her custody and the weight which should be attached to its breach.\nThe undertaking was given under the following circumstances. The appellant was the only witness called for the defence. Her evidence takes up 92 pages of the record. At the conclusion of her cross-examination the transcript reads:\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. If the custody of these two little girls is awarded to you, are you willing to undertake that any associations that have been carried on between you and your co-defendant, Kruger, will be discontinued?\nA. Yes, sir, I do.\nQ. The little girls won\u2019t come under his influence at all?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. You will undertake that?\nA. Yes, sir, I do.\nHIS LORDSHIP: All right. That is all.\nParagraph 3 of the formal judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. shewing how this undertaking was embodied therein has already been quoted.\nThere is no doubt that the undertaking as embodied in the formal judgment was breached by the appellant on a number of occasions between the date of that judgment and November 6, 1958, the date of the last agreement between the parties; but the appellant denies that there was during that period any illicit relationship between her and Kruger and there is no finding against her on that point, nor is it shewn that at any time during that period did the daughters come under the influence of Kruger.\nThe breach of an undertaking given to the Court is never to be regarded lightly, but the fact of it having occurred cannot in this case be treated in isolation. I think it clear from reading the reasons of McRuer C.J.H.C. in their entirety that he regarded the appellant as a proper person and indeed the best person to have the custody of the daughters, provided she did not continue her association with Kruger and that the daughters did not come under his influence. Mr. Robb submits that if the appellant had refused to give the undertaking the learned Chief Justice would not have awarded the custody to her; it is not possible to say just what would have occurred in that event; it may be that after discussion with counsel the terms of the undertaking would have been clarified and provision made for the eventuality of the appellant and Kruger being married. Be that as it may, the important fact remains that the learned Chief Justice was of opinion that apart from the part played by Kruger in the matter the mother was the person to whom in their own best interests the daughters\u2019 custody should be given.\nIt is important to remember that to the extent of keeping the daughters from coming under the influence of Kruger the undertaking appears to have been observed.\nAn affidavit of the respondent sworn on September 5, 1958, in support of the application made by Mr. Beaudoin to vary the judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. as to custody shews that early in April 1958 he was aware that the appellant was associating with Kruger; but as has already been mentioned this application was withdrawn and the negotiations between the parties resulted in the agreement of November 6, 1958.\nIn my respectful view Spence J. in dealing with the effect of the breach of the undertaking failed to give due weight to the complete change in circumstances resulting from the marriage of the appellant and Kruger and to the fact that with full knowledge of that breach the respondent had on November 6, 1958, signed the agreement set out in full above, and containing, it will be remembered, the following provision:\nMr. Booker will apply for judgment absolute forthwith, and following judgment absolute he consents to Mrs. Booker seeing Mr. Kruger pending marriage, and he consents to their marriage and that the association referred to in this paragraph shall not be raised as a ground for a further application for custody by Mr. Booker. It is understanding of the parties that marriage will take place in the immediate future.\nIn his reasons for judgment Spence J. said in reference to this agreement:\nTherefore I am of the opinion that if the agreement, exhibit 16, had been an agreement between the parties on well nigh any subject except the custody of children, it would be an effective and binding agreement upon them both and no attempt of the plaintiff to rescind it months after its execution and when it had been acted upon could be effective. Two factors, however, in the present situation very much alter the result. In the first place, it is an agreement which purports to amend a judgment of the Court and secondly, it is an agreement as to the custody of children.\nOn the argument before us Mr. Williston was proceeding to develop the submission that the parties were acting in good faith with the interest of the daughters in mind in entering into the agreement of November 6, 1958, when he was told by the Court that we would assume this good faith unless it was challenged in which case he could deal with it in reply; it was not challenged.\nCounsel united in informing us that Mr. Beaudoin who advised the respondent to sign the agreement is a counsel of the highest standing and of great experience in cases of the sort with which we are concerned.\nWith the greatest respect to those who hold the contrary view, I am of opinion that the agreement was a proper one and in the best interest of the daughters.\nSpence J. was of the opinion that until the judgment nisi was amended upon application the agreement of November 6, 1958, would be ineffective. I am unable to agree with this. The express power given to parents of an infant who are not living together to enter into a written agreement as to which parent shall have the custody of the infant is not, in my opinion, abrogated by the circumstance that an order of the Court dealing with the custody is in effect. Counsel very properly informed the Chief Justice that the agreement had been made and in my opinion nothing more was necessary. It may also be observed that the order as to who should have the custody of the daughters was not varied. The change was the releasing of the appellant from an undertaking which would obviously cease to have any object after her marriage to Kruger.\nIt was not argued that the Court has not jurisdiction to make an order contrary to the terms of an agreement between the parents as to the custody of an infant if this should be necessary for the welfare of the latter. It is not difficult to think of cases where a change of circumstances might make such a course imperative.\nIn the case at bar the respondent a highly intelligent and successful business man advised by eminent counsel and with the fullest knowledge of the appellant\u2019s breach of undertaking and of all the conduct on the part of the appellant and Kruger with which they have been reproached, and in contemplation of their forthcoming marriage agreed that the appellant should have the custody of the daughters. I have already expressed my view that the agreement was a proper one.\nIn Ontario divorced persons are free to re-marry; no distinction is made in this regard between the \u201cinnocent\u201d and the \u201cguilty\u201d party (as is done in some other jurisdictions). The evidence is that the home in which the appellant and her husband are living is a suitable one for the upbringing of the daughters.\nIt would, I think, require proof of a very real change of circumstances to warrant the Court disregarding this agreement of the parties. When the evidence as to what is complained of since the agreement was made is examined it appears to consist of disputes, disagreements and annoyances in regard to the access to the daughters, some of which were not inaptly described by the learned trial judge as \u201cpicayune\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d. The evidence, in my opinion, falls far short of shewing any such change in circumstances as enables the Court to say that in the best interests of the daughters their custody should be taken from their mother.\nIt remains to consider the following paragraph in the reasons of the learned trial judge:\nThere is, moreover, the most important circumstance that to award the defendant in the issue the custody of the two infant daughters, Susan and Jennifer, would be in effect awarding such custody to the defendant Kruger. Counsel for the plaintiff on the argument put it that Kruger was the moving spirit in this alliance and that he was the person who was in control and directed the conduct of the defendant in the issue throughout. Everything in the trial would seem to indicate such a conclusion to be the sound one. The defendant Kruger was a close friend of the plaintiff for ten years prior to the action for dissolution of marriage and what is more was an object of the plaintiff\u2019s bounty on more than one occasion. The plaintiff advanced the defendant Kruger large sums of money, which were subsequently repaid, and yet the Chief Justice of the High Court, in the dissolution action and I in this action have found that the conduct of the defendant Kruger throughout was, in reference to the plaintiff, about as disgraceful as can be imagined. It would be with some very considerable misgiving that I would make an order which would have the practical effect of giving him the custody of the plaintiff\u2019s two infant daughters. Therefore, and for these reasons and despite the fact that it is with the utmost reluctance that I award the custody of the infant daughters to anyone but their mother, I must find that as between the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff is the more proper person to have the custody of Susan and Jennifer Booker. With great respect, I am unable to agree with this view. I will not repeat what I have said as to the agreement made with the fullest knowledge of Kruger\u2019s conduct. I think the error in this passage lies in approaching the matter as if the question were whether Kruger or the respondent should have the custody and upbringing of these little girls. That is not the question. The question is rather whether they shall be brought up by their mother or by their step-mother. I say this not merely because it is common knowledge that in the normal home the responsibility of bringing up young children, especially young girls, falls upon the mother rather than the father but also because the evidence in this case shews that the respondent is very fully occupied by the business in which he has been so successful and that the demands of that business necessitate his frequent absence from his home. Nothing has been said, and I certainly have nothing to say, against the respondent\u2019s wife but the record is replete with evidence, much of it coming from the respondent himself, that the appellant is a good and affectionate mother well fitted to care for and bring up her daughters.\nBefore parting with the matter I would deal in more detail with the effect of the evidence as to the fitness of the mother to have her children and the suitability of the home in which she is now established and would make reference to some relevant authorities were it not for the fact that, in my opinion, these matters have been so dealt with in the reasons of Laidlaw J.A. that there is nothing which lean usefully add. I wish to adopt those reasons in their entirety and to found my judgment upon them as well as on what I have said above and I refrain from further repetition of them.\nIt is most desirable in the interests of the parties that there should be an end to this litigation but under the terms of the order directing the issue and on the pleadings delivered pursuant thereto the question of what payments if any are to be made by the respondent for the benefit of the infants while they are in the custody of the appellant does not appear to me to be before us on this appeal.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the judgment of Spence J., except in so far as the latter deals with the custody of and access to the infant John Scott Booker, and direct judgment to be entered awarding, until further order, the sole custody and control of the infants Susan Claire Booker, born October 27, 1951, and Jennifer Lynn Booker, born November 3, 1953, to the appellant Vera Leona Kruger subject to the right of the respondent Ernest William Booker to have access to the said infants as provided in the agreement of November 6, 1958, marked as Exhibit 16 at the trial of the issue and the draft minutes of settlement therein referred to and marked as Exhibit 15 at the said trial, and further directing that neither of the said infants shall be removed by either of the parties from the Province of Ontario without the consent in writing of the other party or leave of the Court. The appellant is entitled to recover from the respondent her costs of the issue, including the costs referred to in paragraph 8 of the order of McRuer C.J.H.C. made on June 15, 1959, her costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs, KERWIN C.J. and LOCKE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: Malcolm Robb, Toronto.\n[1] [1951] A.C. 352, 1 All E.R. 942.\n[2] [1955] O.W.N. 341 at 344.\n[3] [1951] A.C. 352.\n[4] [1954] O.R. 120.\n[5] [1955] O.W.N. 341.\n[6] [1951] A.C. 352.\n[7] [1955] O.W.N. 341.\n[8] [1948] 2 All E.R. 413, 64 T.L.R. 418.\n[9] [1951] P. 184.\n[10] (1799), 3 Esp. 1.\n"}

The leases contained a clause reserving to the landlord the right to make reasonable rules, regulations and by-laws relating to operation and maintenance of the terminal, such rules not to limit or restrict the nature or extent of the tenant\u2019s business or the mode of operation thereof.\nOn the recommendation of an association of wholesale fruit and produce tenants, the defendant passed a resolution on November 23, 1956, providing for Saturday closings of the terminal, and a rule to this effect was made on February 21, 1957. The plaintiff contended that the rule as to Saturday closing was ultra vires of the Board, that it did not constitute a reasonable rule within the meaning of the leases, and claimed an injunction and damages.\nJudgment at trial was given in favour of the plaintiff. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal and the plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPrior to the enactment of ss. 13 and 14 of The Ontario Food Terminal Act, which conferred certain legislative powers to make regulations and rules, the Board had the necessary powers to carry on its business as defined in s. 4 of the Act, which included the operation of the terminal and the doing of such acts as might be necessary or expedient for carrying out those operations. The decision as to the times during which the terminal should be open for business was a part of the operation of the terminal and was a part of the business of the Board. The enactment of ss. 13 and 14 did not curtail those powers. It did not compel the Board to transact all business respecting the operation of the terminal by means of regulations or rules.\nThe provision for Saturday closing did not limit or restrict the nature or extent, or the mode of operation of the plaintiff\u2019s business, and in the light of the circumstances which preceded the Board\u2019s decision that the wholesaler\u2019s portion of the terminal should be closed every Saturday throughout the year, the rule could not be considered as not being reasonable. Therefore the closing requirement did not involve a breach of the leases, because such procedure was permissible under the reservation clause.\nThe plaintiff had further contended that if the Board did have power to compel Saturday closing without breach of its leases, it could only do so, under the relevant clause, by means of a rule, regulation or by-law. During the period from December 1, 1956, when Saturday closings had commenced, until February 1, 1957, the only authority for closing had been the resolution made on November 23, 1956.\nThe effect of the clause was to reserve to the Board, as a contractual right, the power to control the hours of business in the terminal. As between itself and the plaintiff as its tenant, it could make rules relating thereto without the necessity of resorting to the legislative authority which it subsequently acquired under ss. 13 and 14 of the Act. The resolution of November 23, 1956, was a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of the clause in the lease and it was passed as a part of the operation of the Board\u2019s business.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Wilson J. Appeal dismissed.\nA.L. Fleming, Q.C., and Meredith Fleming, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nR.E. Shibley and R.E. Scane, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The respondent, which is hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Board\u201d, is a corporation created by statute passed by the Legislature of Ontario, c. 63, Statutes of Ontario 1946. It was continued as a body corporate by the provisions of The Ontario Food Terminal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 261.\nSection 4 of that Act defines its objects as follows:\n4. (1) The objects of the Board shall be,\n(a) to acquire, construct, equip and operate a wholesale fruit and produce market in the County of York to be known as the Ontario Food Terminal and to acquire and operate such facilities for the transportation and handling of fruit and produce as may be necessary for the purposes of the Terminal; and\n(b) to do such other acts as may be necessary or expedient for the carrying out of its operations and undertakings.\nSection 5 of the Act provides:\n5. The Board may rent space in the Terminal to such persons and upon such terms as to the Board may seem proper and may make such arrangement and enter into such agreement with any such person as it may deem advisable in the circumstances. Section 13 of that Act empowered the Minister of Agriculture, subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, to make regulations in relation to various matters, including limiting or regulating the objects and powers of the Board and their exercise and also respecting any other matter necessary or advisable to carry out the intent and purpose of the Act.\nThe appellant is a corporation which imports, processes and distributes bananas as a wholesaler. It leased premises from the Board in the Ontario Food Terminal under a lease dated August 12, 1953, and additional premises in the terminal under a further lease dated July 1, 1954. Each lease was for a term of thirty years, with provision for renewal. Except for the dates, the description of the premises leased and the amounts of rental payable, the provisions of the two leases were the same.\nEach lease included a clause in the following terms:\nIT IS SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED that the Landlord shall have the right to make all reasonable rules, regulations and by-laws relating to the operation and maintenance of The Ontario Food Terminal, including hours of business, sanitation, traffic control and all such matters as are required for or normally incidental to the proper management of a public market, but no such rules, regulations or by-laws shall in any way limit or restrict the nature or extent of the business carried on by the Tenant within the covenants hereinbefore expressed or the mode of operation thereof. The Tenant covenants and agrees that he will observe, abide by and conform to all such reasonable rules, regulations and by-laws made or established by the Landlord as aforesaid. If the Tenant shall fail to observe, abide by and conform to any such rules, regulations or by\u2011laws, then the Landlord may give notice to the Tenant, giving particulars of any such failure and appointing a time and place for the hearing of any complaint in connection therewith and if the Tenant shall fail to comply with the decision of the Landlord forthwith or to rectify the matter complained of the Landlord shall have the right to suspend or revoke any or all rights or privileges of the Tenant at The Ontario Food Terminal or the use of the facilities or equipment thereof and forthwith to determine this Lease.\nAt the times these leases were granted The Ontario Food Terminal Act did not contain any provisions regarding the making of rules or regulations by the Board. On March 31, 1955, by c. 52, Statutes of Ontario 1955, s. 13 of the Act was repealed and a new s. 13 was enacted, together with ss. 14 and 15. Sections 13 and 14 provided:\n13. Subject to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the Board may make regulations,\n(a) prescribing the officers of the Board; (b) prescribing the powers and duties of the manager of the Terminal and of the officers of the Board;\n(c) prescribing the form of the seal of the Board;\n(d) respecting the operation, management and maintenance of the Terminal;\n(e) respecting any other matter necessary or advisable to carry out effectively the intent and purpose of this Act.\n14. Subject to the regulations, the Board may make rules with respect to,\n(a) the conduct of the Board\u2019s employees;\n(b) the conduct of the Board\u2019s tenants and their employees;\n(c) the conduct of any person on the Board\u2019s premises for any purpose;\n(d) the use by any person of the Board\u2019s facilities and equipment.\nSection 15 provided for the imposition of penalties for violations of the provisions of the Act, the regulations or any rule made under the Act.\nMost of the wholesale fruit and produce merchants who leased premises in the terminal were members of an association called the Toronto Wholesale Fruit and Produce Merchants Association (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Association\u201d). On October 30, 1956, a meeting of the Association was called, which all tenants of the Board, whether members of the Association or not, were invited to attend. The purpose of the meeting was to determine whether representations should be made to the Board to have the terminal closed on Saturdays. This question had been under consideration by the Association for some time previously.\nThe appellant was not a member of the Association, but its president and controlling shareholder, Mr. R.H. Jamieson, attended the meeting and moved a resolution to the effect that the market should be closed each Saturday in the year, without any exception. This motion was put to a vote and was carried by about a two-thirds majority.\nA second meeting of the Association was held on November 1, 1956, with a view to presenting \u201ca unanimous front\u201d in making the Association\u2019s recommendation to the Board. At this second meeting a motion to recommend that the terminal be closed on each Saturday throughout the year, with certain exceptions, was passed by a vote of 31 in favour and 3 against. Included in the resolution was an exception in favour of Power Food Markets, one of the Board\u2019s tenants, which was not in the wholesale business, but used its accommodation as a warehouse for itself. At the second meeting Mr. R.H. Jamieson opposed the resolution because of the exception made in favour of Power Food Markets.\nThe resolution passed at the meeting of November 1, 1956, was communicated to the Board for its consideration. At a meeting of the Board on November 23, 1956, a resolution was passed providing for the closing of the terminal on Saturdays throughout the period from December 1, 1956, to May 1, 1957. A copy of this resolution, as passed by the Board, was sent to its tenants on November 26, 1956, and notice was given that the terminal would be closed in accordance with the resolution. The terminal was, in fact, closed, for selling fruit and produce, on Saturdays from and after December 1, 1956, in accordance with the resolution.\nOn February 1, 1957, a rule was made and filed by the Board, as O. Reg. 17\/57, the material portion of which provided as follows:\nHOURS OF OPERATION OF TERMINAL\n16. Except for\n(a) Sundays,\n(b) New Year\u2019s Day, Good Friday, Victoria Day, Dominion Day, the first Monday in August, Labour Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, and\n(c) Saturdays in the months of December, January, February, March and April, other than a Saturday that falls immediately after a Friday, or before a Monday, on which any day mentioned in clause b falls,\nthe terminal shall be open for selling fruit and produce.\nThe appellant commenced action against the Board on April 8, 1957, claiming a declaration that para. (c) of this rule was ultra vires of the Board, that it did not constitute a reasonable rule within the meaning of the leases and claiming an injunction to restrain the Board from acting in pursuance of it. The appellant also claimed damages at the rate of $400 for each Saturday that the terminal was closed from and after December 1, 1956.\nPrior to the action coming on for trial, rule 16, as set forth in O. Reg. 17\/57, had been replaced by a new rule 16, by O. Reg. 91\/57, made and filed on April 18, 1957. The exact terms of this rule are not material. Its effect, as in the case of the preceding rule 16, was to make provision for closing on Saturdays during specified portions of the year.\nSubsequently, rule 16, as contained in O. Reg. 91\/57, was replaced by rule 16 as contained in O. Reg. 64\/58, made and filed on March 19, 1958. Subpara. (3) of this rule provided that:\n(3) The Terminal, other than the Farmers\u2019 Market section thereof, shall not be open for selling fruit and produce on Saturdays.\nFinally on May 16, 1958, regulations were made by the Board, pursuant to s. 13 of the Act, which were approved on May 22, 1958, and filed on May 23, 1958, included in which was a provision in terms identical to those of rule 16(3) as contained in O. Reg. 64\/58.\nJudgment at the trial was given in favour of the appellant. The learned trial judge held that the various rules regarding Saturday closing were ultra vires of the Board and further held that the Board had committed a breach of the leases made with the appellant by closing the terminal on Saturdays. He directed a reference to ascertain the damages sustained by the appellant.\nThis judgment was reversed on appeal by the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2], the conclusion of Laidlaw J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court, being as follows:\nMy conclusion and opinion is that the case for the plaintiff fails because it has not been shown that the act of the Board in closing the Terminal, including the space occupied by the respondent, for selling fruit and produce on Saturdays was unlawful, but, on the contrary, I am satisfied that the act of the Board in doing so was clearly within the right possessed by it under the leases made by it with the respondent and, in any event, within the power possessed by it under sec. 4 of The Ontario Food Terminal Act.\nI am in agreement with this conclusion.\nIt was contended by the appellant that the Board could not require the closing of the terminal on Saturdays, unless provision was made for such requirement in a regulation made by the Board, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, pursuant to s. 13 of the Act, or by a rule authorized by such a regulation. No regulation, pursuant to s. 13, dealing with Saturday closing, had been made by the Board until O. Reg. 131\/58, which was filed on May 23, 1958.\nI do not agree with this contention. Sections 13 and 14 of the Act do confer upon the Board certain legislative powers to make regulations and rules. For breaches of such regulations and rules penalties are provided. But this power to make regulations and rules was not given to the Board until the enactment of c. 52, Statutes of Ontario 1955. Prior to that time the Board had the necessary powers to carry on its business as defined in the objects clause, s. 4, which included the operation of the terminal and the doing of such acts as might be necessary or expedient for carrying out those operations. The decision as to the times during which the terminal should be open for business was, in my opinion, a part of the operation of the terminal. It was a part of the business of the Board. The enactment of ss. 13 and 14 did not curtail those powers. It did not compel the Board to transact all business respecting the operation of the terminal by means of regulations or rules. In my opinion the Board had the necessary power to pass and to put into effect its resolution of November 23, 1956, by virtue of s. 4 of the Act.\nThis brings us to the question as to whether the change respecting the times when the terminal should be open, which was made by the Board after it had granted leases to the appellant, was a derogation from the grants made by those leases. Each of them contained a covenant for quiet enjoyment. Each of them also contained the covenant, which has previously been quoted in full, reserving to the Board the right to make all reasonable rules, regulations and by-laws relating to the operation and maintenance of the terminal, including hours of business.\nThe Board relies upon that clause for the contention that what it did in relation to Saturday closing involved no breach of its leases. The appellant argues that the clause does not assist the Board, because it contains the proviso \u201cbut no such rules, regulations or by-laws shall in any way limit or restrict the nature or extent of the business carried on by the Tenant within the covenants hereinbefore expressed or the mode of operation thereof\u201d. It is urged that the Saturday closing requirement limited or restricted the nature or extent of the appellant\u2019s business and the mode of operation thereof. It is further argued that the clause only permits \u201creasonable\u201d rules, regulations and by-laws and that the Saturday closing requirement was not reasonable.\nWith respect to the question as to whether the provision for Saturday closing limited or restricted the nature or extent, or the mode of operation of the appellant\u2019s business, I agree with the reasoning of Laidlaw J.A. when he said:\nDoes a rule or an order that the Terminal shall not be open for selling fruit and produce on Saturdays limit or restrict the nature or extent of the business carried on by the respondent? The nature of the respondent\u2019s business is \u201cimporting, processing and wholesaling bananas\u201d. Plainly, in my opinion, the nature of the respondent\u2019s business is not affected in any way by the fact that the Terminal is closed on Saturday. The nature of its business remains the same whether the business is carried on one day a week or six days a week. Counsel emphasized that the \u201cextent\u201d of the business carried on by the respondent is limited or restricted by closing the Terminal on Saturday. He argued that the word \u201cextent\u201d as used in the clause is synonymous with \u201cvolume\u201d or \u201cquantity\u201d. I do not think so. The word \u201cextent\u201d means \u201cspace over which a thing extends; width of application; scope.\u201d (The Concise Oxford Dictionary.) That is the meaning which in my opinion should be given to the word in the clause under consideration. When it is read with that meaning it becomes plain that it is not applicable to a rule or regulation fixing the hours the Terminal is open for business for the sale of fruit or produce.\nThe main contention on behalf of the respondent is that the mode of operation of the business carried on by it is limited or restricted by the act of the appellant in closing the Terminal on Saturdays. Again I refer to the dictionary meaning of the word \u201cmode\u201d. It is \u201cthe way, manner in which a thing is done.\u201d It is quite true that the operation of the business carried on by the respondent is limited or restricted by a rule or regulation respecting the hours of business, but I am quite unable to see how the mode of operation is in any way limited or restricted thereby. There is no evidence that the mode, manner or way of operation of the respondent\u2019s business of \u201cimporting, processing and wholesaling bananas\u201d was any different on one day of the week from another or that it was altered, limited or restricted in any way by reason of the fact that the operation was carried on for five days of the week and not for six days.\nAs to the reasonableness of the closing requirement, the evidence shows that the terminal was closed on Saturdays only after strong representations from the Association and at first was not closed on Saturdays throughout the year, as had been requested by the Association. It was only after a period of experiment, from December 1, 1956, to May 1, 1957, and a further period in the summer of 1957, that the Board decided that the wholesalers\u2019 portion of the terminal should be closed every Saturday throughout the year. It is clear that the Saturday closing requirement was favoured by the great majority of the tenants of the Board having premises in the terminal. In the light of these circumstances, it does not appear to me that it can be contended successfully that the requirement imposed by the Board could be considered as not being reasonable.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the requirement for Saturday closing did not involve a breach of the leases with the appellant, because such procedure was permissible under the clause of the leases which has just been considered.\nIt was contended, finally, by the appellant that, if the Board did have power to compel Saturday closing without breach of its leases, it could only do so, under the relevant clause, by means of a rule, regulation or by-law. It was then pointed out that no \u201crule\u201d, under s. 14 of the Act, had been filed pursuant to The Regulations Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 337, until O. Reg. 17\/57 was made and filed on February 1, 1957. Saturday closing had commenced on and after December 1, 1956, and during the period from that time until February 1, 1957, the only authority for closing had been the resolution of the Board made on November 23, 1956.\nIn my view, for the reasons already given, the Board had the necessary power to close its terminal without a legislative act. It did not have to make a regulation or a rule, under s. 13 or 14 of the Act, in order to do so. It is true that the clause of the leases refers to \u201crules, regulations or by-laws\u201d, but it must be remembered that at the time the leases were made ss. 13 and 14 of the Act did not exist. At that time the only regulations mentioned in the Act itself were those which could be made by the Minister of Agriculture.\nIn my opinion, the effect of the clause was to reserve to the Board, as a contractual right, the power to control the hours of business in the terminal. As between itself and the appellant as its tenant, it could make rules relating thereto without the necessity of resorting to the legislative authority which it subsequently acquired under ss. 13 and 14 of the Act. The resolution of the Board on November 23, 1956, was a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of the clause in the lease and it was passed as a part of the operation of the Board\u2019s business.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Fleming, Smoke & Burgess, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: White, Bristol, Beck & Phipps, Toronto.\n[1] [1959] O.W.N. 141, 18 D.L.R.

No such conversion of interest occurred when the employee, finding that his wife was not at home, had the accident while en route to pick up his wife so that she could prepare his meal. The least that can be said here is that the employee was not using the vehicle exclusively in his own interest, but equally and principally in his employer's interest.\nAPPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming two judgments of Demers J. Appeals dismissed.\nA. J. Campbell, Q.C., and G. Allison, for the defendant, appellant.\nR. Lette, for Schrijvershof, plaintiff, respondent.\nH. P. Lemay, for Sicotte, plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Le 18 mai 1954, vers les 7 heures de l'apr\u00e8s-midi, une collision se produisit \u00e0 l'intersection des rues Blair et Champagneur, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, entre le camion de l'appelante, alors conduit par son employ\u00e9 John Zambon dans une direction est sur la rue Blair, et l'automobile de Georgette Sicotte, conduite par elle-m\u00eame vers le nord sur la rue Champagneur. En soi insignifiante, cette collision eut de s\u00e9rieuses cons\u00e9quences. Mademoiselle Sicotte perdit contr\u00f4le et son v\u00e9hicule alla s'\u00e9craser sur un immeuble sis au coin nord-est o\u00f9 elle-m\u00eame et un enfant de quatre ans qui s'y trouvait, Adrianus Schrijvershof, furent gri\u00e8vement bless\u00e9s. Cet enfant dut, par la suite, subir l'ablation des deux jambes.\nDeux actions en dommages furent intent\u00e9es; l'une par Mademoiselle Sicotte contre la compagnie Zambon et son employ\u00e9, et l'autre par le p\u00e8re et tuteur de la jeune victime contre les m\u00eames d\u00e9fendeurs et Mademoiselle Sicotte.\nLa partie demanderesse dans chacune de ces deux actions fit requ\u00eate et obtint, sans objection de la d\u00e9fense, que la preuve soit commune et serve aux deux causes.\nAu m\u00e9rite, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure trouva faute chez les deux conducteurs de v\u00e9hicules. Elle attribua deux-tiers de la responsabilit\u00e9 au conducteur du camion, en raison de la vitesse \u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait venu dans l'intersection et de sa violation de la priorit\u00e9 de passage de Mademoiselle Sicotte, et un tiers \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re pour n'avoir pr\u00eat\u00e9 aucune attention aux v\u00e9hicules susceptibles de venir \u00e0 sa gauche. La Cour rejeta la pr\u00e9tention de la compagnie Zambon voulant qu'au moment de cet accident, le conducteur de son camion, John Zambon, n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9. La compagnie Zambon et son employ\u00e9 furent donc condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Mademoiselle Sicotte la somme de $2,390.58, repr\u00e9sentant les deux-tiers des dommages subis par elle, et furent \u00e9galement condamn\u00e9s, avec cette derni\u00e8re, \u00e0 payer au p\u00e8re et tuteur de l'enfant, la somme de $40,647.39, repr\u00e9sentant le pr\u00e9judice subi par l'enfant. Dans les deux cas, il va de soi, les d\u00e9fendeurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement.\nPort\u00e9s en appel par la compagnie, ces deux jugements furent confirm\u00e9s par d\u00e9cisions unanimes de la Cour du banc de la reine2 laquelle jugea, comme le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que les deux conducteurs des v\u00e9hicules \u00e9taient responsables dans la proportion ci-dessus et qu'au moment de l'accident, John Zambon \u00e9tait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions.\nL'appelante se pourvoit maintenant \u00e0 l'encontre de ces deux jugements.\nEn cette Cour, comme en Cour d'Appel, seule la question de responsabilit\u00e9 demeure en litige.\nL'appelante a soumis (i) que l'accident n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la n\u00e9gligence de son employ\u00e9 et (ii) que, de toutes fa\u00e7ons, ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9, au moment o\u00f9 cet accident se produisit.\nSur le premier point. Il s'agit, en somme, d'une question de fait sur laquelle, comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, les Juges de la Cour d'Appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimes \u00e0 partager la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Cette conclusion est support\u00e9e par la preuve et, ainsi que les avocats des parties en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audition, il n'y a pas lieu de la modifier. Sur le second point, l'argument de l'appelante a port\u00e9 tant sur l'interpr\u00e9tation des faits prouv\u00e9s que sur le droit. Il convient donc de pr\u00e9ciser, en premier lieu, les circonstances dans lesquelles et les raisons pour lesquelles l'appelante a, le soir en question, confi\u00e9 son camion \u00e0 son employ\u00e9.\nLa compagnie Zambon entreprend des travaux de marbre, tuile et terrazzo. Au temps qui nous int\u00e9resse, Dominique Zambon en \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident. C'est lui qui engageait le personnel et en dirigeait le travail. Lui-m\u00eame participait activement aux travaux. Bref, il \u00e9tait le patron actif de l'\u00e9tablissement. John Zambon, son fr\u00e8re, y \u00e9tait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement employ\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'estimateur des prix auxquels la compagnie entreprenait ces travaux. Comme les autres membres du personnel, il utilisait \u00e0 l'occasion le camion de la compagnie. Le jour de l'accident, les deux fr\u00e8res avaient travaill\u00e9 ensemble durant les heures r\u00e9guli\u00e8res de travail \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration d'une soumission dont la remise au client devait \u00eatre faite incessamment. Advenant 6.30 heures de l'apr\u00e8s-midi, le patron jugea qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de poursuivre dans la soir\u00e9e la t\u00e2che commenc\u00e9e et d\u00e9cida en cons\u00e9quence que l'employ\u00e9 utiliserait le camion de la compagnie pour aller prendre son repas du soir, qu'il reviendrait \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement le remplacer pour lui permettre, \u00e0 son tour, d'aller souper, et que les deux, par la suite, continueraient ensemble la pr\u00e9paration de cette soumission. L'employ\u00e9 prit donc le camion pour se rendre chez lui, \u00e0 1045 rue Blair, o\u00f9 il constata, \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e, qu'il n'y avait personne. Apprenant, \u00e0 la maison voisine,\u2014o\u00f9 demeure son fr\u00e8re Dominique\u2014que sa femme \u00e9tait chez sa m\u00e8re, \u00e0 7060 Boulevard Saint-Laurent, il lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phona pour l'informer qu'il devait travailler durant la soir\u00e9e et qu'il allait imm\u00e9diatement la qu\u00e9rir afin qu'elle puisse appr\u00eater son repas. C'est en allant chercher sa femme \u00e0 ces fins que l'accident se produisit.\nL'appelante a soumis que, suivant l'interpr\u00e9tation qu'il convient donner \u00e0 la preuve, c'est dans l'unique but d'accommoder son employ\u00e9 que le patron lui a permis d'utiliser le camion pour aller prendre son repas du soir. L'employ\u00e9, ajoute-t-on, avait lui-m\u00eame une voiture personnelle qui, subissant \u00e0 ce temps des r\u00e9parations, n'\u00e9tait pas en disponibilit\u00e9. Telle n'est pas l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la preuve par le Juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et les Juges de la Cour d'Appel. Tous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d'accord \u00e0 juger, en fait, que John Zambon avait re\u00e7u, de Dominique Zambon, instructions de prendre le camion pour h\u00e2ter son retour au travail, qu'il s'en servait au temps de l'accident, non pas pour ses fins personnelles, mais dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la compagnie dont le travail devait \u00eatre poursuivi sans d\u00e9lai.\nSeuls le patron, Dominique Zambon, et l'employ\u00e9, John Zambon, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur le point.\nEntendu au pr\u00e9alable, dans l'action intent\u00e9e par Mademoiselle Sicotte, le premier rend le t\u00e9moignage suivant:\nEXAMINED BY MTRE H.

JUSTICE DEMERS:\nQ. Your brother told you to take the truck, go and have supper and come back to work? A. That is right, yes.\nCes t\u00e9moignages, et plus particuli\u00e8rement celui donn\u00e9 par Dominique Zambon en r\u00e9ponse aux questions pos\u00e9es par le procureur m\u00eame qui alors repr\u00e9sentait l'appelante, supportent clairement la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en sont venus tous les Juges des Cours inf\u00e9rieures sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de la preuve. En ob\u00e9issance aux instructions du patron, l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait tenu de travailler dans la soir\u00e9e. Il devait revenir imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s son souper remplacer son patron afin que celui-ci puisse \u00e0 son tour, aller prendre son repas, et les deux, par la suite, poursuivre ensemble le travail commenc\u00e9. C'est pour assurer la continuation, h\u00e2ter la reprise conjointe d'un travail pressant de la compagnie appelante que le patron donna instructions \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 d'utiliser le camion afin de faire, en moins de temps, la course n\u00e9cessaire pour aller prendre son repas. Bref, si l'on peut dire g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement qu'en allant prendre un repas, l'employ\u00e9 fait son affaire, l'appelante, en l'esp\u00e8ce, faisait la sienne et agissait dans son int\u00e9r\u00eat en lui donnant instructions de se servir du camion dans les circonstances et pour les fins ci-dessus.\nVoil\u00e0 les faits qui se d\u00e9gagent, en substance, des t\u00e9moignages accept\u00e9s par les deux Cours et qu'elles ont retenus comme repr\u00e9sentant la v\u00e9ritable situation de fait dont elles avaient \u00e0 juger en droit.\nEn droit. L'employ\u00e9 qui, conform\u00e9ment aux instructions, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat ou pour faire l'affaire de son patron, en utilise l'automobile, agit, en ce faisant, dans l'exercice des fonctions \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution desquelles il est employ\u00e9, au sens du dernier paragraphe de l'art. 1054 C.C. Et si, en de telles circonstances, il commet, dans la conduite de l'automobile, une faute causant du dommage \u00e0 autrui, il engage la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'employeur, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'apparaisse qu'au moment de l'accident, il avait absolument fait sienne la possession qu'il avait l\u00e9galement obtenue de l'automobile en la convertissant \u00e0 son usage exclusif. Ces r\u00e8gles bien \u00e9tablies par la jurisprudence re\u00e7oivent leur application en l'esp\u00e8ce. On en trouve l'expression dans Moreau v. Labelle3 o\u00f9 sont cit\u00e9es et comment\u00e9es plusieurs d\u00e9cisions sur la question. Voir aussi Gagnon v. Deroy4, o\u00f9 les Juges de cette Cour, bien que se divisant sur l'interpr\u00e9tation des faits, sont d'accord sur les principes de droit. On peut consid\u00e9rer qu'en se servant du camion dans les circonstances, l'employ\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d'une accommodation pour aller prendre son repas et revenir au travail. Ce n'est pas \u00e0 cette fin personnelle, cependant, que l'usage lui en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. Et le moins que l'on puisse dire, c'est que l'employ\u00e9 ne s'en servait pas exclusivement pour ses propres fins mais \u00e9galement et principalement dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat et pour faire l'affaire de l'appelante. En de telles circonstances, la responsabilit\u00e9 de celle-ci demeure. Jarry v. Pelletier5.\nAu soutien de ses pr\u00e9tentions, l'appelante a invoqu\u00e9, en Cour du banc de la reine comme en cette Cour, plusieurs d\u00e9cisions. M. le Juge Choquette, de la Cour d'Appel, y r\u00e9f\u00e8re dans ses notes et, d'accord avec lui, je dirais que dans chacune de ces causes, la situation de faits diff\u00e8re de celle qui nous occupe. La plupart, au surplus, sont des d\u00e9cisions rendues sous le r\u00e9gime du droit de la Common Law. Les r\u00e8gles de droit qui se d\u00e9gagent de toutes ces causes ne viennent aucunement en conflit avec les principes qui doivent nous guider, en l'esp\u00e8ce, et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9s par cette Cour dans Moreau v. Labelle, supra, et Gagnon v. Deroy, supra. On peut ajouter, bien qu'il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire, que la r\u00e8gle pertinente sous la Common Law ne vient pas en conflit avec celle qui, sous le droit civil de Qu\u00e9bec, s'applique \u00e0 l'instance. Dans Ormrod and Another v. Crosville Motor Services Ltd. and Another. Murphie, Third Party6, Lord Denning, \u00e0 la page 1123, d\u00e9clare ce qui suit:\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nThe law puts an especial responsibility on the owner of a vehicle who allows it out on to the road in charge of someone else, no matter whether it is his servant, his friend, or anyone else. If it is being used wholly or partly on the owner's business or for the owner's purposes, then the owner is liable for any negligence on the part of the driver.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nEnfin, l'appelante a soumis que m\u00eame si le conducteur du camion doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 il se dirigeait chez lui, il ne l'\u00e9tait plus d\u00e8s l'instant o\u00f9 il partit de chez lui pour aller qu\u00e9rir son \u00e9pouse. A l'appui de cette pr\u00e9tention, on a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Moreau v. Labelle, supra, et Dallas v. Home Oil Distributors Limited7. Les instructions de l'appelante \u00e9taient d'utiliser le camion pour aller souper. Rien dans la preuve ne sugg\u00e8re qu'en agissant comme il l'a fait dans les circonstances, l'employ\u00e9 ait, contrairement aux instructions qu'il avait re\u00e7ues, fait sienne la possession qu'il avait l\u00e9galement obtenue du camion en le convertissant \u00e0 son usage exclusif. Il a fait normalement, au contraire, ce qui, dans les circonstances, \u00e9tait devenu n\u00e9cessaire pour y satisfaire.\nEtant d'avis que les deux jugements de la Cour du banc de la reine sont bien fond\u00e9s, je renverrais les deux appels avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Walker, Chauvin, Walker, Allison & Beaulieu, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, Schrijvershof: Duranleau, Dupr\u00e9, Duranleau, Lette & Cousineau, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, Sicotte: Lemay, Poulin & Corbeil, Montreal.\n1 [1959] Que.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nFred O'krane (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1961: January 25, 26; 1961: March 27.\nPresent: Taschereau, Locke, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nLabour\u2014Workmen's compensation\u2014Subrogated action by Workmen's Compensation Board\u2014Whether action lies\u2014Determination of certain matters by Board\u2014Board's exclusive jurisdiction\u2014Workmen's Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 370, ss. 11(3), 12(1) and (4), 76.\nThe plaintiff was injured while working as a longshoreman in the employment of a stevedoring company which was loading lumber on a ship owned by the defendant shipping company. The latter was incorporated under the laws of Greece with head office in Athens. The cause of the injury was the breaking of a rung in a steel ladder attached to the hull of the ship. The workman claimed and was awarded compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act of British Columbia, and subsequently the Board, acting under the right of subrogation given to it by s. 11(3) of the Act, brought an action in the name of the workman and claimed damages for the injury. After the writ was issued and before the action was tried, the Board held a hearing and found, inter alia, that the defendant company was not an employer within the scope of Part I of the Act, and that the action against the defendant was one the right to which was not taken away by Part I. These findings were filed at trial, where judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and the defendant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe matters whether the defendant company was an employer within Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act and whether the right to bring the action had been taken away were conclusively determined by the Board, and that Board had exclusive jurisdiction in these matters whether before or after the institution of an action. With respect to whether it was an employer within Part I of the Act, the defendant's submission that the Board may determine this matter in the administration of the Act but that nothing done in the administration of the Act can preclude an independent determination of the problem by the Court was rejected. The Dominion Canners Ltd. v. Costanza, [1923] S.C.R. 46, discussed and followed.\nIt was questionable whether, as claimed by the defendant, the Board's assertion of a workman's common law rights in an action such as this could be characterized as an invalidating interest in any decision which the Board might make in the performance of its statutory duties, but interest or no interest, this was expressly what the Board was authorized to do by the plain terms of the Act and no such limitation could be imposed on the plain meaning of the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Lett C.J.S.C. Appeal dismissed.\nHugo Ray, Q.C., and W. J. Walker, for the defendant, appellant.\nRay Anderegg, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant is a corporation incorporated under the laws of Greece and has its head office in Athens. It is the owner of the freighter Eleni D. In April 1953 this ship docked in Tahsis, B.C., to take on a cargo of lumber. The respondent was injured while working as a longshoreman in the employment of the stevedoring company which was loading lumber on the ship. The cause of his injury was the breaking of a rung in a steel ladder attached to the hull of the ship. The stevedoring company was an employer within the meaning of Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 370. The workman claimed and was awarded compensation under the Act, and subsequently the Board, acting under the right of subrogation given to it by s. 11(3) of the Act, brought an action in the name of the workman and claimed damages for the injury.\nThe only defence argued by the shipping company on this appeal was that this action does not lie because it is an employer within Part I of the Act. If it is, the right of action of the workman is taken away by s. 11(4) of the Act. At trial the workman recovered judgment for $21,548.60. The Court of Appeal[2] dismissed the appeal and the shipping company now appeals to this Court.\nThe writ was issued on September 6, 1956. Two years later, on September 15, 1958, and before the action was tried, the Board held a hearing at which both sides were present and made the following findings:\nTHIS BOARD DOES FIND AND DETERMINE that on April 30, 1953, Tahsis Company Ltd., was an employer in or about an industry within Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act; that on April 30, 1953, the Plaintiff was a workman within the scope of Part I of the said Act; that on the date aforesaid the Plaintiff sustained personal injuries by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with Tahsis Company Ltd.; that on the date aforesaid Alcyon Shipping Co. Ltd. was not an employer in or about an industry within the scope of Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act.\nAND THIS BOARD DOES FIND AND DETERMINE that the said action against the Defendant Alcyon Shipping Co. Ltd. is one the right to bring which is not taken away by Part I of the said Workmen's Compensation Act.\nWhen the action came on for trial on March 11, 1959, these findings were filed before the learned trial judge.\nIt will be seen that the Board made five findings. The two that are attacked on this appeal are the last two, namely: (a) that Alcyon was NOT an employer in or about an industry within the scope of Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act, and (b) that the action against Alcyon is one the right to bring which is NOT taken away by Part I of the Act.\nThe learned trial judge held that he was precluded by the Board's determination from entering into any inquiry whether the shipping company was an employer within the scope of Part I of the Act and whether the right to bring the action was one which was taken away by Part I of the Act. In the Court of Appeal, Smith J.A. took the same view. Davey J.A. expressed doubt concerning the jurisdiction of the Board to make this finding but he held that it was unnecessary to make a final determination on this matter because he came to the same conclusion of fact as the Board, namely, that this shipping company was not an employer within Part I of the Act, the Workmen's Compensation Act not applying to foreign ship owners. On this appeal the shipping company says that the Court, and the Court alone, should have made the determination whether the shipping company was an employer within Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act and whether the right to bring the action had been taken away.\nI would dismiss the appeal but on the grounds given by the learned trial judge and the minority opinion in the Court of Appeal, namely, that these two matters were conclusively determined by the Board and that the Board had exclusive jurisdiction in these matters whether before or after the institution of an action.\nThe scheme of the Act is well-known by this time. Most industries are under Part I of the Act and if a workman employed in one of these industries is injured in the course of his employment, he has no right of action against his employer but must claim compensation. This is the simplest situation. Not only this, the right of action is taken away against any other employer within Part I of the Act. This follows from s. 11(4), which reads:\n(4) In any case within the provisions of subsection (1), neither the workman nor his dependent nor the employer of the workman shall have any right of action in respect of the accident against an employer in any industry within the scope of this Part;\nTherefore, no employer within Part I of the Act whether or not he is the employer of the particular workman may be sued for an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\nBut the workman may have a right of action against a person who is not his employer or another employer within Part I of the Act. This is dealt with by s. 11(1) of the Act:\n11. (1) Where an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment happens to a workman in such circumstances as entitle him or his dependents to an action against some person other than his employer and other than an employer in an industry within the scope of this Part or against the Crown, the workman or his dependents, if entitled to compensation under this Part, may claim such compensation or may bring such action.\nThe present action is brought under the provisions of s. 11(3) of the Act. This injured workman did claim compensation and the Board awarded it. In consequence the Board was entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the workman and it brought this action in the name of the workman as authorized by the subsection:\n11. (3) If any such workman or his dependents makes application to the Board claiming compensation under this Part, neither the making of such application nor the payment of compensation thereunder shall restrict or impair any such right of action against the party or parties liable, but as to every such claim the Board shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or his dependents and may maintain an action in his name or their names or in the name of the Board, and if more is recovered and collected than the amount of the compensation to which the workman or his dependents would be entitled under this Part, the amount of the excess, less costs and administration charges, may be paid to the workman or his dependents.\nThe other relevant sections of the Act are ss. 12(1) and 12(4) and 76. They provide:\n12. (1) The provisions of this Part shall be in lieu of all rights and rights of action, statutory or otherwise, to which a workman or the members of his family are or may be entitled against the employer of such workman for or by reason of any accident happening to him or any industrial disease contracted by him on or after the first day of January, 1917, while in the employment of such employer, and no action in respect thereof shall lie.\n12. (4) Where an action in respect of an injury is brought against an employer by a workman or a dependent, the Board shall have jurisdiction upon the application of any party to the action to adjudicate and determine whether the action is one the right to bring which is taken away by this Part, and such adjudication and determination shall be final, and conclusive; and if the Board determines that the action is one the right to bring which is taken away by this Part the action shall be for ever stayed.\nSection 76 provides:\n(1) The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into, hear, and determine all matters and questions of fact and law arising under this Part, and the action or decision of the Board thereon shall be final and conclusive and shall not be open to question or review in any Court \u2026\nThe shipping company complains that the Board had no jurisdiction to determine that it was not an employer within Part I of the Act so as to preclude the independent determination of this problem in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. It says that the Board may determine this matter in the administration of the Act but that nothing done in the administration of the Act can preclude an independent determination by the Court.\nIn my opinion there is a conclusive decision of this Court adverse to this submission in the case of Dominion Canners v. Costanza[3]. This case was decided under the provisions of the Ontario Workmen's Compensation Act but there are no differences between the Ontario Act and the British Columbia Act in scheme, structure or wording which would affect the application of the decision to the British Columbia Act.\nIn the Costanza case the workman sued his employer for damages caused by negligence. He obtained judgment at trial and an appeal by the employer failed. The Ontario Courts ruled that this was not an action the right to bring which was taken away by The Workmen's Compensation Act because the injury of which the workman complained was not an accident within the meaning of the Act. Not until after the judgment of the Court of Appeal was there any reference to the Board for a determination of this matter in spite of the fact that the defendant had pleaded that the plaintiffs ought to apply to the Board for a determination. It had not, however, pleaded that the Board had exclusive jurisdiction. After the judgment of the Court of Appeal the plaintiffs did so apply ex parte and the Board decided that the accident was not one arising out of and in the course of employment. The consequence of this finding was that the workman's right of action was not taken away by the Act. This was the position when the case reached this Court where the judgment was that the Board had exclusive jurisdiction in this matter. This Court had before it the ex parte order made by the Board. The proceedings on the appeal were stayed pending the determination of the matter by the Board in a proper proceeding on notice to the defendant. This was an explicit recognition of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board.\nAs far as I know, this principle has never been in doubt since this decision. If it is departed from it will involve a serious breach in the administration of the Workmen's Compensation Acts across the country. The Acts were drawn as they are to avoid \"the waste of energy and expense in legal proceedings and a canon of interpretation governed in its application by refinement upon refinement leading to uncertainty and perplexity in the application of the Act.\" (Per Duff J. in Dominion Canners Limited v. Costanza, supra, at p. 54)\nThe shipping company questions the application of the Costanza case on the ground that the Board has an interest in its own decision when it is asserting the rights of a workman against a third party by way of subrogation under s. 11(3) of the Act. Such a situation, it is urged, should suggest to the Court a limitation of the Board's powers of exclusive decision to those cases where it has no interest\u2014and this as a matter of interpretation and not by way of attack on the constitutional validity of the legislation. I question whether the Board's assertion of a workman's common law rights in an action such as this can be characterized as an invalidating interest in any decision which the Board may make in the performance of its statutory duties, but interest or no interest, this is expressly what the Board is authorized to do by the plain terms of the Act and no such limitation can be imposed on the plain meaning of the Act.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Bull, Houser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Howard & Anderegg, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960), 24 D.L.R.

Application dismissed.\nR. Quain, Q.C., for the applicant.\nC. Beland, for the respondent.\nFauteux J. (in chambers):\u2014This is an application, in a bankruptcy matter, for special leave to appeal from a decision made, on the 15th of November, 1960, by the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec.\nThe relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, 1949, and of the General Rules established thereunder on the 16th day of December 1954, (P.C. 1954\u20131976) are respectively:\nSection 151 of the Act:\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal upon any appeal is final and conclusive unless special leave to appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada is obtained from a judge of that court.\nRule 53:\nAn application for special leave to appeal from a decision of a Court of Appeal and to fix the security for costs, if any, may be made to a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within 60 days after the date of the decision appealed from and notice of the application shall be served on the other party at least 14 days before the hearing thereof. Rule 54:\nSubject to section 53, appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada shall be regulated as nearly as may be by the rules of that Court relating to appeals in civil actions or matters.\nSection 53, referred to in Rule 54, is manifestly Rule 53 above and not section 53 of the Act which deals with the effect of sales of property by the trustee.\nDated the 12th of January, 1961, the present application was served on the 6th of March, 1961, filed two days later with the Registrar of this Court, and came for hearing on the date indicated in the notice of application, to wit, on the 10th of March, 1961. The material date according to Rule 53 is not that of the application or of its filing with the Registrar, but the date when it is actually made to a Judge of this Court. In re Boivin v. Larue1. Thus it appears that the application was not made within the delay of sixty days specified in Rule 53. This delay was expired on the 15th of January, 1961. For this reason, counsel for the applicant also demanded that the time set in Rule 53 be extended. Counsel for respondent consented to the granting of this request. The trustee was not represented and the material does not show that he received notice of the application.\nAs jurisdiction cannot be acquired by consent, the question to be determined is whether a power to extend the time for applying for leave to appeal to this Court from a decision of a Court of Appeal, rendered in a bankruptcy matter, is in the jurisdiction of a Judge of this Court.\nA right of appeal is a right of exception which exists only when authorized by statute. Okalta Oils Limited v. Minister of National Revenue2. Substantive and procedural provisions related to the exercise of this right, when given, are generally regarded as exhaustive and exclusive. This need not be expressly stated in the statute authorizing the appeal; it necessarily flows from the exceptional nature of this right. Welch v. The King3. With respect to appeals to the Court of Appeal in bankruptcy matters, a power to extend the time within which an appeal may be brought is given in the following rule:\nRule 50(1). No appeal to the Court of Appeal shall be brought unless notice thereof is filed with the Registrar and served within ten days after the day of the order or decision appealed from or within such further time as a Judge of the Court of Appeal allows.\nA power to extend time, however, cannot be found in Rule 53 governing appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada. Nor can it be validly derived from the Rules of this Court which, as provided by Rule 54 of the Bankruptcy Act, regulate appeals to this Court in bankruptcy matters, subject, however, to the provisions of Rule 53.\nRule 53 corresponds to and is in terms similar to the 1949 Rule 65(1) and to the pre-1949 Rule 72(1). In all the reported decisions in this Court, with respect to pre-1949 Rule 72(1), it was held that the power to extend the delay specified in the statutory rule was not in the jurisdiction of a Judge of this Court. In re Boivin v. Larue, supra; In re North Shore Trading Company4; In re Louis Webber5. It was also decided that a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada is not empowered to abridge the delay of fourteen days specified in statutory Rule 50. In re Hudson Fashion Shoppe6.\nIn re North Shore Trading Company, supra, Migneault J. made the following comments at the bottom of page 181:\nI must say, however, that I think General Rule 72 should be amended so as to give a Judge of this Court the power to extend the time for application for leave to appeal either before or after the expiration. It seems incongruous and it adds to the costs as well as delays the proceedings, to oblige an applicant to go back to the trial Court to obtain an extension of the time specified by Rule 72. I may add that Rule 68 governing appeals to the Appeal Court gives a like power to a Judge of the Court of Appeal.\nThe relevant part of Rule 68, referred to by Migneault J., was paragraph (1) of the Rule, the provisions of which are literally the same as those of the 1949 Rule 62(1) and those of present Rule 50. Notwithstanding the amendment suggested by Migneault J., and the fact that since that decision, the Bankruptcy Rules have twice been subjected to revision, the Rule governing appeals to this Court has not been changed. Nor has there been, up to this time, any-reported cases in this Court showing that the views expressed in the above quoted decisions have been modified. See also Bradford & Greenberg's Canadian Bankruptcy Act, 3rd ed., p. 322, as to 1949 Rule 65(1), and Houlden and Morawetz, Bankruptcy Law of Canada, p. 342, as to present Rules 53 and 54.\nIn a memorandum filed subsequent to the hearing, counsel has referred to s. 144(11) of the Bankruptcy Act and also to Rule 105 made thereunder, as affording support to the application.\n144(11). Where by this Act, the time for doing any act or thing is limited, the Court may extend the time either before or after the expiration thereof upon such terms, if any, as it thinks fit to impose.\nA like submission has previously been made, but it was rejected by Migneault J., in the case of In re North Shore Trading Co., supra, and by Cannon J., in the case of In re Webber, supra. Referring to the definition of the word \"court\", then appearing in s. 2(l), and now in s. 2(g), both of them held that the power given in s. 163(5), the predecessor to s. 144(11), was in the Court vested with original jurisdiction in bankruptcy under the Act. The original and amended definition of the word \"court\" read:\ns. 2(l). \"Court\" or \"the Court\" means the Court which is invested with original jurisdiction in bankruptcy under this Act.\ns. 2(g). \"Court\" means the Court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy or a Judge thereof and includes a registrar when exercising the powers of the Court conferred upon him under this Act.\nWhile s. 2(g) has widened the original definition of the word \"Court\" in order to include Judges and Registrars, the section does not purport to constitute the Supreme Court of Canada as \"the Court having jurisdiction in bankruptcy \u2026\", even though under and in the terms of s. 140(3), this Court \"has jurisdiction to hear and to decide according to its ordinary procedure any appeal so permitted and to award costs.\"\nIt may be added that the opening words of s. 163(5) were: \"Where by this Act or by General Rules\" and that the words \"or by General Rules\" have been deleted in s. 144(11). Rule 105:\nNon-compliance with any of these rules or with any rule of practice shall not render any proceeding void unless the court so directs, but the proceeding may be set aside, either wholly or in part, as irregular, or amended or otherwise dealt with in such manner and upon such terms as the court considers necessary or desirable.\nThis Rule corresponds to 1949 Rule 120 and pre-1949 Rule 168 and is, in terms, literally similar to the former and substantially similar to the latter.\nIf, as I think, the power to extend the time for applying for leave to this Court from a decision of a Court of Appeal rendered in a bankruptcy matter, is not in the jurisdiction of a Judge of this Court, Rule 105 is not, in my opinion, apt per se to confer such a jurisdiction.\nIt is appropriate to say, I think, that I have considered the grounds raised in support of the application for special leave to appeal, the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal and the sections of the Bankruptcy Act having relevancy on the merits of the application. Even if I had jurisdiction, I would not, under all the circumstances, be justified to grant leave.\nThe application is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the creditor, applicant: Quain & Quain, Ottawa.\nAttorneys for the debtor, respondent: Badeaux, Filion & Beland, Montreal.\n1 [1925] S.C.H. 275, 5 C.B.R. 790, 3 D.L.R. 311.\n2 [1955] S.C.R. 824, 55 D.T.C. 1176, [1955] C.T.C. 271, 5 D.L.R. 614.\n3 [1950] S.C.R. 412, 97 C.C.C. 177, 10 C.R. 97, 3 D.L.R. 641.\n4 [1928] S.C.R. 180.\n5 [1931] S.C.R. 498, 4 D.L.R. 244.\n6 [1926] S.C.R. 26.\n"}

Z, a building contractor, pledged the title to his house property by way of equitable mortgage in favour of the defendant credit union \"to secure the repayment of $2,000 and any moneys borrowed\" by him from the defendant. The duplicate certificate of title was deposited with the defendant pursuant to this agreement. In the course of his business Z made purchases of building materials from the plaintiff and became indebted to it for the purchase price. Security was asked for this debt and Z, after telling the plaintiff that there was a mortgage in favour of the credit union, and that it had the duplicate certificate of title, executed an equitable mortgage upon \"his equity in\" the land in favour of the plaintiff. The latter filed a caveat claiming an interest in the land by virtue of its mortgage.\nSubsequently Z executed, in favour of the credit union, a mortgage in registrable form, under The Land Titles Act, which was later registered. The plaintiff commenced action against Z, and the credit union was added as a party defendant. The plaintiff sought a declaration that it had a valid charge against the land and foreclosure of its mortgage. At trial judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff, and this judgment was sustained by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The credit union appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the judgment at trial should be set aside and the appellant should be entitled to a declaration that its equitable mortgage had priority over that of the respondent.\nIn addition to priority as to time, the defendant's mortgage ranked ahead of that of the plaintiff because of the form of the latter mortgage, which was not drafted as a registrable mortgage under The Land Titles Act, but only purported to charge Z's equity in the land. The defendant had a valid equitable interest in the land at the time that the plaintiff took the mortgage of Z's equity. The wording of the plaintiff's mortgage took the form which it did because both Z and the plaintiff knew of the existence of the defendant's equitable mortgage and intended that Z could only mortgage his remaining equitable interest in the land.\nThe two equitable mortgages which were in competition here were not the same. That of the plaintiff, by its terms, was expressly limited to a charge upon \"my equity\". It was, therefore, a mortgage of only a limited interest in the land. The filing of the caveat could not create a charge upon more than that which had been charged by Z under the terms of the instrument itself. Stated at its highest, the plaintiff's position after registration of the caveat could only be the same as if the equitable mortgage itself could have been and had been registered as an instrument under the Act. According to the tenor and intent of that document it only constituted a mortgage upon a partial interest in the land.\nJellett v. Wilkie (1896), 26 S.C.R. 282, followed; Hackworth v. Baker, [1936] 1 W.W.R. 321; Clark v. Barrick, [1949] 2 W.W.R. 1009, explained; Bank of Hamilton v. Hartery (1919), 58 S.C.R. 338; Davidson v. Davidson, [1946] S.C.R. 115; Church v. Hill, [1923] S.C.R. 642; McKillop & Benjafield v. Alexander (1912), 45 S.C.R. 551, referred to.\nWith respect to the question of merger, the defendant could not be considered to have intended to surrender a prior interest, in favour of the plaintiff's subsequent interest, by the taking of the legal mortgage in substitution for its existing security. It could not, in the circum- stances have intended to effect a merger of its two securities. Even if a merger were held to have occurred that would not automatically increase the interest granted to the plaintiff by the terms of its mortgage. At no time did Z have a complete interest in the land which he could mortgage to the plaintiff by a mortgage of \"his equity\", because at all times there existed a charge on the land in favour of the defendant. This situation continued, even if it were held that a merger had taken place. Ghana Commercial Bank v. Chandiram, [1960] 2 All E.R. 865, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, affirming a judgment of Davis J. Appeal allowed.\nD. A. Schmeiser, for the defendant, appellant.\nJames L. Robertson, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014Anton Zirtz, who was a building contractor carrying on business in Saskatoon, borrowed money from the appellant in order to build his own house and to assist him in his business. On June 14,1957, he executed, in favour of the appellant, a \"Pledge of Title\" by way of equitable mortgage upon his house property, comprising Lots 27 to 30 inclusive, in Block 28, in the city of Saskatoon, according to plan of record in the Land Titles Office for the Saskatoon Land Registration District as No. G. 131 (hereinafter referred to as \"the land\"), \"to secure the repayment of 12,000 and any moneys borrowed\" by Zirtz from the appellant. The duplicate certificate of title for the land was deposited with the appellant pursuant to this agreement. In addition to the $2,000 mentioned in the agreement, $4,400 was loaned by the appellant to Zirtz after June 14, 1957, and prior to June 19, 1958.\nIn the course of his business Zirtz made purchases of lumber and other building supplies from the respondent and became indebted to it for the purchase price. The respondent asked for security for this debt and Zirtz, on June 19, 1958, executed an equitable mortgage, in favour of the respondent, upon the land. This document recited a present indebtedness in excess of $26,000 and that the respondent had requested Zirtz to give a charge and mortgage on his equity in the land for the sum of $6,000 as collateral security for his indebtedness as well as for any moneys which might become owing to the respondent for lumber and supplies purchased by Zirtz. It then went on to provide:\nNOW THEREFORE the debtor does hereby charge and mortgage his equity in said Lots 27 & 28, in Block 28, Plan G. 131, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to the extent of $6,000 to the Company as collateral security for payment of the lumber and builder's supplies heretofore purchased by the debtor from the Company or which may hereafter be purchased by him from the Company;\nIt is conceded that this document was not a registrable mortgage under The Land Titles Act of Saskatchewan, R.S.S. 1953, c. 108, which was in force at all times material to these proceedings. Even if it had been in registrable form, it could not have been registered by the respondent because of the fact that the duplicate certificate of title for the land was in the possession of the appellant as security for its equitable mortgage.\nThe circumstances relating to the granting of this equitable mortgage by Zirtz to the respondent are summarized in the judgment of Gordon J.A., using Zirtz's own words, as follows:\nI told Mr. Ball and Mr. Dingwall that there was a mortgage against my home for $6,400 in favour of The St. Mary's Parish Credit Union and that they had the title. I told them the building was worth $15,000. Although the word \"equity\" was not used I told them that I could only use my interest in the property to get material to finish the buildings.\nBall was the President of the respondent at that time and Dingwall was then a Vice-President.\nThe respondent filed a caveat on June 20, 1958, claiming an interest in the land under the document of June 19, 1958, wherein the respondent stated that Zirtz had \"mortgaged and charged the said land\" to the respondent.\nOn July 15, 1958, Zirtz executed, in favour of the appellant, a mortgage in registrable form, under The Land Titles Act, which was registered on the following day. It was not until the time of registration of this document that the appellant became aware of the existence of the respondent's caveat.\nThe respondent commenced action against Zirtz and the appellant was added as a party defendant. The respondent sought a declaration that it had a valid charge against the land and foreclosure of its mortgage. The appellant, in its statement of defence, asked for a declaration that its interest in the land was entitled to priority over any interest of the respondent.\nAt the trial, judgment was given in favour of the respondent. It was held that its mortgage took priority over that of the appellant and a foreclosure order in favour of the respondent was granted.\nThis judgment was sustained on appeal to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan2, McNiven J.A. dissenting. The contention of the respondent on that appeal, which was accepted by the majority of the Court, is summarized in the majority judgment as follows:\nThe contention of the plaintiff is that it and the Cerdit Union were both creditors of Zirtz, each endeavouring to obtain security for the sums that he owed them; that they knew that the title to the property was clear but for three mechanic's liens, two of them filed by the plaintiff itself, and a third by Myers Construction Co., Ltd., for the small sum of $98. They knew that any equitable mortgage held by the Credit Union was unregistered and that it passed no interest until registered and that therefore the equity that Zirtz had to offer as security was the full equity as shown by the title. The plaintiff relies on the cases of Hackworth v. Baker [1936] 1 W.W.R. 321, and Clark v. Barrick [1949] 2 W.W.R. 1009.\nThe following conclusion is stated:\nIn this case, at the time the respondent obtained the mortgage from Zirtz, it is fair to say that both Zirtz and the respondent believed such mortgage would be subject to the prior claim by the appellant. The priority which the respondent obtained upon registration of the caveat was simply by the operation of the provisions of The Land Titles Act, a priority which under the Act is unassailable in the absence of fraud.\nIt was also held that the appellant's equitable mortgage of June 14, 1957, had become merged in the registered mortgage of July 15, 1958, and that, as the latter document had been registered subsequent to the filing of the respondent's caveat, it ranked subject to the respondent's equitable mortgage.\nMcNiven J.A. held that there had been fraud on the part of the respondent, within the meaning of The Land Titles Act, in the light of the construction placed on the meaning of that word by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan in Independent Lumber Company v. Gardiner3. He also held:\nZirtz recognized his obligation to St. Mary's\u2014told the plaintiff St. Mary's held the duplicate certificate of title and that he could not and would not mortgage its interest in the home property. The plaintiff agreed and the agreement prepared by the plaintiff was in my opinion intended to exclude St. Mary's claim from its operation. It was carved out of the security given the plaintiff under its mortgage with its consent. In case of doubt as to its meaning a document is most strongly construed; against the party who prepared it.\nHe further held that the respondent's caveat had misrepresented the document upon which it was based.\nThe appellant has appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Zirtz is not a party to this appeal.\nUp to the time of the filing of the respondent's caveat the situation was that both the appellant and the respondent had equitable mortgages upon the land. That of the appellant was prior in time to that of the respondent and ranked first in equity. Neither mortgage was in registrable form under the provisions of The Land Titles Act, but the appellant had possession of the duplicate certificate of title for the land. In addition to priority as to time, it seems to me that the appellant's mortgage ranked ahead of that of the respondent because of the form of the latter mortgage. It appears clear, from the terms of that document and in the light of the evidence, that it was intended to charge, not the whole of the owner's interest in the land, but only the equitable interest which remained in Zirtz after he had granted to the appellant the earlier mortgage. The respondent's mortgage, which was drawn by its solicitors, was not drafted as a registrable mortgage under The Land Titles Act, but only purported to charge \"his equity\" in the land.\nWhat was that equity? It was the interest which he retained in the land, subject to the appellant's equitable mortgage. It is true that the appellant's interest was an unregistered interest, but it did confer rights on the appellant and such rights were enforceable against Zirtz. Several cases in this Court have recognized the validity of equitable interests in lands which are subject to the Torrens system of titles and which are not themselves registrable interests under that system. The leading case is Jellett v. Wilkie4, which held that a writ of execution registered pursuant to the provisions of the Territories Real Property Act, 49 Vict. (Can.), c. 51, would only attach the interest of the registered owner of the lands subject to existing equities and that, therefore, it would not take priority over a previous unregistered transfer of those lands.\nIt was suggested in Clark v. Barrick5, a decision of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, which is cited in the majority decision in the present case, that Jellett v. Wilkie had been overruled by the judgment of this Court in Bank of Hamilton v. Hartery6. It appears to be clear, however, from the judgment in Davidson v. Davidson7, which was not referred to in the reasons in Clark v. Barrick, that this conclusion is not correct. The judgment in the Bank of Hamilton v. Hartery case turned on the interpretation of certain sections of the Land Registry Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 127, which had been amended prior to the decision in the Davidson case. The principle formulated in Jellett v. Wilkie was applied by this Court in the latter case.\nThe position of equitable interests under a Torrens system of titles is clearly stated by Anglin J., as he then was, in Church v. Hill8, as follows:\nThe result of decisions of this court in Jellett v. Wilkie, (1896) 26 Can. S.C.R. 282, Williams v. Box, (1910) 44 Can. S.C.R. 1, Smith v. National Trust Co., (1912) 45 Can. S.C.R. 618, Yockney v. Thomson, (1914) 50 Can. S.C.R. 1, Grace v. Kuebler, (1917) 56 Can. S.C.R. 1, and other cases, is that, notwithstanding such provisions as s. 41 of ch. 24 of the Alberta statutes of 1906, equitable doctrines and jurisdiction apply to lands under the Land Titles or Torrens system of registration and equitable interests in such lands may be created and will be recognized and protected.\nThe section of the Alberta Real Property Act to which he refers provided as follows:\n41. After a certificate of title has been granted for any land, no instrument until registered under this Act shall be effectual to pass any estate or interest in any land (except a leasehold interest for three years or for a less period) or render such land liable as security for the payment of money; but upon the registration of any instrument in the manner hereinbefore prescribed the estate or interest specified therein shall pass, or, as the case may be, the land shall become liable as security in manner and subject to the covenants, conditions and contingencies set forth and specified in such instrument or by this Act declared to be implied in instruments of a like nature.\nThe equivalent section of The Land Titles Act of Saskatchewan provides:\n65. (1) After a certificate of title has been granted no instrument shall until registered pass any estate or interest in the land therein comprised, except a leasehold interest not exceeding three years where there is actual occupation of the land under the same, or render such land liable as security for the payment of money except as against the person making the same.\n(2) Every instrument shall become operative according to the tenor and intent thereof when registered and shall thereupon create, transfer, surrender, charge or discharge, as the case may be, the land, estate or interest therein mentioned.\nIt will be noted that subs. (1) of s. 65 contains, as s. 41 of the Alberta Real Property Act did not, the significant words \"except as against the person making the same\". A similar change in wording had occurred in the Land Registry Act of British Columbia in the interval between the decisions in Bank of Hamilton v. Hartery and Davidson v. Davidson.\nIn my opinion the appellant had a valid equitable interest in the land at the time that the respondent took the mortgage of Zirtz's equity in the land. The wording of the respondent's mortgage is significant and, in my view, took the form which it did because both Zirtz and the respondent knew of the existence of the appellant's equitable mortgage and intended that Zirtz could only mortgage his remaining equitable interest in the land.\nWhat then was the effect of the registration of the respondent's caveat? The judgment of the Court of Appeal is that the respondent thereby obtained a priority over the appellant's mortgage by reason of the operation of the provisions of The Land Titles Act. That decision is based upon the authority of Hackworth v. Baker9 and Clark v. Barrick, supra.\nThe former case involved the issue of priority as between two transfers of the same land. The one which had been executed the later was registered and the earlier one was not. The Court ruled in favour of the transferee who had registered his transfer. It held that the fact that a person, who obtained a transfer of land and registered it, knew that there was an outstanding unregistered transfer of the same land did not amount to \"fraud\" within the meaning of s. 216 of The Land Titles Act, R.S.S. 1930, c. 80.\nClark v. Barrick was a case in which the competing interests were as between two agreements for sale of the same lands. The purchaser under the agreement which was later in point of time registered a caveat against the lands to protect his interest. The purchaser under the earlier agreement did not. The Court held in favour of that purchaser who had filed a caveat, holding that an unregistered instrument, protected by a caveat claiming an estate or interest in land, must, when the claim is established, be given its full effect according to its tenor, regardless of any other unregistered instrument, whether prior or subsequent, not protected by a caveat, or protected by a caveat subsequent to the one first mentioned.\nClark v. Barrick was overruled in this Court10, but on other grounds.\nThe relevant sections of The Land Titles Act which deal with the filing and the effect of caveats are ss. 138 and 145, which provide as follows:\n138. Any person claiming to be interested in land may file a caveat with the registrar to the effect that no registration of any transfer or other instrument affecting the land shall be made, and no certificate of title to the land granted, until the caveat has been withdrawn or has lapsed as provided by section 146, 147, 148 or 149, unless such instrument or certificate of title is expressed to be subject to the claim of the caveator as stated in the caveat.\n145. While a caveat remains in force the registrar shall not enter in the register any memorandum of a transfer or other instrument purporting to transfer, encumber or otherwise deal with or affect the land with respect to which the caveat is registered, except subject to the claim of the caveator.\nThe matter of the priority of registered instruments is dealt with in s. 71 of the Act, which reads:\n71. Instruments registered in respect of or affecting the same land shall be entitled to priority, the one over the other, according to the time of registration and not according to the date of execution.\nCounsel for the appellant argued that a caveat filed under s. 138 of the Act did not have the effect attributed to it in the judgment in Clark v. Barrick. His contention was that the caveat would serve only as a stop order to preserve the status quo as of the time of its filing, so as to prevent any further dealing with the lands thereafter, save subject to the unregistered instrument which the caveat protected. He pointed out that the Saskatchewan Act does not contain any provision such as s. 148(1) of the Manitoba Real Property Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 220, or s. 152 of the Alberta Land Titles Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 170, the relevant portions of which sections provide as follows:\n148(1) The filing of a caveat by the district registrar or by a caveator gives the same effect, as to priority, to the instrument or subject matter on which the caveat is based, as the registration of an instrument under this Act;\n* * *\n152 Registration by way of caveat, whether by the Registrar or by any caveator, has the same effect as to priority as the registration of any instrument under this Act \u2026\nEach of the Manitoba and the Alberta Acts contains a provision similar to s. 71 of the Saskatchewan Act dealing generally with the priority of registered instruments.\nI do not find it necessary to resolve this question because, even if the view of the effect of filing a caveat in Saskatchewan as stated in Clark v. Barrick is correct, I do not think that it establishes the respondent's claim in this case. In both that case and Hackworth v. Baker the competing interests were the same in form. In the former case a caveat had been registered by one purchaser, under an agreement for sale, who was thereby held to have obtained a priority over another purchaser, under an earlier agreement for sale, of the same lands. In the latter case a transferee who registered his transfer obtained priority over the holder of an earlier, unregistered transfer of the same lands. In each case it was held that under the provisions of the Act the registration of the instrument conferred priority.\nIn the present case, however, the two equitable mortgages which are in competition are not the same. That of the respondent, by its terms, was expressly limited to a charge upon \"my equity\". It was, therefore, a mortgage of only a limited interest in the land. The filing of the caveat gave notice of that interest in the respondent, and any one dealing thereafter with the land could do so only subject to that interest of the respondent, but the filing of the caveat could not and did not increase the extent of the respondent's interest in the land. It could not create a charge upon more than that which had been charged by Zirtz under the terms of the instrument itself.\nThis proposition is clearly stated in the judgment of Duff J., as he then was, in McKillop & Benjafield v. Alexander11, where he said, in reference to the Saskatchewan Land Titles Act, 6 Edw. VII, c. 24:\nThe fundamental principle of the system of conveyancing established by this and like enactments is that title to land and interests in land is to depend upon registration by a public officer and not upon the effect of transactions inter partes. The Act at the same time recognizes unregistered rights respecting land, confirms the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of such rights and, furthermore, makes provision\u2014by the machinery of the caveat\u2014for protecting such rights without resort to the courts. This machinery, however, was designed for the protection of rights\u2014not for the creation of rights. A caveat prevents any disposition of his title by the registered proprietor in derogation of the caveator's claim until that claim has been satisfied or disposed of; but the caveator's claim must stand or fall on its own merits.\nDuff J. dissented in this case on the issue as to whether the respondent, Alexander, had acquired an interest in the lands in question, but the majority of the Court did not disagree with the above statement of the law.\nSubsection (2) of s. 65 of the Act previously quoted, referring to the effect of a registered instrument under the Act, says that, when registered, it shall become operative \"according to the tenor and intent thereof\".\nStated at its highest, the respondent's position after registration of the caveat could only be the same as if the equitable mortgage itself could have been and had been registered as an instrument under the Act. According to the tenor and intent of that document it only constituted a mortgage upon a partial interest in the land.\nFor these reasons, therefore, I do not agree that, by virtue of the filing of its caveat, the respondent obtained, under the provisions of The Land Titles Act, a priority over the prior equitable interest of the appellant.\nI turn now to the question of merger. The respondent's argument is that the rule stated in Halsbury, 3rd ed., p. 420, para. 819, applies:\nAs a general rule a person, by taking or acquiring a security of a higher nature in legal valuation than one he already possesses, merges and extinguishes his legal remedies upon the inferior security or cause of action; thus the taking of a bond or covenant, or the obtaining of a judgment for a simple contract debt, merges and extinguishes the simple contract debt. For this purpose, however, the superior security must be co-extensive with the inferior security and between the same parties; and a security, given by one of two co-debtors to secure a simple contract debt, does not merge the simple contract debt.\nHe also relies on para. 821, which states:\nA mere charge created by deposit of deeds is extinguished by the taking of a formal mortgage, even though the mortgage does not confer a legal estate, and the sum thenceforth secured is the sum mentioned in the mortgage, notwithstanding that other sums were covered by the deposit. But, where a charge on two estates is kept alive in equity in favour of a person paying it off, he does not lose the benefit of the charge by taking a mortgage of one estate, and an equitable security is not merged by taking a security which is ineffectual.\nThe rule at common law as to merger in relation to a mortgage was that, if a mortgage on land and the ownership of the land subject to the mortgage became united in the same person, the mortgage was merged in the ownership and the mortgage was extinguished. In equity merger did not necessarily follow upon the union of the two interests and whether or not such union did occur depended upon the intention, express or implied, of the mortgagee. Dealing with the matter of intention, Falconbridge on The Law of Mortgages, 3rd ed., p. 372, para. 204, says:\nIn the absence of evidence of actual intention, either express or implied from the circumstances of the transaction, the presumption of merger ordinarily arising from the union of a charge and the estate subject to the charge may be rebutted by the consideration that it is more for the benefit of the owner of the charge and the estate that merger shall not take place, as, for example, if the effect of merger would be to confer priority upon subsequent encumbrancers.\nWhile this proposition, as stated by Falconbridge, relates to a merger of a mortgage and the estate, it is also, in my opinion, applicable with respect to the matter of the merger of a security of a lower nature into one of a higher nature in legal valuation.\nAuthority for this view is found in a recent decision of the Privy Council in Ghana Commercial Bank v. Chandiram12. That was a case in which it was argued that the appellant bank, possessed of an equitable charge on land, had merged that charge in a legal mortgage of the same land which was subsequently taken. The legal mortgage proved to be invalid. The argument in favour of merger was rejected and it was said at p. 871:\nWhile not disputing that the Ghana Bank's intention was to substitute the legal mortgage for the equitable charge, they find it impossible to accept the view that the Ghana Bank intended the equitable charge to be extinguished in the event of the legal mortgage proving for any reason to be invalid or ineffective. In other words, their Lordships take the intention of the Ghana Bank to have been to replace the equitable charge by a valid and effective legal mortgage, but to keep it alive for their own benefit save in so far as it was so replaced.\nIn that case the legal mortgage was invalid. The appellant's legal mortgage in the present case was valid, but, if it were to rank subsequent to the respondent's caveat, so that the respondent's mortgage would charge the entire interest of Zirtz in the land, it would be ineffective. I think the same reasoning is applicable in the present case in seeking to determine what was the appellant's intention. I do not see how the appellant could be considered to have intended to surrender a prior interest, in favour of the respondent's subsequent interest, by the taking of the legal mortgage in substitution for its existing security. It cannot, in the circumstances, have intended to effect a merger of its two securities.\nIn any event, even if a merger were held to have occurred, I do not see how that would automatically increase the interest granted to the respondent by the terms of its mortgage. At no time did Zirtz have a complete interest in the land which he could mortgage to the respondent by a mortgage of \"his equity\", because at all times there existed a charge on the land in favour of the appellant. This situation continued, even if it were held that a merger had taken place.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed, the judgment at the trial should be set aside and the appellant should be entitled to a declaration that its equitable mortgage had priority over that of the respondent.\nThere is one further point to be determined and that is as to the amount of the appellant's prior charge. At the time the respondent took its mortgage on the equity of Zirtz he was indebted to the appellant in the principal amount of $6,400. Subsequent to the execution of the equitable mortgage to the respondent and the registration of its caveat, a further $3,000 was advanced to Zirtz by the appellant, making a total of $9,400, which appears as the principal amount of the appellant's legal mortgage. The appellant contended that it was entitled to priority for the entire amount, but I cannot accept that contention. The respondent's mortgage, protected by caveat, applied to the equity of Zirtz as it existed at the time of the execution of the respondent's mortgage. At that time and at the time of the filing of the caveat the principal amount of the prior mortgage was $6,400. As from the time of the registration of its caveat the respondent had a valid charge upon the remaining interest of Zirtz in the land. In my opinion, therefore, the appellant's priority is limited to the extent of $6,400, together with simple interest, at the rate of one per cent per month as provided in the appellant's equitable mortgage, from time to time on unpaid balances to June 19, 1958.\nThe appellant, in my opinion, is entitled to its costs throughout, including the costs of the motions for leave to appeal to this Court made before the Court of Appeal and this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Douglas A.

The department prepared an equalization report for the district of Sudbury by which the local assessment in the municipality of Copper Cliff was greatly increased. The equalization report took into consideration a smelter that had not been assessed by the municipality. The Town of Copper Cliff appealed from this report to the Ontario Municipal Board. Shortly thereafter, an amended equalization report, which purported to amend the earlier one, was forwarded to the municipalities concerned. The amended report was also appealed, and a request was made by the present appellant that a case be stated by the Board for the opinion of the Court of Appeal upon certain questions of law. Leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was granted by this Court.\nHeld: The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\n1. The Department of Municipal Affairs had jurisdiction to make the equalization report.\n2. The report did not require the signature of the Minister of Municipal Affairs.\n3. The legislation did not contemplate a succession of equalization reports for any one year. The first report alone was authorized and was to be considered.\n4. In preparing its equalization report, the department was not restricted to a mere examination of the assessment rolls of the interested municipalities. Everything which was done by the department came under the heading of revision and equalization. 5. The jurisdiction of the Ontario Municipal Board was not limited merely to a dismissal of the appeal from the equalization report or to a granting thereof by setting aside the report, but this did not mean that the Board had jurisdiction to determine whether a particular property was or was not assessable.

Eglinton Bowling Co., [1957] O.R. 621, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dealing with questions of law submitted to that Court by the Ontario Municipal Board. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.\nJ.T. Weir, Q.C., and B.M. Osler, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ.E. Eberle, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The Corporation of the Town of Copper Cliff appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, dated June 24, 1957, and, objection having been taken, leave to appeal was granted by this Court at the opening of the argument.\nAt the outset attention should be drawn to the time that has elapsed since the judgment of the Court of Appeal in a matter affecting the proper amount of the assessment roll of the appellant for the year 1954 as equalized for the purpose of defining its proportion of the cost of maintaining a home for the aged under The Homes for the Aged Act, Statutes of Ontario 1955, c. 30, as amended in 1956. Notice of appeal to this Court was given October 11, 1957, by Copper Cliff and the Corporation of the Town of Frood Mine. A notice of cross-appeal by the respondent, The Department of Municipal Affairs for the Province of Ontario, was dated October 17, 1957. On December 21, 1959, Frood Mine gave notice of discontinuance of its appeal. Copies of these notices were duly filed in the office of the Registrar of this Court, but it was only in March 1960, that a motion was launched to dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution. When the matter came before a member of this Court, to whom the Registrar had referred the motion, an order was made putting the appellant upon terms as to the filing of the case and factums for the October 1960 sittings. It is true that by an amendment to The Homes for the Aged Act (subs. 3 of s. 4 of c. 45 of the Statutes of 1957), subs. 5 of s. 19 of the Act was added, but this cannot account for or excuse the delay.\nThere is a home for the aged in the District of Sudbury and it has been taken for granted that that home had been established under s. 4 of the Act, because the parties to this appeal agreed that subs. 1 of s. 19 applies:\n19. (1) The cost of maintaining a home established under section 4 shall be defrayed in each year by the municipalities in the territorial district in proportion to the amounts of their assessments according to their last revised assessment rolls as equalized.\nAn amendment to the Act, s. 1 of c. 30 of the Statutes of Ontario for 1956, which came into force as of January 1, 1955, added clause (c) to s. 1 of the Act, which now reads, with the introductory words, as follows:\n1. In this Act,\n..........................................................................................................................................................\n(c) \u201clast revised assessment rolls as equalized\u201d means last revised assessment rolls as revised and equalized for the purposes of this Act by the assessor of the territorial district, or, if there is no district assessor, by the Department of Municipal Affairs.\nAt the outset it is important to bear in mind the distinction between counties and territorial districts in Ontario. The Territorial Division Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 388, provides that the province shall consist of counties and districts. In the list of districts is \u201cThe Territorial District of Sudbury\u201d, consisting of the City of Sudbury, eight towns, including Copper Cliff and Frood Mine. It was not made clear how and when the Improvement District of Renabie came into being, but no party took exception to the fact that that Improvement District appears in the equalization report to be mentioned shortly. By s. 97 of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 24, as amended, provision is made for the appointment by the Minister of Municipal Affairs of a district assessor for any territorial district described in The Territorial Division Act. By subs. 17 of that section \u201cif any municipality or locality in a district is dissatisfied with the last revised assessment as equalized for any purpose by the district assessor or by the department\u201d, which means the Department of Municipal Affairs, \u201cthe municipality or trustees of an improvement district may appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board\u201d. There being no district assessor in the District of Sudbury, the department made a 1955 equalization report, dated January 30, 1956, with explanatory notes. Copper Cliff and Frood Mine appealed from this report to the Municipal Board. By a letter dated March 13, 1956, the Director of Municipal Assessment wrote the Clerk of Copper Cliff that he had been instructed by the Minister of Municipal Affairs to forward an amended 1955 equalization report, made under the provisions of the Act. This report purported to supersede the earlier one of January 30th. An appeal by the same two municipalities was launched against this report. When both appeals came before the Board the two municipalities requested that a special case be stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal, in accordance with s. 96 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 262, as amended. I agree with the Court of Appeal that we need not concern ourselves with the later report.\nThe first report increased the 1956 local assessment of Copper Cliff from $8,625,264 to $49,627,520. At the request of the council of Copper Cliff, the supervisor of municipal assessment informed it of the basic principles applied in equalizing the assessment. It is sufficient to state that in applying these principles the supervisor explained that the equalization report had taken into consideration property that had not been assessed in Copper Cliff,\u2014apparently a smelter which had been omitted being responsible for the great increase noted above. In the case of some municipalities, assessments were added to cover buildings erected after the return of the local assessment roll and for other reasons, in accordance with s. 51(a) of The Assessment Act, as amended.\nThe words \u201cfor any purpose\u201d, which have been underlined in the extract from subs. 17 of s. 97 of The Assessment Act, quoted above, should be noted, as it is important to bear in mind that the last revised assessment of Copper Cliff was equalized for the purpose of fixing that municipality\u2019s proportion of the cost of maintaining the Sudbury District Home for the Aged. As is pointed out by Aylesworth JA., speaking for the Court of Appeal, the case as stated by the Board is most unsatisfactory, but I agree that that learned judge has correctly stated the questions to be answered as follows:\n(1) Had the Department of Municipal Affairs in 1956, jurisdiction to make an Equalization Report? This question is academic so far as future years are concerned by reason of a subsequent amendment to the Home for the Aged Act, enacted in 1957.\n(2) Is the January 1956 Equalization Report of the Board a nullity, by reason of the fact that it does not bear the signature of the Minister of Municipal Affairs?\n(3) Did the Department of Municipal Affairs have jurisdiction to make its so-called amended Equalization Report in March, 1956, having already delivered its Equalization Report in January of that year?\n(4) In making its Equalization Report, was the Department of Municipal Affairs restricted merely to an examination of the assessment rolls of the interested municipalities as those rolls were closed pursuant to Section 53 of The Assessment Act and as those rolls had been revised and certified, pursuant to Section 54, of The Assessment Act, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the valuations of real property, made by the assessors in each municipality, bear a just relation one to another, and for the purpose of increasing or decreasing the aggregate values shown in the local assessments, by adding or deducting so much percent as, in the opinion of the Department, was necessary to produce a just relation between such valuations?\n(5) Is the jurisdiction of the Ontario Municipal Board on the applications to it by way of appeals from the said Equalization Report limited merely to a dismissal of the appeal or to a granting thereof by setting aside the Equalization Report?\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that Question 1 should be answered in the affirmative. Clearly, by the relevant statutes quoted above, the Department of Municipal Affairs had jurisdiction to make the equalization report of January 30, 1956.\nWith reference to Question 2, the Court of Appeal decided that the January 1956 equalization report was not a nullity by reason of the fact that it did not bear the signature of the Minister of Municipal Affairs. It was upon this point that the cross-appeal to this Court was launched and argued. The Executive Council Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 121, provides by s. 1 that the Executive Council shall be composed of such persons as the Lieutenant-Governor from time to time appoints. Section 2 provides that the Lieutenant-Governor may appoint under the Great Seal from among the Ministers of the Crown certain named Ministers to hold office during pleasure, among them being a Minister of Municipal Affairs. Section 5 reads as follows:\n5. No deed or contract in respect of any matter under the control or direction of a minister shall be binding on His Majesty or be deemed to be the act of such minister unless it is signed by him or is approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nThe Department of Municipal Affairs Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 96, as amended, provides for a Department of Municipal Affairs over which the Minister shall preside. While subs. 1 of s. 2 states \u201cThe Minister shall have power and authority to act for and on behalf of the Department\u201d, subs. 3 provides for the appointment by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of such officers, clerks and servants as from time to time may be deemed necessary for the proper conduct of the business of the department. By s. 3 the department is to administer all acts in respect to municipal institutions and affairs. It appears to me to be clear, in view of these enactments, that the Court of Appeal was correct in answering Question 2 in the negative.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal\u2019s answer to Question 3 and have nothing to add to the reasons given by that Court for its answer in the negative.\nWith respect to Question 4, I agree with the Court of Appeal for the reasons given by it that everything done by the department in preparing the report of January 1956, comes under the heading of revision and equalization.\nAs to Question 5, it should be reiterated that the equalization is made for the purpose of defining the share of each municipality in the territorial division of the cost of maintaining the home for the aged, which is to be in proportion to the amounts of their assessments according to their last revised assessment rolls as equalized which, as shown by the amendment of 1956, means \u201cas revised and equalized\u201d. We are not concerned with the amendments to s. 80 of The Assessment Act dealing with appeals to the Municipal Board from a County Judge, nor with appeals to the Court of Appeal from a County Judge, nor with the amendment in 1956 to The Assessment Act which added s. 81(a) thereto. As has been pointed out, this is an appeal under s. 97 of The Assessment Act. The Board is to determine whether the equalization report was proper and is not concerned with the question of whether the smelter, for instance, referred to above, is or is not assessable or taxable in Copper Cliff,\nThe appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by leave granted by this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] dealing with questions of law submitted to that Court in a case stated by the Ontario Municipal Board, a body constituted under the provisions of The Ontario Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 262.\nThe Town of Copper Cliff is one of the 29 municipalities in the District of Sudbury and, as such, liable to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a home for the aged in that district by reason of s. 4 of The Homes for the Aged Act, 1955.\nBy s. 19(1) of the last mentioned Act it is provided that:\nThe cost of maintaining a home established under section 4 shall be defrayed in each year by the municipalities in the territorial district in proportion to the amounts of their assessments according to their last revised assessment rolls as equalized.\nBy s. 1 of c. 30 of the Statutes of Ontario for 1956 there was added to s. 1 the following:\n(c) \u201clast revised assessment rolls as equalized\u201d means last revised assessment rolls as revised and equalized for the purposes of this Act by the assessor of the territorial district, or, if there is no district assessor, by the Department of Municipal Affairs.\nActing under these powers the department prepared and forwarded to the Town of Copper Cliff and other municipalities in the district who were liable to contribute to the support of the home for the aged a document described as the 1955 equalization report. According to the 1954 assessment rolls of the town, properties in the town were assessed for a total amount of $8,625,264 and the department\u2019s equalized assessment raised this figure to $49,627,520. This was forwarded to the clerk of the town by the director of municipal assessment on January 30, 1956. The council of the town, by letter dated February 3, 1956, addressed to the Department of Municipal Affairs, asked it for certain information as to the manner in which the equalized assessment had been made. This was answered by a letter from the supervisor of municipal assessment under date February 20, 1956. The great disparity between the total assessment of the town and that in the equalized assessment of the department was mainly attributable to the fact that the town had not assessed the smelter of the International Nickel Co. Ltd.\nOn March 13, 1956, the director of municipal assessment forwarded an amended 1955 equalization report for the district to the municipalities concerned.\nIn February 1956 the Town of Copper Cliff appealed to the Ontario Municipal Board from the equalization report forwarded to it in January under the provisions of s. 97(17) of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 24, and, when the second equalization report was received, also appealed from it. These appeals came before the Municipal Board and the request was then made by the present appellant that a case be stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal upon certain questions of law under the terms of s. 96 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act. By an order of the Board dated November 14, 1956, it was directed that this be done.\nThe questions of law submitted for the opinion of the court are more conveniently summarized and stated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Aylesworth J.A. and are as follows:\n(1) Had the Department of Municipal Affairs in 1956, jurisdiction to make an Equalization Report? This question is academic so far as future years are concerned by reason of a subsequent amendment to the Home for the Aged Act, enacted in 1957.\n(2) Is the January 1956 Equalization Report of the Board a nullity, by reason of the fact that it does not bear the signature of the Minister of Municipal Affairs?\n(3) Did the Department of Municipal Affairs have jurisdiction to make its so-called amended Equalization Report in March, 1956, having already delivered its Equalization Report in January of that year?\n(4) In making its Equalization Report, was the Department of Municipal Affairs restricted merely to an examination of the assessment rolls of the interested municipalities as those rolls were closed pursuant to Section 53 of The Assessment Act and as those rolls had been revised and certified, pursuant to Section 54, of The Assessment Act, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the valuations of real property, made by the assessors in each municipality, bear a just relation one to another, and for the purpose of increas- ing or decreasing the aggregate values shown in the local assessments, by adding or deducting so much percent as, in the opinion of the Department, was necessary to produce a just relation between such valuations?\n(5) Is the jurisdiction of the Ontario Municipal Board on the applications to it by way of appeals from the said Equalization Report limited merely to a dismissal of the appeal or to a granting thereof by setting aside the Equalization Report?\nThe Home for the Aged Act, 1955, provides for the establishment and maintenance of persons over the age of 60 years who are unable to care for themselves, whether through the disabilities of age or sickness or mental incompetence. The home for the district in question is situated in Sudbury and all persons eligible for admission to it resident in the district and complying with the provisions of the Act may be admitted. The cost of a home to which s. 4 applies may be contributed to the extent of fifty per cent by the province; the balance is to be provided by the municipalities in proportion to the amount of their assessments, as required by s. 19.\nBy s. 33 of The Assessment Act, land is to be assessed at its actual value, subject to the provisions of that section. If any municipality in the district fails to assess the property within its limits which are subject to assessment and taxation as required by s. 33, or if there is omitted from the assessment roll properties liable to assessment and taxation, the result is, of necessity, that the municipality does not pay its fair share toward the support of the home for the aged and an undue burden is cast upon the other municipalities in the district. It is, apparently, to guard against any evasion of this statutory obligation that the provision is made for equalization and revision.\nI see no ambiguity in the language of s. 19 as amended and I agree with Aylesworth J.A. that the first question should be answered in the affirmative.\nThe January equalization report was not signed by the Minister of Municipal Affairs, being merely forwarded to the town by the director of municipal assessment. The language of the 1956 amendment to s. 1 which defines the expression \u201ctheir last revised assessment rolls as equalized\u201d in s. 19(1) declares this to mean the last revised assessment roll, as revised and equalized for the purposes of the Act by the Department of Municipal Affairs. There is no requirement that the equalization report should be signed by the Minister and, in my opinion, that is unnecessary. The second question should be answered in the negative.\nAs to the third question, I agree with the answer of Aylesworth J.A. that the legislation does not contemplate a succession of equalization reports, but one only, and that it is the first alone that was authorized and is to be considered.\nAs to the fourth question, the department is authorized and required not merely to equalize but to revise the asssessment. To correct assessments which would not comply with s. 33 of The Assessment Act and to include property which had not been assessed at all was a proper exercise, in my opinion, of the powers given to the department and the question should be answered in the negative.\nThe fifth question restates the matter raised by paragraph 12 of the special case.\nIn my opinion, this question should be answered by a simple negative. I think it inadvisable in answering it to attempt to define the limits of the jurisdiction vested in the Municipal Board by subs. (17) of s. 97 of The Assessment Act and s. 40 of The Municipal Board Act and that any question respecting that jurisdiction should be submitted in a concrete form stating the exact matter in respect of which it is questioned.\nIn the answer given to this question by Aylesworth J.A. the following passage appears:\nI think the purpose, intent and scheme of the legislation and in particular the provisions of Section 97 of the Assessment Act, as amended, envisage the Board, sitting in appeal, dealing with the Report at large and determining all questions of fact and of law raised in and relevant to the appeal.\nI do not construe this language as meaning that the Board, contrary to what was decided by this Court in Toronto v. Olympia Edward Recreation Club Ltd.[3], and by the Court of Appeal in Metropolitan Toronto v. Eglinton Bowling Co.[4], has jurisdiction to determine whether a particular property is or is not assessable. The former case dealt with the powers of the Board to decide such questions of law under the powers given to it by ss. 80(6) and 83 of The Assessment Act of 1950, as amended, and the decision applies with equal force to the determination of such questions under s. 97, as amended. Had this been intended, no, doubt it would have been pointed out how these cases were to be distinguished, but neither case is mentioned.\nI would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the questions of law which were raised for the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case stated by the Ontario Municipal Board (which were conveniently summarized in the form of five questions by Aylesworth J.A.) are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nI agree with the Chief Justice and with my brother Locke that the first three of these questions were answered correctly by the Court of Appeal.\nQuestions (4) and (5) read together appear to me to involve a question of considerable difficulty.\nIt is clear from the material in the record that in making the equalization of the last revised assessment rolls of the municipalities in the territorial district for the purposes of The Homes for the Aged Act the Department of Municipal Affairs included in the amount at which it equalized the last revised assessment roll of the appellant a sum of about $40,000,000 which it regarded as the amount at which a smelter which had been omitted from the last revised assessment roll ought to have been assessed.\nIt appears to me that in reaching the decision to add this amount the department must have considered and decided the question whether or not this smelter was assessable. It is true that the decision of that question by the department or the Board would not, as between the owner of the smelter and the Town of Copper Cliff, render the former liable to taxation in respect of the smelter; it was, however, in my opinion, a necessary and not merely an incidental step in arriving at the end result as to the total amount at which the roll of the appellant should be equalized. In view of the decision of the majority of this Court in Toronto v. Olympia Edward Recreation Club Ltd.[5], I find some difficulty in holding that either the Department of Municipal Affairs or the Ontario Municipal Board was clothed with the necessary jurisdiction to decide, even for the limited purpose of making the equalization, the question whether or not the smelter was assessable.\nHowever, as if we were untrammelled by authority I would have no hesitation in agreeing that the appeal and cross-appeal fail and as I understand that all the other members of the Court are of opinion that there is a sufficient difference between the circumstances of the case at bar and those of the Olympia case to prevent the last mentioned judgment being decisive of the case before us, I am content to concur in the disposition of the appeal and cross-appeal proposed by the Chief Justice and by my brother Locke.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the Department of Municipal Affairs for the Province of Ontario: Kimber, Dubin & Eberle, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the Corporation of the Township of Neelon and Garson: Waisberg & Waisberg, Sudbury.\n[1] [1957] O.W.N. 411, 9 D.L.R.

By the judgment of the Court of Appeal the compensation was reduced to $5,149.82 with interest, which represented the amount spent on improvements, plus 10 per cent of that sum for time and effort spent on the improvements, and $1,200 for being deprived of possession.\nThe claimant held the lot under a ten-year lease which contained a provision as to the lessor\u2019s right of sale in the event of her receiving an offer to purchase the property and an option to the lessee to make an identical offer. Approximately two months after the claimant had taken possession the city passed a by-law expropriating the property for municipal purposes.\nThe arbitrator found that a reasonable lessee in the position of the claimant at the date of the by-law would have been prepared to agree to pay a rental of 61 per cent of the gross parking revenue and 1\u00bc cents per gallon of gasoline sold rather than surrender possession of the demised premises. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the rental value of the premises at the date of expropriation was no more than the rent reserved in the lease (50 per cent of the gross parking revenue, with a minimum of $770 per month).\nThe claimant appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ.: The principles to be applied in determining the compensation to be awarded the claimant whose interest as lessee was to be valued were as stated in Bignall v. The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, [1957] O.W.N. 408. The value of the lease to the claimant was the difference between what he had to pay as rental and what he would be prepared to pay as a reasonable man rather than surrender possession of the premises.\nThe Court of Appeal had not overlooked the evidence that the amounts derived from parking and from sales of gasoline had increased over the estimates of the claimant at the time of the making of the lease, and therefore no additional amount should be allowed because of this evidence.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: While the award made by the arbitrator could not be supported, the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal was not supported by the evidence.\nThe arbitrator, having formed his estimate of what he considered to be the premium value of the lease, in determining the compensation to be paid, apparently proceeded upon the basis that the annual profits from the property would at least be equal in each year to the amounts comprising the premium value since, otherwise, the full benefit of this premium value would not be realized. To do so was to follow the course condemned by the Judicial Committee in Pastoral Finance Association v. the Minister, [1914] A.C. 1083. Furthermore the provision for the earlier termination of the lease appeared to have been ignored in deciding the amount of the award, and a further material matter not mentioned was the amount of income tax which would be levied upon the claimant\u2019s profits.\nThe lot in question was, due to its location, a very valuable one for public parking, and the fact that the claimant company was skilled in the operation of such a business was not a factor to be disregarded in estimating the value of the lease to it. The admissible evidence (evidence of earnings following the date of the expropriation by-law should be excluded as irrelevant) supported the view taken by the arbitrator that the business done would, in all probability, have exceeded very considerably that contemplated both by the lessor and the claimant\u2019s president at the time when the lease was executed.\nA prudent person in the position of the claimant would have paid a sum of $10,000 rather than be dispossessed, plus the amount expended for improving the property.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The findings of fact made by the arbitrator were supported by the evidence of the actual parking revenues and sales of gasoline up to May 31, 1956, and should not have been disturbed. This evidence was admissible under a term of the agreement by which the claimant remained in possession up to January 7, 1957.\nHowever the arbitrator did not attach sufficient weight to the existence of the sale clause in the lease. Having arrived at the increased rental which a prudent lessee would have been prepared to agree to pay rather than give up possession, it was next necessary to convert the difference between that rental and the rental reserved in the lease into a lump sum. This involved a calculation factors in which would be the rate of percentage to be used and the time which the lease had to run. The last mentioned of these factors was uncertain by reason of the sale clause and made the question as to what lump sum should be awarded difficult to answer. If one-half of the amount fixed by the arbitrator were awarded, the reasons of the arbitrator (which were correct) for not awarding any additional amounts for the improvements made by the claimant would still be applicable.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], varying an expropriation award of an official arbitrator. Appeal dismissed, Locke and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and R.B. Robinson, for the claimant, appellant.\nJ. Sedgwick, Q.C., for the contestant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014There is no dispute as to the principles to be applied in determining the compensation to be awarded the appellant whose interest as lessee is to be valued. The arbitrator and the Court of Appeal accepted as correct the following statement of Aylesworth J.A. in Bignall v. The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto[2]:\nIt is clear that the only element to be taken into consideration is the value to the owner of the land expropriated. That means in the case of a lessee such as the present respondent, that the value for which he is to receive compensation is the value of the lease to him. The value of the lease to him, in my view, is the difference between what he is called upon to pay as rental and what he would be prepared, as a reasonable man, actually to pay rather than surrender possession of the premises.\nHowever, there is a great divergence of opinion as to the amount to be awarded under the circumstances existing in the present case. The Court of Appeal unanimously arrived at an estimate different from that of the arbitrator, one Member of this Court would substitute another amount and a third Member still another.\nI do not read the reasons of Chief Justice Porter and of Roach J.A. as overlooking the evidence that the amounts derived from parking and from sales of gasoline had increased over the estimates made by Herman at the time of the making of the lease. I am, therefore, unable to agree that something additional should be allowed because of this evidence. The question of the effect of income tax was not argued before us and such a point would require careful consideration and possibly further evidence.\nI am not prepared to disagree with the amount fixed by the Court of Appeal and would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014The question to be determined is the value to the appellant of its leasehold interest in the property in question as of November 7, 1955, being the date of the bylaw expropriating the lands for municipal purposes under the provisions of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243. The principle to be applied is that which has been stated many times in judgments of this Court and which was restated in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King[3].\nThe lease is dated August 17, 1954, and was for a term of 10 years to commence on September 1, 1955. The negotiations for the lease were carried on by Mr. W.B. Herman, the president of the appellant, with Mr. Louis Rotenberg, the husband of the lessor. The property was at that time occupied by a tenant who used it as a public parking lot and gasoline filling station, upon terms which were not disclosed. A provision of the lease which is of importance permitted the lessor, in the event of her receiving a bona fide offer to purchase the land, to advise the lessee of her intention of accepting such offer, whereupon the lessee should have ten days from the date of such notification to offer to purchase the premises. The lessor agreed that if the lessee\u2019s offer was on the same terms and conditions and otherwise identical with the offer received by her, to accept the offer of the lessee. If the lessee failed to submit such an offer and the lessor should accept the offer made to her, the lease might be terminated on 90 days\u2019 notice. There were provisions for reimbursing the lessee for improvements made by it upon the property, in the event of the termination of the lease under this provision.\nHerman had prior to this time a long experience in directing the operation of parking lots in the City of Toronto. The appellant company was one of the most extensive operators in that business at the time in question, having some 65 to 70 locations where such business was carried on. He was aware at the time of the negotiation of the lease that the then occupant of the premises was carrying on an unsuccessful operation, both from the amount of revenue derived from the parking of cars and from the sale of gasoline. According to the evidence, the sales of gasoline on the premises were at the rate of about 40,000 gallons a year, which would be insufficient to make the business profitable. The lease in question required the lessee to pay to the lessor one-half of the gross receipts from the parking of automobiles and trucks and some incidental revenue, but expressly excepted any receipts from the operation of the service station on the premises. While greatly experienced in the parking end of the business at the time the lease was negotiated, the appellant had not theretofore been engaged in the sale of gasoline. Giving evidence, Herman said that he had underestimated very badly the amount of parking revenue the lot would produce and the amount of gasoline that his company could sell on it, saying that he had thought they might get a gross parking revenue of from $1,500 to $1,800 a month and that they might sell 100,000 gallons of gasoline a year. He said that at the time he negotiated the lease he did not attach much importance to the possible sales of gasoline and that he would have made the same deal as to parking revenue even if there had been no service station on the property. The appellants took possession on the date specified in the lease and made improvements to the building and paved the lot. The pumps and storage tanks used by the former defendant were replaced by such equipment provided by the British American Oil Co. Ltd. The appellant had been in possession for the period of slightly more than two months when the expropriation by-law was passed. The evidence is undisputed that the revenue from parking in the months of September and October were greatly in excess of what Herman had anticipated, being $2,778.62 for September and $2,872.65 for October. Gasoline was apparently sold only during the last two weeks of September and the sales amounted to 1,184 gallons. In October this was increased to 5,282 gallons. Evidence for the appellant showed that these sales very greatly increased from November 1, 1955, to May 31, 1956, averaging monthly during that period some 22,000 gallons. The monthly parking revenue during the same period averaged slightly in excess of $3,000.\nNo objection was made before the arbitrator to the admission of this evidence and, as the matter is not mentioned in the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal, I assume that its admissibility was not argued there. Since the appellant is entitled to be compensated for the value of the lease to it and since that matter is to be determined by estimating what the lessee would, as a prudent person, have paid at the relevant date for the leasehold interest rather than be deprived of it, there appears to be no logical basis for the admission of evidence of matters thereafter occurring of which, of necessity, the appellant could know nothing and which could not influence its decision as to what it could prudently pay. That decision could be based only on facts known to the lessee at the time of making it. It is \u201cwhat would he as a prudent man at that moment pay for the property rather than be ejected from it\u201d (Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King, at p. 508). Had there been a disastrous slump of business after November 7, 1955, evidence of that fact would be equally inadmissible. In my opinion, the evidence in either case should be excluded as irrelevant. I consider that nothing that was said by Kerwin J. (as he then was) in The King v. Halin[4], or by Nolan J. in the judgment of this Court in Roberts v. The Queen[5], supports the admissibility of this evidence. In the latter case, evidence to establish market value was admitted of sales of land on the open market within a reasonable period after the date of the expropriation, it being proved that there was no material change in the market for such land in the interim. The evidence received in this case was for an entirely different purpose, being to show the earning capacity of the property as of a later date. If it were in law admissible, its weight would, in my opinion, be negligible, though it would afford some support for Herman\u2019s evidence that he was of opinion that the revenue from parking would be greatly in excess of the amounts contemplated at the time the lease was negotiated and possession taken.\nThe appellant sought to establish the value of the leasehold interest by evidence to the effect that the rent reserved of 50 per cent. of the gross receipts from other than gasoline sales was substantially less than it would have been prepared to pay for such a lease on November 7, 1955, rather than be dispossessed. The lease provided that land taxes, except to such extent as they might be increased by improvements made by the lessee, were to be paid by the lessor. Taxes and other expenses incident to the operation of the business were payable by the lessee. The main expense of operating both the parking and service station businesses was for labour, this requiring the employment of three men. According to Herman, the cost of operation of such a property for labour does not increase in proportion to the increase of parking revenue and he said that it cost no more to operate the lot when it was producing a gross revenue of $3,000 a month from parking than it would have, had his original estimate of a revenue of about $1,500 a month from this source proved accurate. He said that no additional men were employed or required for the operation of the service station.\nThe lessor received no share of the revenue or profit derived from the sale of gasoline. The appellant had made a written agreement with the British American Oil Company for the use of equipment supplied by it, and the purchase of gasoline and oil at the current rate charged to retail dealers by that company in Toronto. Herman, however, said that before the appellant took possession of the property he had made an agreement with the oil company entitling it to purchase gasoline at .02cts less per gallon than the price defined in the written agreement. This arrangement was not apparently reduced to writing and while the witness Hodgins, an employee of the company, was called by the appellant, he said nothing about the matter. The arrangement apparently enabled the appellant to sell gasoline at .05cts less than the price current at the majority of other filling stations and, according to Herman, at a profit.\nHerman\u2019s evidence was that as of November 7, 1955, the appellant would have agreed to pay to the lessor 66\u2154 per cent. of the revenue derived from the property, other than from the sales of gasoline.\nMr. Murray Bosley, an experienced real estate agent and valuator living in Toronto, said that he considered from the standpoint of the lessee that a fair economic rent to pay for the property as of the relevant date was 65 per cent. of the parking revenue. The witness formed this opinion after considering figures supplied to him by the appellant as to the parking revenue and sales of gasoline during the period September 1, 1955, to May 31, 1956, and assuming the continuance of revenue at the level shown during the balance of the year.\nMr. Frederick Hotrom, who was shown to have some forty years\u2019 experience in the real estate business in Toronto, expressed the opinion that the rent reserved of 50 per cent. of the gross revenue was about normal, compared with that payable for other such lots in Toronto. He had not considered the possible revenue to be derived from the sale of gasoline but said that this would not affect his opinion. He was satisfied that Rotenberg would not rent the property for less than a rental that was fair to the lessor and appeared to be of the view that, since he had not stipulated for a share of the profit from sales of gasoline, he did not regard this as of importance. The witness, while of very long experience, had not theretofore had anything to do with leases and rent for parking purposes when the rental reserved was a percentage of the gross receipts and he had not considered the figures as to the receipts after November 7, 1955, in forming his opinion.\nMr. R.F. Heal, who had had an extensive experience in dealing in real estate in Toronto, was of the opinion that 50 per cent. of the gross revenue was practically a standard rate for leases of this nature and that the leasehold interest was of no value at the time of the expropriation. He considered, rightly in my opinion, that only the result of the operations up to that date were to be considered in deciding the value to the lessee. Dealing with gasoline sales, as these had been only at the rate of some 14,000 gallons in October 1955 and, assuming a continuance of this rate of sales, he did not consider that the business would be profitable and said that he could not understand how anyone could make money on such a turnover when selling gasoline at .05cts less than the current price.\nMr. John W. Walker, the general manager of the parking authority in the city of Toronto, had negotiated a large number of leases for the parking lots of his employer and showed that, when leased on a percentage basis, there was a considerable variation in the rent reserved. The city operated 40 of such lots and the witness showed that some rentals paid were less than 50 per cent. of the gross revenue and some exceeded that amount. It was apparently considered that the site in question was a desirable parking site as the purpose of the expropriation was to construct a parking garage having a capacity of several times that of the lot, as used by the appellant. The witness agreed that the higher the gross revenue the higher the percentage a lessee could afford to pay. He had not been asked to consider the rental value of the property in the light of the revenue derived after November 7, 1955.\nThe learned arbitrator, while referring to a passage of the judgment of Aylesworth J.A. in Bignall v. Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto[6], which dealt with the expropriation of a leasehold interest where that learned judge stated that the lessee was entitled to the value of the lease to him, that being the difference between what he is called upon to pay as rental and what he would be prepared as a reasonable man to pay rather than surrender possession of the premises, and to the further fact that there was a clause permitting the termination of the lease upon the conditions above referred to, computed the compensation by allowing the present value of the sum of what he considered to be the annual premium value of the lease throughout the balance of the ten year term. The arbitrator was apparently invited to determine the value of the lease to the appellant as of the date of the expropriation by considering, inter alia, the revenue derived from the property, both from parking and from the sale of gasoline up to a date some six months after November 7, 1955, and upon his estimate of its continuance at this high level during the balance of the term.\nDealing with the matter on this footing, he considered that the annual sales of gasoline would approximate 260,000 gallons and that the fair rental value of the premises for this purpose for which nothing was paid was .01\u00bc cts. per gallon, amounting to $3,250 annually. He estimated that the gross earnings from parking for the remaining period of the lease would average $36,301.20 a year, that a fair rental on this basis was 61 per cent of these gross figures and that, as the lease called for payment of only 50 per cent of such gross, the lease had a premium or added value for this purpose of $3,933.13. The total of these two estimates is $7,243.13.\nWhile the appellant did not undertake to estimate the gross annual profit which might be anticipated, sufficient evidence was adduced which, if accepted by the arbitrator, would tend to show that the annual profits reasonably to be expected would be in excess of the above mentioned sum.\nIn arriving at the present value of the lease to the appellant the arbitrator adopted a figure used by the witness Bosley, who had expressed the opinion that what the arbitrator referred to as the premium value of the lease per annum was $9,739.80 and took the sum of this difference for 8 years and 8 months, being the balance of the 10 year term as of the date the appellant gave up possession, and calculated that the present value of that sum was 6.29982 times the said annual premium value. The arbitrator, using this method of computation, multiplied the figure of $7,243.13 by 6.29982 thus arriving at a total figure of $45,630.41, to which was added 10 per cent for compulsory taking. The judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside this award and reduced the total compensation to $5,149.82 and allowed interest on that sum at 5 per cent. from January 7, 1957.\nAll of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that the rent reserved by the lease was the full rental value of the property for the purposes to which it was being put and that, accordingly, the lease had no market value. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario, while referring to the revenue from the operations of the property between November 1955 and May 1956, said that there was no evidence to indicate that the lease was worth more as a parking lot than at the date of the lease \u201cwhen the claimant puts its own valuation upon it.\u201d Roach J.A., referring to the fact disclosed by the evidence that both Rotenberg and Herman were shrewd and experienced business men and it was reasonable to conclude that when they finally settled upon the terms of the lease the claimant got no better bargain than anyone else could have got, considered that the rental value in the open market as of that date was thereby established.\nWhile, in my opinion, the award made by the arbitrator cannot be supported, I am unable with great respect to agree with the conclusions reached in the Court of Appeal or with the reasons advanced for those conclusions.\nIn Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister[7], Lord Moulton, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, after referring to the fact that at the hearing evidence of the prospective savings and additional profits had been put forward in support of a claim that the capitalized value of the increase in the profits of the business due to them should be added to the market value of the land in arriving at the compensation, said in part (p. 1088):\nThat which the appellants were entitled to receive was compensation not for the business profits or savings which they expected to make from the use of the land, but for the value of the land to them. No doubt the suitability of the land for the purpose of their special business affected the value of the land to them, and the prospective savings and additional profits which it could be shewn would probably attend the use of the land in their business furnished material for estimating what was the real value of the land to them. But that is a very different thing from saying that they were entitled to have the capitalized value of these savings and additional profits added to the market value of the land in estimating their compensation. They were only entitled to have them taken into consideration so far as they might fairly be said to increase the value of the land.\nThe learned arbitrator, having formed his estimate of what he considered to be the premium value of the lease, in determining the compensation to be paid in the manner above explained, apparently proceeded upon the basis that the annual profits from the property would at least be equal to these amounts in each year since, otherwise, the full benefit of this premium value would not be realized. To do this was to follow the course condemned by the Judicial Committee. Furthermore, while mentioning the provision for the earlier termination of the lease and saying that he regarded it as lessening its value, this appears to have been ignored in deciding the amount of the award.\nA further material matter which would, of necessity, affect the judgment of the appellant in deciding what amount it would pay rather than be dispossessed was the amount of income tax which would be levied upon its profits. During the cross-examination of Herman he was asked as to the annual income of the appellant, to which he replied that he did not know at what point in 1955 the company \u201creached $20,000\u201d and said that he did not have the income tax statement there. The matter was not further mentioned in the evidence and, from the fact that it was not mentioned in the reasons for the award, it was presumably not argued before the arbitrator. It is to be remembered that the appellant operates some 65 to 70 filling stations in Toronto and elsewhere and, accepting Herman\u2019s evidence as to the expected profit from the operation of the property in question, it may properly be assumed that the total net income from all of the company\u2019s operations would be greatly in excess of $20,000 during the years when the lease continued in effect. Corporation incomes in excess of that amount were subject to tax in the amount of $3,600 plus 45 per cent. of the amount by which the amount taxable exceeded $20,000, a rate which applied also to the taxation years 1957 and 1958. In 1959 the percentage rate mentioned applied to incomes in excess of $25,000. It would obviously be only the net income that would be considered by a lessee in deciding what amount it could prudently pay rather than be dispossessed.\nIn my opinion, it is made clear by the evidence in this matter that the lot in question was, due to its location, a very valuable one for public parking and that the appellant, by reason of its long experience, could utilize its natural advantages to the fullest extent. It was shown that the business activities carried on in the vicinity of the property attracted large numbers of persons who required parking facilities. The property was expropriated by the city for that purpose, the evidence disclosing that after possession was taken a garage having six times the parking capacity of the bare lot was erected upon the property. The fact that the appellant was skilled in the operation of such a business is not a factor to be disregarded in estimating the value of the lease to it and, in my opinion, the evidence supports the view taken by the arbitrator that the business done would, in all probability, have exceeded very considerably that contemplated both by the lessor and by Herman when the lease was executed in 1954.\nThe parking receipts for September and October were between $1,200 and $1,300 in excess of the amount necessary to pay the minimum rent reserved by the lease of $770 a month and exceeded Herman\u2019s estimate by more than $1,000 a month. As the lessee was entitled to half of the gross revenue from parking it was thus assured a gross monthly return of roughly $1,400 which would yield an additional $500 a month gross profit if that figure could be maintained. The lessee might further reasonably anticipate, in my opinion, that the arrangement which enabled it to sell gasoline at such a considerable discount would attract added custom for the parking facilities. Herman was not experienced in the operation of filling stations, according to his evidence, up to the time that this lease was negotiated. The sales for the portion of the month of September in which the filling station was operated and for the month of October were small, only totalling some 6,600 gallons. Herman said that he anticipated that the filling station would operate at a profit and that its operation would not increase the cost of labour for the operation of the parking lot. There is, however, nothing in the admissible evidence to support the arbitrator\u2019s estimate of average annual sales of 260,000 gallons. The evidence given by Herman to the effect that the greater the revenue to be derived from parking the larger percentage of the gross revenue could be paid as rent is supported by the evidence of the witness Walker, and the learned arbitrator has accepted the evidence that for a lease of property producing a gross revenue from parking of $3,000 a percentage of 61 per cent. was a fair rental at the time.\nI do not think that this is a case which should be sent back for rehearing by the arbitrator since it appears to me that there is no further evidence relevant to the point to be decided that could be adduced. Upon the evidence in the record it is my opinion that a prudent person in the position of the appellant would have paid a sum of $10,000 rather than be dispossessed, plus the amount expended for improving the property as to which I would adopt the figure accepted by the Court of Appeal of $3,590.75.\nI would allow this appeal with costs in this Court and direct that the respondent pay to the appellant the sum of $13,590.75 and, in addition, 10 per cent thereof for forceable taking, and interest on these amounts since January 7, 1957.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[8] pronounced on July 2, 1959, allowing an appeal by the City of Toronto from an award made by Harold W. Timmins, Esquire, Q.C., an official arbitrator, dated February 24, 1958, fixing the compensation payable to the appellant for its leasehold interest in a parcel of land in downtown Toronto expropriated by the respondent for municipal purposes.\nBy the award the compensation payable to the appellant was fixed at $50,193.45 plus interest and costs. By the judgment of the Court of Appeal this was reduced to $5,149.82 plus interest and costs. There does not appear to have been any difference of opinion between the learned arbitrator and the members of the Court of Appeal as to the principle to be applied in fixing the compensation. All accepted as accurate the statement of Aylesworth J.A. in Bignall v. The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto[9]:\nIt is clear that the only element to be taken into consideration is the value to the owner of the land expropriated. That means in the case of a lessee such as the present respondent, that the value for which he is to receive compensation is the value of the lease to him. The value of the lease to him, in my view, is the difference between what he is called upon to pay as rental and what he would be prepared, as a reasonable man, actually to pay rather than surrender possession of the premises.\nOn the argument before us, I did not understand counsel to question either the accuracy of this statement or, subject to the effect of the sale clause to be mentioned hereafter, its applicability to the case at bar.\nThe demised premises were owned by one Minnie Rotenberg. The negotiations leading to the making of the lease were carried on in August 1954, at which time the premises were in the possession of a tenant under a lease expiring on August 31, 1955. On behalf of the owner the negotiations were conducted by Mr. Louis Rotenberg, hereinafter referred to as Rotenberg, and on behalf of the appellant by its president Mr. W.B. Herman, hereinafter referred to as Herman. It is common ground that both of these persons are shrewd and experienced business men.\nA formal lease was executed; it is dated August 17, 1954, and is for a term of ten years to be computed from September 1, 1955, on which date the appellant was to be given possession. The appellant went into possession early in September 1955 and commenced selling gasoline on September 14, 1955.\nOn November 7, 1955, the respondent passed a by-law expropriating the lands in question for municipal purposes, and it is as of that date that the compensation is to be fixed.\nThe parcel expropriated is of an irregular shape having a frontage on Dundas Square, its south boundary, of 121 feet 9 inches, a frontage on Victoria Street, its east boundary, of 58 feet 11 inches, a frontage on Dundas Street East, its north-east boundary, of 148 feet 3\u00bd inches and a frontage on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Lane, its west boundary, of 148 feet 3\u00bd inches. On the south-west portion of the expropriated parcel stood a two-storey brick building having a frontage of 18 feet on Dundas Square and 89 feet on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Lane. The land leased to the appellant consisted of the whole of the expropriated parcel except the part occupied by this brick building. It is clear from the description of the demised lands in the lease that the portion occupied by the brick building was not included and this was confirmed by Mr. Herman\u2019s evidence. The learned arbitrator appears to have been under the impression that it was included and the terms of paragraph 3 of the lease, to be referred to later, seem inconsistent with the view that it was excluded. However, nothing seems to turn upon this and neither counsel made any point of the provision in paragraph 3 referring to this building.\nWhile the expropriating by-law was passed on November 7, 1955, the appellant was permitted to remain in possession and to continue to operate its business until January 7, 1957; but it was a condition of this permission that in arbitration proceedings to fix the compensation to which it was entitled the appellant should not make use of any statements as to its earnings subsequent to May 31, 1956.\nThe rent payable was set out in paragraph 2 and part of paragraph 3 of the lease as follows:\n2. YIELDING AND PAYING THEREFOR unto the Lessor, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, yearly and every year during the said term a rental equivalent to 50 per centum (50%) of the amount of the gross receipts (as hereinafter defined) in each year, but in no event shall the minimum annual rental hereunder be less than the sum of $9,240.00 which rental shall be payable $770.00 monthly in advance on the first day of each and every month commencing September 1st, 1955 and the balance of any rental, if any, which may become owing shall be ascertained and paid as hereinafter provided.\n3. The term \u201cgross receipts\u201d shall include the gross receipts of each year from the following sources:\n(a) All revenue derived from parking of automobiles and motor trucks on the demised premises.\n(b) All rent revenue which the lessee may derive from the second floor of the building on the demised premises.\n(c) All revenue derived from the leasing of billboards, taxi stalls and telephone booths and any other rental revenue which the Lessee shall derive by virtue of its use of the demised premises. The gross receipts shall not include the revenue derived from the first floor of the building on the demised premises and shall not include the receipts derived from the operation of the service station on the demised premises.\n* * *\nFor the purpose of calculating rental, any Dominion, Provincial or Municipal taxes which the Lessee or other occupant of the demised premises is required to collect from its customers shall not be included as gross receipts.\nWe were informed by counsel that clauses (b) and (c) of paragraph 3, quoted above, are of no importance.\nThe lease contained a provision that if at any time during the term the lessor should receive a bona fide offer to purchase the demised premises which she wished to accept she should give the lessee 10 days\u2019 notice of her intention to accept and if within that period the lessee made an identical offer she would accept the offer of the lessee but if the lessee failed to make such an offer the lessor would be free to accept the first mentioned offer and have the right to require the lessee to vacate upon 90 days\u2019 notice after the completion of the sale. In the event of the lessee being required to vacate under this clause it was provided that the lessor should repay the cost of repairs and improvements made by the lessee to the demised premises and the costs of paving the lot but in no event was the lessor to be liable to repay more than $5000 if possession were taken during the first year of the term, $4000 if possession were taken during the second year of the term, $3000 if possession were taken during the third year of the term, $2000 if possession were taken during the fourth year of the term, $1000 if possession were taken during the fifth year of the term. If possession was taken thereafter no repayment was to be made to the lessee.\nAt the date of the lease there was on the demised premises a stucco service station building in a poor state of repair to the east of which was a gasolene pump \u201cisland\u201d on which were two pumps. The terms of the lease to the former tenant are not in evidence. The business carried on on the premises by the former tenant was that of a parking lot and a service station selling Supertest gasolene; there is little evidence as to what revenue he in fact derived from either of these activities but there is evidence that at the time of negotiating the lease Herman believed that the former tenant\u2019s operations had not been very successful, that his sales of gasolene had amounted to about 40,000 gals. a year, that the rental paid to Mrs. Rotenberg was substantially less than the $770 a month which was to be the minimum rental under the lease to the appellant and that in view of the results under the former lease Rotenberg thought he was making a \u201cvery good deal\u201d with the appellant.\nIn the course of the negotiations for the lease Rotenberg asked for an estimate of the appellant\u2019s probable receipts and Herman\u2019s evidence as to this is as follows:\nQ. At the time you negotiated that lease were you making forecasts of what you might make on it? A. We were at Mr. Rotenberg\u2019s request, because he was interested in knowing what he might earn with his fifty percent.\nQ. And did you give him some estimates of yours before you signed the lease?\u2014A. Yes, we did, sir.\nQ. What did you estimate? A. Well, we estimated and we told him we thought it would gross at least fifteen hundred dollars a month, and that is why we were quite prepared to guarantee seven hundred and seventy dollars a month.\nQ. That is where the figure in the lease comes in? A. Yes. It was originally seven hundred and fifty. I don\u2019t know where the other twenty came in, and we thought we could probably gross as high as seventeen or eighteen hundred, and in the last months of the year, which was the fall of the year, there was a chance we might reach two thousand, which would give him a rent of a thousand dollars a month.\nQ. And on that basis the two of you agreed on the terms of this lease in August, nineteen fifty-four? A. Yes, sir.\nHerman testified that he understood that Rotenberg attached little significance to the operation of the service station; his actual words were:\n... and he (Rotenberg) furthermore knew, Mr. Campbell, that his previous tenant had not sold enough gasoline to\u2014to use the vernacular\u2014to put in your left eye, and he didn\u2019t think that we would either, so he didn\u2019t attach very much importance to the gasoline business.\nHerman\u2019s evidence as to his own view as to this at the time of entering into the lease is as follows:\nQ. What do you pay for this service station on subject lot\u2014did you pay? A. We paid nothing.\nQ. You paid nothing for it? A. Yes.\nQ. The rent for that lot\u2014did the fact that you were getting that service station thrown in influence you in your tender and the amount of rent that you agreed on? A. As I told you earlier, I didn\u2019t attach too much importance or rate very highly the possible gasoline volume in that location at the time I entered into my lease with Mr. Rotenberg; and it is difficult for me to say to what extent I was influenced. I think I probably would have made the same deal with Mr. Rotenberg even if there hadn\u2019t been a service station on that lot.\nQ. You say you would? A. I think I would have. You see, I had what appeared to be a profitable operation without the service station\u2014just running a parking lot. I wasn\u2019t sure at the time I went in whether\u2014I didn\u2019t know what the service station would bring.\nThe learned arbitrator, in his reasons for the award, after an elaborate examination of the evidence made the following findings of fact: (i) that the appellant had in fact made a \u201cgood deal\u201d; (ii) that the revenues both from parking and the operation of the gasolene station went far beyond what the previous operators of the lot had been able to achieve; (iii) that this great increase of revenue was due largely to the skilful management of the appellant; (iv) that a substantial increase in the amount of gasolene sold would tend to some extent to reduce the gross revenue from parking; (v) that the lot was a small one as parking lots go and that its best use at the date of the by-law was that which was being made of it, i.e., \u201ca small transient service station and a parking lot\u201d; (vi) that the future of the business was subject to hazards and uncertainties such as competition from other parking lots and service stations which might be opened in the vicinity and the possibility of alteration in traffic and parking regulations by municipal by-laws; (vii) that the sale clause was a detriment to the lease; (viii) that the gross parking revenue for the balance of the term of the lease to be reasonably anticipated at the date of the by-law was $36,301.20 a year; and (ix) that the amount of the annual sales of gasolene for the balance of the term to be reasonably anticipated at the date of the by-law was 260,000 gallons.\nThe learned arbitrator went on to find that a reasonable lessee in the position of the appellant at the date of the by-law would have been prepared to agree to pay a rental of 61 per cent. of the gross parking revenue and 1\u00bc cents per gallon of gasolene sold rather than surrender possession of the demised premises.\nI have read all the record with care and, in my opinion, the above findings are all supported by the evidence. The estimates of gross parking revenue and of sales of gasolene made by the learned referee are substantially less than those made in the testimony of Herman who said he would have been prepared to pay a rental of 1\u00bd cents per gallon of gasolene and more than 66\u2154 per cent of the gross parking revenue rather than give up possession; but I think it clear from reading the whole record that the learned arbitrator regarded Herman as an honest and truthful witness.\nHaving made the above findings the learned arbitrator arrived at the amount of compensation by the following calculation:\n61 per cent of estimated annual parking revenue of $36,301.20\n\u2014\n22,143.73\n50 per cent of estimated annual parking revenue of 36,301.20\n\u2014\n18,150.60\nDifference\n3,993.13\n1\u00bc cents per gal. on estimated annual sale of 260,000 gallons\n3,250.00\nTotal\n$7,243.13\nTaking $7,243.13 as the difference between the annual rental payable under the lease and that which a prudent lessee would have been willing to pay, the present value of this difference as of January 7, 1957, calculated over the period from the date of giving up possession to the date of expiration of the lease, i.e., from January 7, 1957, to August 31, 1965, was arrived at by applying the factor of 6.29982 which brings out the result of $45,630.41. On the assumption that the other figures arrived at by the learned arbitrator were correct counsel did not question the correctness of the factor mentioned.\nThe learned arbitrator added 10 per cent. for compulsory taking and awarded as total compensation $50,193.45 with interest from January 7, 1957.\nIn the Court of Appeal the learned Chief Justice of Ontario was of opinion that there was no evidence that the rental value of the premises at the date of expropriation was more than the rent reserved in the lease, and Roach J.A. said in part:\nThe claimant contended that, quite apart from the improvements, the actual rental value was considerably greater than the rental reserved by the lease because it got this lease at a bargain price or as Mr. Herman put it,\u2014he got a \u201cgood deal\u201d. The learned official arbitrator gave effect to that contention; I would not. In his reasons he said: \u201cThe evidence of Mr. W.B. Herman, President of City Parking Limited, is that the claimant company has been in the parking business in Toronto and elsewhere for ten or twelve years and that they have had wide experience in the parking business and in the negotiating of leases and purchase of properties for parking stations.\u201d Mr. Rotenberg, who negotiated the lease on behalf of his wife, the owner, was also a shrewd, keen and experienced businessman. He was not likely to lease the lot to the claimant for a rental less than he could get from someone else on the open market at that time. He and Mr. Herman dealt at arms\u2019 length each unquestionably attempting to get on behalf of those whom he represented, the best possible terms. I think it is reasonable to conclude that when they finally settled on the terms of the lease, the claimant got no better bargain than anyone else could have got. The rental value on the open market as of that date, expressed in terms of a percentage of \u201cgross receipts\u201d with a guaranteed minimum, was thereby established. This is the cogent and compelling evidence to which I earlier referred. That value was increased only by the improvements that the claimant made.\nWith great respect, these observations appear to me to overlook the facts, (i) that by the date of the passing of the expropriating by-law it had already become apparent that the revenues to be derived from parking were greatly in excess of the estimates made by Herman and communicated to Rotenberg at the time of the making of the lease, and (ii) that the evidence as to the sales of gasolene made up to the end of May, 1956, shewed that the revenues from that source would greatly exceed those obtained by the former tenant. The preponderance of the evidence was to the effect that, generally speaking, the greater the gross parking revenue the greater will be the percentage thereof charged as rental. There was uncontradicted evidence that even if the appellant were obligated to pay a rental of 1\u00bd cents per gallon of gasolene sold sales of gasolene of the annual volume found by the learned arbitrator to be probable would yield a substantial profit; it is true that this was to some extent dependent on the favourable arrangement as to price which the appellant had made with the company from which it purchased its gasolene but there was evidence that this arrangement was likely to continue.\nIn determining what rental a prudent man in the position of the appellant would have agreed to pay at the date of expropriation rather than give up possession of the demised premises it was necessary for the learned arbitrator to decide, amongst other things, what estimate as to the revenues which would probably be derived in the future during the currency of the lease would be made by that prudent man. In doing this, he was, in my opinion, entitled to consider the evidence of the actual parking revenues and sales of gasolene up to May 31, 1956. It appears from the whole record that the parties made it a term of the agreement under which the appellant remained in possession of the expropriated premises up to January 7, 1957, that in any arbitration proceedings evidence might be given of earnings up to May 31, 1956, but not of earnings subsequent to that date. In civil cases the rules of evidence may be relaxed by consent or contract of the parties; (vide the cases collected in Phipson on Evidence, 9th edition, p. 8).\nIn this case, the agreement of the parties relieves us of the task of deciding whether in the absence of any agreement evidence of the revenues actually derived from the demised premises during the period that the appellant remained in possession would have been admissible. Had it become necessary to decide that question, careful consideration would have had to be given to the judgment of the House of Lords in Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries (1891) Limited v. Pontypridd Waterworks Company[10], and to the comments made thereon by Lord MacMillan, in Lincolnshire Sugar Co. v. Smart[11].\nIn my opinion the findings of fact made by the learned arbitrator which I have set out above were supported by the admissible evidence and should not have been disturbed, and I would have been of opinion that the final result at which he arrived was a proper one if the lease had been for a term certain of ten years.\nI have, however, reached the conclusion that the learned arbitrator did not attach sufficient weight to the existence of the sale clause in the lease. Having arrived at the increased rental which a prudent lessee would have been prepared to agree to pay rather than give up possession it was next necessary for the learned arbitrator to convert the difference between that rental and the rental reserved in the lease into a lump sum. This involved a calculation factors in which would be the rate of percentage to be used and the time which the lease had to run. The last mentioned of these factors was, by reason of the sale clause, uncertain; it might well continue to August 31, 1965; it might equally well terminate in a little over ninety days. The evidence as to the probability of the lessor receiving an acceptable offer to purchase the property is understandably scanty, but Herman says in his evidence that it is true of most of the appellant\u2019s rented lots that there is a scheme to build on them in the future, that the rented lots they have lost in the past have usually been lost because someone decided to build on them or because they were sold and that \u201cthe casualty rate in regard to those lots is large\u201d. Against this is to be set Herman\u2019s evidence that the appellant was in a financial position to meet an offer made to purchase the property and purchased many of its lots; but if the appellant purchased the lot pursuant to the sale clause the lease would none the less be at an end, and, as is pointed out in the reasons of the Court of Appeal, there was no reason to suppose that the appellant would acquire the lot in this way for less than its full market value.\nIn view of this uncertainty as to how long the lease would have continued in force I find the question as to what lump sum should be awarded an extremely difficult one to answer but have reached the conclusion that this should be fixed at one half of the amount fixed by the learned arbitrator. If this amount is awarded the reasons of the learned arbitrator for not awarding any additional amounts for the improvements made by the appellant will still be applicable and I agree with those reasons.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and direct that the order of the Court of Appeal be varied to provide that the contestant do pay to the claimant the sum of $25,096.73 together with interest thereon at 5 per cent per annum from January 7, 1957, as full compensation for the lands taken including all damage suffered by the claimant by reason of the expropriation; the order of the Court of Appeal as to the costs in that Court and of the proceedings before the Official Arbitrator should stand; the appellant is entitled to its costs in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, LOCKE and CARTWRIGHT JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter, Weir & Boeckh, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.G.

Respondent.\n1960: October 31; November 1; 1961: March 27.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Excise tax\u2014Tax paid on \"mouton\" under protest\u2014Product not taxable\u2014Petition of right to recover amounts\u2014Whether paid under mistake of law or fact\u2014Whether under duress or compulsion\u2014Whether refund provisions of statute applicable\u2014The Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, ss. 80A, 105(5) and 105(6) (Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, ss. 24(1) [repealed in 1954], 46(5) and 46(6)).\nThe respondent company was engaged in the business of processing sheepskins into \"mouton\". From March 30, 1950, to January 29, 1952, it was compelled to pay excise tax on this product which was considered to be a fur under the Excise Tax Act. After being threatened with the cancellation of its licence, the respondent paid the tax demanded \"under protest\", and its cheques were so marked. In 1956, it was decided by this Court in Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Ltd. v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 632, that mouton was not a fur and therefore not subject to excise tax. In October 1957, by petition of right, the respondent sought to recover the moneys paid under protest. The petition was granted by the Exchequer Court of Canada. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. dissenting): The respondent was entitled to recover from the Crown the amounts paid as taxes.\nPer Taschereau and Cartwright JJ.: The refund provisions of the Excise Tax Act, which refer to taxes imposed by the Act, paid or overpaid by \"mistake of law or fact\", did not apply since the amounts were not paid by mistake of law or fact. The evidence was clear that there was on the part of the officers of the respondent no error of law. The failure of the respondent to make an application for refund within the time limit specified in the Act was not, therefore, a bar to the present proceedings. The true reason why the payments were made under protest was that the respondent wished to continue its business and feared that it would be \"closed\". The payments were not prompted by the desire to discharge a legal obligation, or to settle definitely a contested claim. The pressure which was exercised was sufficient to negative the expression of free will of the respondent's officers. It flowed from the circumstances of this case that the respondent clearly intended to keep alive its right to recover the sum paid.\nThe consent not having been legally and freely given, an essential requisite to the validity of the payment was therefore lacking. Moreover, art. 998 of the Civil Code applied as the respondent, who did not owe any money to the Crown, was unjustly and illegally threatened in order to obtain its consent. Per Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The payments were not voluntary payments, but involuntary payments made because of fear of the serious consequences threatened. Under the general law, and more particularly under art. 998 of the Civil Code, the respondent had the right, in the circumstances of this case, to recover the moneys paid. This right was not barred in the present instance by any of the statutory provisions of the Excise Tax Act. The refund provisions, contained in s. 105(6) of this Act, had no application as they apply only where the refund claimed is for moneys paid under a mistake of law or fact. Nor was s. 105(5) applicable, since the refund was not for taxes imposed by this Act but for moneys exacted without legal justification.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J., dissenting: The payments implied a reservation by the respondent of its right to claim repayment of the amounts paid. In the circumstances here, they also implied a doubt on its part as to its right to recover these amounts. The payments clearly fell within the terms of s. 46(6) of the Act. The amounts paid were claimed by the Crown as taxes due by the respondent, were accepted and dealt with by the Department as such, and it was not possible to limit the operation of s. 46(6) to claims for the repayment of taxes validly imposed.\nAssuming that duress was raised or argued in the Court below, in any event, these payments were not so made by the respondent. The respondent paid the tax claimed in the mistaken belief that it was obliged to do so. The respondent paid the amount claimed as tax because it found it expedient to do so, and not under duress or through fear within the meaning of arts. 994 et seq. of the Code.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Fournier J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, granting a petition of right. Appeal dismissed, Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J. dissenting.\nPaul Ollivier, for the appellant.\nRoch Pinard, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Abbott J. was delivered by\nAbbott J. (dissenting):\u2014Respondent is a processor of sheepskins, and during a period between March 1950 and January 1952, was engaged in the city of Montreal, in processing such skins into what are known in the trade as mouton products, which in their finished state closely resemble certain types of fur such as beaver or seal.\nDuring the period referred to, respondent paid to the Department of National Revenue, as tax claimed on the processing of sheepskins into mouton products, sums totalling $24,681. These amounts were claimed by the Department under the provisions of s. 80A of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, as amended (now R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, s. 24), which imposes an excise tax calculated upon the current market value of \"all dressed furs, dyed furs, and dressed and dyed furs \u2026 dressed, dyed, or dressed and dyed in Canada, payable by the dresser or dyer at the time of delivery by him\".\nThe said payments, totalling $24,681, were so paid by respondent by means of cheques bearing on the back thereof, in almost every case, such words as \"paid under protest\" or \"tax paid under protest\", and the total amount so paid is not in issue. No further objection, verbal or written, was made to payment of the tax claimed until the present proceedings were taken some five years later. These payments \"under protest\" implied a reservation by respondent of its right to claim repayment of the amounts paid. In the circumstances here, in my view, they also implied a doubt on the part of respondent as to its right to recover these amounts.\nThe circumstances under which these payments were thus made were found by the learned trial judge2 to have been as follows:\nLorsque la requ\u00e9rante commen\u00e7a ses op\u00e9rations, en 1950, elle re\u00e7ut la visite de deux inspecteurs du minist\u00e8re qui venaient faire l'\u00e9valuation ou l'estimation de ces marchandises pour fin d'imposition de la taxe d'accise. Il y eut discussion entre les inspecteurs et un repr\u00e9sentant de la requ\u00e9rante. Ce dernier a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que les peaux de mouton n'\u00e9taient pas soumises \u00e0 la taxe d'accise sur les fourrures. L'inspecteur lui aurait r\u00e9pondu \"qu'il fallait payer cette taxe, que c'\u00e9tait la loi\".\u2014S'il faut payer, nous paierons sous-prot\u00eat.\" \"Tr\u00e8s bien, payez comme vous voudrez, mais payez.\" L'inspecteur se rappelle avoir discut\u00e9 avec les repr\u00e9sentants de la requ\u00e9rante, mais il ne peut se souvenir si ces derniers lui ont dit que la taxe n'\u00e9tait pas exigible. Toutefois, vers ce temps-l\u00e0, il avait entendu dire par des personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans l'industrie et le commerce de fourrures que les peaux de mouton s\u00e9ch\u00e9es, appr\u00eat\u00e9es et transform\u00e9es n'\u00e9taient pas imposables.\nUn autre directeur de la requ\u00e9rante a souvent pris part aux discussions avec les officiers du minist\u00e8re. Il pr\u00e9tend qu'il y \u00e9tait question des \u00e9valuations et cotisations et de la taxe. D\u00e8s les d\u00e9buts, les paiements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits sous prot\u00eat parce que la requ\u00e9rante croyait que les peaux de mouton appr\u00eat\u00e9es n'\u00e9taient pas des fourrures et qu'elles \u00e9taient, par cons\u00e9quent, non imposables. Les gens du m\u00e9tier partageaient cette opinion. M\u00eame les inspecteurs auraient entendu des remarques \u00e0 ce sujet.\nA la suite de ces discussions et apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que ses permis pourraient \u00eatre annul\u00e9s si elle ne se conformait pas \u00e0 la loi, la requ\u00e9rante d\u00e9cida de payer les montants cotis\u00e9s, mais par ch\u00e8ques endoss\u00e9s \"Taxe pay\u00e9e sous prot\u00eat\" ou \"Pay\u00e9 sous prot\u00eat\". La requ\u00e9rante a produit une liasse de ch\u00e8ques comme pi\u00e8ce P-1, lesquels portent l'endos susdit, sauf quelques exceptions. D'ailleurs, l'intim\u00e9e dans sa d\u00e9fense admet que le montant pay\u00e9 par la requ\u00e9rante pour taxe, du 30 mars 1950 au 29 janvier 1952, s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 $24,681.\nIn April 1953 an action\u2014apparently in the nature of a test case\u2014was brought in the Exchequer Court in which the Crown claimed from Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Limited, a sum of $573.08 as taxes under s. 80A of the Excise Tax Act, together with certain penalties. The purpose of this litigation appears to have been to determine whether the product described as \"mouton\" was to be considered as a fur, and therefore subject to tax under the Act. That question was decided in the affirmative in the Exchequer Court in 1954: The Queen v. Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Limited3, but on June 11, 1956, that judgment was reversed by this Court: Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Limited v. The Queen4. More than a year later, on October 8, 1957, respondent instituted these proceedings, to recover the amounts paid by it as aforesaid.\nBefore this Court it was conceded by counsel for appellant that, in view of the decision rendered in The Queen v. Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Limited, supra, the respondent was not legally liable for the amounts paid by it, and the sole question in issue here is as to the right of respondent to be reimbursed the amounts so paid. The relevant statutory provision is subs. 6 of s. 46 of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, which reads as follows:\n(6) If any person, whether by mistake of law or fact, has paid or overpaid to Her Majesty, any moneys which have been taken to account, as taxes imposed by this Act, such moneys shall not be refunded unless application has been made in writing within two years after such moneys were paid or overpaid.\nThe learned trial judge found that the payments made by appellant were so made in error, but that s. 46 had no application because it applied only in the case of the payment of taxes validly imposed. Relying upon the provisions of the Civil Code and more particularly upon arts. 1047 and 1048 he maintained the petition of right and declared respondent entitled to recover the sum of $24,681. With respect, I am unable to agree with the finding that s. 46(6) had no application. In my view, the payments made by respondent clearly fall within the terms of that section. The amounts paid were claimed by the Crown as taxes due by respondent, were accepted and dealt with by the Department as such, and with great respect for the view expressed by the learned trial judge, I am unable to limit the operation of the said section to claims for the repayment of taxes validly imposed. Moreover, I think it is clear from the decision of this Court in The Queen v. Beaver Lamb and Shearling Co. Ltd.5, that no such limitation exists.\nBefore this Court, counsel for respondent also urged that the payments in question were made under duress and for that reason recoverable. This ground does not appear to have been raised or argued in the Court below, and I question whether it is open to respondent on the pleadings. However, in any event, I am satisfied that these payments were not so made by respondent. As found by the learned trial judge: \u00abSa d\u00e9cision de payer r\u00e9sulte du fait que les autorit\u00e9s l'ont convaincue que c'\u00e9tait la loi et qu'elle a craint de voir ses op\u00e9rations industrielles et commerciales mises en danger.\u00bb\nWhether or not mouton products were liable to tax as fur under section 80A of the Excise Tax Act, remained in doubt until judgment was rendered by this Court in the Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Limited case, supra, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court which had held that they were so liable, and in my opinion the respondent paid the tax claimed in the mistaken belief that it was obliged to do so.\nThere is no doubt that the officers of the Department were in good faith in claiming payment of the tax from respondent and the trial judge so found. They were doing no more than their duty in insisting upon payment of a tax, which they believed to be exigible from respondent as well as from all other like processors. To have allowed those who were unwilling to pay, to postpone or avoid payment of the tax, while receiving payment from those who did not dispute liability, would have been manifestly unfair, since it is a reasonable inference that those who paid would be obliged to try to recover the tax paid in the resale price of the finished product.\nThe distinction made in the common law between a voluntary payment which is not recoverable and an involuntary payment which is, does not exist in the civil law of Quebec. Under art. 1047 of the Civil Code, he who receives what is not due to him through error of law or of fact is bound to restore it. Generally speaking, the payment of any sum claimed as tax is made under compulsion of the taxing statute which usually contains an appropriate penalty for non-payment, and in my opinion respondent paid the amount claimed as tax here because it found it expedient to do so, under the circumstances found by the learned trial judge, and not under duress or through fear within the meaning of arts. 994 et seq. of the Civil Code. At any time within two years after the payments were made, appellant could have taken advantage of the provisions of s. 46(6) of the Excise Tax Act and made written application for a refund of the amounts so paid. It failed to do so and first claimed repayment some five years later, when it instituted these proceedings.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the petition of right with costs throughout.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014During the relevant periods, the respondent was engaged in the processing of raw sheepskins which it transformed into finished mouton skins and shearling. It alleges in its petition that from March 30, 1950, to January 29, 1952, it was called upon and forced to pay to the Department of National Revenue a total excise tax amounting to $25,269.76, which it did not owe. It was its contention that sheepskins, as processed and sold to its clients, were not subject to the excise tax claimed by the appellant. The Exchequer Court6 allowed the petition and held that the respondent had the right to claim from the appellant $24,681 with costs. The tax is imposed by the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, s. 24 (formerly R.S.C. 1927, c. 179, s. 80A) which reads as follows:\n1. There shall be imposed, levied and collected, an excise tax equal to fifteen per cent of the current market value of all dressed furs, dyed furs and dressed and dyed furs,\u2014\n(i) imported into Canada, payable by the importer or transferee of such goods before they are removed from the custody of the proper customs officer; or\n(ii) dressed, dyed, or dressed and dyed in Canada, payable by the dresser or dyer at the time of delivery by him.\nIn Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Limited v. The Queen7, it was held that sheepskin cannot be described as a fur, and that therefore, in that case, s. 80A of the Excise Tax Act could not find its application. In the present case, the appellant admits that mouton is not a fur and that no tax is payable on the processing of sheepskin into mouton products. The grounds on which the appellant relies are the following, with which I will presently deal.\nIt is first submitted on behalf of the appellant that the respondent is barred from claiming any refund as it failed to make any application in writing within two years after the moneys were paid or overpaid. (Section 46, para. 6 of the Act, 1952 R.S.C., c. 100). This section applies, when the payment has been made by mistake of law or fact, but I do not think that such is the case here. The officers of the company were not mistaken as to the law or the facts. They had been in the fur business since many years, and it was in 1950 that they commenced the processing of raw sheepskins.\nWhen they started that business, they immediately received the visit of two inspectors of the Excise Department, with whom they had numerous discussions in the course of which they continuously maintained that mouton was not a fur, and therefore not subject to the tax. After being told that they would be \"closed up\" if they did not pay, they decided, with the agreement of the inspectors, to pay \"under protest\". This was done from March 23, 1950, until September 7, 1951, and all the fifty-eight cheques were endorsed \"paid under protest\" or \"tax paid under protest\". The evidence is clear to me that there was on the part of the officers of the company no error of law. They had the conviction that they did not owe the tax, and their numerous discussions with the departmental officers, and the payments made under protest, negative any suggestion of a mistake of law.\nAt that time, other firms engaged in the same business as the respondent had contested the validity of this tax and had refused to pay it. A test case was made, and a few years later this Court, in Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Ltd. v. The Queen8, held that the tax was not payable. The respondent's officers were aware of the position taken by the others operating in the same field, and of their refusal to comply with the request of the Department. When the respondent finally decided to pay under protest, I am quite satisfied that it was not because the officers were mistaken as to the law; they were fully aware of their legal position, and had repeatedly set forth their contentions to the Department's officers from the beginning of the discussions in 1950. There being no mistake of law or fact, s. 46(6) does not apply, and therefore the failure by the respondent to give a written notice is not a bar to the present proceedings.\nI do not agree with the trial judge who says in his reasons, although he allows the claim, that the respondent paid as a result of a mistake of law. The respondent is not bound by this pronouncement, and is of course entitled to have the judgment upheld for reasons other than those given in the Court below. The true reason why the payments were made under protest, is that the respondent wished to continue its business and feared that if it did not follow the course that it adopted, it would be \"closed\". Eli Abramson, one of the officers of the respondent says in his evidence:\nQ. What were you told by the officers of the Department with whom you were discussing this?\nA. Well, they told me I have to pay the tax. So, I says, 'Why do I have to pay the tax?' They said 'If you don't pay the tax we will close you up, because that is the law, and you must pay the tax.'\nThis statement is not denied by the two inspectors who were called as witnesses. Instead of seeing their business ruined, which would have been the inevitable result of their refusal to pay this illegal levy, they preferred, as there was no other alternative, to comply with the threatening summons of the inspectors. As Abramson says: \"Well, if I have to pay, I feel I am going to pay it under protest\". This is what was done, and I am satisfied that the payments made were not prompted by the desire to discharge a legal obligation, or to settle definitely a contested claim. The pressure that was exercised is sufficient, I think, to negative the expression of the free will of the respondent's officers, with the result that the alleged agreement to pay the tax has no legal effect and may be avoided. The payment was not made voluntarily to close the transaction. Vide Maskell v. Horner9, also Atlee v. Backhouse10, Knutson v. Bourkes Syndicate11, The Municipality of the City and County of St. John et al. v. Fraser-Brace Overseas Corporation et al12 As it was said in Valpy v. Manley13, the payment was made for the purpose of averting the threatened evil, and not with the intention of giving up a right, but with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand. The threats and the payments made under protest support this contention of the respondent. Vide: The City of London v. London Club Ltd.14. Of course, the mere fact that the payment was made \"under protest\" is not conclusive but, when all the circumstances of the case are considered, it flows that the respondent clearly intended to keep alive its right to recover the sum paid. Vide supra.\nIn Her Majesty the Queen v. Beaver Lamb and Shearling Co. Ltd.15, decided by this Court, the situation was entirely different. The majority of the Court reached the conclusion that the company paid as a result of a compromise and that there was no relation between the agreement that was reached and the threats that had been made. The payment was made voluntarily to prevent all possible litigation, and to bring the matter to an end. I must add that in the province of Quebec, the law is substantially in harmony with the authorities that I have already cited. The consent to an agreement must be legally and freely given. This is an essential requisite to the validity of a contract. Moreover, I think that art. 998 of the Civil Code applies, as the respondent who did not owe any amount to the appellant was unjustly and illegally threatened in order to obtain its consent. Articles 1047 and 1048 of the Civil Code do not apply, and are not a bar to respondent's claim. These sections suppose the existence of an error of law or of fact, which does not exist here.\nIt has been submitted by counsel for the appellant that the pleadings are insufficient and not specific enough to justify a finding of duress or compulsion. In paragraph 6 of its petition, the respondent alleges that it was \"called upon and forced to pay\" the tax. The respondent could have been asked to furnish particulars, but the appellant did not choose to follow that course of action. I am, therefore, of the opinion that this allegation is sufficient to allow the evidence that was adduced at trial.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Taschereau and those given by my brother Fauteux I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nFauteux J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court16 maintaining respondent's claim and declaring that it is entitled to recover from appellant the sum of $24,681.\nIt is admitted that this amount was paid by respondent to appellant, between March 1950 and January 1952; that the payment of that sum was exacted from the former by the latter as excise tax purported to be imposed, under the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179 and its amendments, on the processing of sheepskins into mouton products; that these moneys were paid by means of a number of cheques issued every month throughout the period, all of these cheques, with very few exceptions, bearing on the back the words \"paid under protest\" or \"tax paid under protest\"; and that, at all relevant times, no such tax was imposed by the Excise Tax Act on the processing of sheepskins into mouton products, as it was indeed eventually decided by this Court in Universal Fur Dressers and Dyers Ltd. v. The Queen17.\nThe only question in issue is as to the right of respondent to obtain reimbursement of these moneys.\nIt is convenient to say immediately that the claim of respondent is not that it paid these moneys by mistake of either law or fact, but under illegal constraint giving a right of reimbursement. That this is really the true nature of the claim appears from the petition of right. It is therein alleged that from the beginning and throughout the period during which these moneys were exacted, there were, between the officers of the Department of National Revenue and those of the respondent company, numerous discussions in the course of which the latter (i) claimed that no excise tax could be imposed on these sheepskins; (ii) demanded that the officers of the Department alter their illegal attitude; (iii) opposed the payment of such tax which it was \"forced\" to pay and which it did pay under protest at the suggestion of the officers of the Department. Surely, one who makes such allegations and says that he did pay under protest does not indicate that he was under the impression that he owed the money and that he paid through error. As was said by Taschereau J. in Bain v. City of Montreal18, at the bottom of page 285:\nOf course, one who pays through error, cannot protest: he is under the impression that he owes, and has nothing to protest against, or no reasons to protest at all.\nFurthermore, the evidence adduced by respondent is consistent with this view as to the nature of the claim. Indeed the evidence accepted by the trial Judge shows that, to the knowledge of the officers of the Department, other processors in the trade entertained the view that such a tax was not authorized under the Act. It also shows that respondent, who was opposed to its payment, would not have paid it, as it did under protest, had not its officers been intimidated, threatened by those of the Department, and in fear of the greater evil of having their business closed up. The trial Judge so found and, in this respect, expresses himself as follows:\nIl n'y a pas de doute qu'elle ne les aurait pas pay\u00e9s si elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 intimid\u00e9e par les remarques et informations des officiers du Minist\u00e8re du Revenu National, \u00e0 l'effet qu'elle devait payer parce que c'\u00e9tait la loi et qu'au cas de refus, elle pourrait voir son entreprise close.\nHaving said this, the trial Judge continues :\nLa preuve m'autorise, je crois, \u00e0 conclure qu'elle a r\u00e9ellement pens\u00e9 qu'elle devait payer et que la taxe \u00e9tait exigible; le paiement a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par erreur. Dans ces circonstances, il est logique de croire que son consentement au paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 vici\u00e9 par les repr\u00e9sentants de l'autorit\u00e9 et que les paiements n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faits volontairement mais par suite d'erreur et de crainte d'un mal s\u00e9rieux. (The italics are mine).\nI agree with the trial Judge that these payments were not voluntary payments, but involuntary payments made because of fear of the serious consequences threatened. I must say, however, that I find it difficult to reconcile that conclusion, which is supported by the evidence, with the statement that these payments were made through error. And if the trial Judge really meant that the payments were made through error, in the sense that respondent officers really thought that they owed these moneys to the appellant, I must say, with deference, that such an inference is not supported by the evidence.\nThe right of respondent to be reimbursed these moneys, which it paid to appellant, involves the consideration of two questions:\u2014(i) Whether, under the general law, there is, in like circumstances, a right to recover moneys paid, and, in the affirmative, (ii) Whether this right to recover, under the general law, is barred, in the present instance, by any of the statutory provisions of the Excise Tax Act.\nThe first question must be decided according to the principles of the Civil Law of the province of Quebec where the facts leading to this litigation took place and where, in particular, these payments were made.\nArticle 998 of the Civil Code, relating to the incidence of constraint as affecting consent, reads as follows:\nIf the violence be only legal constraint or the fear only of a party doing that which he has a right to do, it is not a ground of nullity, but it is, if the forms of law be used or threatened for an unjust and illegal cause to extort consent. In Wilson et al. v. The City of Montreal19, the Superior Court condemned respondent to repay to appellants moneys it had collected from them under an illegal assessment roll made to defray the costs of certain municipal improvements. These moneys were paid under protest, as evidenced by the receipt obtained from the City and which read:\nReceived from the Hon. Charles Wilson, the above amount which he declares he pays under protest and to save the proceedings in execution with which he says he is threatened.\nThis judgment, being appealed, was confirmed by the Court of Appeal20.\nIn The Corporation of Quebec v. Caron21, the Court of Appeal again confirmed a judgment condemning the City to reimburse a payment made, not by error, but \"sciemment\" by Caron, under protest. The claim of the City was for arrears of water rate and it had, in like cases, the power to shut off the water. The claim, however, was prescribed. Caron was threatened, on the one hand, by his tenant, to be sued in damages in the event of a stoppage of water and was threatened, on the other hand, by the City, of a stoppage of water unless payment was made. The Court of Appeal said:\nIt is true that there was no physical force employed to compel the payment but there was a moral force employed which compelled the respondent to choose one of two evils, either to pay a debt which he could not by law be forced to pay, or to pay damages which he desired to avoid; in neither case could the payment have been voluntary; it was the effect of moral pressure, and would not have been made without it. It was an influence which took away the voluntary character from the payment and yet which could not be ranked with \u00abcrainte et violence\u00bb. Under these circumstances, this payment was not being voluntary but was made under pressure; the plaintiff's action must stand and the appeal be dismissed.\nBaylis v. The Mayor of Montreal et al22 This was an action brought to recover from the City an amount collected from the appellant for assessment not legally due, the assessment roll, under which the payment was exacted, being a nullity. The appellant did not protest or make any reserve when he paid. He paid only when compelled to do so by warrant of distress. Sir A. A. Dorion, C.J. said, at the bottom of page 304:\n* * *\nAnd it has repeatedly been held that a payment made under such circumstances is not a voluntary payment and did not require that the party making it should pay, under protest, to enable him to recover back what has been illegally claimed from him.\nIn Bain v. City of Montreal, supra, the above decisions are referred to, with virtual approval, by Taschereau J., at page 286, where he makes the following comments as to the significance and necessity, or non necessity, of protest:\nI cannot help but thinking that, that when a party pays a debt which he believes he does not owe, but has to pay it under contrainte or fear, he ought to accompany this payment with a protest, if not under the impossibility to make one, and so put the party whom he pays under his guard, and notify him that he does not pay voluntarily, if this party is in good faith. If he is in bad faith and receives what he knows is not due to him, he is, perhaps, not entitled to this protection. A distinction might also perhaps be made between the case of a payment under actual contrainte, and one made under a threat only of contrainte, or through fear.\nIf there is an actual contrainte, a protest may not be necessary, and in some cases, it is obvious, may be impossible, but if there is a notice of threat only of contrainte, then, if the party pays before there is an actual contrainte, he should pay under protest. Demolombe Vol. 29 No. 77 seems, at first sight, to say that a protest is not absolutely necessary, but he speaks, it must be remarked, of the case of an actual contrainte.\nOf course, each case has to be decided on its own facts. It is not as a rule of law that a protest may be said to be required. For a protest is of no avail when the payment or execution of the obligation is otherwise voluntary. Favard de Langlade, R\u00e9p. Vo. Acquiescement, Par. XIII; Solon, 2 Des Nullit\u00e9s, No. 436; B\u00e9darride De La Fraude, Vol. 2, No. 609.\nBeing of opinion that, under the general law, respondent is entitled to be reimbursed of the moneys it paid to appellant, there remains to consider the contention of the Crown that this right is barred under the provisions of s. 105 of the Excise Tax Act.\nAppellant relies on s. 105(6):\n6. If any person, whether by mistake of law or fact, has paid or overpaid to His Majesty, any moneys which have been taken to account, as taxes imposed by this Act, such moneys shall not be refunded unless application has been made in writing within two years after such moneys were paid or overpaid. The French version of s. 105(6) reads:\n(6) Si quelqu'un, par erreur de droit ou de fait, a pay\u00e9 ou a pay\u00e9 en trop \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 des deniers dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu compte \u00e0 titre de taxes impos\u00e9es par la pr\u00e9sente loi, ces deniers ne doivent pas \u00eatre rembours\u00e9s \u00e0 moins que demande n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par \u00e9crit dans les deux ans qui suivent le payement ou le payement en trop de ces deniers.\nThe two texts make it clear that these provisions apply only where the refund claimed is for moneys paid under a mistake of law or fact. They have no application in this case.\nThe other provisions of the Act, which may be referred to, are in s. 105(5) reading:\n5. No refund or deduction from any of the taxes imposed by this Act shall be paid unless application in writing for the same is made by the person entitled thereto within two years of the time when any such refund or deduction first became payable under this Act or under any regulation made thereunder.\nThese provisions are also inapplicable to the present case. The refund claimed is not for \"taxes imposed by this Act\" but for moneys exacted without legal justification.\nIt was further conceded that s. 105 is not exhaustive of the cases where refund may be made. Indeed one would not expect the Act to provide that moneys exacted under threat as a tax not imposed under the Act, may be reimbursed.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the respondent's petition of right is well founded.\nI may add that this case is entirely different from the case of The Queen v. Beaver Lamb & Shearling Co. Ltd.23 In that case, the payments of the moneys claimed were found to have been made long after and not consequential to the alleged duress, but under a mistake of law.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Kerwin C.J. and Abbott J dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Bird and The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Respondents.\n1961: March 9, 10; 1961: March 27.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nImmigration\u2014Validity of deportation order\u2014Whether provisions of an Act for the Recognition and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, infringed\u2014Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, ss. 36(1), 61, 63\u2014Immigration Regulation 13.\nThe appellant, a \"stateless\" person born in Peking, China, of \"White Russian\" parents, obtained a six-months' non-immigrant visa in Brazil for admission to Canada and, following her arrival in this country, applied to an Immigration Officer \"for permission to work in Canada\". The latter reported to a Special Inquiry Officer that he was of the opinion that it would be contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Act to grant the appellant admission to Canada by reason of her coming under the prohibited class of s. 5(t) of the Act, in that she could not or did not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of s. 20 of the Immigration Regulations. An inquiry was held before the Special Inquiry Officer who found that the appellant might not come into or remain in Canada as of right and ordered her detention and deportation. An appeal from this order to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was dismissed. The appellant applied in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. This motion was dismissed; an appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed but the latter granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Acting Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was vested with power under the provisions of ss. 61 and 63 of the Immigration Act and clause 13 of the Immigration Regulations to prescribe the form of deportation order that was used by the Special Inquiry Officer. The form was one that had been in use for some time, but the words at the end through which lines had been drawn were so deleted because the Acting Minister, pursuant to s. 63 of the Act and the Regulations and Amendments thereto, had prescribed a new form of deportation order,\u2014the only difference between the old and new forms being the omission of the deleted words. The submission that paragraphs 2 and 3 of regulation 13 indicated that the order should have used all the words in subs. (1) of s. 36 of the Act was rejected, as those paragraphs apply to circumstances that did not exist in this case.\nThere was no infringement of An Act for the Recognition and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as the appellant had not been deprived of her liberty except by due process of law. The contention that matters irrelevant to a proper determination of whether the appellant should be deported had been considered at all levels failed. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Norris J. Appeal dismissed.\nA. E. Branca, Q.C., for the appellant.\nW. R. Jackett, Q.C., and N. A. Chalmers, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014By leave of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia Irene Rebrin appeals from a judgment of that Court[2] dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Norris J. who had dismissed the appellant's motion for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. All of the points taken in the Courts below on behalf of the appellant were abandoned before us except two.\nMiss Rebrin, who describes herself as a \"stateless\" person, was born in Peking, China, of \"White Russian\" parents. About 1948 she and her parents were given permission to leave China provided they left their assets there. This they did and a United Nations Refugee Certificate was issued to her in China, and, together with her parents, she travelled to Brazil whither her brother had already escaped from China. At the invitation of a friend whom she had met while in China, she came to Canada as a tourist or visitor on July 5, 1958, presumably having been permitted entry under s. 7(1) (c) of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, which authorizes \"tourists or visitors\" to be allowed to enter and remain in Canada as non-immigrants. Before leaving Brazil the appellant had obtained a six-months' non-immigrant visa under subs. (4) of para. 18 of the Immigration Regulations. She secured employment at the University of Toronto in the autumn of 1958. In the summer of 1959 she was employed by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as a cashier at the Banff Springs Hotel; in the autumn of 1959 she was a member of the staff of the Department of Slavonic Languages at the University of British Columbia where she lectured in the Russian language. She was requested to resume her teaching at the summer school at the University during 1960 and to return to her teaching duties again in the autumn of 1960. At the time of the hearing of this appeal, we were advised that she is at present continuing her work at the University. Since coming to Canada and taking up employment she has been self-supporting, living in West Vancouver.\nIn August 1958, the appellant applied to an Immigration Officer \"for permission to work in Canada\" and, having thus ceased to be in the \"particular class in which he was admitted as a non-immigrant\", that is, the class of \"tourist or visitor\"\u2014she was, by virtue of subs. (3) of s. 7 of the Immigration Act \"deemed to be a person seeking admission to Canada\". The text of this subsection is as follows:\n(3) Where any person who entered Canada as a non-immigrant ceases to be a non-immigrant or to be in the particular class in which he was admitted as a non-immigrant and, in either case, remains in Canada, he shall forthwith report such facts to the nearest immigration officer and present himself for examination at such place and time as he may be directed and shall, for the purposes of the examination and all other purposes under this Act, be deemed to be a person seeking admission to Canada.\nShe was therefore properly treated by the Immigration Officer as though she had appeared before him under subs. (1) of s. 20 of the Immigration Act \"for examination as to whether he is or is not admissible to Canada or is a person who may come into Canada as of right\".\nOn November 19, 1958, the Immigration Officer reported to Special Inquiry Officer Clifford Ireland as follows:\nI have examined Irene Rebrin, a person seeking to come into Canada and in accordance with Section 23 of the Immigration Act, I hereby report I am of the opinion it would be contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Act to grant admission to or otherwise let the said Irene Rebrin come into Canada by reason of her coming under the prohibited class of Section 5 paragraph (t) thereof in that she cannot or does not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of Section 20 of the Regulations of the Immigration Act.\nOn January 22, 1959, pursuant to subs. (2) of s. 24 of the Act, an inquiry was held at Toronto before Mr. Ireland, at which Miss Rebrin was present together with her counsel, who was permitted to ask such questions as he desired of Miss Rebrin who was the only person who testified. At the conclusion of this inquiry Mr. Ireland rendered the following decision:\nMiss Irene Rebrin, on the basis of the evidence adduced at this Inquiry, I have reached the decision that you may not come into or remain in Canada as of right and that:\u2014\n(1) you are not a Canadian citizen; (2) you are not a person having Canadian domicile;\n(3) you are a member of the prohibited class described under paragraph (t) of Section 5 of the Immigration Act in that you cannot or do not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of this Act or the Regulations by reason of the fact that:\n(a) you cannot or do not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of Section 20 of the Regulations of the Immigration Act.\nI hereby order you to be detained and to be deported.\nThe formal deportation order made by Mr. Ireland and made part of the return in these proceedings is as follows:\n(Seal)\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nDEPORTATION ORDER AGAINST\nMiss Irene Rebrin\n6 Lowther Avenue, Toronto, Ontario (Formerly of Brazil, South America) under section 28 of The Immigration Act. On the basis of the evidence adduced at an inquiry held at 175 Bedford Road, Toronto, Ontario on 22nd of January 1959 I have reached the decision that you may not come into or remain in Canada as of right and that (1) you are not a Canadian citizen; (2) you are not a person having Canadian domicile; (3) you are a member of the prohibited class described under paragraph (t) of Section 5 of the Immigration Act in that you cannot or do not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of this Act or the Regulations by reason of the fact that (a) you cannot or do not fulfil or comply with the conditions or requirements of Section 20 of the Regulations of the Immigration Act.\nI hereby order you to be detained and to be deported\n\"C. Ireland\"\nDate Jan. 22, 1959\nSpecial Inquiry Officer.\nService Hereof Acknowledged by\n\"Irene Rebrin\"\nThis form has been prescribed by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. From this order Miss Rebrin appealed to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration by notice dated January 22, 1959, and pending the disposition of the appeal she was conditionally released in accordance with s. 18 of the Act on her own recognizance in the sum of $200. On January 22, 1960, E. P. Beasley, Chief of the Admissions' Division of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration wrote Miss Rebrin that he had been directed to inform her that her appeal from the deportation order of January 22, 1959, had been duly considered and dismissed.\nThe first question raised on behalf of the appellant is that the deportation order of Special Inquiry Officer Ireland is invalid because it failed to comply with subs. (1) of s. 36 of the Act since, as put in the appellant's factum and elaborated by counsel, \"it does not set out the place to which the appellant is to be deported\". This subsection reads as follows:\n36. (1) Subject to subsection (2), a person against whom a deportation order has been issued shall be deported to the place whence he came to Canada or to the country of which he is a national or citizen or to the country of his birth or to such country as may be approved by the Minister under this Act.\nSubsection (2) does not affect the questions in dispute. The printed form used by Mr. Ireland was one that had been in use for some time but the words at the end through which lines have been drawn were so deleted because, on October 28, 1957, the Acting Minister of Citizenship and Immigration for Canada, pursuant to s. 63 of the Act and the Regulations and Amendments thereto, had prescribed a new form of deportation order,\u2014the only difference between the old and new forms being the omission of the deleted words. Section 63 of the Act is as follows:\n63. The Minister may\n(a) prescribe such forms and notices as he deems necessary for the carrying out of this Act and the regulations;\n(b) designate ports of entry and immigrant stations for the purposes of this Act; and\n(c) prescribe and arrange for the procurement of suitable uniforms and insignia to be worn by immigration officers. Under s. 61 of the Act power is given to the Governor in Council to make regulations for carrying into effect the purposes and provisions of the Act. Regulations were duly promulgated, Clause 13 of which reads:\nDeportation Orders\n13. (1) A deportation order in the form prescribed by the Minister shall be executed in duplicate and one duplicate original shall be served upon the person ordered deported by remitting such duplicate original to him personally whenever practicable and in other instances, by forwarding it by registered mail to his last known address.\n(2) A copy of the deportation order shall be forwarded to the transportation company that is obligated to remove or to pay the costs of deportation of the person ordered deported and such copy may form part of a notice in the form prescribed by the Minister.\n(3) A transportation company may request once only in each case that deportation be made to a country other than that designated in the deportation order or other order made by the Minister, Director or a Special Inquiry Officer.\nThe Acting Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was thus vested with power to prescribe the form that Mr. Ireland used. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of regulation 13 were relied upon by counsel for the appellant as indicating that the deportation order should have used all the words in subs. (1) of s. 36 of the Act, but we are unable to agree as they apply to circumstances that do not exist in this case. The appellant fails on her first point.\nThe only remaining point involves a submission that the provisions of \"An Act for the Recognition and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\", c. 44 of the Statutes of 1960, were infringed. There was no infringement as the appellant has not been deprived of her liberty except by due process of law. Involved in this second submission is the contention that matters irrelevant to a proper determination of whether the appellant should be deported had been considered at all levels. Nothing was put forward which indicated Mr. Ireland considered any such matters, but reference was made to certain correspondence between the appellant or persons on her behalf on the one hand, and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration on the other, and also to certain statements made in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister and by the Minister. In view of the liberty of an individual or her liability to deportation being at stake, no objection was raised by counsel on behalf of the respondents to the reading of these statements, but there is nothing in them or in the correspondence to warrant the suggestion that matters irrelevant to the proper determination of the appeal to the Minister were considered.\nBy subs. (2) of s. 31 of the Act \"All appeals from deportation orders shall be reviewed and decided upon by the Minister\" except where the Minister directs that the matter should be dealt with by an Immigration Appeal Board and by subs. (3) \"An Immigration Appeal Board or the Minister, as the case may be, has full power to consider all matters pertaining to a case under appeal and to allow or dismiss any appeal\". One of the letters sent on Miss Rebrin's behalf was clearly a request to the Minister to take steps to permit the appellant to remain in Canada notwithstanding the probable validity of the deportation order. We agree with the submission on behalf of the respondents that the material discloses nothing from which any inference may be drawn that in disposing of the appellant's appeal from the deportation order the Minister was in any way acting upon any evidence or information against the appellant which had not been brought to the attention of Miss Rebrin and which she had not had an opportunity to answer. The statement of the Minister in the House of Commons distinguished between the dismissal of such appeal and the review made of the case \"to see whether the strict application of the law should be waived by the exercise of the discretion vested in the Minister under The Immigration Act\". That discretion arises under s. 8 of the Act whereby the Minister has power to issue a written permit for the appellant to remain in Canada for a specified time, not exceeding twelve months, and also power to extend or cancel such permit.\nThe appeal is dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G. H. Dowding, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Tysoe, Harper, Gilmour, Grey, De Vooght & Levis, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960), 32 W.W.R. 400, 24 D.L.R. (2d) 593.\n"}

The notice did not name the officer sought to be examined. At the hearing of the motion counsel for Newfoundland requested that the person to be examined should be the Attorney General of Canada. In the event that such request should be denied, the suggestion was made that the then Deputy Minister of Justice should be the officer named and that, failing the naming of either of these, an officer who was one of the then Assistant Deputy Ministers should be named. In his judgment the President of the Exchequer Court directed that the Assistant Deputy Minister, who in the meantime had been appointed Deputy Minister, be examined. Applications on behalf of Canada and the Attorney General of Canada for leave to appeal to this Court from the order of the Court below having been granted, notices of cross-appeal were served on behalf of Newfoundland pursuant to Supreme Court rule 100. Motions were then brought for orders quashing the proceedings by way of cross-appeal commenced by Newfoundland, on the ground that no appeal lies to this Court from an interlocutory judgment pronounced by the Exchequer Court except with leave of a judge of this Court and Newfoundland had neither sought nor obtained such leave.\nHeld: The motions should be dismissed.\nHad there been no appeal taken by Canada, Newfoundland could not have appealed from the order of the President of the Exchequer Court without first obtaining leave; but the notices which it was sought to quash were not the initiation of appeals by Newfoundland, they gave notice that on the hearing of Canada's appeals Newfoundland would ask the Court to exercise in a particular way the jurisdiction which it possessed by reason of the fact that those appeals were properly before it, a jurisdiction which it was free to exercise whether or not notice under rule 100 had been served.\nWhile the notices served by Newfoundland were not necessary to clothe this Court with jurisdiction to give the relief for which they asked, it was proper to serve them.\nThe procedure to be followed by a respondent in an appeal taken to this Court who wishes to cross-appeal or to contend that the decision of the Exchequer Court should be varied is regulated by rule 100. The question whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal brought from a decision of the Exchequer Court must be determined by reference to the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act, but once that question has been answered in the affirmative the procedure to be followed by a respondent who seeks a variation of the judgment appealed from and the powers of this Court to treat the whole case as open and to give the judgment that the Court appealed from should have given are to be found in the Supreme Court Act and the rules made thereunder.\nBritish American Brewing Company Ltd. v.

R. Jackett, Q.C., for the respondent, appellant.\nK. E. Eaton, for the claimant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Judson J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014I am not persuaded that the respondent has the right to proceed as it did but as the majority of the Court are of a contrary opinion, I do not register a formal dissent. The judgment of Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014These are motions brought on behalf of the appellant for orders \"quashing the proceedings by way of cross-appeal commenced herein by the respondent by notice of cross-appeal dated the 31st day of October 1960 on the ground that no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from an interlocutory judgment pronounced by the Exchequer Court except with leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada and the respondent has neither sought nor obtained leave as required by law\". As a matter of convenience the appellant will hereinafter be referred to as \"Canada\" and the respondent as \"Newfoundland\".\nOn October 2, 1959, pursuant to s. 30 of the Exchequer Court Act, a statement of claim was filed in the Exchequer Court on behalf of Newfoundland as claimant, commencing proceedings against Canada as respondent. The statement of claim alleged an agreement dated June 12, 1957, between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of Newfoundland although the agreement referred to is in fact expressed to be between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada, of the first part, and the Government of the Province of Newfoundland, of the second part. This document has reference to the employment in Newfoundland of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Force or any portion thereof, in aiding the administration of justice in the province and in carrying into effect the laws of the legislature of the province. Clause 13 provides:\n13. Where in the opinion of the Attorney General of the Province an emergency exists within the province requiring additional members of the Force to assist in dealing with such emergency, Canada shall, at the request of the Attorney General of the Province addressed to the Commissioner, increase the strength of the division as requested if in the opinion of the Attorney General of Canada, having regard to other responsibilities and duties of the Force, such increase is possible.\nThe Commissioner referred to is the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Force. The claim is for a declaration that the agreement is valid and subsisting, that Canada is in breach of Clause 13, and for damages.\nThe statement of defence was filed on November 12, 1959. Pursuant to Exchequer Court Rule 130 a notice of motion was served on behalf of the claimant on December 2, 1959, for an order for the examination for discovery of a departmental or other officer of the Crown. The notice did not name the officer sought to be examined. The motion was returnable before the Presiding Judge in Chambers of the Exchequer Court on December 17, 1959; it came on before the President on January 12, 1960, when it was adjourned to February 23, 1960. In the meantime, pursuant to leave granted by the President, an affidavit was filed on behalf of the claimant which had as an exhibit a copy of the agreement of June 12, 1957, showing that the parties to the agreement were as noted above instead of as mentioned in the statement of claim. That affidavit also contained the following paragraphs:\n3. That I am informed and verily believe that the Honourable Edmund Davie Fulton is the Minister of Justice of Canada and Her Majesty's Attorney General of Canada, appointed pursuant to the Department of Justice Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, Chapter 71.\n4. That I am informed and verily believe that Wilbur Roy Jackett is the Deputy Minister of Justice and the Deputy Attorney General of Canada, appointed pursuant to the said Act.\n5. That I am informed and verily believe that Elmer A. Driedger and Guy Favreau are Assistant Deputy Ministers of Justice, appointed pursuant to the said Act.\n6. That I believe that the persons mentioned in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this affidavit are officers of the Respondent who are in positions of responsibility and authority and are qualified to represent the Respondent on examination for discovery in this proceeding, make discovery of the relevant facts within the knowledge of the Respondent and make such admissions on its behalf as may properly be made.\nAs appears from the reasons for judgment, when the motion came on for argument on February 23, 1960, the first request made to the President by counsel for the claimant was that the person to be examined should be the Attorney General of Canada. In the event that such request should be denied, the suggestion was made that the then Deputy Minister of Justice should be the officer to be named and that, failing the naming of either of these, Mr. E. A. Driedger, Q.C., of the Department of Justice, should be named.\nJudgment upon this motion was delivered on July 15, 1960. The President refused to name the Attorney General of Canada as he was of opinion that the Attorney General was not an officer of the Crown within the meaning of Rule 130; he refused to name the then Deputy Minister of Justice as that officer had been instructed to act as senior counsel for the respondent in the proceedings, and directed that Mr. Driedger, who in the meantime had been appointed Deputy Minister of Justice and Deputy Attorney General, be examined.\nAt the same time the President considered that it would be appropriate that the style of cause should be changed so that the party against whom the proceedings were taken should be described as Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada instead of the Government of Canada, and that the statement of claim should be amended so that the allegations in it might conform to the agreement in order to make it clear that any reference in it to the Government of Canada or to Canada meant Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada and it was so ordered. It does not appear whether the necessary steps were taken by the claimant to carry out the order of the President that the style of cause be amended, but it may be assumed that this either has been done or will be done.\nTwo notices of motion for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the order of the President of July 15, 1960, were thereupon served, on behalf of Canada. Both notices used the old style of cause, i.e., The Government of the Province of Newfoundland, claimant, and The Government of Canada, respondent. In one the application was made on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada asking for leave to appeal from the President's order; this was signed by Mr. Driedger as Deputy Attorney General of Canada. In the other notice of motion, which was for the same purpose, the application was made on behalf of the respondent as originally named in the statement of claim and was signed by Mr. Driedger, as solicitor for the respondent. These applications came before the Chief Justice of Canada who made the orders requested on October 25, 1960.\nThe appeals are brought pursuant to s. 82(1) (b) of the Exchequer Court Act, which reads:\n82. (1) An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada lies\n* * *\n(b) with leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, from an interlocutory judgment,\npronounced by the Exchequer Court in an action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding, in which the actual amount in controversy exceeds five hundred dollars. It is conceded that the actual amount in controversy in the action exceeds five hundred dollars.\nOn the argument of these motions to quash counsel for Canada stated that his appeals are based on two grounds: (i) that in an action of this sort there is no right to order the examination of any officer of the Crown and (ii) that, if this first ground be rejected, the learned President erred in naming Mr. Driedger as the officer to attend.\nNewfoundland served notices dated October 31, 1960, each of which so far as relevant reads as follows:\nNOTICE OF CROSS-APPEAL\nTAKE NOTICE that the Respondent intends upon the hearing of this appeal to contend that the Order of the Honourable the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada dated the 15th day of July, 1960, should be varied so as to provide that the Honourable Edmund Davie Fulton be examined for discovery herein instead of Elmer A. Driedger.\nThis Notice is given pursuant to Rule 100.\nCounsel for Canada argues that these notices are in substance appeals from the order of the learned President which do not lie without leave. He submits that the power of this Court to make rules does not extend to creating a right of appeal without leave in a case in which an Act of Parliament makes the granting of leave a condition precedent to the existence of a right of appeal, and that therefore the plaintiff is not assisted by rule 100 of the Supreme Court Rules.\nRule 100 is as follows:\nRule 100. It shall not, under any circumstances, be necessary for a respondent to give notice of motion by way of cross-appeal, but if a respondent intends upon the hearing of an appeal to contend that the decision of the court below should be varied, he shall, within fifteen days after the security has been approved, or such further time as may be prescribed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers, give notice of such intention to all parties who may be affected thereby. The omission to give such notice shall not in any way interfere with the power of the Court on the hearing of an appeal to treat the whole case as open, but may, in the discretion of the Court, be ground for an adjournment of the appeal or for special order as to costs.\nIn the case at bar the effect of this rule is not to create a right of appeal but to set out the manner in which the Court may exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Supreme Court Act, and particularly s. 46 thereof, in appeals properly brought before it. It is clear that if there had been no appeal taken by Canada Newfoundland could not have appealed from the order of the learned President without first obtaining leave; but the notices which it is sought to quash are not the initiation of appeals by Newfoundland, they give notice that on the hearing of Canada's appeals Newfoundland will ask the Court to exercise in a particular way the jurisdiction which it possesses by reason of the fact that those appeals are properly before it, a jurisdiction which it is free to exercise whether or not any notice under rule 100 has been served.\nIn my opinion while the notices served by Newfoundland were not necessary to clothe this Court with jurisdiction to give the relief for which they ask, it was proper to serve them.\nThis Court is now validly seized of Canada's appeals; if those appeals should succeed on the first ground mentioned above and the Court should decide that, in this case, there is no power to order any officer to attend for examination that will, of course, be an end of the matter. If, on the other hand, the Court should be of opinion that the first ground of appeal should be rejected it would then have to enter upon the second ground and decide whether Mr. Driedger was the proper officer to be selected. Under s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act the Court has power to give the judgment and award the process or other proceedings that the learned President should have given or awarded, and I think it clear that the Court would have jurisdiction to name the officer who, in its opinion, should be ordered to attend for examination.\nThe rules of this Court have the force of statute by virtue of s. 103(3) of the Supreme Court Act which reads:\n(3) All such rules as are not inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act have force and effect as if herein enacted.\nRule 63 is as follows:\nRule 63. Except as otherwise provided by the Exchequer Court Act, these Rules shall, so far as applicable, apply to appeals from the Exchequer Court of Canada. I can find nothing in the Exchequer Court Act providing that rule 100 shall not apply to appeals from that Court. Neither in the Exchequer Court Act nor in the rules made thereunder is there any provision as to the procedure to be followed by a respondent in an appeal taken to the Supreme Court who wishes to cross-appeal or to contend that the decision of the Exchequer Court should be varied. In my opinion that procedure is regulated by rule 100. The question whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal brought from a decision of the Exchequer Court must be determined by reference to the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act, particularly ss. 82, 83 and 84, but once that question has been answered in the affirmative the procedure to be followed by a respondent who seeks a variation of the judgment appealed from and the powers of this Court to treat the whole case as open and to give the judgment that the court appealed from should have given are to be found in the Supreme Court Act and the rules made thereunder.\nI have not overlooked Mr. Jackett's argument based on s. 82(4) of the Exchequer Court Act which corresponds to s. 64 of the Supreme Court Act and reads as follows:\n82 (4) In such notice the party so appealing may, if he so desires, limit the subject of the appeal to any special defined question or questions.\nIn the case at bar one of the questions raised by Canada's appeals is as to which officer of the Crown should be ordered to attend; the appeals have not been limited so as to exclude that question.\nIn my opinion nothing that I have said above conflicts with the decision of this Court in British American Brewing Company Ltd. v. The King1.\nThe nature of the judgment of the Exchequer Court from which the appeal in that case was brought is described in the reasons of the Court at page 571, as follows:\nThis is a judgment at the trial of the action dismissing it. True, as the suppliant was not prepared to prove his case, the matter of substance considered by the trial judge was whether or not the trial should be adjourned in order to give the suppliant a further opportunity to produce evidence. Nevertheless, it is a judgment pronounced at a trial, both parties being present, after the suppliant, on whom the burden of proof lay, had declared he had no evidence to offer. Such a judgment, we have no doubt, is a final judgment within the meaning of section 82, subsection 4, of the Exchequer Court Act. At the date of the decision s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, was worded somewhat differently from the corresponding section, s. 82 of the present act, but it did not differ in substance. It gave to any party to an action a right of appeal to the Supreme Court provided two conditions existed (i) the judgment sought to be appealed was a final judgment and (ii) the actual amount in controversy in the judicial proceeding in which such judgment was given exceeded five hundred dollars.\nSections 38 and 44 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35 (the predecessors of sections 44 and 42 of the present Act) were as follows:\n38. No appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion except in proceedings in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity originating elsewhere than in the province of Quebec.\n* * *\n44. Notwithstanding anything in this Act contained the court shall also have jurisdiction as provided in any other Act conferring jurisdiction.\nThe Court having quoted section 44, said in part at page 570:\nAs regards appeals from the Exchequer Court, the right of appeal is given by section 82 of the Exchequer Court Act; and it is contended on behalf of the Crown that section 38 of the Supreme Court Act applies to such appeals. In our opinion, the jurisdiction of this Court in respect of appeals in exercise of a right of appeal given by the Exchequer Court Act is not affected by section 38 of the Supreme Court Act; which section, we think, is limited in its application to those cases in respect of which the jurisdiction is set forth and denned immediately or referentially by the Supreme Court Act.\nAssuming for the purposes of the argument that this lays down the principle that the question whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the Exchequer Court in any given case depends on the provisions of the Exchequer Court Act alone, it does not appear to me to suggest that where those provisions confer jurisdiction on this Court it shall deal with the appeal otherwise than in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Supreme Court Act and the rules made thereunder in regard to all matters which are not dealt with in the Exchequer Court Act. For these reasons I would dismiss the motions with costs.\nMotions dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the respondent, appellant: E. A. Driedger, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the claimant, respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n1 [1935] S.C.R. 568, 4 D.L.R. 750.\n"}

Northwestern Utilities Ltd., [1961] S.C.R. 392\nDate: 1961-04-25\nCity of Edmonton, Town of Jasper Place, City of Red Deer and Town of Vegreville (Respondents) Appellants;\nand\nNorthwestern Utilities Limited (Applicant) Respondent.\n1961: January 31; February 1; 1961: April 25.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright, Abbott and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nPublic utilities\u2014Jurisdiction of Board in fixing rates to allow for transitional losses between date of application and date of decision\u2014Meaning of statutory phrase \"undue delay\"\u2014Jurisdiction to approve of purchased gas adjustment clause\u2014The Public Utilities Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 267, as amended by 1959 (Alta.), c. 73.\nIn June 1958 the respondent utility company applied to the Public Utilities Board to fix a new schedule of rates. The hearing of the application commenced in the following December and continued intermittently until February 26, 1959. The Provincial Legislature amended The Public Utilities Act on April 7, 1959, to provide by s. 67(8) as follows: \"It is hereby declared that, in fixing just and reasonable rates, the Board may give effect to such part of any excess revenues received or losses incurred by a proprietor after an application has been made to the Board for fixing of rates as the Board may determine has been due to undue delay in the hearing and determining of the application\".\nEffect was given to this amendment in an order of August 28, 1959, by which the Board approved an increase in the utility's rates as of September 1, 1959. An application was then made on behalf of the appellants under s. 49 of the Act for leave to appeal from the Board's order on the grounds that (i) the Board erred in law and had no jurisdiction to fix rates enabling the respondent to collect through its rates an additional amount for transitional losses during 1959, and that (ii) the Board erred in law and had no jurisdiction to approve the principle of a purchased gas adjustment clause. Another question raised was as to whether there had been \"undue delay\" within the meaning of the amendment to s. 67. Leave to appeal was granted and the Appellate Division, by a majority decision, dismissed the appeal on the first ground. The appeal on the second ground was allowed unanimously. The appellants appealed to this Court on the first question and the respondents cross-appealed on the second.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The cross-appeal should be allowed, and in lieu of the answer made by the Appellate Division to the second question, judgment should be entered declaring that the Public Utilities Board did not err in law and had jurisdiction to approve the principle of a purchased gas adjustment clause.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J.: It was not necessary to express an opinion on the contention of the respondent that the question whether there had been undue delay in the hearing and determination of the application to the Board was not open to the appellants. On the assumption that the question was open the Board had decided it correctly.\nPer Locke, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The language of subs. 8 of s. 67 of the Act, which gave the Board power to provide for transitional losses, made it clear that the amendment was intended to be retroactive. Sussex Peerage case (1844), 11 Cl. & Fin. 85 and Vacher v. London Society of Compositors, [1913] A.C. 107, referred to. It is only, however, such losses as have been due to undue delay in the hearing and determining of the application which may be permitted to be recovered. In the decision to authorize the utility to collect an additional amount for 1959 it was implicit that the Board held that the delay after December 31, 1958, was undue within the meaning of that expression in the subsection. It was clear that the Board attributed to the expression the meaning \"more than was reasonable in the circumstances\", and it was correct in doing so. As to whether the delay after December 31 was more than was reasonable, this was a question of fact as to which there could be no appeal under the statute.\nThe proposed order, with respect to the purchased gas adjustment clause, would be made in an attempt to ensure that the utility should from year to year be enabled to realize, as nearly as may be, the fair return mentioned in s. 67(2) and to comply with the Board's duty to fix just and reasonable rates to permit this to be done. How this should be accomplished, when the prospective outlay for gas purchases was impossible to determine in advance with reasonable certainty, was an administrative matter for the Board to determine.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, reversing in part a decision of the Alberta Board of Public Utility Commissioners. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.\nA. F. Macdonald, Q.C., and W. R. Sinclair, for the City of Edmonton.\nG. J. Bryan, Q.C., for the Town of Jasper Place. J. W. Beames, for the City of Red Deer.\nW. H. Hurlburt, for the Town of Vegreville.\nGeorge H. Steer, Q.C., and B. V. Massie, Q.C., for the applicant, respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014Subject to the same reservation expressed in the reasons of Mr. Justice Cartwright and on the same assumption that he makes, I agree with the reasons of Mr. Justice Locke.\nThe judgment of Locke, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014The respondent is the owner and operator of a natural gas transmission and distribution system serving large numbers of domestic, commercial and industrial consumers in the City of Edmonton, the Town of Jasper Place, the City of Red Deer and the Town of Vegreville and some 55 other municipalities or places in the Province of Alberta. The respondent is a public utility within the meaning of The Public Utilities Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 267, as amended.\nOn June 13, 1958, the respondent applied to the Public Utilities Board, constituted under the said Act, for an order:\nfixing and approving as of the return date of this motion, or such other date as the Board may deem proper, such new rates as are necessary to meet the applicant's costs, including its return.\nThe hearing of the said application commenced on December 9, 1958, and continued intermittently until February 26, 1959.\nOn June 29, 1959, the Board rendered its decision fixing a rate of depreciation, working capital allowance and estimated expenses of operation, and held the respondent entitled to a rate of return of 7.5 per cent upon its property used or required to be used in its service to the public within Alberta as determined and that the respondent was entitled to an increase in its revenue of $2,817,929 for the year 1959 and $3,019,792 for 1960, and directed that the respondent file schedules of rates for the approval of the Board, indicating how it suggested such amounts should be obtained. The value of the properties of the respondent upon which it was permitted the annual return above stated was fixed for the year 1959 at $48,568,892 and for the year 1960 at $51,412,702. The respondent has large natural gas reserves of its own but, in addition, purchases large quantities, for use in the operation, from the owners of other gas wells and operators of oil wells. The Board's estimate of its expense for this purchased gas for the year 1959 was $3,825,690 and for the year 1960 $3,722,300.\nSection 67(a) of the Act reads:\nThe Board, either upon its own initiative or upon complaint in writing, may by order in writing, which shall be made after giving notice to and hearing the parties interested,\n(a) fix just and reasonable individual rates, joint rates, tolls or charges or schedules thereof, as well as commutation, mileage and other special rates, which shall be imposed, observed and followed thereafter by any proprietor.\nDuring the lengthy proceedings before the Board it was contended on behalf of the respondent that the Board had power to make provision for the loss sustained by the respondent between June 13, 1958, the return date of its motion, and the date of the coming into effect of new rates. This loss referred to in the proceedings as \"transitional loss\" was the difference in the revenue of the respondent under the old rates, which remained applicable throughout the time consumed by the hearings and until the new rates became effective, and the amount which would have been received had the new rates to be authorized been in effect throughout this period. It was contended by the present appellants that the Board was without jurisdiction to make any such order, a contention which was upheld by the Board. As to this, the decision made in March 4, 1959, read in part:\nThe board has no doubt that the application of the principle of transitional loss is in effect fixing rates retroactively. The principle results in rates which are determined being dated back to the time of the application. The board can find no authority for it to do this either in The Public Utilities Act or elsewhere. The language used in The Public Utilities Act is prospective rather than retrospective. The authority of the board in this regard is limited to fixing rates for the future. The board accordingly has come to the conclusion that it cannot give effect to the principle of transitional loss. On April 7, 1959, the Legislature amended section 67 of the Act by, inter alia, adding thereto the following:\n(8) It is hereby declared that, in fixing just and reasonable rates, the Board may give effect to such part of any excess revenues received or losses incurred by a proprietor after an application has been made to the Board for the fixing of rates as the Board may determine has been due to undue delay in the hearing and determining of the application.\nThe amendment and the matter of the delays which had occurred between the filing of the application and the date of the Board's decision were dealt with in the following terms in the decision of June 29, 1959:\nCounsel for the consumers have asked that the decision upon transitional loss given by this board respecting the application of Canadian Western Natural Gas Company Limited be applied to this case. In the Canadian Western case this board came to the conclusion that it could not give effect to the principle of transitional loss as it could find no authority for it to do so either in The Public Utilities Act or elsewhere. Since that decision The Public Utilities Act has been amended and Section 67(8) now provides:\u2014(reciting the above amendment).\nIn this case, as has been pointed out above, the company's motion was returnable June 13, 1958. The hearing commenced December 9, 1958. There were unavoidable adjournments from December 19, 1958 to January 15, 1959, and from January 24, 1959, to February 24, 1959, and the hearing finally concluded February 26, 1959. There has been an inevitable delay from that date to the date of this decision and it appears that it will not be possible to have the new rates effective until August 1 at the earliest. It is apparent that the losses due to undue delay in the hearing and determining of the application have been considerable. The Board considers that it is only fair, in the circumstances, to reserve this question until the hearing of the second phase of this application.\nIt was impossible in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence for the respondent to determine with certainty in advance the amounts it would expend for purchased gas from year to year, and the figures above mentioned were, of necessity, estimates only. The respondent, accordingly, asked that the order to be made by the Board should contain what was called a purchased gas adjustment clause, a provision which, it was said, was approved by public utility boards in various states of the Union. The practical effect of such a clause would be that, assuming by way of illustration that the estimate of the cost of purchased gas for the year 1959 should prove to be $800,000 less than the actual expenditure for that purpose, this amount would be recouped by the company by an increase in the price of gas to consumers for the year 1960. Should, however, the estimated figure for this cost, used in approving the rates for the year 1959, be greater than the actual expenditure, the rates fixed for the year following would be reduced to give to the purchasers of gas the benefit of the saving. The details of the manner in which this would, in practice, be worked out was given by the witness Wilson, the executive vice-president of the respondent, and was explained in Exhibit 3 filed before the Board. It is unnecessary for the disposition of this aspect of the matter to examine these details in any more particularity.\nIn its decision of June 29, 1959, the Board said:\nThe evidence disclosed that the company faces a serious problem in estimating, with any degree of accuracy, the volumes of oil field gas which it will be required to purchase in any particular year. Added to this is the problem resulting from the fact that contracts between producers and exporters contain escalation and favoured nations clauses which affect future prices. In view of these problems the company led evidence as to a possible purchased gas adjustment clause which might be inserted in the board's order. Counsel for the company point out in argument that the company's proposal at no time involved, and does not now involve, rate changes without board approval.\nAfter pointing out that a further amendment had been made to the Act as s. 42(a) which might affect the matter, the Board reserved judgment until further representations might be made to it.\nAs to the transitional losses, the company was, as above stated, given permission to file rate schedules for the approval of the Board, calculated to produce an increase in its revenue for the calendar year 1959 of $2,817,929. In preparing these schedules the respondent company proceeded on the basis that the Board had decided that the delay in disposing of the application from January 1st onward had been undue delay within the meaning of s. 67(8), since the figure of $2,817,929 included, according to the respondent's computation, $1,845,000 as the transitional loss from January 1st to August 31, 1959. The schedule of rates filed proposed that this amount should be recouped from the rates to be imposed during the four and one-third years immediately succeeding September 1st, 1959. After further hearings for the purpose of hearing objections to the rates proposed, the Board rendered its decision on August 26th. In dealing with the question of transitional loss, the Board quoted that portion of its decision of June 29th, above referred to, and said:\nThe board in its decision of June 29 last quoted above, after citing the many adjournments and delays held that there had been undue delays and is still of the same opinion.\nAfter saying that the amendment to s. 67 permitted it to allow for losses sustained before the amendment was passed, the decision read in part:\nIn its decision of June 29th the Board held:\nSubject to the above the board finds that the additional revenue to meet the deficiency as set out in detail in Schedule \"B\" amounts to $2,817,929.00 for 1959 and $3,019,792.00 for 1960. The company may now file schedules of rates for the approval of the board indicating how it suggests such amounts should be obtained.\nIt will be noted that there is no mention of transitional loss in Schedule \"B\" which gives the details of the computation of the deficiency. It is considered clear that the board by this finding authorized the company to collect an additional $2,817,929.00 for the year 1959. The manner of collecting that amount was not broken down by months, the intention, which appears obvious, being that an additional amount of $2,817,929.00 would be collected for the entire year. Since new rates cannot be made effective until September 1 at the earliest it is apparent that to recover such an amount in the four remaining months of the year would result in very high rates for those months. The company accordingly designed its rates to recover the amount over a period of several years and this commends itself to the board.\nDealing with the proposed purchased gas adjustment clause and the objections raised to the application of any-such principle, the Board said in part:\nThe board undoubtedly has jurisdiction to fix just and reasonable individual rates, joint rates, tolls or charges or schedules thereof as well as other special rates which shall be imposed, observed and followed thereafter by any proprietor. It appears to the board that it has jurisdiction to say that the rate would be a certain amount per MCF. or per therm plus the cost of purchased gas or a certain rate plus or minus an adjustment for any variation in the cost of purchased gas which is in effect what is done by the adoption of a purchased gas adjustment clause.\nAfter pointing out that the cost of purchased gas was one of the main items of expense of the company and that it was obvious that it is entitled to recover this expense through the rates charged, the Board said:\nAfter reviewing very carefully all the evidence in this respect and giving consideration to what was said in argument this board is convinced that a provision for purchased gas adjustment is in the best interests of the consumer and is essential to the company if its financial integrity is to be maintained, which of course is also in the best interests of the consumer. The detailed provisions of the necessary order need not be discussed in this decision as these can be worked out between representatives of the consumers and the company subject to the approval of the board. The right is reserved to the company to file revised estimates of its purchased gas expense if for any reason it is found to be impossible to make such order effective.\nBy a formal order dated August 28, 1959, the Board approved the proposed rates as interim rates, to become effective on and after September 1, 1959, and dealt with the proposed purchased gas adjustment clause in the following terms:\nThe principle of a purchased gas adjustment clause as proposed by the Applicant is approved and the form of Order submitted in evidence by the Applicant is referred to the Applicant and the Respondents to consider whether agreement can be reached among them as to the wording of such a clause to be submitted to the Board for its approval. Failing such agreement the Applicant on ten (10) days' notice to the communities or persons who appeared on the said hearings may submit for the approval of the Board a form of Order providing that the rates as shown in Schedule \"A\" may be increased or decreased by Order of the Board to reflect changes in the average cost to the Applicant of gas and to reflect surpluses or deficiencies in revenue which have accrued to the Applicant due to the over or under provisions in the said rates for such average cost of gas.\nNo agreement was reached as to the wording of such a clause and the record does not indicate that the Board made any further order thereafter dealing with the question.\nSection 49 of The Public Utilities Act provides that leave to appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta upon a question of jurisdiction or upon a question of law may be obtained from a judge of the Court of Appeal upon application within a defined time. Such an application was made to Johnson J.A. who, by order dated October 20, 1959, gave leave to appeal upon the following grounds:\n(a) That the said Board erred in law and had no jurisdiction under the provisions of The Public Utilities Act or otherwise to fix rates enabling the Respondent to collect through its rates an additional $2,817,929 for the year 1959, as provided in the said decision;\n(b) That the Board erred in law and had no jurisdiction to approve the principle of a purchased gas adjustment clause as referred to in the said decision and order.\nThe questions upon which leave to appeal was granted are, according to the reasons delivered by the learned judge, those proposed on behalf of the City of Edmonton. Another question raised on the argument before him was as to whether there had been \"undue delay\" within the meaning of the amendment. This would appear to be a question which would arise in considering the first question upon which leave was granted. Whether the applicants proposed that a separate question should be submitted as to this is ' not clear. Johnson J.A. said that the question was not a question of law but, at the highest, a mixed question of fact and law. I mention the matter because it was contended by the respondent that the question of whether there had been undue delay within the meaning of that expression in the amendment was not open to the appellants, a contention with which I do not agree.\nThe Appellate Division, by a decision of the majority of the court, dismissed the appeal on the first ground, Porter J.A., with whom Milvain J. agreed, dissenting. The appeal upon the second ground was allowed by a unanimous judgment of the court.\nThe appellants have appealed to this Court from the judgment on the first question and the respondent has cross-appealed from the judgment dealing with question (b).\nA public utility, such as the respondent, in Alberta may not change a rate theretofore fixed by the Public Utility Board without its approval (s. 83(1)). The rates, we are informed, had last been fixed several years earlier. The Board was empowered at the time of the application to require the utility to furnish safe, adequate and proper service and to keep and maintain its property and equipment in such condition as to enable it to do so (s. 67(d) (ii)) and to make extensions to its facilities when, in the judgment of the Board, to do so was reasonable and practicable (s. 67(d) (iii)). These powers were continued in the 1959 amendments to ss. 66 and 67. The utility was further under the obligation to supply and deliver gas at such rates and upon such terms as the Board might direct (s. 67(d) (viii); s. 67(1) (e) as amended). The rates thus to be fixed from time to time were such as the Board considered to be just and reasonable.\nUnlike the British Columbia Act, considered by this Court in B.C. Electric Railway Company v. Public Utilities Commission2, the expression \"unjust and unreasonable rates\" is not defined. Section 66(b), however, as it read prior to the 1959 amendment, empowered the Board to value the property of the public utility, and the purpose of these powers was explained and they were amplified in the amendment of 1959. This required the Board, in fixing just and reasonable rates, to determine a rate base for the property of the proprietor that is used or required to be used in his service to the public within Alberta and to fix a fair return thereon.\nThere is no explanation in the record of the delay in considering the respondent's application between June 13, 1958, and December 9, 1958. While the respondent might have applied for an interim order increasing the rates under s. 41(2), this was not done, presumably because in a matter involving so many varied interests this was deemed impractical. A further delay occurred between the conclusion of the main hearings on February 26 and the rendering of the decisions of June 29 and August 26 and, as shown, the new rates did not come into effect until September 1, 1959.\nThe right of the consumers to require the respondent to supply them with gas, conferred by the statute, would, in my opinion, even in the absence of any statutory provision, impose upon them an obligation at common law to pay for the service on the basis of a quantum meruit. In such circumstances, I consider that the position of the utility would be similar to that of a common carrier upon whom is imposed, as a matter of law, the duty of transporting goods tendered to him for carriage at fair and reasonable rates (Great Western Railway v. Sutton3). Here the duty of determining what rates are fair and reasonable is imposed upon the Board. In the result, in the present matter the consumers paid less than a fair price for a period of something more than a year.\nAs shown by the decision of March 4, 1959, while on various earlier occasions the Board had made provision for the recovery of transitional losses in fixing rates, this had apparently been done by consent of the parties. When its power to do so was questioned in the present matter, the Board came to the conclusion that its powers were limited to fixing rates to apply in the future. While the reasons given do not explain the grounds upon which the Board proceeded, it may, I think, be fairly assumed that it was based upon the language of s. 67(a) which speaks of rates which shall be imposed, observed and followed thereafter by any proprietor. The amendment adding subs. (8) to s. 67 was passed in the following month and the Board acted upon the powers which it considered were given to it.\nThere has been much discussion in argument before the Appellate Division and in this Court as to whether the amendment was retroactive, or whether it was simply declaratory of the law as it stood before its enactment. In my opinion, it is unnecessary to determine this question since, in agreement with the majority of the learned judges of the Appellate Division, I consider that the language of the amendment is perfectly clear.\nUnder the decision approving the new rate schedule made on August 26, 1959, authority was given to add to the rates over a term of years the amount by which the revenue of the company fell short of what it would have been, had the new rates been in effect throughout the year 1959. No doubt, the vast majority of the consumers who purchased gas from the utility during the first eight months of the year 1959 continued as customers thereafter. Those persons had paid the rates approved by the Board during this period and, while they were less than what was fair and reasonable, it is clear that in the absence of an order of the Board the utility had no enforceable claim against them for any difference. The new rates while prospective created a new obligation in respect of transactions already past in the case of these consumers and, in that respect, were retroactive (Craies on Statute Law, 5th ed. 357).\nThis, however, is exactly what the amendment authorized since it empowered the Board to give effect to such part of any excess revenues received or losses incurred by a proprietor after an application has been made to the Board for the fixing of rates, to the extent that the Board may determine these to have been due to undue delay in the hearing and determining of the application. The amendment applies to both losses and gains and, if during the prescribed interval it were shown that the proprietor had earned amounts in excess of what were determined to be fair and reasonable, the continuing consumers might be given the benefit in the rates to be fixed. Since in the interval between the return date of the application and the going into effect of the new rates the customers would be required to pay the existing rate on the former date, of necessity an order made under the subsection would be retroactive in its effect, whether the proprietor had suffered losses or realized excess revenues in the sense that these expressions are used.\nIn the Sussex Peerage case4, Tindal C.J. said that:\nthe only rule for the construction of Acts of Parliament is that they should be construed according to the intent of the Parliament which passed the Act. If the words of the statutes are in themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense.\nIn Vacher v. London Society of Compositors5, where the question was as to the interpretation of a section of the Trade Disputes Act, of 1906, Haidane L.C. said (p. 113) that he proposed:\nto exclude consideration of everything excepting the state of the law as it was when the statute was passed, and the light to be got by reading it as a whole, before attempting to construe any particular section. Subject to this consideration, I think that the only safe course is to read the language of the statute in what seems to be its natural sense.\nSection 9 of The Interpretation Act of Alberta, R.S.A. 1955, c. 160, declares that every Act shall be deemed remedial and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nIn my opinion, the language of the subsection makes its meaning perfectly clear and it is unnecessary to resort to any outside aid to interpretation. If, however, it were otherwise, as the evidence shows, the state of the law as of March 5, 1958, was considered by the Public Utility Board to be that it was without power to provide for transitional losses, a state of affairs which the amendment passed so soon thereafter was clearly and obviously designed to remedy.\nIt is only, however, such losses as have been due to undue delay in the hearing and determining of the application which may be remedied. As to this, it must be said that the finding of the Board might have been expressed with greater clarity. The passage from, the decision of June 29, 1959, above quoted recites the various delays, referring particularly to the adjournments after December 19, 1958, and the delay in giving the decision following the conclusion of the hearings on February 26. As has been shown, however, at the same time the Board held that there would be a deficiency of revenue for the years 1959 and 1960 and authorized the company to file rates for the approval of the Board, suggesting how such amounts should be obtained. In referring to this in its final decision the Board said that it was clear that it had by this finding authorized the company to collect an additional amount of $2,817,929 for the year 1959. In my opinion, it is implicit in this decision that the Board held that the delay after December 31, 1958, was undue within the meaning of that expression in the subsection. I think it is clear that the Board attributed to the expression the meaning \"more than was reasonable in the circumstances\" and, in my opinion, it did not err in doing so. As to whether the delay after December 31 was more than was reasonable, that is a question of fact as to which there can be no appeal under the statute.\nPorter J.A. has criticized the manner in which effect was given to the Board's order permitting the recovery of the transitional loss for the year 1959, in various respects. The schedule approved by the Board appears to have capitalized the actual net deficiency of revenue after income tax, and added the income tax which would have been paid by the company if the new rates had been applicable for the year 1959. I think there is much to be said for these views but the questions are not those in respect of which leave to appeal was granted, and it is, no doubt, for that reason that they were not raised before the Appellate Division. The question is whether the Board erred in law and was without jurisdiction to fix rates enabling the respondent to collect the transitional loss for the year 1959, and not as to whether, granted the Board had power to do this, the method approved to carry the decision into effect was authorized by the statute. In these circumstances, I express no opinion upon these matters. The respondent cross-appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Division by which the decision of the Board upon the purchased gas adjustment clause was set aside, on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to make such an order.\nAs I have pointed out, no formal order was made by the Board, the order of August 29 simply approving the principle of such a clause as proposed by the utility but referring the settlement of the form of the order to the parties in the hope that they could agree. Failing such agreement, permission was given on ten days' notice to submit an order for the approval of the Board. The respondent contends that since no formal order was made there was no right of appeal to the Appellate Division. Section 49(2) reads that leave to appeal may be obtained from a judge of the Court of Appeal within one month after the making of the order, decision, rule or regulation sought to be appealed from. I agree with the learned judges of the Appellate Division that there was such a decision from which the appeal was properly taken.\nIn approving rates which will yield a fair return to the utility upon its rate base, it is, of course, essential for the Board to estimate the expenses which will necessarily be incurred thereafter in rendering the service. The fair return permitted is, after deducting from the gross revenue these necessary estimated expenditures and such necessary outgoings as taxes, including income taxes. The Board can only come to a conclusion as to what rates should be approved by determining as closely as may be done in advance the probable amount of these expenditures.\nUpon the application in the present matter, the expense which would be incurred for purchased gas in the year 1959 was estimated by the applicant as an amount which, as of August 1959, appeared to be approximately $800,000 less for that year than the amount which would necessarily be expended. For the year 1960, in respect of which an estimate had been given for the use of the Board in considering the application, the amount that would be expended for this purpose had been underestimated, in the opinion of the executive vice-president of the applicant, by $1,300,000. The reason for these inaccurate estimates was explained at length in the evidence of this witness. That, in determining what was a fair return and deciding what rates should be authorized to earn such a return, the expenses of operation must be estimated as accurately as is reasonably possible is not questioned by anyone. The Board was apparently satisfied that, in the circumstances, it was not possible to estimate for years in advance the cost to which the respondent would be put for purchased gas from year to year, and concluded that such a provision as was proposed was in the best interests of the consumers and essential to the company if its financial integrity was to be maintained.\nWhat was proposed was that the utility should submit to the Board, and to such other interested parties as the Board might direct should be notified, not later than November 1st in each year, the figures as to its cost for purchased gas during the first nine months of the year and its estimate of the amounts required for such purpose during the months of October, November and December. Dependent upon whether these costs were in excess of or less than the amount estimated, in approving the rates the Board would be asked to make such adjustments in the rates for the following year to carry out the purpose above explained.\nMacdonald J.A., with whom the Chief Justice and Johnson J.A. agreed, was of the opinion that in adopting the proposed clause the Board intended to fix gas rates without compliance with s. 67(2) of the 1959 amendment which reads:\nIn fixing just and reasonable rates, tolls or charges, or schedules thereof, to be imposed, observed and followed thereafter by a proprietor, the Board shall determine a rate base for the property of the proprietor that is used or required to be used in his service to the public within Alberta and fix a fair return thereon.\nWith great respect, however, the proposed order would be made in an attempt to ensure that the utility should from year to year be enabled to realize, as nearly as may be, the fair return mentioned in that subsection and to comply with the Board's duty to permit this to be done. How this should be accomplished, when the prospective outlay for gas purchases was impossible to determine in advance with reasonable certainty, was an administrative matter for the Board to determine, in my opinion. This, it would appear, it proposed to do in a practical manner which would, in its judgment, be fair alike to the utility and the consumer. As pointed out by Porter J.A., s. 67(5) does not touch the matter and this the respondent concedes, but the Board has not assumed to act under that subsection. Rather did it propose to make the order under the powers given to it and the duty imposed upon it by the sections to which I have referred to fix just and reasonable rates which would yield the fair return mentioned in s. 67(2).\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. I would allow the cross-appeal with costs and direct that, in lieu of the answer made by the Appellate Division to the second question, judgment be entered declaring that the Public Utility Board did not err in law and had jurisdiction to approve the principle of a Purchased Gas Adjustment Clause, as referred to in the said decision and order.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of my brother Locke subject only to one reservation. I do not find it necessary to express an opinion on the contention of the respondent that the question whether there had been undue delay in the hearing and determination of the application to the Board was not open to the appellants and I wish to reserve my opinion on that contention.\nOn the assumption that the question was open I would agree, for the reasons given by my brother Locke, that the Board decided it rightly.\nI would dispose of the appeal and the cross-appeal as proposed by my brother Locke.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the City of Edmonton: A.

That day, the temperature had varied, and as the sun disappeared melted snow and water turned to ice. The employees of the City had sanded the sidewalks earlier in the day. The action was maintained by the trial judge, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal and the action should be dismissed.\nTo succeed, the plaintiff had to prove that the city or its employees had been negligent, and that the injury was the result of this negligence. In a country such as ours, where temperatures vary greatly, sudden dangers can be created by the changing weather.

Dans cette chute, elle s'est fractur\u00e9 le coude droit et caus\u00e9 d'autres blessures et diverses contusions. M. le Juge Collins de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a trouv\u00e9 que la responsabilit\u00e9 de la ville avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, et l'a condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la demanderesse la somme de $3,795.28 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens. La Cour du banc de la reine1 a maintenu l'appel et a rejet\u00e9 cette action. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le jour de l'accident, la temp\u00e9rature \u00e9tait variable. Apr\u00e8s quelques chutes de neige au cours de la matin\u00e9e, le temps \u00e9tait devenu doux et ensoleill\u00e9. A certaines heures de la journ\u00e9e, l'eau coulait dans les rues et sur les trottoirs, et plus tard dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi, le temps est devenu plus frais et le sol s'est recouvert d'une l\u00e9g\u00e8re couche de glace.\nLes employ\u00e9s de la ville pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'entretien des rues et des trottoirs ont commenc\u00e9, ce matin l\u00e0, \u00e0 sabler les rues \u00e0 6.30 heures a.m., et c'est vers 10.00 heures a.m. qu'ils ont plac\u00e9 du sable \u00e0 l'endroit m\u00eame o\u00f9 l'accident s'est produit. Des \u00e9quipes ont pratiqu\u00e9 des drains et des rigoles afin de lib\u00e9rer les trottoirs de l'eau qui s'accumulait et qui, \u00e0 cause du gel, pouvait devenir un danger. Ceci \u00e9videmment facilitait le sablage rendu difficile par la fonte de la glace et de la neige.\nDe 11.00 heures a.m. \u00e0 3.00 heures p.m., \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 l'heure o\u00f9 l'accident est arriv\u00e9, la temp\u00e9rature \u00e0 l'ombre a vari\u00e9 de quelques degr\u00e9s seulement, soit de 28 \u00e0 30 Fahrenheit, ce qui implique qu'elle \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e o\u00f9 se faisaient sentir les rayons du soleil. Des centaines d'hommes bien \u00e9quip\u00e9s \u00e9taient en alerte, et se promenaient de rues en rues dans le quartier, et partout dans la ville afin d'assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des pi\u00e9tons.\nLa pr\u00e9sente action ne peut r\u00e9ussir, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il y a eu n\u00e9gligence de la part de la cit\u00e9 ou de ses employ\u00e9s, et que c'est de cette n\u00e9gligence que le dommage a r\u00e9sult\u00e9. Dans notre pays, o\u00f9 les intemp\u00e9ries de nos saisons sont fr\u00e9quentes, o\u00f9 la temp\u00e9rature hivernale pr\u00e9sente de soudaines variations, on ne peut \u00e9videmment pas s'attendre sur nos trottoirs \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient ceux qui vivent sous des ciels plus cl\u00e9ments. Ces changements climatiques offrent toujours des dangers subits, dont ne peuvent dans tous les cas, \u00eatre tenues responsables les municipalit\u00e9s.\nCe que l'on exige de ces derni\u00e8res, ce n'est pas un standard de perfection. Elles ne sont pas les assureurs des pi\u00e9tons, et on ne peut leur demander de pr\u00e9voir l'incertitude des \u00e9l\u00e9ments. La vigilance simultan\u00e9e de tous les moments, dans tous les endroits de leur territoire, serait leur imposer une obligation d\u00e9raisonnable. Il peut arriver, et il arrive malheureusement des accidents, o\u00f9 s'exerce cependant tr\u00e8s bien la surveillance municipale, qui r\u00e9sultent d'aucune n\u00e9gligence et pour lesquels il n'y a pas de compensation sanctionn\u00e9e par la loi civile. Lorsque la municipalit\u00e9 fait preuve de soin et de diligence raisonnables, lorsqu'elle agit \"en bon p\u00e8re de famille\", lorsqu'elle prend les pr\u00e9cautions que prendraient des personnes prudentes dans des circonstances identiques, elle ne peut \u00eatre recherch\u00e9e devant les tribunaux civils.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, je suis clairement d'opinion qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 toutes les circonstances, l'intim\u00e9e a agi avec prudence, qu'aucune n\u00e9gligence n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie contre elle, et qu'elle doit \u00eatre lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de toute responsabilit\u00e9.

A wholesale store in Truro, N.S., was broken into on the night of January 24, 1960, and nine cases of cigarettes were reported missing. The three accused were charged and tried separately by the same magistrate for unlawfully possessing a quantity of cigarettes, knowing that they were obtained by the commission of an indictable offence, contrary to s. 296(a) of the Criminal Code. The evidence disclosed that they were trying to dispose of a case containing 49 cartons of cigarettes of an unidentified brand in a neighbourhood town on the day following the break-in, and that they were travelling in a two-tone 1956 Buick convertible, with Ontario licence plates. A two-tone car, with Ontario licence plates, containing two occupants whom the police could not identify, had been seen in the area near the store on the evening of January 24. The evidence of the police was that all the nine cases were returned; the owner's evidence was that eight cases were recovered and that the missing case contained Player's Cigarettes. Accused \u0392 and \u039a stated that they never had any cigarettes in their possession, but that they were endeavouring to dispose of some on behalf of another person. The magistrate convicted the accused, basing his reasoning on the express finding that the cigarettes they were trying to sell had been stolen by them from the wholesale store. The convictions were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco. The accused were granted leave to appeal to this Court upon certain questions of law.\nHeld: The appeals should be allowed, the convictions quashed and the accused acquitted.\nThere was no direct evidence that the cigarettes were in the possession of anyone other than the true owners. There was, however, no doubt that the three accused were attempting to dispose of cartons of unidentified cigarettes. This was a circumstance to be weighed by the magistrate, together with the other circumstances disclosed by the evidence in accordance with the rule in Hodge's case. The magistrate had misdirected himself in applying this rule. The evidence of any cigarettes having been stolen at all was at best equivocal, and there was no evidence of the kind of cigarettes tendered for sale by the accused. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the accused \u0392 or A were in that area on the previous night. It was undoubtedly suspicious to find these men driving a two-tone 1956 Buick with Ontario licence plates and peddling cigarettes, but suspicion is not a substitute for proof and the convictions on circumstantial evidence appeared to be based upon a misconception of the rule in Hodge's case. The magistrate had erred in proceeding on the assumption that the accused had admitted having been in the area together on the night of the break-in. The doctrine of recent possession could not apply to the case, since the magistrate had based his decision on the express finding that the accused had themselves stolen the cigarettes in question. The further submission that the appeals should be dismissed because no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred, failed for lack of evidence.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, affirming the accused convictions.

The three appellants were charged and tried separately by the same Magistrate for unlawfully having in possession at or near Amherst, Nova Scotia, on January 25, 1960,\n\u2026 a quantity of cigarettes, the property of Truro Wholesalers Limited, knowing that it was obtained by the commission of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 296(a) of the Criminal Code.\nThe evidence taken against Boss was used by consent in the other two cases, and the evidence given by Kline in his own defence was similarly used in the case of Arsenault.\nIn each case the evidence discloses that these three men were trying to dispose of a case containing 49 cartons of cigarettes of an unidentified brand at Amherst on the 25th of January, and that they were then travelling in a two-tone 1956 Buick convertible with Ontario license plates, but the evidence does not indicate that cigarettes were found in the possession of any of the appellants, and it is stated by both Boss and Kline that they had never had any cigarettes in their possession but that they were endeavouring to dispose of some on behalf of another person.\nCoupled with this evidence is the fact that on the morning of January 25 the secretary-treasurer of Truro Wholesalers Limited found that his store had been broken into, and that, as far as he could tell from his records, one full case containing 50 cartons of cigarettes was missing and that marks in the snow which had fallen during the night before indicated that a case of Player's cigarettes had been put out and taken away. In this latter regard the same secretary-treasurer states that there were originally nine cases missing of which eight were recovered, whereas the police officer concerned swears that nine cases were returned to Truro Wholesalers Limited.\nThe other circumstance strongly relied upon by the Crown was the fact that an Ontario two-tone 1956 convertible Buick containing two occupants whom the police could not identify was seen in Truro near Truro Wholesalers Limited on the evening of January 24. In a statement made to the police which was produced at his trial, Boss said that he had been in Truro with the other two appellants on the 25th of January, but denied knowing about the break, and Kline, giving evidence at his own trial, stated that he was in Truro on the evening of the 24th in a two-tone 1956 Buick convertible of a different shade from that described by the two police officers, but did not name either of the other appellants as his companion.\nIn convicting each of the appellants it is quite apparent that the learned Magistrate based his reasoning on the express finding that the cigarettes which these men were trying to sell in Amherst on the 25th of January had been stolen by them from Truro Wholesalers Limited. He says, in convicting Boss, \"I have to find that these fellows stole them in order to convict them\", and in convicting the other two appellants, \"In this case I am well satisfied that they not only had possession of them but that they are the thieves\".\nIn appealing from these convictions to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, each of the appellants gave notice of appeal on the following, amongst other, grounds:\n1. There was not sufficient evidence presented at the trial to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the offence charged.\n2. The learned Magistrate did not give the accused the benefit of reasonable doubt as to his guilt.\n3. The learned Magistrate failed to comprehend or to apply the rules of law applicable to circumstantial evidence.\n4. The conviction is against the weight of evidence and the proper application of the evidence.\nThe decision of the Supreme Court en banc was rendered by Ilsley C. J. who found:\n1. THAT there was evidence in the proceedings against Boss (admissible only against Boss) on which the learned Magistrate could properly find, as he did, that Boss jointly participated with Kline in the theft of a case of cigarettes at Truro from Truro Wholesalers Limited;\n2. THAT in the proceedings against Kline there was evidence (admissible only against Kline) that Kline jointly participated with Boss in the same theft; 3. THAT there was evidence in each of the three cases that later, in Amherst, each of the three appellants had, jointly with the others, possession of or control over this case of cigarettes less one carton, or aided in concealing or disposing of it;\n4. THAT at that time Boss and Kline must, of course, each have known that the cigarettes had been stolen;\n5. THAT the evidence in the proceedings against Arsenault was sufficient to justify the Magistrate in properly inferring that Arsenault also knew that they had been stolen; and\n6. THAT each of the explanations given by Boss and Kline was one which the Magistrate was quite justified in finding not to be an explanation that could reasonably be true.\nFrom this judgment the appellants sought leave to appeal to this Court, and by Order dated December 19, 1960, leave was granted upon the following questions of law:\n1. Did the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc err in failing to hold that the learned magistrate misdirected himself on the law in his application of the rule relating to circumstantial evidence known as the rule in Hodge's case?\n2. Did the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc err in failing to hold that there was no evidence against the appellants to sustain a conviction?\n3. Did the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc err in failing to hold that the learned magistrate misdirected himself as to the doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods?\n4. Did the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc err in failing to hold that the learned magistrate misdirected himself as to the doctrine of reasonable doubt?\nThe offence here charged is complete when a person has (alone or with another person) possession of or control over goods which he knows to have been obtained by the commission of an indictable offence or when he aids in concealing or disposing of such goods (see s. 300 of the Criminal Code).\nIn the present case, while there is no direct evidence of \"a quantity of cigarettes, the property of Truro Wholesalers Limited\", being in the possession of anyone other than the true owner, there is no doubt that the three appellants were attempting to dispose of 49 cartons of unidentified cigarettes in Amherst on January 25. This was a circumstance to be weighed by the Magistrate, together with the other circumstances disclosed by the evidence in accordance with the rule of law which has come to be known as the rule in Hodge's case1 and which was expressed by Sir Lyman Duff, speaking on behalf of this Court in The King v. Comba2, where he said:\nIt is admitted by the Crown, as the fact is, that the verdict rests solely upon a basis of circumstantial evidence. In such cases, by the long settled rule of the common law, which is the rule of law in Canada, the jury, before finding a prisoner guilty upon such evidence, must be satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with a conclusion that the criminal act was committed by the accused, but also that the facts are such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused is the guilty person.\nTo this statement there should be added what was said by Cartwright J. in Lizotte v. The King3, as follows:\nHodge's case was a case where all the evidence against the accused was circumstantial. It is argued that the direction there prescribed is not necessary in a case where there is direct evidence against the accused as well as circumstantial evidence. However that may be, it is my opinion that where the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged depends upon circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be given.\nIn the course of his reasons in the case of Boss which he applied to the other two cases, the learned Magistrate is reported, according to the record before this Court, as having stated the rule in the following language:\nIf they (the Crown) had to prove they were stolen and these people knew they were stolen, there would be no sense in rule in Hodge's case. The rule in Hodge's case is the rule that circumstantial evidence, if no other reasonable explanation they are in their possession, then they are guilty.\nIf the learned Magistrate was correctly reported, as we must take him to have been, he misdirected himself in this regard, but it is not so much the language which he is reported to have used as the manner in which he applied the rule which is of importance in determining the disposition of these appeals.\nIt is an essential ingredient of the offences charged that it should at least be proved that cigarettes were missing from Truro Wholesalers Limited, and as to this phase of the matter the opening words of the learned Magistrate's reasons for judgment are significant. He there says:\nI must say there is a bit of doubt as to whether any cigarettes were missing at all. According to the evidence as far as Nichols (Secretary-Treasurer of Truro Wholesalers Limited) is concerned he said according to his records it looked as though there were nine cases of cigarettes missing and they recovered eight. I think the Detective said they recovered nine. The secretary-treasurer stated that as far as he could tell there was one full case missing, and when asked to explain this statement he said:\nWe keep a record of our stock, sir, and as far as we could tell from our records there was one full case missing and evidence of one case being put over a fence. The mark of the imprint was there in the snow. Therefore, that case would have to be put down in the snow and taken away by some one.\nThe evidence of any cigarettes having been stolen at all is, therefore, at best equivocal, and although the secretary-treasurer adds that as far as he could tell the imprint in the snow was that of a case of Player's cigarettes, there is no evidence whatever of the kind of cigarettes tendered for sale in Amherst. There is no evidence that either Boss or Arsenault were in Truro on the night of the 24th of January, the police were unable to identify any of the appellants as the men seen in the Buick near Truro Wholesalers Limited that evening, and Kline says that the Buick he was in that night was a different colour from that described by the police.\nIt was undoubtedly suspicious to find these men driving a two-tone 1956 Buick with Ontario license plates and peddling cigarettes in Amherst the day after a break into premises at Truro from which cigarettes were thought to have been missing and outside of which a similar car had been seen on the night of the break, but suspicion is not a substitute for proof, and insofar as these convictions rest upon circumstantial evidence, they appear to me to be based in large measure on the misconception of the rule in Hodge's case to which reference has been made. In my opinion, if the learned Magistrate had properly directed himself as to the law in his application of the rule in Hodge's case to the circumstances here disclosed, he would have concluded that there was no evidence to sustain a conviction against these appellants.\nIt should be pointed out, however, that the Magistrate appears to have proceeded on the assumption that the appellants admitted having been in Truro together on the night of the break. In this he was in error.\nAs the learned Magistrate based his decision on the express finding that the appellants had themselves stolen the cigarettes in question, there was no room for the application of the \"doctrine of recent possession\" which is directed to the question of whether or not an accused who is found to be in possession of goods recently stolen is aware of the fact that they are stolen goods nor indeed is there any occasion to invoke this doctrine on the view which I take of these cases because, as I have indicated, I do not consider that the evidence is of a kind upon which it is safe to base a finding that there were cigarettes missing from Truro Wholesalers Limited.\nIt is argued on behalf of the respondent that notwithstanding the errors in law which there may have been in the trial of these cases, the appeals should nevertheless be dismissed on the ground that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. The test to be applied to this argument is to be found in the decision of Viscount Simon in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions4, the following portion of which was adopted by this Court in Schmidt v. The King5:\n\u2026 the provision that the Court of Criminal Appeal may dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation where a reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would on the evidence properly admissible, without doubt convict.\nI am of opinion, with the greatest respect, that there was no evidence upon which the learned Magistrate could properly find that Boss and Kline jointly participated in the theft of this case of cigarettes or that the appellants had possession of it or aided in concealing or disposing of it with knowledge that it had been stolen.\nThe judgment of this Court has already been rendered allowing these appeals, quashing the convictions and directing verdicts of acquittal to be entered.\nAppeals allowed, convictions quashed and verdicts of acquittal ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellants: L.

Without the company's knowledge one of its employees had taken secret commissions in respect of two mortgage transactions. Following a hearing before a committee of the board, the company was informed that the committee had recommended its expulsion, but it was not advised that this recommendation might be waived if corrective action were taken nor was it informed of the kind of corrective action contemplated by the directors. An appeal to an appeal board of directors and a further appeal to the membership as a whole were without success. The company then brought an action to recover damages for wrongful expulsion and to obtain an order restoring it to membership in the board. The trial judge found in favour of the defendant; the Court of Appeal reversed this decision and directed that the action be referred back to the Court below for a new trial confined solely to the assessment of damages. By leave of this Court the defendant appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n(1) The company, having been elected to active membership in the defendant board, remained a member at all times relevant to the action. Steps had not been taken to terminate the company's membership on the ground that it had no individual representative as a member of the board, and as the by-laws made no provision for automatic expulsion of a corporation on this ground, the validity of the membership to which it was initially admitted remained undisturbed.\n(2) As the plaintiff had already been elected to membership at the time when the by-law providing that persons seeking election sign an \"irrevocable Waiver of Claim against the Society\" came into effect, it could not be construed as being in any way bound by that provision.\n(3) The defendant's contention that the plaintiff's pleadings had been designedly limited to a claim for \"general damages\" and that only nominal damages are recoverable under this heading in an action for breach of contract was rejected. Wyman and Moscrop Realty Limited v. Vancouver Real Estate Board (No. 4) (1959), 27 W.W.R. 476, followed.\n(4) The question of whether or not the company suffered damage must await the outcome of the new trial directed by the Court of Appeal to be confined to the question of damages only.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Maclean J. Appeal dismissed.\nW. J. Wallace, for the defendant, appellant.\nT. R. Berger, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia1 allowing the appeal of Moscrop Realty Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Moscrop\") from the judgment of Maclean J., and directing that the action be referred back to the Court below for a new trial confined solely to the assessment of damages. This action was originally brought by both Moscrop and E. C. Wyman claiming damages for wrongful expulsion from the appellant Board and for loss of business and profits arising therefrom, and also for an order restoring them to membership in the Board, but Wyman's membership was not alleged in the pleadings, and his appeal having been dismissed by the Court of Appeal on the assumption that he was not a member, he is not a party to this appeal.\nThe appellant Board is a society incorporated under the Societies Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 311, for the purposes of promoting the interests of real estate agents in the city of Vancouver and establishing and maintaining proper standards of conduct by its members. Real estate agents in the city of Vancouver are not obliged to be members of the Board but it is apparent that such membership enhances an agent's prestige and, in particular, that it makes available to him a system of multiple listings maintained by the Board which is considered to be of value in the conduct of the real estate business. Moscrop was duly admitted to membership on November 22, 1951, on the application of G. Gamble, its then manager-owner, and from that date until the expulsion complained of it paid all membership dues and subscriptions for group insurance, was listed on the official list of members and treated in every respect by the Board as an active member in good standing.\nIn January 1953 Gamble, who was then Moscrop's representative on the Board, sold his interest in that company to Wyman who, as it must be assumed, did not become a member of the Board although his name appears to have been entered in the Board's register as the Moscrop representative. The change of ownership was communicated orally to the secretary of the Board but no new application for membership was made when Wyman acquired his interest.\nIn January and February 1956 the Board received two letters of complaint from former clients of Moscrop, alleging that an employee of that company had taken secret commissions in respect of two mortgage transactions. There followed a hearing before the Complaints and Discipline Committee of the Board at which the employee admitted taking the commissions, but stated that this was done without the knowledge of either Moscrop or Wyman. The decision of this Committee having been communicated to the Board of Directors, the latter body recorded a resolution in its minutes of March 1, 1956, which read in part as follows:\nAfter much discussion, it was on motion resolved that Secretary be instructed to inform Mr. Wyman of a recommendation of the Complaints and Discipline Committee that he be expelled and also that the directors had considered this matter and instructed the Secretary to advise him that he may file notice of appeal within seven days of receipt of this letter and further that this recommendation for expulsion may be waived if necessary corrective action is taken by him. It was further resolved that until the seven day period for appeal has elapsed, services should not be discontinued to Moscrop Realty Ltd. and the membership at large are not to be informed of the proposed action.\nThe action taken by the Secretary pursuant to these instructions was to write a letter to Wyman saying:\n\u2026I have been instructed to inform you that it has been recommended that Moscrop Realty Ltd. be expelled from the Vancouver Real Estate Board. I have further been instructed to advise you that under Article 5, Part B, Section 8, Paragraph g of the Bylaws of the Board, you have seven days in which to appeal this decision.\nIt does not appear that either Wyman or anybody else on behalf of Moscrop was ever advised that the recommendation of expulsion might be waived if corrective action were taken nor does the kind of corrective action contemplated by the directors appear to have been communicated to Moscrop notwithstanding the fact that the by-law authorizing the directors' action reads in part as follows:\n\u2026 where the Board of Directors deems it proper to do so, they may instruct the member to take such remedial action as may be required to correct the matter of the complaint and\/or to bring about a satisfactory and fair settlement of the matter of the complaint, allowing the member a reasonable period of time but not in excess of ninety days to carry out the recommended action.\nIt is true that the secretary did tell Wyman in a telephone conversation that he thought the Board might withdraw the expulsion if the offending employee was dismissed by Moscrop but he did not commit himself and this conversation did not constitute an instruction to the member \"to take such remedial action as may be required \u2026\u201d.\nAn appeal was taken to an appeal board composed of seven directors on the ground, inter alia, that the penalty of expulsion was too severe in light of the fact that neither Wyman nor Moscrop was implicated in the employee's misconduct, and upon this appeal being dismissed a further appeal was taken without success to the membership as a whole.\nThe present action was then brought, alleging that the proceedings before the committee, the directors and the full Board and the resultant expulsions were contrary to law, natural justice and the constitution and by-laws of the Board. The defence was threefold in that the Board denied all allegations whereby the regularity of any of its proceedings or those of its directors or committees was impugned and pleaded also that the plaintiffs were not members of the Board \"at all times relevant to the proceedings or at all\", and, in the alternative, that if they were such members they were barred from bringing this action by reason of a waiver of all rights of action arising out of the disciplining of members, which waiver is contained in the by-laws of the Board. In his decision, the learned trial judge, after a very lengthy review of the evidence, concluded that there were no irregularities in the proceedings of the Board, its directors or its committee of such a character as to invalidate the expulsion which he found to have been lawfully imposed and directed. Having reached this conclusion, the learned trial judge did not find it necessary to deal with the allegation that the plaintiffs were never properly elected to membership or the alternative defence that if they were members their right of action was barred by the by-laws.\nIn the course of his decision, rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, Davey J.A., having found that Moscrop was a member of the Board at all relevant times, went on to say:\nBut, in my opinion, this appeal must be determined against the Board upon the invalidity of the order of expulsion itself, resulting from serious violations of the bylaws in respect of the form the order took and the notice given the Company. It will not be necessary to consider the validity of the appeal proceedings, except to say that these initial violations of the bylaws vitiated all that followed.\nLater in the same judgment it is said:\nThus the directors' failure to specify on March 1st, 1956, the corrective action that they recommended and upon which they might waive the expulsion, and the appellants' ignorance that the expulsion might be waived if they took the appropriate action dogged the appellants throughout all appeal proceedings and nullified them.\nIn my opinion, the expulsion order cannot stand against the Company and must be set aside, and the Company restored to full membership in the Board.\nThe Court of Appeal further held that the allegation that Moscrop was barred from bringing the action by the terms of its membership could not be supported because the requirement for members to sign a waiver of claim against the Society at the time of their election did not come into existence until the enactment of the by-laws of 1955 and was only referable to and binding upon members who were elected subsequent to that date.\nAlthough in its pleadings Moscrop described its claim as one for \"general damages\", (a) for wrongful expulsion; and (b) for loss of business and profits arising out of such wrongful expulsion, the Court of Appeal nevertheless held, following its own decision on an interlocutory appeal (see Wyman and Moscrop Realty Limited v. Vancouver Real Estate Board No. 4)[2], \"that in the circumstances of this case there was a sufficient allegation of and prayer for special damages\" and accordingly ordered a new trial confined solely to the question of damages which were not assessed by the learned trial judge.\nIn the factum filed on behalf of the appellant, it is alleged that the Court of Appeal erred in manner following:\n1. In holding that Moscrop was a member of the appellant Board at all times material to this action.\n2. In failing to hold that if Moscrop was a member of the appellant Board and wrongfully expelled, that it had waived its claim to damages.\n3. In failing to award nominal damages only in that Moscrop asked for general damages only and did not plead or prove any special damages.\n4. In failing to find that Moscrop had suffered no financial loss and was therefore entitled to nominal damages only.\n5. In directing that the action be referred back to the Court below for a new trial.\nIn support of the first of these allegations, counsel for the appellant drew attention to the fact that the by-laws as revised to August 1953 contained the following provision in Art. 1(1):\nIn the case of firms or corporations, in order that a firm or corporation may be deemed a member of the Society, it shall be necessary that a partner of such firm, or an official of such corporation, be elected as a member of the Society \u2026.\nIt was argued that Moscrop's compliance with the terms of this by-law at the time of its initial election only accorded it the status of being \"deemed a member\" and that this did not constitute active membership and in any event that it lost the status of being \"deemed a member\" when it ceased to have an official as its nominee on the Board and that it certainly could not be said to have continued to be \"deemed a member\" after the new by-laws were enacted in 1955 because those by-laws contemplate the election of individuals only to membership on the Board. Great stress was laid by appellant's counsel on the meaning to be attached to the word \"deemed\" as used in the above-quoted article of the by-law, and it was urged that it should be given the meaning attributed to it by Cave J. in Regina v. Norfolk County Council[3], where, in construing the phrase \"the following areas shall be deemed to be highway areas \u2026\", he said:\nGenerally speaking when you talk of a thing being deemed to be something, you do not mean that it is that which it is deemed to be. It is rather an admission that it is not what it is deemed to be, and that, notwithstanding it is not that particular thing, nevertheless for the purposes of the Act, it is deemed to be that thing.\nThe word \"deemed\" is obviously capable of more than one meaning depending upon the context in which it is used. In the present circumstances, although far from saying that the quotation is of general application, I am of opinion that the word bears the meaning assigned to it by Coleridge J. in Wolton v. Gavin[4], where he was construing the phrase \"deemed to be enlisted as a soldier in Her Majesty's Service\" and said:\nWhen an Act of Parliament says that a person is deemed to be in any particular capacity, surely that must be understood to mean that he is thenceforward taken as actually the very person that he is deemed to be.\nI am accordingly of opinion that Moscrop, having been duly elected to active membership in the appellant Board in 1951, remained a member at all times relevant to these proceedings. It does not appear that any steps were ever taken to terminate Moscrop's membership on the ground that it had no individual representative as a member of the Board, and as the by-laws make no provision for automatic expulsion of a corporation on this ground, the validity of the membership to which it was initially admitted remains undisturbed.\nIn construing these by-laws, it is to be remembered that they are the by-laws of the very Board which now seeks to invoke them against the respondent and that this same Board recognized the respondent's membership for four years and endorsed this recognition by ordering its expulsion. The allegation that Moscrop was barred from recovering any damages by the terms of its membership was based on the following provision of the 1955 by-laws of the appellant Board:\nArticle 2\u2014Membership\nPart A\u2014Qualifications\n\u2026Section 2\u2014Qualification for Membership\u2026\nThe Directors may elect to membership, in accordance with the terms of these By-laws, any individual who is eligible for membership in the Society \u2026and signs an irrevocable Waiver of Claim against the Society, or any member or agent for any act in connection with the business of the society, and particularly as to its or their acts in electing or failing to elect or disciplining him as a member \u2026.\nAs Moscrop had, in my opinion, already been elected to membership at the time when this by-law came into effect, it cannot, in my view, be construed as being in any way bound by the \"irrevocable Waiver of Claim against the Society\" which persons seeking election after 1955 were required to sign. I agree with the Court of Appeal that Moscrop's claim for damages is in no way affected by the terms of the by-law last referred to.\nOn the question of damages the appellant contends that the respondent's pleadings have been designedly limited to a claim for \"general damages\" and that only nominal damages are recoverable under this heading in an action for breach of contract.\nThis very point was the subject of an appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia from the dismissal of an application to strike out the claim for \"general damages\" in the respondent's statement of claim, and in the course of delivering the reasons for judgment of that Court which have heretofore been referred to (see Wyman and Moscrop Realty Limited v. Vancouver Real Estate Board No. 4) supra, Coady J.A. read:\nIt is contended that this should be a claim for special damages and not general damages. I think that submission finds some support in the cases to which counsel for the appellant has referred, but in that connection the observations of Atkinson J. in Aerial Advertising Co. v. Batchelor Peas Ltd. [1938] 2 All E.R. 788 at 795 are to be noted. In this case, however, since particulars of what was claimed under this heading were upon demand supplied to the appellant and since counsel for the appellant admits that he is not therefore embarrassed by this pleading of general damages, if the action proceeds to trial in the form it now appears, it would therefore appear that the learned Judge below was right, in the exercise of his discretion, in his refusal to strike out that pleading which designated the damages claimed for loss of business and profits under a heading of general damages rather than special damages.\nThe pleadings were amended and the action proceeded to trial in accordance with this decision from which no appeal has been taken to this Court and which must, for the purposes of this case, be regarded as conclusive.\nIt was also contended on behalf of the appellant that the evidence does not disclose that Moscrop suffered any financial loss, but the Court of Appeal, acting pursuant to the powers conferred upon it by the Court of Appeal Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 74, and the rules made thereunder has directed a new trial confined to the question of damages only and as I do not feel that this order should be interfered with, it follows that the question of whether or not Moscrop suffered damage must await the outcome of such new trial.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Shulman, Tupper, Gray, Worrall & Berger, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960), 23 D.L.R.

The by-laws of the defendant hospital enact that all doctors attached to the hospital in any capacity whatsoever shall constitute the medical board of the hospital; that the appointment of doctors to the staff of the hospital is to be made by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Medical Board; that if the Board of Directors refuse to re-appoint a doctor to the Medical Board it must notify the Medical Board, give reasons for its decision and request the recommendation of another doctor; that in no case can the Board of Directors dispose of an application, refuse to renew, or annul a nomination made prior without the recommendation of the Medical Board. On January 31, 1956, the Board of Directors passed a resolution refusing to renew the plaintiff's engagement as a member of the Medical Board, although the Medical Board had recommended the renewal of his appointment.\nIn his action the plaintiff asked for a writ of mandamus ordering the defendant to renew his nomination, and the annulment of the resolution. The trial judge granted both these conclusions. This judgment was modified by the Court of Appeal which declared the resolution illegal, null and void, but deleted the part which dealt with the mandamus. The defendant appealed to this Court and there was no cross-appeal with respect to the writ of mandamus.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe plaintiff's engagement was not legally terminated. The resolution was in direct contradiction with the by-laws of the hospital since the refusal to renew the engagement was made without the recommendation of the Medical Board. The Board of Directors could not act ex parte and bypass the by-laws.\nThe fact that the judgment below refused the mandamus did not make that judgment merely declaratory. The judgment annuled the resolution and redressed a wrong complained of. The remedy was the annulment of the resolution and that is where the execution of the judgment was to be found.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, modifying a judgment of Sylvestre J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. Filion, Q.C., and J. Laurendeau, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. G. Ahern, Q.C., and J. Y. Debrabant, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2015L'intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de mandamus enjoignant \u00e0 l'appelante de renouveler sa nomination comme membre du bureau m\u00e9dical de la corporation appelante pour l'ann\u00e9e 1956, et l'annulation d'une r\u00e9solution adopt\u00e9e le 31 janvier 1956. L'intim\u00e9 est membre du Coll\u00e8ge des m\u00e9decins et chirurgiens de la province de Quebec, et au moment o\u00f9 ont commenc\u00e9 les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures, exer\u00e7ait sa profession depuis au del\u00e0 de quinze ans. En qualit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decin au service de la corporation appelante, il a fait partie du bureau m\u00e9dical de cette derni\u00e8re depuis 1940 jusqu'au d\u00e9but de f\u00e9vrier 1956, date o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de sa destitution.\nL'intim\u00e9 soutient que la r\u00e9solution en date du 31 janvier 1956, dont copie lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise, est ill\u00e9gale, contraire \u00e0 la lettre et \u00e0 l'esprit des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires qui r\u00e9gissent la corporation, et il demande qu'elle soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e nulle.\nL'appelante a contest\u00e9 la requ\u00eate, et l'honorable Juge Sylvestre de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, a maintenu la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nulle et ill\u00e9gale la r\u00e9solution en date du 31 janvier 1956, et a enjoint \u00e0 la corporation appelante de renouveler la nomination de l'intim\u00e9 comme membre du bureau m\u00e9dical de la corporation pour l'ann\u00e9e 1956, et de permettre au requ\u00e9rant de faire hospitaliser, et de soigner ses patients \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc de Montr\u00e9al.\nLa Cour du banc de la reine2 a modifi\u00e9 ce jugement, et a fait droit \u00e0 l'appel \u00e0 la seule fin de retrancher du jugement frapp\u00e9 d'appel la partie qui a trait aux conclusions du mandamus. La Cour du banc de la reine a donc maintenu l'action du requ\u00e9rant avec d\u00e9pens contre la corporation en ce qui concerne seulement la demande de nullit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9e.\nLa corporation appelante a log\u00e9 un appel devant cette Cour, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu la permission d'appeler par jugement rendu le 26 novembre 1958. Il se trouve donc que le seul point en litige devant cette Cour est d'examiner la validit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution qui mettait fin \u00e0 l'engagement du Dr Garneau, et nous n'avons pas en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 juger du droit au mandamus r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9, vu que devant cette Cour aucun contre-appel n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 log\u00e9.\nL'appelante est une corporation autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 recevoir des patients et \u00e0 les traiter. Cet h\u00f4pital est r\u00e9gi par une charte amend\u00e9e, adopt\u00e9e par la L\u00e9gislature en 1939 (3 Geo. VI, ch. 143). En vertu de cette charte, la corporation est form\u00e9e de gouverneurs choisis et nomm\u00e9s suivant les r\u00e8glements de la corporation. Tous les r\u00e8glements de la corporation doivent \u00eatre approuv\u00e9s par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil, sur la recommandation du Ministre provincial de la Sant\u00e9. La charte pourvoit en outre \u00e0 ce que la corporation soit dirig\u00e9e et administr\u00e9e par un bureau d'administration d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et \u00e9lu de la mani\u00e8re prescrite aux r\u00e8glements qui doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis par le bureau d'administration, et qui doivent recevoir \u00e9galement l'approbation du Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil sur la recommandation du Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9.\nLes m\u00e9decins attach\u00e9s \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital constituent le bureau m\u00e9dical, et ce bureau est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 passer des r\u00e8glements qui doivent \u00eatre approuv\u00e9s par le bureau des gouverneurs et par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil. Les mots \u00abBureau M\u00e9dical\u00bb sont d\u00e9finis dans les r\u00e8glements et signifient \u00abl'ensemble des m\u00e9decins ayant le privil\u00e8ge de traiter des patients \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc\u00bb.\nEn vertu des r\u00e8glements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s par le bureau m\u00e9dical, \u00e0 la fin de chaque ann\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire dans le cours du mois de d\u00e9cembre, les officiers pour l'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 venir doivent \u00eatre \u00e9lus \u00abet les recommandations pour les nominations des membres en service actif doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre faites\u00bb. Ces recommandations doivent \u00eatre transmises au bureau d'administration, vu que c'est le devoir de ce dernier de nommer les membres du bureau m\u00e9dical pour l'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 venir.\nLe 28 d\u00e9cembre 1955, les administrateurs de l'h\u00f4pital Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc n'avaient pas encore re\u00e7u les recommandations que devait leur faire parvenir le bureau m\u00e9dical pour l'ann\u00e9e 1956. Apparement, un plan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 pour recruter des m\u00e9decins et des chirurgiens, et une r\u00e9solution fut pass\u00e9e suspendant toutes les recommandations par le bureau m\u00e9dical, et on voulait \u00e9videmment \u00e9tablir une proc\u00e9dure nouvelle afin de d\u00e9terminer les nominations qui devaient \u00eatre faites.\nLe 19 janvier 1956, les administrateurs se sont r\u00e9unis en assembl\u00e9e, et aucune recommandation pour la nomination de m\u00e9decins au bureau m\u00e9dical n'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue, les administrateurs furent inform\u00e9s que les recommandations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, mais pas encore transmises au bureau. Le jour suivant, soit le 20 janvier 1956, une lettre sign\u00e9e par le Dr Ducharme, secr\u00e9taire du bureau m\u00e9dical, a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e au Dr Mercille. Cette lettre contenait les noms de tous les m\u00e9decins recommand\u00e9s pour l'ann\u00e9e 1956, et demandait l'approbation des administrateurs. Parmi ces noms recommand\u00e9s par le bureau m\u00e9dical se trouvait le nom l'intim\u00e9, le Dr Georges Garneau.\nLe plan sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par le bureau des administrateurs \u00e9tait que tous les m\u00e9decins attach\u00e9s \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital \u00e0 la fin de 1955, devaient \u00e9crire personnellement \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital pour obtenir un renouvellement de leur emploi. Plusieurs se rendirent \u00e0 cette exigence du bureau des administrateurs, mais d'autres, comme le Dr Garneau, le Dr Manseau et le Dr Laricheli\u00e8re, ne firent pas parvenir de semblable lettre.\nLe 31 janvier 1956, \u00e0 une r\u00e9union du bureau des administrateurs, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'ignorer les recommandations faites par le bureau m\u00e9dical, de refuser la nomination des trois m\u00e9decins ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s pour l'ann\u00e9e 1956 \"pour cause de refus total de coop\u00e9ration et d'insubordination marqu\u00e9e\"; de nommer au bureau m\u00e9dical tous les m\u00e9decins qui avaient fait leur application par \u00e9crit, et de suspendre tous les autres m\u00e9decins qui ne s'\u00e9taient pas rendus \u00e0 la demande du bureau des administrateurs, telle que contenue dans sa lettre du 19 janvier 1956. C'est alors que l'intim\u00e9 Garneau institua les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures.\nL'appelante soutient que la Cour du banc de la reine, ayant refus\u00e9 d'accorder les conclusions contenues au bref de mandamus, n'avait pas de juridiction l'autorisant \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer invalide la r\u00e9solution du bureau d'administration en date du 31 janvier 1956, car ce jugement n'\u00e9tant qu'un jugement d\u00e9claratoire, n'\u00e9tait pas susceptible d'ex\u00e9cution en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 541 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile. L'appelante soutient additionnellement que la r\u00e9solution du 31 janvier 1956 est l\u00e9gale, r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et valide, et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e par le bureau d'administration dans l'exercice de sa discr\u00e9tion.\nLa charte de la corporation appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 refondue par la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec en 1939, et la loi se trouve au statut 3 Geo. VI, 1939, ch. 143. En vertu de cette loi, la corporation est form\u00e9e de gouverneurs choisis et nomm\u00e9s suivant les r\u00e8glements de la corporation, et celle-ci est dirig\u00e9e et administr\u00e9e par un bureau d'administration d\u00e9sign\u00e9 et \u00e9lu de la mani\u00e8re prescrite aux r\u00e8glements. En outre, tous les m\u00e9decins attach\u00e9s \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit, forment le bureau m\u00e9dical de l'h\u00f4pital. Ce bureau \u00e9tablit les r\u00e8glements concernant les services m\u00e9dicaux, chirurgicaux et scientifiques de l'h\u00f4spital, et ces derniers, avant de devenir en vigueur, doivent \u00eatre approuv\u00e9s par le bureau d'administration et par le Lieu-tenant-Gouverneur en Conseil sur la recommandation du Ministre de la Sant\u00e9.\nPour donner suite \u00e0 cette l\u00e9gislation, le bureau d'administration a \u00e9tabli des r\u00e8glements modifiant les anciens qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil, tel que ci-dessus requis. Le bureau m\u00e9dical a \u00e9galement adopt\u00e9 ces r\u00e8glements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par le bureau d'administration et aussi sanctionn\u00e9s par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil. Le nombre des gouverneurs est illimit\u00e9, mais le nombre des administrateurs est de vingt-quatre, d\u00e9sign\u00e9s, choisis ou \u00e9lus parmi les gouverneurs. Les administrateurs ont une juridiction et une autorit\u00e9 compl\u00e8tes et absolues sur tout l'h\u00f4pital. Ces administrateurs doivent se r\u00e9unir au moins une fois par mois, et dans le bureau des administrateurs, il doit y avoir deux d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s du bureau m\u00e9dical. Le quorum d'une assembl\u00e9e du bureau d'administration est de cinq administrateurs ayant droit de vote, et en cas d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des votes, le pr\u00e9sident a une voix additionnelle pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante. Le surintendant fait partie ex officio du bureau d'administration o\u00f9 il si\u00e8ge \u00e0 titre consultatif seulement et il remplit, en vertu de l'art. 30 (c), la fonction d'agent de liaison entre le bureau m\u00e9dical et le bureau d'administration. Dans le temps o\u00f9 ce litige a pris naissance, le Dr Mercille remplissait la fonction de surintendant.\nLes articles des r\u00e8glements qui n\u00e9cessitent consid\u00e9ration sp\u00e9ciale dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, sont les arts. 37 et 38 qui se lisent de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n37. Les nominations doivent \u00eatre faites par le bureau d'administration de l'h\u00f4pital pour une p\u00e9riode d'un an ou pour la balance de l'ann\u00e9e alors en cours.\n38. A la fin de l'ann\u00e9e fiscale, le bureau d'administration peut renommer tous les membres du bureau m\u00e9dical \u00e0 la condition que le bureau m\u00e9dical n'ait pas recommand\u00e9 que telle nomination en particulier ne soit pas renouvel\u00e9e. Sauf ce cas, toutes les nominations peuvent \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9es. Cependant, si le bureau d'administration veut prendre l'initiative de refuser le renouvellement d'une nomination, il doit en aviser le bureau m\u00e9dical, donner les raisons de sa d\u00e9cision et demander la recommandation d'un autre candidat. En aucun cas, le bureau d'administration ne disposera d'une candidature, refusera de renouveler ou annuler une nomination faite ant\u00e9rieurement, sans la recommandation du bureau m\u00e9dical.\nOn voit donc \u00e0 la lecture de ces deux r\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s par la corporation appelante, u'il appartient au bureau des administrateurs de faire les nominations des m\u00e9decins qui doivent \u00eatre attach\u00e9s au bureau m\u00e9dical pour une p\u00e9riode d'un an.\nMais avant que la d\u00e9cision du bureau des administrateurs ne soit rendue, il y a certaines exigences requises par les r\u00e8glements. Ainsi, \u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e fiscale, la nomination de tous les membres du bureau m\u00e9dical par le bureau d'administration peut \u00eatre faite, \u00e0 condition que le bureau m\u00e9dical n'ait pas recommand\u00e9 que telle nomination ne soit pas faite. Tel n'est pas le cas qui nous occupe, car tous les m\u00e9decins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9s. Mais il peut arriver que le bureau des administrateurs d\u00e9cide de prendre l'initiative, malgr\u00e9 la recommandation du bureau m\u00e9dical, de refuser un ou plusieurs renouvellements, mais dans ce cas, il doit en aviser le bureau m\u00e9dical, donner les raisons de sa d\u00e9cision, et demander la recommandation d'un autre candidat. Dans aucun cas cependant, ajoute le r\u00e8glement 38, le bureau des administrateurs ne peut disposer d'une candidature, refuser un renouvellement, ou annuler une recommandation faite ant\u00e9rieurement, sans la recommandation du bureau m\u00e9dical.\nLe bureau des administrateurs aurait pu, en vertu de ce r\u00e8glement no. 38, prendre l'initiative de refuser le renouvellement de l'engagement du Dr Garneau; c'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 son droit, en vertu des r\u00e8glements, d'adopter cette attitude. Mais, il aurait fallu que le bureau des administrateurs avise le bureau m\u00e9dical du refus et demande sa recommandation. Le r\u00e8glement est pr\u00e9cis, et m\u00eame s'il y a eu une recommandation faite ant\u00e9rieurement, il faut une nouvelle recommandation du bureau m\u00e9dical pour refuser le renouvellement.\nCe n'est \u00e9videmment pas ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Le bureau des administrateurs a pris une autre initiative, et \u00e0 sa r\u00e9union du 19 janvier 1956, date o\u00f9 l'assembl\u00e9e \u00e9tait inform\u00e9e par le Dr Manseau que les nominations et les recommandations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites par le bureau m\u00e9dical, le conseil des administrateurs a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'adresser \u00e0 chacun des m\u00e9decins du bureau m\u00e9dical, une lettre l'enjoignant d'adresser par \u00e9crit, le ou avant le 29 janvier 1956, au surintendant m\u00e9dical de l'h\u00f4pital, une demande de renouvellement d'engagement s'il d\u00e9sirait faire partie du bureau m\u00e9dical pour l'ann\u00e9e 1956. Ce n'est pas l\u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure qu'il faut suivre pour les renouvellements. On a plut\u00f4t suivi la proc\u00e9dure pour les nouvelles applications, et non celle qui doit \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e pour les renouvellements.\nA une r\u00e9union du conseil d'administration tenue le 31 janvier 1956, le Dr Jean Mercille, surintendant et directeur m\u00e9dical, a fait rapport aux administrateurs que trente-et-un m\u00e9decins s'\u00e9taient rendus \u00e0 la demande du conseil d'administration, et avaient requis par \u00e9crit le renouvellement de leur engagement; un m\u00e9decin a adress\u00e9 une lettre de d\u00e9mission, un autre a fait adresser un avis d'absence, et un troisi\u00e8me a envoy\u00e9 un t\u00e9l\u00e9gramme. L'intim\u00e9 le Dr Garneau, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 recommand\u00e9 suivant le r\u00e8glement 38 par le bureau m\u00e9dical, n'a pas fait d'application, de m\u00eame que les Docteurs Raymond Laricheli\u00e8re et J. A. Manseau. Il a en cons\u00e9quence \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e et r\u00e9solu ce qui suit:\n1\u00ba de mettre fin, pour cause de refus total de coop\u00e9ration et d'insubordination marqu\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'engagement de messieurs les docteurs J. A. Manseau, Georges Garneau et Raymond Laricheli\u00e8re comme membres du bureau m\u00e9dical de l'H\u00f4pital Ste-Jeanne d'Arc de Montr\u00e9al, de refuser le renouvellement de leur engagement pour l'ann\u00e9e 1956, de leur refuser en cons\u00e9quence, d\u00e8s r\u00e9ception par chacun d'eux des pr\u00e9sentes, tous les privil\u00e8ges accord\u00e9s aux m\u00e9decins attach\u00e9s \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, de leur refuser l'acc\u00e8s de tous les services de l'h\u00f4pital, de refuser d'accepter ieurs patients dans l'un quelconque des services d'hospitalisation, d'enlever leurs noms du tableau des m\u00e9decins attach\u00e9s \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital et d'ordonner \u00e0 l'administrateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et au surintendant et directeur m\u00e9dical d'ex\u00e9cuter la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision du conseil d'administration et de la faire respecter dans tous et chacun des services de l'H\u00f4pital Ste-Jeanne d'Arc de Montr\u00e9al;\n2\u00b0 de nommer messieurs les m\u00e9decins dont les noms suivent et qui ont demand\u00e9 leur admission et le renouvellement de leur engagement conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'avis du 19 janvier 1956, membres du bureau m\u00e9dical de l'H\u00f4pital Ste-Jeanne d'Arc de Montr\u00e9al et faisant partie comme tels du groupe des m\u00e9decins attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la corporation.\n(Suit la liste des noms des m\u00e9decins dont l'engagement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 par le Conseil d'Administration.)\nIl est bon de remarquer que le bureau m\u00e9dical avait fait ses recommandations en d\u00e9cembre 1955, \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e o\u00f9 le repr\u00e9sentant du conseil d'administration \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent, et que le conseil d'administration a re\u00e7u ces recommandations par \u00e9crit le 20 janvier 1956. L'on peut voir \u00e0 la lecture du paragraphe 2 de la r\u00e9solution cit\u00e9e plus haut que le conseil d'administration a renouvel\u00e9 l'engagement seulement de ceux qui s'\u00e9taient conform\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande faite par le bureau des administrateurs, de faire parvenir une demande de renouvellement. Ceci n'est pas la proc\u00e9dure qui doit \u00eatre suivie, suivant les r\u00e8glements sanctionn\u00e9s par le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil. La proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre, c'est celle pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'art. 38 des r\u00e8glements, et \u00e9videmment, elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie. On objecte que le bureau des administrateurs peut prendre l'initiative que j'ai signal\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment et refuser un renouvellement propos\u00e9 par le bureau m\u00e9dical, mais dans ce cas, le bureau m\u00e9dical doit en \u00eatre avis\u00e9, les raisons doivent \u00eatre donn\u00e9es, et dans aucun cas, dit le r\u00e8glement 38, le bureau des administrateurs ne peut disposer d'une candidature, refuser un renouvellement ou annuler une nomination sans la recommandation du bureau m\u00e9dical. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, le bureau des administrateurs ne pouvait pas de sa propre initiative nommer seulement ceux qui en avaient fait la demande par \u00e9crit, vu que cette proc\u00e9dure n'est pas autoris\u00e9e dans les cas de renouvellements. Si le bureau des administrateurs a voulu agir suivant les dispositions du r\u00e8glement 38, alors, il devait, s'il refusait de nommer de nouveau l'intim\u00e9, demander la recommandation du bureau m\u00e9dical suivant les dispositions imp\u00e9ratives de ce r\u00e8glement. C'est ce qui doit \u00eatre fait dans tous les cas, et c'est ce qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cas pr\u00e9sent.\nIl s'ensuit donc que le bureau des administrateurs n'a pas suivi les prescriptions impos\u00e9es par les r\u00e8glements de la corporation, et que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement d\u00e9mis de ses fonctions. Le conseil d'administration, lorsqu'il s'agit de renouvellements d'engagements des membres du corps m\u00e9dical, n'a pas de pouvoirs dictatoriaux. Il ne peut agir ex parte, et ignorer les r\u00e8glements qui lui imposent l'obligation d'obtenir la recommandation du bureau m\u00e9dical. Il est imp\u00e9ratif qu'il en soit ainsi, et le Lieutenant-Gouverneur en Conseil, en sanctionnant le r\u00e8glement n\u00b0 38, a \u00e9videmment jug\u00e9 bon que le bureau m\u00e9dical ait son mot \u00e0 dire dans le choix des m\u00e9decins.\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle je suis arriv\u00e9 concernant la validit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution, il devient inutile d'examiner la question de savoir s'il y avait le quorum requis \u00e0 l'assembl\u00e9e du bureau m\u00e9dical. L'appelante a enfin invoqu\u00e9 l'argument que le jugement rendu par la Cour du banc de la reine n'est qu'un jugement d\u00e9claratoire, non susceptible d'ex\u00e9cution. Je ne puis m'accorder avec cette pr\u00e9tention que je crois non fond\u00e9e. Il est certain que les tribunaux ne doivent pas donner des consultations l\u00e9gales, et qu'ils doivent s'abstenir de se prononcer sur des questions acad\u00e9miques, mais tel n'est pas le cas qui se pr\u00e9sente. Ici, le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, s'il refuse le mandamus demand\u00e9, il annule une r\u00e9solution et redresse un tort dont l'intim\u00e9 souffrait pr\u00e9judice. Il apporte un rem\u00e8de qui est l'annulation de la r\u00e9solution, et comme le dit M. le Juge Cross, c'est l\u00e0 m\u00eame que se trouve l'ex\u00e9cution du jugement.

Gagnon and Others (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nFoundation Maritime Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1960: October 17, 18; 1961: April 25.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL DIVISION\nLabour\u2014Request of unregistered unions for recognition refused\u2014Subsequent picketing resulting in work stoppage\u2014Unlawful strike constituting tortious conspiracy\u2014Labour Relations Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 124, ss. 22(1), 23.\nWhile the plaintiff company was engaged in the construction of a wharf at St. John, New Brunswick, under a contract with the Department of Public Works, certain union organizers, who claimed that they repre- sented more than fifty per cent of the employees, asked for recognition of their unions. The company refused their request on the ground that the unions had not been certified under the Labour Relations Act. The subsequent establishment of a picket line brought the entire operation to a halt, and the work stoppage continued until an interim injunction was obtained to stop the picketing. At the trial, the plaintiff was awarded damages and an injunction restraining all picketing. On appeal, the damages were reduced but the injunction was affirmed. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright and Ritchie JJ.: The submission that the prohibition with respect to striking contained in s. 22(1) of the Labour Relations Act only applied to employees on whose behalf an application for certification was pending before the Board was rejected.\nThe defendants not only formed a common design to obtain recognition for their uncertified unions, which would not of itself have been unlawful, but agreed to achieve this end by organizing a stoppage of work, which constituted a \"strike\" within the meaning of the Act on the part of a group of employees who were prohibited from striking by the terms of s. 22(1).\nIt was unnecessary to determine whether or not a breach of s. 22(1) gave rise to a statutory cause of action because when inquiry was \"made of the statute law\" it disclosed that the means here employed by the defendants were prohibited, and this of itself supplied the ingredient necessary to change a lawful agreement which would not give rise to a cause of action into a tortious conspiracy, the carrying out of which exposed the conspirators to an action for damages if any ensued therefrom. Therien v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, [1960] S.C.R. 265, referred to.\nIt was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove that actual breaches of contract took place in order to sustain the plea of conspiracy because the evidence supported the allegation that the defendants wrongfully conspired to procure, cause and induce the employees of the plaintiff to abstain from work.\nPer Locke J.: The action of the defendants in causing or inducing the employees to cease to work was a tortious act for which they were liable in damages. It was clear that their actions in setting up the picket line were carried on in combination for the purpose of causing injury to the plaintiff by unlawful means.\nAt the time the picket line was established the plaintiff, by virtue of its contract, was entitled and was required to enter upon the premises of the Crown for the purpose of carrying on the work of construction and to do so, in the circumstances then existing, without interference by the defendants or anyone else with the entry of its employees upon the premises. In these circumstances the conduct of the defendants was a private nuisance and, as damage resulted, actionable. Lumley v. Gye (1853), 2 E. & B. 216; Quinn v. Leathern, [1901] A.C. 495; Lyons v. Wilkins, [1899] 1 Ch. 255, referred to; Williams v. Aristocratic Restaurants (1947) Ltd., [1951] S.C.R. 762, distinguished.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The prohibitions of s. 22 of the Act applied only where an application for certification was pending, and the only other prohibition against striking was contained in s. 23 which did not touch this case. Therefore there was no breach of the Act which could turn the conduct here complained of into a tortious conspiracy. The conspiracy as found by the Court of Appeal was never pleaded. It was not open to that Court to base its judgment, of its own mere motion, on a conspiracy which had never been pleaded and which the defendants had no opportunity to answer.\nThe defendants in pursuit of the legal object of union recognition employed means which were neither criminal nor tortious in themselves but which, on one reading of the Act, could be held to be prohibited conduct. This did not make them guilty of the tort of conspiracy. In the law of civil conspiracy the unlawful means must be found in nominate torts or crimes.\nThere was no question of doing something lawful by unlawful means. If the conduct of the defendants was held to be contrary to the legislation, then the conspiracy was to do something forbidden by the Act. They should have been prosecuted for this breach, with leave of the Board, or if the plaintiff wanted damages, its claim was to be founded on a breach of the Act and no more\u2014not on conspiracy.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division1, varying a judgment of Ritchie J. as to damages but affirming injunction granted. Appeal dismissed, Judson J. dissenting.\nI. P. Macklin, for defendants, appellants.\nA. B. Gilbert, Q.C., P. M. Laing, Q.C., and T. L. McGloan, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C. J. and of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014The evidence in this case discloses that in the early days of July 1958, at a time when the respondent company was employing some 190 workmen without labour difficulty, dispute or complaint of any kind, on the construction of a wharf for the Department of Transport at Saint John, New Brunswick, the three appellants Gagnon, Black-man and Merloni, accompanied by others, called on the superintendent on this job, asking that the company recognize certain unions which they claimed to represent. The superintendent told these men that the matter was one which would have to be decided by other company officials who would be in Saint John during the following week, and, accordingly, on July 15 the same three appellants and some other persons called on the company's construction manager who describes the interview in the following terms:\nMr. Merloni appeared to be the spokesman for the group. He asked if we would be prepared to recognize their union and sign an agreement with them. I asked him if their unions were certified and they were the legal bargaining agents and he replied they were not certified under the New Brunswick laws but had more than fifty per cent of the men who had signed cards with their groups and would we recognize them on that basis. I said \"No,\" they should be certified under the law and we would not recognize them or sign an agreement with them on that basis.\u2026 The discussion I had was with Mr. Merloni. He was the spokesman. When I told him we would not recognize them or sign an agreement with them, the discussion ended and they left. When leaving Mr. Merloni said they were willing at this time to discuss the matter with us but there would come a time when we would have to bargain with them on their terms.\nThe superintendent, who was also present at the meeting, recounts Merloni's parting words as being, \"the time will come when you will recognize us on our basis and there will be no discussion.\"\nOn the morning of July 23 (eight days after the meeting) it became apparent that the means which Gagnon, Black-man and Merloni had decided to adopt to achieve recognition without certification under the Labour Relations Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 124, was to bring about a cessation of work at the company's premises by persuading the other appellants to parade outside the entrances thereto, carrying placards which read \"Engineers, Teamsters & Labourers on strike against Foundation Maritime Limited\". Although the picketing itself was, in my opinion, peaceful, it would be totally unrealistic to regard it as an exercise of any right of employees to peacefully inform other persons that they were on strike. There is no evidence that there was anything in the nature of a strike in progress before the placards were paraded and the picket line established. The purpose of the picketing and parading of placards was not to inform other people that a strike existed but rather to create a situation which would result in a cessation of work, constituting a strike within the meaning of the Labour Relations Act, s. l(p), and thus to achieve recognition for unions which were not prepared to comply with the provisions of the statute regarding certification.\nThe result of these activities was that none of the company's employees (except office workers and supervising staff) crossed the picket line although there were employees who otherwise would have been willing to return to work. Work ceased entirely until July 28th, when, after an interlocutory injunction had been granted to restrain the picketing, some 30 per cent of the men returned to work to be followed by others during the next seven days. The judgment of the learned trial judge which declared the strike and picketing to have been unlawful, awarded damages in the sum of $22,712.39 and granted an order restraining the appellants from picketing, was based on the grounds that the employees had been intimidated by the pickets, that there had been a tortious interference with the company's contractual relations with its employees and with the Department of Public Works, and that any picketing in furtherance of an illegal strike should be restrained.\nIn affirming the decision of the learned trial judge, subject to a reduction of the damages to the amount of $12,500, the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick2 based its decision on the ground that the appellants had brought about a strike in contravention of the Labour Relations Act and had thus employed unlawful means to achieve their object so as to make them parties to an actionable conspiracy and liable for the damages flowing therefrom and subject to restraint by injunction from repetition of any acts in furtherance of such unlawful means.\nIn resting his decision on this ground, Bridges J.A., speaking on behalf of the Appeal Division, said:\nIn an action based on conspiracy we do not think it necessary for the plaintiff to prove that actual breaches of contracts took place. In the case at bar the plaintiff's employees were induced to abstain from work, which, in our view, is sufficient.\nIn our opinion, Gagnon, Blackman, Merloni and the other defendants who acted as pickets combined in inducing workmen of the plaintiff to refrain from working. Their object was to obtain recognition of the Unions without certification, which, in itself, was not unlawful but the means they used, a strike in violation of the Labour Relations Act, was and they have therefore no defence to the action. Any act done in furtherance of the unlawful means should, in our opinion, be restrained. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to an injunction against picketing in addition to damages.\nA conspiracy consists, not merely in the intention of two or more but in the agreement of two or more, to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. The essence of the crime of conspiracy lies in the agreement itself which may be punishable, although no action has been taken pursuant to it, but the tort of conspiracy sounds in damages and is concerned only with the effect upon others of steps taken to carry out such an agreement. It is apparent from the language used by Merloni, coupled with the stoppage of work for which he, Blackman and Gagnon were primarily responsible, not only that they had formed a common design to obtain recognition for their uncertified unions, which would not of itself have been unlawful, but that they had agreed to achieve this end by organizing and creating a stoppage of work at the respondent's premises. In carying out this design, they enlisted the aid of the other appellants who thus became parties to the agreement. There can be no doubt that the means employed by the appellants resulted in damages to the respondent, but the question which bears further examination is whether or not these means were unlawful in such manner as to taint the whole agreement with the tortious quality necessary to give rise to liability.\nBoth the learned trial judge and the Appeal Division were satisfied that this stoppage of work constituted a strike which was in contravention of s. 22(1) of the Labour Relations Act and therefore unlawful, but as there is a wide difference between the parties to this appeal as to the true meaning to be attached to this subsection, it becomes necessary to analyze its provisions in the framework of the statute as a whole. Section 22 reads as follows:\n22. (1) No employee in a unit shall strike until a bargaining agent has become entitled on behalf of the unit of employees to require their employer by notice under this Act to commence collective bargaining with a view to the conclusion or renewal or revision of a collective agreement and the provisions of section 20, or as the case may be, have been complied with.\n(2) No employer shall declare or cause a lockout of employees while an application for certification of a bargaining agent to act for such employees is pending before the Board.\nThe conditions under which a bargaining agent may become entitled to require an employer by notice to commence collective bargaining are prescribed in s. 11 of the Act which reads as follows:\n11. Where the Board has under this Act certified a trade union as a bargaining agent of employees in a unit and no collective agreement with their employer binding on or entered into on behalf of employees in the unit, is in force,\n(a.) the bargaining agent may, on behalf of the employees in the unit, by notice require their employer to commence collective bargaining; or (b) the employer or an employers' organization representing the employer may, by notice, require the bargaining agent to commence collective bargaining;\nwith a view to the conclusion of a collective agreement.\nThat it is an essential prerequisite to certification of a bargaining agent that the Board shall have first determined whether or not the \"unit\" in respect of which application for certification is made is \"appropriate for collective bargaining\" appears from the following provisions of s. 8(1):\n8. (1) Where a trade union makes application for certification under this Act as bargaining agent for employees in a unit, the Board shall determine whether the unit in respect of which the application is made is appropriate for collective bargaining and the Board may before certification, if it deems it appropriate to do so, include additional employees in, or exclude employees from, the unit, and shall take such steps as it deems appropriate to determine the wishes of the employees in the unit as to the selection of a bargaining agent to act on their behalf.\nSome assistance as to the intent of the legislature can also be derived by reading s. 22(1) in conjunction with s. 20, bearing in mind that the former section provides inter alia that \"No employee in a unit shall strike until \u2026 the provisions of section 20, or as the case may be, have been complied with.\" The latter section reads:\n20. Where a trade union on behalf of a unit of employees is entitled by notice under this Act to require their employer to commence collective bargaining with a view to the conclusion or renewal or revision of a collective agreement, the trade union shall not take a strike vote or authorize or participate in the taking of a strike vote of employees in the unit or declare or authorize a strike of the employees in the unit, and no employee in the unit shall strike, and the employer shall not declare or cause a lockout of the employees in the unit, until\n(a) the bargaining agent and the employer, or representatives authorized by them in that behalf, have bargained collectively and have failed to conclude a collective agreement; and either\n(b) a Conciliation Board has been appointed to endeavour to bring about agreement between them and seven days have elapsed from the date on which the report of the Conciliation Board was received by the Minister; or\n(c) either party has requested the Minister in writing to appoint a Conciliation Board to endeavour to bring about agreement between them and fifteen days have elapsed since the Minister received the said request, and\n(i) no notice under sub-section (2) of section 27 has been given by the Minister, or\n(ii) the Minister has notified the party so requesting that he has decided not to appoint a Conciliation Board. The respondent contends that the purpose and effect of s. 22(1) is to prohibit all employees from striking unless and until a bargaining agent has been certified to act on their behalf and until the collective bargaining and conciliation procedures established by the Act have failed.\nOn the other hand, it is argued on behalf of the appellants that the prohibition is only directed against employees who are members of a group on behalf of which application for certification has been made to the Board and that it is only effective during the time when those employees are waiting for the Board's decision.\nIn support of this contention it is urged that the words \"no employee in a unit shall strike \u2026\" as used in s. 22(1) should be construed as meaning \"no employee in a unit appropriate for collective bargaining shall strike\", and that a unit on whose behalf an application for certification has been made is to be regarded as a \"unit appropriate for collective bargaining\". It is upon this basis that the appellants' counsel contends that the prohibition does not extend to the strike organized by them because at the time of the strike no application for certification had been made on behalf of the employees concerned.\nIt will accordingly be seen that it is of fundamental importance to determine the meaning which the legislature intended to be attached to the word \"unit\" as it first appears in s. 22(1), and in so doing it is necessary also to determine the purpose and function of this subsection as a part of the legislative scheme embodied in the statute.\nThe word \"unit\" is defined in s. 1(3) of the Act as follows:\n1. (3) For the purposes of this Act, a \"unit\" means a group of employees, and \"appropriate for collective bargaining\" with reference to a unit, means a unit that is appropriate for such purposes whether it be an employer unit, craft unit, technical unit, plant unit, or any other unit and whether or not the employees therein are employed by one or more employers.\nAs the meaning attached to the words \"appropriate for collective bargaining\" by s. 1(3) is confined to their use \"with reference to a unit\" and as these words are not used at all in s. 22, it seems to me that the meaning attributed to them in this definition has no relevance in the context of s. 22(1). As has been seen, the opening words of s. 8(1) indicate that the question of whether or not a group of employees is appropriate for collective bargaining is a matter for the Board and in this regard the provisions of s. 55 appear to me to be significant. That section provides:\n55. (1) If in any proceeding before the Board a question arises under this Act as to whether\n* * *\n(f) a group of employees is a unit appropriate for collective bargaining;\n* * *\nthe Board shall decide the question and its decision shall be final and conclusive for all the purposes of this Act.\nIt seems to me, therefore, that when an application is made to the Board for certification, the \"unit\" on whose behalf it is made must be regarded for the purposes of this Act as simply being \"a group of employees\" until such time as the Board has determined that it is \"a unit appropriate for collective bargaining\". It is true that when the application is first made, the unit concerned is one which the applicant trade union is claiming to be \"appropriate for collective bargaining\" (see s. 6), but the whole scheme of the collective bargaining sections of the Act seems to me to contemplate that a \"unit\" cannot have the status of one which is \"appropriate for collective bargaining\" until the Board has decided the question.\nIn view of the above, and with the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I am of opinion that when the Act is read as a whole its language gives no support to the contention that the legislature intended the word \"unit\" as first used in s. 22(1) to have the limited meaning of \"a unit appropriate for collective bargaining\" nor do I think that, for the purposes of this Act, \"a group of employees\" becomes \"a unit appropriate for collective bargaining\" simply because a trade union claims that it has that character when making application for certification under s. 6. I cannot, therefore, agree with the submission made on behalf of the appellants that the prohibition contained in s. 22(1) only applies to employees on whose behalf an application for certification is pending before the Board.\nInsofar as this Act is designed to secure a greater measure of industrial peace to the public by encouraging collective bargaining and conciliation procedures rather than strikes as a method of resolving industrial disputes, the attainment of its purpose would, it seems to me, be gravely hampered if, as appellants' counsel contends, the effect of the language used in s. 22(1) is that in the Province of New Brunswick employees who ignore the Act can strike without offending against its provisions, and that those on whose behalf a bargaining agent has been appointed can strike under the circumstances outlined in s. 20 while those and only those whose application for certification is pending before and being held up by the Board are absolutely prohibited from striking between the time when the application is made and the time when it is granted or refused.\nA consideration of s. 23 of the Act also appears to me to weigh heavily against the contention made on behalf of the appellants. This section reads:\n23. A trade union that is not entitled to bargain collectively under this Act on behalf of a unit of employees shall not declare or authorize a strike of employees in that unit.\nIf effect were given to the construction sought to be placed on s. 22(1) by the appellants' counsel, it would mean, when read in conjunction with the last-quoted section, that the legislature intended to exercise no control whatever over strikes by employees who are not members of any trade union while prohibiting strikes by trade unions which have not been certified as bargaining agents. That the legislature should have intended this result seems to me to be inherently unlikely, having regard to the recognition accorded to trade unions by the other provisions of the Act.\nIt is further said, however, on behalf of the appellants that to read s. 22(1) as prohibiting all strikes by employees until a bargaining agent has been certified on their behalf is to attribute to the legislature the intention of creating one standard for the employee and another for the employer because s. 22(2) only prohibits \"a lockout\" while an application for certification is pending before the Board and the employer is left free to declare or cause a lockout at any earlier time, although, of course, after certification this right is restricted by ss. 20 and 21. This objection must be viewed in light of the fact that the Act provides an elaborate and workable procedure whereby employees may compel their employer to bargain collectively with them with a view to concluding a collective agreement as to terms and conditions of employment, whereas no such right and no such procedure is provided for the employer unless and until a bargaining agent has been certified at the instigation of his employees.\nIt must be emphasized that the only statute in question in this appeal is the Labour Relations Act of New Brunswick, and that this Court is not here concerned with the statutes existing in other provinces concerning labour relations which, in many cases, are differently framed and worded.\nThe regulation of a system whereby collective bargaining and conciliation procedures are to be exhausted before resorting to strikes appears to me to be one of the chief functions which this Labour Relations Act purports to accomplish, and I am unable to agree that by using the phrase \"No employee in a unit shall strike \u2026\" instead of \"No employee shall strike \u2026\", the legislature intended s. 22(1) to have the effect of relieving employees who disregard the Act from any obligation to make use of those procedures for which such elaborate provision is made elsewhere.\nAdopting this view, I have concluded that the appellants organized, directed and participated in a cessation of work constituting a \"strike\" within the meaning of the Act on the part of a group of employees who were prohibited from striking by the terms of s. 22(1). The appellants Gagnon, Blackman and Merloni designedly and deliberately adopted this unlawful means of achieving their object, and for the reasons hereinafter specified I am of opinion that they, together with those who were persuaded to join their enterprise, must bear responsibility for any damage which ensued to the respondent.\nSection 40 of the Act provides a penalty for breach of s. 22(1), and although it is true that \"No prosecution for an offence under this Act shall be instituted except with the consent in writing of the Board\" (s. 44(1)) this does not, in my view, alter the fact that s. 22(1) constitutes a mandatory prohibition enforceable by penalty if the Board deems it appropriate to consent to such method of enforcement.\nIn the case of Therien v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters3, Mr. Justice Sheppard of the British Columbia Court of Appeal had occasion to consider whether breaches of the Labour Relation Act of that province by the defendant constituted \"illegal means\" whereby the company there in question was induced to cease doing business with the plaintiff. In the course of his decision, Mr. Justice Sheppard said at p. 680:\nIn relying upon ss. 4 and 6 of the statute the plaintiff is not to be taken as asserting a statutory cause of action. The plaintiff is here founding upon a common law cause of action within Hodges v. Webb [1920] 2 Ch. 70 which requires as one of the elements that an illegal means be used or threatened. To ascertain whether the means was illegal enquiry may be made both at common law and at statute law.\nWhen the Therien case4, reached this Court, Mr. Justice Locke, speaking on behalf of the majority of the Court, said at p. 280:\nI agree with Sheppard J.A. that in relying upon these sections of the Act the respondent is asserting, not a statutory cause of action, but a common law cause of action, and that to ascertain whether the means employed were illegal inquiry may be made both at common law and of the statute law.\nIn light of these observations, it becomes unnecessary to embark upon the difficult exercise of determining whether or not a breach of s. 22(1) of the Labour Relations Act gives rise to a statutory cause of action because when inquiry is \"made of the statute law\" in the present case it discloses, as has been said, that the means here employed by the appellants were prohibited, and this of itself supplies the ingredient necessary to change a lawful agreement which would not give rise to a cause of action into a tortious conspiracy, the carrying out of which exposes the conspirators to an action for damages if any ensue therefrom. The only plea of conspiracy in this case is contained in para. 10 of the statement of claim which reads as follows:\n10. In the alternative the Defendants wrongfully and maliciously conspired and combined amongst themselves to procure, cause and induce the employees of the Plaintiff to break their contracts of employment with the Plaintiff and to leave its service and to abstain from continuing therein.\nI agree with Bridges J.A. that it is not necessary for the respondent to prove that actual breaches of contract took place in order to sustain the plea of conspiracy because the evidence supports the allegation that the appellants wrongfully conspired to procure, cause and induce the employees of the respondent to abstain from work. Although the wrongful means are not specifically alleged in the paragraph pleading conspiracy, all the ingredients of an unlawful strike are elsewhere alleged and the pleadings are sufficiently explicit to have made the appellants aware of the fact that the legality of the means which they employed to obtain recognition was being placed in issue.\nThomas Onno never entered an appearance, although his name appears in the notice of appeal to the Appeal Division as one of the appellants. However, as against him the damages awarded by the Appeal Division should be substituted for the amount fixed by the judge of first instance.\nOnno and Roy Carr did not appeal to this Court, although named as parties appellant. There should, therefore, be no costs of this appeal as against them. Save for varying the amount of damages as against Onno, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick5 which, with a variation as to the damages to be awarded, affirmed the judgment of Ritchie J. at the trial. The respondent company was on July 15, 1958, engaged in the construction of a wharf for the Department of Transport in the Harbour of St. John, employing on the work some 190 men engaged as labourers, timbermen, carpenters, operating engineers, riggers and a number of office workers.\nSome days previous, one Capone and the appellants Merloni, Blackman, Gagnon, and two men name Kaiser and Evans, called upon the superintendent of construction of the work, Gerald H. Lilly, asking that the company recognize certain unions which, they said, they represented. The names of the unions were not stated at that time. Lilly told them that he had no authority to deal with the matter but told them that other company officials would be in town on the following week when they could discuss the matter.,\nOn July 15 these men came again to the company's office, together with one Murray Stanton and some other official of the carpenters' union, and presented the same request to Lilly and J. A. Marshall, the construction manager of the company. They asked Marshall if the company would recognize their unions and, according to Lilly, when asked if they were certified by the Labour Relations Board, they said they were not but that they would produce cards of fifty per cent of the men if the company \"would recognize them on that basis.\" According to Marshall, he informed them that they should be certified under the law and that the company would not recognize them or sign an agreement with them until that was done. Merloni said that the time would come when the company would have to recognize them \"on our basis and there will be no discussion\", which terminated the interview.\nWhile there was no issue of any kind between the respondent and any of its employees as to wages, hours or any similar matters and nothing to indicate that the employees were not satisfied with the conditions as they were, on July 23 a picket line was established outside the site of the work organized and under the direction apparently of the defendants Gagnon, Blackman and Merloni, exhibiting placards on some of which there appeared the words \"Operators, engineers and labourers on strike against Foundation Maritime Ltd.\" These placards were carried from time to time by the defendants Roach, O'Neill, Morrison, Blackman, Merloni, Michaelson, Onno, Hachey, Armstrong, Lundman and Grant. When the various employees other than the office staff came to work they were faced with this picket line and, in the result, did not enter the premises and the entire operation was brought to a halt, the work stoppage continuing for five days when an injunction in the present action was effective to stop further picketing and work was resumed. There is no evidence that there was any violence employed by the pickets Blackman and Merloni who were, apparently, in charge on the morning of July 23. When Cecil Bellefontaine, a workman employed on a hydraulic jack, was stopped, he was told by them that \"there was a strike on and we could not go in to work.\" Bellefontaine said that he did not go through the picket line saying that \"they erupt sometimes.\" He went back the following morning in a further attempt to go to work and was again stopped and said as to this that he was afraid to go through the picket line.\nArthur Neilson, who was working as a mechanic, endeavoured to go to work on July 23 and was stopped by three pickets who told him that \"the company was on strike.\" He asked Gagnon what the strike was about and he said that they were on strike for recognition. Neilson told him there was no necessity of striking because if they went through the proper channels they would get recognition. He did not go through the picket line and explained this by saying:\nJudging from the way that the pickets spoke if a man went through he would be in trouble.\nHe tried to go to work on the following morning and was again stopped.\nBy an order made on July 25, 1958, by Ritchie J. certain of the defendants who were engaged in the picketing and some persons who are not now defendants in the action were enjoined from watching, besetting or picketing the premises until July 30. A second order was made by Ritchie J. on July 30 naming the present appellants and continued the injunction until the trial.\nIt was shown by the evidence of the witness Lilly that on July 23 Gagnon and Blackman represented themselves as officers of the Operating Engineers' union and the International Teamsters' union, respectively. The identity of the union represented by Merloni is not shown.\nThat the respondent suffered substantial damage from the work stoppage is not and cannot on the evidence be disputed. The argument for the appellants, however, is that the evidence does not disclose a cause of action against the defendants or any of them. The Labour Relations Act of New Brunswick, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 124, provides the means whereby a trade union may. be certified as a bargaining agent on behalf of employees such as those with whom this case is concerned. and, on their behalf, negotiate with the employer and enter into a collective agreement. It was shown at the trial that none of the unions claimed to have been represented by Capone, Merloni, Blackman and Gagnon had been certified as bargaining agents for any of the employees concerned. Whether any of such employees were members of these unions on July 23, 1958, was not shown, the defendants electing not to give any evidence at the trial.\nThe word \"strike\" is defined by s. 1 of the Act to include:\na cessation of work or refusal to work or to continue to work by employees in combination or in concert or in accordance with a common understanding.\nand the expression \"to strike\" is defined to include:\nto cease work, or to refuse to work or to continue to work, in combination or in concert or in accordance with a common understanding.\nSection 1(3) reads in part:\nFor the purposes of this Act, a \"unit\" means a group of employees.\nSection 22(1) reads:\nNo employee in a unit shall strike until a bargaining agent has become entitled on behalf of the unit of employees to require their employer by notice under this Act to commence collective bargaining with a view to the conclusion or renewal or revision of a collective agreement and the provisions of section 20 (which provides for the appointment of a conciliation board), or as the case may be, have been complied with.\nSection 23 reads:\nA trade union that is not entitled to bargain collectively under this Act on behalf of a unit of employees shall not declare or authorize a strike of employees in that unit.\nSection 39 provides, inter alia, that every trade union that declares or authorizes a strike contrary to the Act is guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty, and s. 40 provides, inter alia, that every person who does anything prohibited by the Act is liable to a fine.\nThe purpose of this statute and others of the same nature in Canada is the prevention of strikes and lockouts and the maintenance of industrial peace. As none of the unions said to be represented had been certified or, so far as the evidence in this case goes, authorized in any manner to act on behalf of any of the employees, the attitude taken by the officers of the respondent on July 15 was correct.\nIt is apparent that Merloni, Gagnon and Blackman had decided to ignore the provisions of the Act and to endeavour to compel the respondent to negotiate with their unions by bringing about a stoppage of work. The remaining defendants were apparently duped by these three into taking part in bringing about that stoppage.\nRitchie J. was of the opinion that the cessation of work was a strike and was unlawful as being contrary to the provisions of s. 22(1) of the Act; that to induce and persuade the employees not to report for work was a tortious interference with the contractual relations existing between the plaintiff and its employees; that there was evidence that the employees Neilson and Bellefontaine were intimidated by the picket line and thus prevented from reporting for work, and that the picketing itself in support of an illegal strike was unlawful. He awarded damages in the sum of $22,712.39.\nBridges J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Appeal Division, agreed that there was a strike within the meaning of the Act. He was of the opinion that the evidence did not support the charge of intimidation but considered that there was evidence that the defendants had conspired together to injure the respondent in its trade or business and, further, that as the strike itself was unlawful the picketing was unlawful. He, however, considered that the damages awarded were excessive and they were reduced to $12,500.\nThere was at the time in question no statute in New Brunswick such as the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342, which was considered in the decision of this Court in Williams v. Aristocratic Restaurants (1947) Ltd.6 In that case the trade union had been certified as the bargaining authority for the employees of one of the respondent's five restaurants, but did not represent any of the employees of the other restaurants which were operated in Vancouver. The conduct complained of was to have men walk back and forth on the sidewalk in front of each of the five restaurants, bearing a placard to the effect that the employees did not have an agreement with the union. It was held in this Court, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that this conduct was permissible under the provisions of ss. 3 and 4 of the Trade-unions Act.\nIn the present case the statement exhibited in the placards carried by Merloni et al. on the morning of July 23 that there was a strike was untrue, to the knowledge of all of the defendants who took part in the picketing. So far as the evidence goes, at the time the picketing commenced no single employee of the respondent company was a member of any of the unions. There was no dispute between the company and any of its employees of the kind commonly known as a trade dispute, nor any difference between them on any ground that might become the subject of such a dispute. The defendants Merloni, Gagnon and Blackman, who claimed to represent certain trade unions, were well aware of this fact, and such of the other defendants as were employees at least knew that in their own case they had no dispute with their employer and that no one had been authorized to represent them and that no strike had been called.\nWhile, by paragraph 10 of the statement of claim, the respondent alleged that the defendants had wrongfully and maliciously conspired and combined among themselves to induce its employees to break their contracts of employment and to leave its service and to abstain from continuing therein, no evidence was given as to any contract of employment other than that of Lilly who said that the men were required to fill in a standard form used by their company when they went to work, but he was unable to give any further details. The evidence, therefore, is insufficient to show whether or not the failure of the men to report for work on the morning of July 23 was a breach of contract on their part. The respondent's right to recover, however, does not turn upon this, in my opinion. It is, however, clear that the respondent expected them to return to their work on the morning of July 23 and that they intended to do so.\nIn my opinion, the presence of the picket line did not excuse the actions of the employees in failing to continue to work on the morning of July 23 and on the succeeding days and I consider that the learned trial judge was justified, in view of the fact that none of them other than the office workers did pass the picket line, in drawing the inference that the cessation of work was done by them in concert or in accordance with a common understanding, within the meaning of s. l(p) and (q), and was unlawful under the terms of s. 22(1). All of these employees must have known when they reported for work on that day that the statement that there was a strike on was false and that Merloni et al. did not represent the employees. I agree with the learned trial judge and with Bridges J.A. that the action of the defendants in causing or inducing them to cease to work was a tortious act for which they are liable in damages. It is clear from the evidence that the purpose of setting up the picket line was to inflict injury upon the respondent by halting the work for the purpose of compelling it to contract with the unions which, so far as the evidence goes, represented no one.\nBy the statement of claim the respondent alleged, inter alia, that the defendants wrongfully and maliciously conspired and combined amongst themselves to procure and induce the employees of the plaintiff to abstain from continuing in its employment. That the actions of Merloni, Gagnon and Blackman were carried on in combination for the purpose of causing injury to the respondent by unlawful means is made clear by the evidence. Neither the learned trial judge nor Bridges J.A. found that these actions were malicious but this was not essential. While in Lumley v. Gye7, the head note to the report says that an action lies for maliciously procuring a breach of contract to give exclusive personal services for a time certain, Lord Macnaghten in Quinn v. Leathern8, said that the real basis of the finding in that case was not on the ground of malicious intention but on the ground that a violation of a legal right committed knowingly is a cause of action. Lord Lindley, speaking of Lumley v. Gye, said at p. 535:\nFurther, the principle involved in it cannot be confined to inducements to break contracts of service, nor indeed to inducements to break any contracts. The principle which underlies the decision reaches all wrongful acts done intentionally to damage a particular individual and actually damaging him. And at p. 538 he said:\nA combination not to work is one thing, and is lawful. A combination to prevent others from working by annoying them if they do is a different thing, and is prima facie unlawful.\nOn July 23, 1958, the respondent, by virtue of its contract, was entitled and was required to enter upon the premises of the Crown for the purpose of carrying on the work of construction and to do so, in the circumstances then existing, without interference by the defendants or anyone else with the entry of its employees upon the premises.\nIn these circumstances, it is my opinion that the conduct of the defendants was a private nuisance and, as damage resulted, actionable.\nIn Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 11th ed. at p. 560, nuisance is defined as:\nan act or omission which is an interference with, disturbance of or annoyance to a person in the exercise of enjoyment of (a) a right belonging to him as a member of the public, when it is a public nuisance, or (b) his ownership or occupation of land or of some easement, quasi-easement, or other right used or enjoyed in connection with land, when it is a private nuisance.\nThe respondent, by virtue of its contractual relationship with the Crown, had an easement in the nature of a right-of-way across the property of the Crown, in order to carry on its work, and that right was interfered with.\nIn Lyons v. Wilkins9, the head note reads:\nPer Lindley M.R. and Chitty L.J.: To watch or beset a man's house, with the view to compel him to do or not to do that which it is lawful for him not to do or to do, is, unless some reasonable justification for it is consistent with the evidence, a wrongful act: (1) because it is an offence within s. 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875; and (2) because it is a nuisance at common law for which an action on the case would lie; for such conduct seriously interferes with the ordinary comfort of human existence and the ordinary enjoyment of the house beset.\nSection 7 of the Act referred to is to the same effect as s. 366 of the Criminal Code. There was in s. 7 an exception from the penal provisions dealing with watching or besetting which read:\nAttending at or near the house or place where a person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place, in order merely to obtain or communicate information, shall not be deemed a watching or besetting within the meaning of this section. To the same effect is the exception in s. 366 of the Code. In Lyons' case it was held upon the facts that the conduct of the defendants did not fall within the exception.\nIn Quinn's case at p. 541 Lord Lindley said that:\nthere are many ways short of violence, or the threat of it, of compelling persons to act in a way which they do not like. There are annoyances of all sorts and degrees: picketing is a distinct annoyance, and if damage results in an actionable nuisance at common law, but if confined merely to obtaining or communicating information it is rendered lawful by the Act (s. 7).\nIn the Aristocratic Restaurant case the claim that the conduct above mentioned was a private nuisance was rejected by the majority of the court by reason of the provisions of s. 3 of the Trade-unions Act, which provided, inter alia, that no officer, agent or servant of a trade union or any other person should be liable in damages for persuading or endeavouring to persuade by fair or reasonable argument, without unlawful threats, intimidation or other unlawful acts, any person to refuse to become the employee or customer of any employer. As there is no such statutory provision in New Brunswick, the case does not affect the present matter.\nWhile named as parties appellant, the defendants Onno and Carr did not appeal to this Court and there should, accordingly, be no costs of this appeal awarded against them. I would direct that as against Onno the amount of damages awarded by the Appeal Division should be substituted for the amount fixed by the trial judge.\nWith the exception above mentioned, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nJudson J. (dissenting):\u2014The first three named appellants are trade union organizers and the others were employees of the respondent on July 23, 1958. The respondent sued them all for damages and an injunction against picketing because of a strike which they began on July 23, 1958, and which lasted for a few days. At the trial, the respondent obtained judgment for $22,712 in damages and the injunction. On appeal10, the damages were reduced to $12,500 but the injunction was affirmed as having been rightly granted, although the need for it had disappeared. The appellants appeal both against the award of damages and the injunction.\nIn the summer of 1958 Foundation Maritime Limited was building a wharf in the city of Saint John under a contract with the Department of Public Works of Canada. On July 13 the three union organizers met an official of the company and asked for recognition of their unions, claiming that they represented more than 50 per cent of the employees. A week later they made the same request to a higher official of the company. The company refused their request on the ground that the unions had not been certified as representing the men under the Labour Relations Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 124. Pickets appeared on July 23 outside both jobs on which the company was engaged. These pickets carried notices stating \"Engineers, Teamsters and Labourers on strike against Foundation Maritime Limited\". The company obtained an interim injunction against all picketing on July 25, and on July 30 this order was continued until the trial. For 5 days the stoppage of work appears to have been complete and for an additional 7 days, while the men were drifting back to work, the company claims that the efficiency of its operation was reduced. This was the main basis of its claim for damages.\nThe injunction against picketing was completely prohibitory and it was based upon the threefold conclusion of the learned trial judge that there had been intimidation of employees reporting for work, a tortious interference with contractual relations between the company and its employees and also between the company and the Department of Public Works, and picketing in furtherance of a strike which was prohibited by the Labour Relations Act. The Court of Appeal, after a full review of the evidence, found that the picketing was peaceful and that there was no basis for a finding of intimidation. The Court of Appeal also found that there was no plea of interference with contractual relations with the Department of Public Works and no evidence that by stopping work the employees broke their contracts of employment or that they were under any legal obligation to work during the days of the strike. The findings of the Court of Appeal raise three issues in this Court:\n(a) Was this strike prohibited by the Labour Relations Act;\n(b) Was the conspiracy as found by the Court of Appeal the one which was sued on and pleaded;\n(c) Was this strike for union recognition a tortious conspiracy from the mere fact that there was no compliance with the certification provisions of the Labour Relations Act, and was picketing in pursuance of such a strike properly enjoinable even though it was peaceful and was carried on without violence, intimidation or obstruction?\nThese are the issues raised in the ratio decidendi of the Court of Appeal which is contained in the following paragraphs:\nIn an action based on conspiracy we do not think it necessary for the plaintiff to prove that actual breaches of contracts took place. In the case at bar the plaintiff's employees were induced to abstain from work, which in our view, is sufficient.\nIn our opinion, Gagnon, Blackman, Merloni and the other defendants who acted as pickets combined in inducing workmen of the plaintiff to refrain from working. Their object was to obtain recognition of the unions without certification, which, in itself, was not unlawful but the means they used, a strike in violation of the Labour Relations Act, was and they have therefore no defence to the action. Any act done in furtherance of the unlawful means should, in our opinion, be restrained. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to an injunction against picketing in addition to damages.\nThe appellants question the judgment on all three grounds. On the first, they submit that since there was no collective agreement in existence, their conduct in this case was not in breach of the Act. This submission requires an examination of all the sections of the Act relating to strikes and lockouts and the reading of s. 22(1), which has been taken to be the applicable section, in the context of the other sections.\nSection 20 provides that where a trade union has been certified there shall be no strike vote, no strike and no lockout until there has been failure to conclude a collective agreement and conciliation proceedings have been taken. This section does not apply because no union had been certified in this case.\nSection 21 deals with the case where there is a collective agreement in force whether entered into before or after the commencement of the Act. In this situation there are to be no strikes or lockouts until certain procedures have been exhausted. This section does not apply because there was no collective agreement of any kind in force.\nSection 22 I now set out in full:\n22(1) No employee in a unit shall strike until a bargaining agent has become entitled on behalf of the unit of employees to require their employer by notice under this Act to commence collective bargaining with a view to the conclusion or renewal or revision of a collective agreement and the provisions of section 20, or as the case may be, have been complied with.\n(2) No employer shall declare or cause a lockout of employees while an application for certification of a bargaining agent to act for such employees is pending before the Board.\nI take this section to be applicable as a whole to the case where there is an application for certification pending before the Board. The second subsection says so expressly in dealing with the right of lockout. The employer's right is limited only during this period. Outside this period, unless the case is one within ss. 20 and 21, there is no restriction on the right of lockout. Under the same conditions, that is outside the stated period, unless the case is one to which ss. 20 and 21 apply, is the employee's position made inferior by the first subsection to that of the employer? The company submits that it is and that s. 22 treats employee and employer on a different basis. It requires very plain language to reach such an anomalous conclusion. Far from cogently pointing to this conclusion, it is my opinion that subsection (1) does equate the positions of employee and employer and that the whole section applies only when the certification proceedings are pending. The language of subsection (1) is \"No employee in a unit shall strike\" not \"No employee shall strike\". The company says that there is no difference between these two expressions and that unit merely means a group of employees\u2014 any group of employees\u2014but the definition (s. 1(3)) continues:\nand \"appropriate for collective bargaining\" with reference to a unit, means a unit that is appropriate for such purposes whether it be an employer unit, craft unit, technical unit, plant unit, or any other unit and whether or not the employees therein are employed by one or more employers.\nWhen does a unit become appropriate for collective bargaining? Only when the claim is made in an application for certification of the bargaining agent under s. 6, or the Board has made a determination under s. 8 that the unit in respect of which the application is made is appropriate for collective bargaining.\nI therefore conclude that the prohibitions of s. 22 apply only where an application for certification is pending and that both employer and employee are treated by this Act on a footing of equality and that there is nothing in s. 22(1) or anywhere else in the Act to prohibit an employee who may be a member of an uncertified union withholding his labour in concert with others and engaging in peaceful picketing in a case where there is no collective agreement in effect. If the legislature had intended to prohibit this conduct, there is a simple way to do it by imposing the prohibition in all cases, whether or not there is a collective agreement in force and whether or not the collective agreement was made before or after the coming into force of the Act. This is not what this legislation has attempted to do.\nThe only other prohibition against striking imposed by the Act is contained in s. 23, which reads:\n23. A trade union that is not entitled to bargain collectively under this Act on behalf of a unit of employees shall not declare or authorize a strike of employees in that unit.\nThis prohibition is imposed on the trade union. It does not touch the individual who may be a member of the union. The action in this case is taken entirely against three individual union organizers and individual employees. The penalty provisions of the Act against the trade union are in s. 39(3) and (4). The trade union is liable to a fine of $150 for each day that the strike exists and the officer or representative of the union to a fine not exceeding $300. The individual employee is dealt with only by s. 40, which imposes a penalty not exceeding $100 on every person who does anything prohibited by the Act. All these penalties are subject to the condition that there is to be no prosecution under the Act except with the consent in writing of the Board. My conclusion is that s. 23 does not touch this case.\nThe reasoning of the Court of Appeal, in my respectful opinion, therefore fails in the first place on an interpretation of the Act. There was no breach of the Act which could turn the conduct complained of in this case into a tortious conspiracy. In the second place, the conspiracy as found by the Court of Appeal was never pleaded. Paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of the statement of claim complain with some repetition of threats of violence, coercion, procuring breach of contract between the company and its employees, misleading placards and the establishment, wrongfully and illegally, of a picket line whereby workmen were intimidated and prevented from working. Up to this point there is no plea of conspiracy. This is contained in para. 10 of the statement of claim, which reads:\n10. In the alternative the Defendants wrongfully and maliciously conspired and combined amongst themselves to procure, cause and induce the employees of the Plaintiff to break their contracts of employment with the Plaintiff and to leave its service and to abstain from continuing therein.\nThis is the plea of conspiracy in a very bare framework without any particulars and its basis has been expressly denied by the finding of the Court of Appeal. There is no other plea of a combination to do any other act or acts causing damage against which the defendants might have pleaded that their predominant purpose was to advance their own lawful interests. There was no plea of the use of unlawful means which might bring liability in a conspiracy case. The defendants successfully met the only conspiracy charged against them. If they were to be expected to meet others, they are reasonable in their assertion that they should know in the pleading what they have to meet. A finding of a conspiracy based upon a breach of the Act appeared for the first time in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. Counsel for the appellants stated without contradiction that the point had never up to that time been argued. In my respectful opinion, it was not open to the Court of Appeal to base its judgment, of is own mere motion, on a conspiracy which had never been pleaded and which the defendants had no opportunity to answer.\nThe judgment under appeal has wide implications and involves, in my respectful opinion, an erroneous extension of the law of civil conspiracy. After the decision in Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Company Limited v. Veitch11, there could, on the facts of this case, be no liability in tort at common law. If this was a strike, its predominant purpose was for the legitimate promotion of the interests of the persons who were acting in concert. The Crofter case holds that if the means employed are neither criminal nor tortious in themselves, the combination is not unlawful. This judgment makes a strike, which was formerly not actionable, actionable in conspiracy, solely on the ground of violation of the Labour Relations Act, when there is no conduct on the part of the participants which can be labelled as criminal or tortious.\nThis extension of liability appears to me to be based on a very insecure foundation. It is not to be found in Williams v. Aristocratic Restaurants (1947) Ltd.12 At the trial of that action there was, among others, a plea of conspiracy based solely upon a breach of the statute and it failed. The breach alleged was failure to take a strike vote. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, liability was imposed on this as well as other grounds. But on appeal to this Court no attempt was made to support the judgment on the ground of conspiracy in breach of the statute. The ratio of the judgment in this Court which restored the judgment at trial was that the picketing did not amount to a criminal offence or to a common law nuisance.\nThe case of International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. Therien13, does not carry the matter any further. It was not a conspiracy case. A business agent of a union attempted to compel Therien who was an independent trucker and an employer of labour, to join the union. Therien had a business relationship with a construction company and the union agent, for the purpose of compelling Therien to do his bidding, threatened to picket the job, with the result that Therien lost his business relationship and the construction company ceased to do business with him. The case was therefore one where a union organizer intentionally inflicted harm upon Therien without justification. His attempt to justify his conduct on the ground of advancing union interests could not stand because of the prohibition in the statute against harassing an employer or independent con- tractor into union membership. The case is not authority for the establishment of a statutory breach or a threat to compel a statutory breach as an independent basis of unlawful means in the law of civil conspiracy. It is no more than Allen v. Flood14 over again with the added element of a statute which prevented a justification of the conduct complained of.\nFurther, these union agents made no threat to the Foundation Company to compel it to do something in violation of the Act. On any reading of the Act it was open to the company to negotiate a collective agreement without resort to prior certification proceedings. It is, of course, equally clear that the company had the right to refuse to do this. These defendants, then, in pursuit of the legal object of union recognition employed means which were neither criminal nor tortious in themselves but which, on one reading of the Act, could be held to be prohibited conduct. I do not think that this makes them guilty of the tort of conspiracy. I prefer the view that in the law of civil conspiracy the unlawful means must be found in nominate torts or crimes. On this point, I adopt the statement in Salmond on Torts, 12th ed., 678, to the following effect:\nIt is submitted that when the object of the combination is legitimate the unlawful means which will give a good ground of action against persons acting in concert are the same as the unlawful means which will give a good ground of action against a defendant acting alone.\nCould it be said here that the plaintiff has a good cause of action against any of these defendants as individuals? According to the Court of Appeal they did not commit any tort apart from conspiracy founded upon a statutory breach. If there is to be any liability in this case it must be on the grounds pleaded, namely, the commission of nominate torts or conspiracy with nominate torts as the unlawful means.\nIf this is not so any strike in violation of the Act which by definition means \"a cessation of work or refusal to work or to continue to work by employees in combination or in concert or in accordance with a common understanding\" would be actionable as a conspiracy even in the extreme case where hourly paid employees did nothing more than stay at home. If there is to be liability in damages for the tort of conspiracy founded solely upon a breach of the Labour Relations Act, it should, in my respectful opinion, be imposed by the legislature and not by what I regard as an unwarranted extension of the case law.\nSo far I have accepted the distinction drawn in the reasons of the Court of Appeal between the end and the means in the consideration of the acts of these defendants. What did these individuals do? Acting under the leadership of the three union organizers, they withdrew their labour, established a picket line and carried placards. Following this no employees except supervisory and office staff went to work for some days. If there was a combination it was to do these acts. If the doing of these acts is held to be contrary to the legislation, then the conspiracy is to do something forbidden by the Act. There is no question of doing something lawful by unlawful means. A more accurate way of stating the problem is whether an agreement to strike, which is carried out, in the face of a statutory prohibition is actionable as a conspiracy.\nAt this point it is reasonable to ask what need there is for the tort of conspiracy. On the assumptions made there has been a breach of the Act by people acting in concert. Does it add anything to the liability, if there is any, by calling the conduct by the name of conspiracy? To give rise to tortious liability for conspiracy, there must be more than the mere fact of agreement. There must be some carrying out of the agreement, causing damage. The agreement in itself does not cause the damage. If the agreement is to commit a tort and it is carried out or if the agreement is to do something lawful, but its carrying out involves the commission of a tort, what need is there in either case for the tort of conspiracy? The defendants in each of these two situations could always be sued as joint tortfeasors under some other special heading of tortious liability.\nWhat we have in this case then, if every assumption is made against the defendants is an agreement to breach the Act which was carried out. Does this involve any more than a breach of the Act? If this is the basis of liability the defendants should have been prosecuted for this breach, with leave of the Board, or if the plaintiff wants damages, its claim must be founded on a breach of the Act and no more\u2014not on conspiracy. Whether such a claim is maintainable in this action, it is unnecessary to decide. It was not pleaded and not argued. This is a picketing case in its simplest elements. According to the finding of the Court of Appeal, threats, coercion, intimidation and procuring breach of contract are all absent.

After making provision for certain bequests, he directed the accumulation out of residuary income of three funds, each of $20,000, the first for a Jewish hospital, the second for a Jewish orphan asylum and the third for a Jewish old men's home. No such institutions were in existence at the date of the testator's death. The appellant society, incorporated in 1950, claimed the third fund under a clause of the will which provided for the fund being paid out in the event that a Jewish old men's home of a minimum specified cost was built within fifty years of the testator's death, or such extended time as might be allowed, and on condition that admittance and care were on a non-sectarian basis. The will contained identical provisions with respect to the hospital and the orphan asylum. The appellant also claimed under the residuary clause which provided that the residue of the estate was to be divided equally among the three institutions and that if the institutions were not in existence within the specified period, everything that remained was to be distributed by the trustee among charitable objects.\nThe trustee applied for directions and submitted questions relative to the construction of the will. The Courts below rejected the appellant's claims on the ground that the dispositions in question offended the rule against perpetuities. Held: The appellant was entitled to the fund and one-third of the residue as they existed on July 5, 1957. All surplus income after that date must be applied cy-pr\u00e8s and a scheme settled by the Court.\n(1) This was not a case where the gift for charitable purposes was contingent upon the happening of an event which may not happen within the perpetuity period, but rather one of an immediate unconditional gift to charity with a designation of certain particular modes of application of the property to charitable purposes. The validity of this charitable trust was not affected by the directions to accumulate the three funds out of residuary income. The accumulation was not a condition precedent to the existence of the charitable trust. In re Lord Stratheden and Campbell, [1894] 3 Ch. 265; Kingham v. Kingham, [1897] 1 I.R. 170; Re Schjaastad Estate (1920), 50 D.L.R. 445; In re Wightwick's Will Trusts, [1950] Ch. 260; In re Mander, [1950] Ch. 547, referred to; Attorney-General v.

In these circumstances the surplus income did not go to the next-of-kin but was to be applied cy-pr\u00e8s.

Freeman, for the defendants, respondents, the residuary legatees of the late Louis Brier.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by JUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant was incorporated in the year 1950 under the Societies Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 311. It appeals against the rejection of its claims to an accumulated fund and a share of the residue under the will of the late Louis Brier. The British Columbia Courts[2] have rejected these claims on the ground that the dispositions in question offend the rule against perpetuities.\nLouis Brier made his will in 1934 and died in 1936. He left all his property in trust to the Toronto General Trusts Corporation as executor and trustee. We are concerned on this appeal with his disposition of the residue of his estate. After making provision for his wife and certain distant relatives, he directed the consecutive accumulation out of residuary income of three funds each of $20,000. The first fund was for a Jewish Hospital, the second for a Jewish Orphan Asylum and the third for a Jewish Old Men's Home. No institutions answering these descriptions were in existence at the date of death. The appellant came into existence only in 1950 and is the claimant to the third of these funds, which have all been fully accumulated. The appellant claims the fund under clause (p) of the will, which, apart from the named beneficiary, is in precisely the same terms as the two preceding paragraphs which direct the prior accumulation of funds for the hospital and the orphan asylum. Clause (p) reads:\n(p) As soon as the provisions of the preceding paragraph (o) of this my will have been complied with by my said executor and trustee in so far as having the sum of Twenty thousand ($20,000) dollars set aside by either deposit or investment in said paragraph herein provided and as soon as there is a further sum of Twenty thousand ($20,000) dollars available from the income of my estate, then I direct my said executor and trustee at its discretion to deposit in the Savings Department of some chartered bank in the City of Vancouver or to invest in either Dominion Government bonds or securities or any bonds or securities of any of the Provinces of the Dominion of Canada the further sum of Twenty thousand ($20,000) dollars which sum of Twenty thousand ($20,000) dollars with accumulated interest thereon from the date same is so deposited or invested to be paid out as follows:\u2014 In the event the Jewish people of British Columbia build a Jewish Old Men's Home within the Province of British Columbia that will cost the sum of One hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars or more at any time within fifty (50) years after my decease said sum of Twenty thousand ($20,000) and accumulated interest to be paid by my said executor and trustee to the proper officers of said Jewish Old Men's Home on condition, however, that the said Jewish Old Men's Home shall by its rules and regulations admit and care for Gentile patients on the same terms and conditions as Jewish patients are admitted and cared for but in the event the said condition is not complied with and in the further event that the said Jewish people of British Columbia do not build a Jewish Old Men's Home in the Province of British Columbia within fifty (50) years after my death then this bequest shall lapse and the said further sum of twenty thousand ($20,000) dollars so deposited and accumulated interest thereon shall at the end of fifty (50) years after my decease be given by my said executor and trustee to some other charitable institution in the Province of British Columbia that in the good judgment of my said executor and trustee it may deem worthy. Having in mind that I would prefer to give same to some Jewish Institution but my said preference not to bind my said executor and trustee in exercising its discretion in the event, however, the Jewish people of British Columbia express to my executor and trustee in writing their desire to build a Jewish Old Men's Home within British Columbia but are unable to so build same within the said Fifty (50) years then my executor and trustee shall have the right to extend the time for the completion of said Old Men's Home for such time beyond the said Fifty (50) years as my said executor and trustee shall deem just and this bequest shall upon completion of said Jewish Old Men's Home within the time so extended be paid as aforesaid. Otherwise this bequest to lapse.\nClause (p) must, however, be read in conjunction with the final residuary clause (clause (s)), which reads:\n(s) All the rest and residue of my estate not hereinbefore disposed of by this my will including all lapsed legacies I direct my said executor and trustee to distribute same among the three institutions referred to in paragraphs (n), (o) and (p) of this my will, one third to each, such distribution to be made as hereinbefore provided to such three institutions. In the event only one or more of such institutions is in existence in the said fifty (50) years after my death or such extended period as hereinbefore provided then one third of said rest and residue of my estate shall be given to such of the three institutions as shall be in existence at the end of the said Fifty (50) years or such extended period if such period is extended as hereinbefore provided and in the event any one or more of said three Jewish Institutions is not in existence within the time as hereinbefore provided then I direct that the rest and residue that then remains undisposed of be distributed by my said executor and trustee to such worthy charitable object or objects, institution or institutions, person or persons in the Province of British Columbia that in the good judgment of my said executor and trustee it may deem best.\nThe British Columbia Courts have held that the gift to the charity could not arise until there was an accumulation of the specified fund and until the institution named came into existence and qualified under the will. This gift, therefore, offended the rule against perpetuities and the gift over of the residue failed for the same reason. In my respectful opinion, there is error in this construction. To me, the case is not one where the gift for charitable purposes is contingent upon the happening of an event which may not happen within the perpetuity period but rather one of an immediate unconditional gift to charity with a designation of certain particular modes of application of the property to charitable purposes. The particular mode of application may be subject to a condition precedent which may not happen within the perpetuity period, but the charitable trust does not fail if the testator had a general unconditional intention to devote the property to charitable purposes. It is saved by the application of the cy-pr\u00e8s doctrine.\nThe two principles which I have just summarized are clearly stated in the judgment of Lord Selborne in Chamberlayne v. Brockett[3], which is usually taken as a starting point in an inquiry of this kind. There the testatrix, after reciting her intention to give her estate to charity, directed her trustees to apply the residue of her estate to the building of alms-houses and the support of the inmates in three specified places as soon as land should be given (by others) on which the buildings could be erected. This was held to be an absolute immediate gift to charity with a mode of execution dependent on future events which might happen outside the perpetuity period. The mode of execution did not make the gift to charity conditional or contingent.\nIf one reads clauses (n), (o) and (p), directing the accumulation and application of the three funds, along with the residuary clause of this will, there is a clearly expressed general charitable intention. Nothing is left to inference or surmise. Once the testator began to deal with the residue of his estate, there is only one possible view and that is that his intention was a general charitable one. It is true that the ability of the particular institutions to qualify for the accumulations and share of residue is subject to the many contingencies mentioned. These have been taken, in the judgment under appeal, to be the determining factor. Such a view, in my opinion, ignores the expressed immediate general charitable intention and holds that there is only a particular charitable intention to be found in the particular mode of application. The concluding words of the residuary clause provide that if these three Jewish institutions are not in existence within the specified time limits, everything that remains is to be distributed by the trustee among worthy charitable objects in British Columbia.\nWith respect, the error in the judgment under appeal is in its foundation upon the cases where the gift to a particular charity was in itself contingent upon the happening of a future uncertain event which might not happen within the perpetuity period. A mere listing of them is sufficient to give point to the distinction between them and the present case. Some of these cases are: In re Lord Stratheden and Campbell[4], where a gift to a regiment was postponed until the appointment of the next Lieutenant-Colonel; Kingham v. Kingham[5], where a gift to the General Assembly of a church was contingent upon the sale of certain premises not owned by the testator and the delivery of the proceeds of the sale to the trustees under the will; Re Schjaastad Estate[6], where the gift was to the first Norwegian Lutheran Orphans' Home to be built in Saskatchewan and Alberta; In re Wightwick's Will Trusts[7], where the gift was to a named charity when the practice of vivisection should be abolished; In re Mander[8], where there was a gift of a fund for the training of a candidate for the priesthood, the fund to be invested until such time as a candidate should come forward from a certain church.\nThe applicable line of authority is to be found, not in these cases dealing with a contingent gift to a particular charity but in those where there was the general charitable intention and an immediate unconditional gift to charity, with a term of postponement or a condition attached to the particular mode of execution. Such cases are: Attorney-General v. Bishop of Chester[9]; Sinnett v. Herbert[10]; Chamberlayne v. Brockett[11]; Wallis v. Solicitor-General for New Zealand[12]; In re Swain[13]; Re Mountain[14], per Boyd C.\nThe principle is stated in 4 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 286:\nA gift to charity is not allowed to fail merely because the application to the particular purpose is postponed, as by a direction to accumulate. An immediate gift to a charity is valid, although the particular application of the fund directed by the will may not of necessity take effect within any assignable limit of time, or may never take effect at all except on the occurrence of events in their essence contingent and uncertain. Accordingly, bequests for the erection of almshouses or schools when the necessary sites should be obtained, to endow a bishopric in a certain place in case a bishop should be appointed, or to endow any additional church which might be erected, or bequests the application of which is postponed until a licence in mortmain is obtained, have been supported.\nA similar statement is to be found in Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities, 4th ed., p. 581:\n607. If the Court, however, can see an intention to make an unconditional gift to charity (and the Court is very keen-sighted to discover this intention), then the gift will be regarded as immediate, not subject to any condition precedent, and therefore not within the scope of the Rule against Perpetuities. The mode pointed out by the testator is only one way, though the preferable way, of carrying out the charitable purpose; and if it cannot, with regard to the general charitable intention, be carried out in that way, it will be carried out cy pres. Thus while the Court will allow the fund to be transferred to a corporation not in existence at the time of the gift, if such corporation is constituted in a reasonable time, it will not recognize the right of such non-existent corporation to keep the fund locked up until such time as it may please itself to be incorporated. The formation of the corporation is not a condition precedent to the charitable trust, and therefore the trust is not too remote. The cases where charitable gifts to non-existent corporations or societies have been sustained are numerous.\nMy conclusion therefore is that the validity of this charitable trust is not affected by the directions to accumulate these three funds out of residuary income. The accumulation is not a condition precedent to the existence of the charitable trust. Precisely the same point as to the effect of a direction to accumulate arose in Re Swain, supra. After the termination of a life interest in the residue of the estate, the trustees were directed to accumulate a reserve fund and then to begin paying three charitable annuities to poor inhabitants of a certain town. The direction to accumulate was not a condition precedent to the validity of the charitable bequest but a direction as to the particular application of the charitable fund.\nI turn now to the validity of the provision for accumulation. In the absence of a statute a direction to accumulate in favour of a charity would be subject only to judicial supervision as to its duration. But the Accumulations Restraint Act of British Columbia has been in force during the relevant period. Its principles are those contained in the corresponding English legislation under which the statutory restriction has been held to be applicable to charitable funds which are directed to be accumulated beyond the time permitted by the statute (4 Hals., 3rd ed., 302). The result is that on July 5, 1957, which is 21 years from the death of the testator, all accumulation must stop, both in the three funds and the residue itself. The appellant is therefore entitled now to the fund and one-third of the residue as they existed on that date.\nThe next question is the destination of the surplus income after July 5, 1957. All that has happened here is that the testator has directed an accumulation to extend beyond the legal limit in the carrying out of a general charitable intention. In these circumstances, the surplus income does not go to the next-of-kin but is to be applied cy-pr\u00e8s. This was the result in Re Monk[15], and in Re Bradwell's Will Trusts[16]. The rule is stated in Gray, 4th ed., at p. 630, as follows:\nBut where there is an unconditional gift to charity, the gift will be regarded as immediate and good, although the particular mode of carrying out the charity which the donor has indicated is too remote. Consequently in such a case if a direction for accumulation is invalid the only result is that the income is immediately distributable in charity; the heirs or next of kin are not let in.\nThe same principle is stated in 4 Hals., 3rd ed., 319. I notice a recent application of it in Re Burns Estate[17]. A scheme must therefore be settled by the Court for the cy-pr\u00e8s application of all the surplus income after July 5, 1957.\nThe only remaining question is whether the appellant is a beneficiary answering the description contained in the will. The trustee raises this doubt because the testator spoke of a Jewish Old Men's Home whereas the appellant is a Jewish Home for the Aged and admits men and women. In all other respects the appellant qualifies under the will. In my opinion, it makes no difference that the appellant admits aged women. The institution qualifies as a Jewish Old Men's Home.\nThe questions submitted to the Court will therefore be answered in accordance with the following principles. The appellant is entitled now to the fund and one-third of the residue as they existed on July 5, 1957. All surplus income after July 5, 1957, must be applied cy-pr\u00e8s and a scheme settled by the Court. Further than that I would not go on this application but I do suggest that when the application is made for cy-pr\u00e8s administration of the surplus income, the interested parties should at the same time consider joining with it an application for cy-pr\u00e8s administration of the two remaining funds and the two-thirds of the residue. It is now nearly 25 years since the death of the testator.\nThe costs of all parties throughout these proceedings including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal should be taxed on a solicitor and client basis and paid out of the remaining two-thirds of the residue. I make this order because the appellant has carried the burden throughout and because counsel for the next-of-kin and for others potentially interested in the residue were appointed by the Court to represent these interests.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: D.

It was alleged that the defendants falsely and maliciously published the editorial and that the same was defamatory of the plaintiff. The defences pleaded were, inter alia, a plea of qualified privilege and a plea of the defence of fair comment. At trial, on a motion for dismissal of the action, it was ruled that the editorial was published on an occasion of qualified privilege but that there was evidence of malice to go to the jury. The jury in answer to questions put by the trial judge negatived express malice but found that the comment was unfair. The action was dismissed and this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal; the latter granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nOn the assumption that the allegations of facts and circumstances on which the plea of qualified privilege was founded were proved, they were not such as to render the occasion privileged. The right which the publisher of a newspaper has, in common with all Her Majesty\u2019s subjects, to report truthfully and comment fairly upon matters of public interest was not to be confused with a duty of the sort which gives rise to an occasion of privilege. Globe and Mail Ltd. v. Boland, [1960] S.C.R. 203; Arnold v. The King-Emperor (1914), 30 T.L.R. 462; Adam v. Ward, [1917] A.C. 309; Allbutt v.

Southey, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from a judgment of that Court, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Spence J. whereby the appellant\u2019s action was dismissed with costs.\nThe action was for damages for libel.\nThe appellant is a vice-president of the Seafarers\u2019 International Union of North America; he resides in the town of Pointe Claire in the Province of Quebec. The corporate respondent is the proprietor of a daily newspaper published under the name of \u201cThe Globe and Mail\u201d, of which the individual respondent is the editor and publisher.\nThe words complained of were published as the leading editorial in the issue of \u201cThe Globe and Mail\u201d dated Monday, November 11, 1957, and are as follows:\nMISSION ACCOMPLISHED\nIt would seem in retrospect that Mr. Harold C. Banks, Canadian director of the Seafarers\u2019 International Union, was brought to this country for the specific purpose of scuttling Canada\u2019s deep sea fleet. If this was indeed the case, he has succeeded admirably. With the decision by Canadian National Steamships to strike its eight vessels on West Indian service from Canadian registry, Canada is left with only three ocean\u2011going merchant ships\u2014as against the hundred or more it had when Mr. Banks took over the SIU eight years ago.\nConsidering his record of criminal offenses in the United States, which he diversified and extended after coming to Canada, this country has done rather well by Mr. Banks. He enjoys great power and considerable wealth, his salary being a reported $12,000 a year. Unlike most other union leaders in Canada, he does not have to go through the irritating business of getting himself re-elected at periodic intervals; indeed, he was never elected in the first place. And he has influential friends; when he applied for Canadian citizenship this year, who should show up to vouch for him but such people as Mr. Claude Jodoin, president of the Canadian Labor Congress, and Mr. Frank Hall, head of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks.\nBut if Canada has done well by Mr. Banks, it cannot be said that Mr. Banks has done well by Canada. It is true that, by his forcible demands on ship owners he has made Canada\u2019s ocean-going seamen the most highly paid in the world. But in so doing, he has put virtually all of them out of employment. With Mr. Banks directing the SIU, almost every Canadian-owned deep sea ship has been transferred to a foreign flag, and is being worked by a foreign crew. This will now be the case with the eight West Indies vessels of CNS, which are to be registered in Port of Spain, Trinidad. The eight ships have been tied up since last July, owing to a strike called by Mr. Banks. At the time, he demanded a 30 per cent wage increase for the SIU members working them; CNS offered 10 per cent, which it later raised to 15 per cent\u2014not unreasonable considering that the West Indian service has run at a heavy loss for the last seven years. This latter offer was rejected by Mr. Banks even when CNS warned him that rejection would mean the registry transfer, and consequent unemployment of all the crew members concerned.\nMr. Banks\u2019 application for citizenship is still, apparently, before the Canadian Government, which has reached no final decision in the matter. We suggest, in the light of the CNS fiasco, that the application be turned down, and Mr. Banks be sent back to the U.S. He came here to preside over the dissolution of the Canadian Merchant Marine; the Canadian Merchant Marine has been dissolved. Why, then, should he remain? His mission has been accomplished, his work is done.\nThe action was commenced on December 3, 1957.\nIn the statement of claim it is alleged that the defendants falsely and maliciously published this editorial of and concerning the plaintiff and that in its plain and ordinary meaning it is defamatory of him and of and concerning him in the way of his office as vice-president of his union. In paragraph 6, thirteen innuendoes are alleged. In paragraph 7 it is alleged that notice of complaint was served on the defendants on November 21, 1957.\nIn the statement of defence publication is admitted. The defences pleaded are, (i) that the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning are no libel, (ii) that the said words do not bear and were not understood to bear and are incapable of bearing or being understood to bear the meaning alleged in the statement of claim, (iii) a plea of qualified privilege and (iv) a plea of the defence of fair comment.\nThe plea of qualified privilege is contained in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the statement of defence as follows:\n3. The Defendants say that the words complained of were published under the following circumstances\u2014\nThe said words were published following the decision by Canadian National Steamships to transfer its eight vessels on West Indian service from Canadian Registry to a Foreign Registry on the 9th of November, 1957. In July 1957 the Seafarers\u2019 International Union, of which the Plaintiff is the Canadian Director, called a strike which tied up the said eight vessels. After more than four months the strike was still not settled and the vessels were transferred to Foreign Registry as aforesaid, all of which was the subject of discussion and comment in the House of Commons and in the Public Press. 4. By reason of such circumstances it was the duty of the Defendants to publish, and in the intrests of the public to receive communications and comments with respect to the strike and the resultant transfer of eight vessels from Canadian Registry and by reason of this the said words were published under such circumstances and upon such occasion as to render them privileged.\nThe plea of the defence of fair comment is set out in paragraphs 6 and 8 of the statement of defence as follows:\n6. Insofar as the said words consist of statements of fact the said words are in their natural and ordinary meaning, and without the meanings alleged in paragraphs 6 of the Statement of Claim, true in substance and in fact; and insofar as the said words consist of expressions of opinion they are fair comment made in good faith and without malice upon the said facts which are a matter of public interest in the circumstances stated in paragraph 3.\n* * *\n8. In the alternative if any of the said words are capable of the meanings alleged in paragraph 6 of the Plaintiff\u2019s Statement of Claim then they are fair comment made in good faith and without malice on a matter of public interest. The said comment was based upon the transfer by Canadian National Steamships of eight vessels from Canadian Registry to Foreign Registry in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 3.\nThe action was tried in June 1958. Counsel for the appellant called two witnesses, the plaintiff and a Mr. Leonard McLaughlin who was the secretary-treasurer of the Seafarers\u2019 International Union of North America, Canadian District. Counsel then read some questions and answers from the examination for discovery of the respondent Dalgleish and closed his case.\nCounsel for the respondents then moved, in the absence of the jury, for the dismissal of the action on the ground that the words complained of were published on an occasion of qualified privilege and that there was no evidence of malice to go to the jury.\nIt appears that before commencing his argument on this motion, counsel for the respondents had announced his decision not to call any evidence. Shortly after counsel for the appellant had commenced his argument on the motion the learned trial judge called attention to this as follows:\nHIS LORDSHIP: May I interrupt you for a moment. I think it is only proper, Mr. Walker, that I should ask you, when you commenced your argument, the thing which I did ask you in chambers and therefore I omitted to ask for the record. Is it the intention of counsel for the defendants to adduce evidence?\nMR. WALKER: No, my lord, I am calling no evidence. At a later stage of his argument on this motion counsel for the plaintiff admitted that the strike and the resultant transfer of the ships involved to foreign registry constituted a matter of public interest; but, as I read the record, counsel did not admit that the statements and comments made about the plaintiff were made on a matter of public interest. This accords with the position taken by counsel in his opening to the jury in the course of which he said:\nWe shall also contend throughout this trial that what was said about Mr. Banks was not said on a matter of public interest; that it was substantially a personal attack and not mere comment or expressions of opinion on a matter of public interest.\nThese circumstances have a bearing on the submission of counsel for the respondents, to be mentioned later, that counsel for the plaintiff at the trial had in effect admitted that the editorial was published on an occasion of qualified privilege.\nAt the conclusion of the argument on the motion the learned trial judge ruled that the editorial was published on an occasion of qualified privilege but that there was evidence of malice to go to the jury.\nIn his charge the learned trial judge made it clear to the jury that they had the right to bring in a general verdict but he invited them to answer a number of questions and the jury followed this course. The questions and answers are as follows:\n1. Were the statements complained of and set out in Exhibit 1 under the circumstances in which they were used, defamatory of the plaintiff?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n2. (a) Insofar as the statements are of fact were they all true?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n(b) Insofar as the statements are expressions of opinion did they exceed the limit of fair comment? Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n3. Do the words complained of and set out in Exhibit 1 mean\u2014\n(a) that the plaintiff came from the United States to Canada for the specific purpose of ending the existence of Canadian ships at sea, contrary to the interests of members of his Union and the people of Canada?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n(b) that the plaintiff committed a substantial number of criminal offences in the United States? Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n(c) that the plaintiff has committed a substantial number of criminal offences of diverse kinds after coming to Canada?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n(d) that the plaintiff is a dictatorial and irresponsible union officer not subject to removal or re-election by the membership of his Union?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n(e) that the plaintiff has used threats of force in making demands upon Canadian ship owners?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n(f) that the plaintiff has caused loss of employment to be suffered by most or all of Canada\u2019s ocean-going seamen?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n(g) that the plaintiff, on his own initiative and without the authority of the membership of his Union, called a strike against Canadian National Steamships?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n(h) that the plaintiff, on his own initiative and without reference to the membership of his Union, demanded a 30 per cent wage increase for such members.\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n(i) that the plaintiff, on his own initiative and without reference to the membership of his Union, rejected an offer of a 10 per cent wage increase?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n(j) that the plaintiff, while posing as a representative of working seamen, was indifferent or hostile to their interests?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n(k) that the plaintiff deliberately used an office of trust held by him to cause injury and loss to the membership of his Union by whom he was employed?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n(l) that the plaintiff is an unfit person to be granted Canadian citizenship?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n(m) that the plaintiff is an unfit person to be permitted to reside in Canada? Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n4. If you have answered \u201cYes\u201d to any of the sub-questions in 3 above, does such meaning exceed the limit of fair comment?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\n5. When the defendants published this statement were they actuated by any motive other than their duty to publish communications and comments on a matter of public interest?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: No.\n6. At what amount do you assess the damages of the plaintiff?\n$3500.00 (Thirty\u2011five hundred dollars).\nUpon these answers the learned trial judge directed judgment to be entered dismissing the action with costs.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The first ground set out in the notice of appeal was:\nThat the learned trial judge erred in holding that the words complained of were protected by the defence of qualified privilege.\nLaidlaw J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, in summarizing the grounds of appeal presented in argument before that Court described the first of those grounds as follows:\nFirst, that the decision of the learned trial Judge that the occasion was one of qualified privilege, was erroneous, or, in the alternative, that the learned Judge ought to have found that part of the published article was within the privilege and part of it was not within the privilege;\nI have reached the conclusion that the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal were in error in holding that the occasion on which the editorial was published was one of qualified privilege and consequently do not find it necessary to consider the other grounds urged by Mr. MacKinnon in support of the appeal.\nThe reasons of the learned trial judge for holding that the occasion was privileged are as follows:\nThe first branch of the application may be disposed of very shortly. I think it is quite evident by consideration of the cases cited by counsel for the defendant, particularly Jenoure vs Delmege, [1891] Appeal Cases 73; Pittard v. Oliver, [1891] 1 Queen\u2019s Bench 474; Mangena vs Wright, [1909] 2 King\u2019s Bench 958; Adam vs Ward, [1917] Appeal Cases 309; Showler vs Maclnnes, [1937] 1 Western Weekly Reporter 358; Dennison vs Sanderson, [1946] Ontario Reports 601; and Drew vs Toronto Star, [1947] Ontario Reports 730; that the class of cases to which the defence of qualified privilege extends have, during the course of recent years, been extended, and that that extension will cover editorial comment by a metropolitan newspaper upon matters of public interest. It is difficult to conceive a matter in which the public would be much more interested in the year 1957 than the most important topic of industrial relations, when added to that there is the topic of the continued existence of a deep-sea fleet under Canadian registry. The latter topic, in fact, had so interested the public that it was included in a reference of matters to a Royal Commission, the report of which had not yet been rendered at the time of this alleged libel.\nThere is no more efficient organ for informing the public and for disseminating to the public intelligent comment on such matters of public interest, than a great metropolitan newspaper, which the plaintiff has proved the defendant to be. The members of the public have a real, a vital\u2014I might go so far as to say\u2014a paramount interest in receiving those comments.\nThe decision of Mr. Justice Manson in Showler vs Maclnnes has been critized but I feel that his words are most applicable to the particular situation which existed here, and I propose to adopt those words in this case where he said:\u2014\nThe whole citizenhood of Vancouver has and had at the time of the address in question a vital concern in the matter of industrial relations in the community and in knowing under what circumstances strikes might be called.\nadding the comment that for \u201call the citizens of Vancouver\u201d I would insert \u201ccitizens of Canada\u201d.\nThe statement of the rule as to the burden of proof where a defence of qualified privilege is set up, contained in Gatley on Libel and Slander, 4th edition, at page 282 (stated in the same words in the 5th edition of that work at page 270) was approved by this Court in Globe and Mail Ltd. v. Boland[1], and is as follows:\nWhere a defence of qualified privilege is set up, it is for the defendant to allege and prove all such facts and circumstances as are necessary to bring the words complained of within the privilege, unless such facts are admitted before or at the trial of the action. Whether the facts and circumstances proved or admitted are or are not such as to render the occasion privileged is a question of law for the judge to decide.\nIn the case at bar the evidence of the plaintiff shewed that the strike referred to in the editorial had commenced in July 1957 and that it had not been settled at the date of the trial. His evidence in cross-examination continued:\nQ. So that when the defendant says in the Statement of Defence that after four months the strike was still not settled, that is correct.\nA. That is correct.\nQ. And you also told us that the vessels were transferred to foreign registry. Now, Mr. Banks, I suppose you read the newspapers, do you?\nA. Occasionally. Q. And was there considerable newspaper publicity with reference to this strike and with reference to the transfer of the vessels?\nA. There was.\nQ. And was there discussion in the House of Commons with reference to the strike and the transfer of the vessels?\nA. There was.\nIt has already been mentioned that counsel for the plaintiff admitted that the strike and the transfer of the ships involved to foreign registry constituted a matter of public interest.\nI do not find it necessary to consider whether the allegations of fact on which the plea of qualified privilege was founded were sufficiently proved. If it be assumed for the purposes of argument that all the facts and circumstances alleged in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the statement of defence were proved it is my opinion that they were not such as to render the occasion privileged.\nWith the greatest respect it appears to me that in his reasons quoted above the learned trial judge has fallen into the same error as was pointed out in the judgment of this court in Globe and Mail Ltd v. Boland, supra, at p. 207, and has confused the right which the publisher of a newspaper has, in common with all Her Majesty\u2019s subjects, to report truthfully and comment fairly upon matters of a public interest, with a duty of the sort which gives rise to an occasion of privilege. It is not necessary to refer again to the authorities discussed in the case last cited, but I think it desirable to recall the passage from the judgment of Lord Shaw in Arnold v. The King-Emperor[2]:\nThe freedom of the journalist is an ordinary part of the freedom of the subject, and to whatever lengths the subject in general may go, so also may the journalist, but apart from statute law, his privilege is no other and no higher. The responsibilities which attach to his power in the dissemination of printed matter may, and in the case of a conscientious journalist do, make him more careful; but the range of his assertions, his criticisms, or his comments, is as wide as, and no wider than, that of any other subject. No privilege attaches to his position.\nThe following statement in Gatley on Libel and Slander 5th ed., at pages 322 and 323 is, in my opinion, accurate:\nThe defence of fair comment must also be distinguished from that of qualified privilege. In the defence of fair comment the right exercised by the defendant is shared by every member of the public. Who is entitled to comment? The answer to that is \u2018everyone\u2019. A newspaper reporter or a newspaper editor has exactly the same rights, neither more nor less, than every other citizen. In that of qualified privilege the right is not shared by every member of the public, but is limited to an individual who stands in such relation to the circumstances that he is entitled to say or write what would be libellous or slanderous on the part of anyone else. For instance, if a master is asked as to the character of a servant, and he says that the servant is a thief, he has a privilege which no one else would have. A privileged occasion is one on which the privileged person is entitled to do something which no one who is not within the privilege is entitled to do on that occasion. A person in such a position may say or write about another person things which no other person in the kingdom can be allowed to say or write. But, in the case of a criticism upon a matter of public interest whether it be the conduct of a public man or a published work, every person in the kingdom is entitled to do, and is forbidden to do exactly the same things, and therefore the occasion is not privileged.\nThe judgments given at trial in the cases of Dennison v. Sanderson, supra, and Drew v. Toronto Star, supra, relied on by the learned trial judge, in so far as they deal with the question of qualified privilege, must be regarded as having been overruled by the judgments of this Court in Douglas v. Tucker[3] and in Globe and Mail Ltd. v. Boland, supra. The judgment in Showler v. Maclnnes[4], is, in my opinion, inconsistent with the two last mentioned judgments of this Court and with our judgment in the case at bar and ought not to be followed. The other decisions referred to in the reasons of the learned trial judge are all distinguishable on their facts from the case at bar.\nThere are of course many cases in which publication of defamatory matter in a newspaper may be privileged either by statute or at common law; examples are to be found in The Libel and Slander Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 204, ss. 9 and 10, and in such cases as Adam v. Ward[5] and Allbutt v. General Council of Medical Education and Registration[6]. In the first of these it was held that the Army Council owed a duty to publish to the whole world a letter vindicating a General who had been falsely accused before the same audience of discreditable conduct and that publication in the press was therefore privileged; in the second it was held that publication in the press of an accurate report of proceedings within the jurisdiction of the General Medical Council erasing the name of the plaintiff from the medical register was privileged on the ground, inter alia, that it was the duty of the Council to give the public accurate information as to who is on the register and if a person\u2019s name is erased accurate information of the cause of its erasure.\nThe decision of the learned trial judge in the case at bar, quoted above, appears to involve the proposition of law, which in my opinion is untenable, that given proof of the existence of a subject-matter of wide public interest throughout Canada without proof of any other special circumstances any newspaper in Canada (and semble therefore any individual) which sees fit to publish to the public at large statements of fact relevant to that subject-matter is to be held to be doing so on an occasion of qualified privilege.\nHaving reached the conclusion that the learned trial judge was in error in deciding that the editorial complained of was published on an occasion of qualified privilege, it is not necessary to consider what judgment should have been given on the answers of the jury had the ruling of the learned trial judge been upheld; but I do not wish to be understood as agreeing that even in that event the action should have been dismissed; while the plea of qualified privilege and the answer of the jury negativing express malice would, on the hypothesis mentioned, have afforded a defence to the action in so far as it was based on the publication of defamatory statements of fact there remained the finding of the jury that the comment (and the editorial consisted partly of comment) was unfair. However, I do not pursue this question further.\nIt remains to consider what order should be made. Counsel for the respondents argued that if we should hold the publication was not made on an occasion of qualified privilege a new trial should be directed; this argument was based in part on the submission that at the trial counsel for the plaintiff had admitted that the occasion was one of qualified privilege. I have read all the record with care and cannot find that any such admission was made. Doubtless both counsel at the trial were familiar with the ruling which had been made by the learned trial judge a short time before in the case of Boland v. The Globe and Mail Ltd., supra, and, perhaps for that reason, counsel for the plaintiff concentrated his argument on the submission that even if the occasion was one of privilege the bounds of the privilege had been exceeded. The following passage at the end of the argument of the motion, and particularly the words I have italicized, would be inconsistent with the view that the learned trial judge considered that any such admission had been made.\nMr. JOLLIFFE: Therefore the gist of my submission is that even if the Court holds the occasion to be a privileged one, the editorial\u2026\nHis LORDSHIP: In short, even if the Court holds it is qualified privilege, qualified privilege only exists for the purpose for which the privilege is set up.\nMr. JOLLIFFE: Exactly, my lord.\nHis LORDSHIP: And if the motive goes beyond that, it is evidence of malice to go to the jury.\nMr. JOLLIFFE: Exactly, my lord. That is what I am attempting to say.\nHis LORDSHIP: I understand that.\nI am unable to find any sufficient ground for directing a new trial; I have given my reasons for holding that the defence of qualified privilege fails; the answers of the jury negatived the defence of fair comment; the error in law which, in my respectful opinion, was made by the trial judge was not one which would cause the jury to increase the amount of the damages or would otherwise prejudice the position of the respondents.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and that of the learned trial judge and direct that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for $3500 with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Jolliffe, Lewis, Osler & Gilbert, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Macdonald & Macintosh, Toronto.\n[1] [1960] S.C.R. 203 at 206, 22 D.L.R.

The defendant commission, a body corporate engaged in the production and distribution of electrical energy in Ontario, was enabled under an interprovincial agreement to utilize the water power of the river by the erection of dams at certain sites. Under the agreement the defendant acquired rights to the relevant portions of the river-bed and adjacent lands. Paragraph 44 of the agreement reserved the lawful rights of timber owners or others to drive their logs down the river.\nAs a result of the closing of the dams the flow of the river was so altered that the plaintiff was obliged to tow the logs which formerly floated freely in the current. The plaintiff\u2019s action for damages was dismissed at trial and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: It was a common law right of a riparian owner in Upper Canada and in Ontario since 1792 to dam the waters of a stream or river flowing through or past his lands for the purpose of using the water power, subject to the condition that he should not interfere with the rights of other proprietors, either above or below him. Wright v. Howard (1823), 1 Sim. & St. 190; Mason v. Hill (1832), 3 B. & Ad. 304; Embrey v. Owen (1851), 6 Exch. 353; Miner v. Gilmour (1859), 12 Moo. P.C.C. 131; Chasemore v. Richards (1859), 7 H.L. Cas. 349, referred to.\nThe right of lumbermen to float or drive their logs past dams lawfully erected in the province was one given by statute, c. 4 of 1828. This Act and subsequent statutes which gave and now give that right recognized the common law right of the riparian owner. McLaren v. Caldwell (1881), 6 O.A.R. 456, referred to.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s contention that the meaning to be attributed to the words \u201cdriving\u201d in s. 26(4) of The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act and \u201cto drive\u201d in para. 44 of the agreement is the floating or transmission of logs and timber with the aid of the natural current was rejected. The legislature and the parties to the agreement intended nothing more than the perpetuation of the log-owners\u2019 former rights of passage.\nThere was nothing inconsistent with the exercise of riparian owner rights to their fullest extent by the defendant with the exercise by the plaintiff of the easement or right of passage for its timber to which it was entitled under The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act. Orr Ewing v. Colquhoun (1877), 2 App. Cas. 839; Ward v. Town of Grenville (1902), 32 S.C.R. 510; Quyon Milling Co. v. E.B. Eddy Co., [1926] S.C.R. 194, applied.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s further contention that the right to drive its logs free in the current was made clear by para. 44 of the agreement was also rejected. The agreement clearly reserved to timber owners or others only such rights to drive their logs and timber down the Ottawa River as then existed. It did not purport to add to or implement such rights.\nThe issue as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the laws of Quebec differed from those in Ontario was not properly before this Court as this was an appeal from the Court of Appeal and the issue, not having been pleaded, was not considered by that Court.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The right of lumbermen in Ontario to use such rivers as the Ottawa for the transportation of their logs was recognized at common law as a part of the right of navigation on such rivers. Provincial legislation dealing with the rights of lumbermen driving logs and the rights of riparian owners to construct dams defined the manner in which the common law rights of each were to be exercised concurrently. In re Provincial Fisheries (1884), 9 App. Cas. 392; North Shore Railway Co. v. Pion (1889), 14 App. Cas. 612, referred to.\nThe rights of loggers were in no way greater than those of other members of the public. As they possessed no right of property in the water they had no rights as regards its flow, and so long as their right to pass their logs down the river was maintained in the manner provided by statute they had no cause of action against a riparian owner exercising his right to dam the river. Ward v. The Township of Grenville (1902), 32 S.C.R. 510; Caldwell v. McLaren (1884), 9 App. Cas. 392; Orr Ewing v. Colquhoun (1887), 2 App. Cas. 839, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Gale J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.D.

McDonald, Q.C., Allan Findlay, Q.C., and E.E. Saunders, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 which dismissed an appeal of the present appellants, the plaintiffs in the action, from the judgment of Gale J. at the trial dismissing the action. The Upper Ottawa Improvement Company was incorporated in the year 1859 and is engaged in the business of driving logs and timber down the Ottawa River from the head of Lake Temiskaming to the cities of Ottawa and Hull for such parties, including the other appellants, as may turn their logs and timber over to it for that purpose. The other appellants are the principal shareholders of that company and the services rendered by it are carried on at rates which approximate the cost of such services and, accordingly, any increase in such cost must in the main be borne by them. It will be convenient to refer to the Improvement Company hereinafter as the appellant.\nThe Ottawa River flows from Lake Temiskaming to the River St. Lawrence and forms the dividing line between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in the area with which this case is concerned. The respondent commission is a body corporate engaged in the production and distribution of electrical energy in Ontario and its general operations are carried on pursuant to The Power Commission Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 281, and predecessor statutes.\nBy an agreement dated January 2, 1943, made between His Majesty the King in the right of the Province of Ontario, His Majesty the King in the right of the Province of Quebec, the respondent and the Quebec Streams Commission, Quebec leased to the respondent certain tracts of land upon the Quebec side of the Ottawa River and the portions of the bed of the Ottawa River necessary to enable the respondent to utilize the water power of the river at La Cave, Des Joachims and Chenaux, with the right to enter upon, possess, occupy, use and enjoy such additional lands owned by the province as were necessary to enable the head water level of the dams to be raised to specified levels. The lands on the Quebec side of the river required for the purposes of the dams to be constructed and the approaches thereto were leased to the respondent for a term of 999 years. On its part the Province of Ontario granted rights in Ontario similar in their nature, to the Quebec Commission for the purpose of the construction of two other power sites on the Ottawa River. Paragraph 44 of the agreement provided that:\nThe granting of these presents shall not take away the lawful rights of timber owners or others to drive their logs or timber down the Ottawa River, not only within but also beyond the limits of the lands comprised in these presents.\nThe execution of this agreement, in so far as it referred to lands in Quebec, was authorized by c. 33 of the statutes of 1942 of that province and, by paragraph 6 of that statute, it was provided that:\nIt shall be a condition of the leases contemplated under sections 1 and 2 that no third party claiming to have been injured by reason of any development contemplated by the said leases shall have any remedy by way of injunction or other process but by way of damages only.\nIn Ontario, by The Ottawa River Water Powers Act, 1943, being c. 21 of the statutes of that year, the agreement referred to, which had been executed, was ratified and confirmed and the respondent commission authorized to do all acts and things necessary to carry out its terms. The commission was further authorized by s. 3 to exercise in its own name, on behalf of His Majesty the King in the right of the Province of Ontario without the authority of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, for the purposes of the said agreement all powers conferred upon it by The Power Commission Act and the provisions of The Public Works Act incorporated in The Power Commission Act by s. 21. The nature of the rights acquired by the respondent are described in an agreed statement of facts as follows:\nThe Defendant at all material times was the owner, lessee, or licensee with a licence to develop waterpower, of all lands on which the dams at Des Joachims, Chenaux and Cave & Fourneaux were constructed and of all lands forming the bed of the said river above each of the said dams as far as the upstream limit of the pool formed by raising the water at each of the said dams and of all lands adjacent to the said river which were flooded as a result of closing the said dams, with certain exceptions which are not relevant to this action.\nSection 11 of the statute read:\nNo person claiming that he has been or may be injured by reason of any development contemplated by the said agreement shall have any remedy by way of injunction or other process but by way of damages only. Part of that portion of the Ottawa River with which we are concerned was navigable and, accordingly, approval of the contemplated works under the Navigable Waters Protection Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 140, was required and obtained. The works were also approved in the manner required by The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 195 and predecessor statutes.\nThe dams at Chenaux and Des Joachims were closed in 1950 and the dam at La Cave in 1952. That at Des Joachims is approximately 130 ft. high, at La Cave approximately 100 ft. and at Chenaux 35 to 40 ft. The effect of the closing of the dams at La Cave and Des Joachims was to create large bodies of water above each dam in which there was virtually no current, where previously the logs had run freely in the river. The dam at Chenaux materially reduced the current in the river upstream for a distance of approximately 6 miles, though the logs still run freely at a reduced rate of speed. As a result, the appellant is obliged to tow its logs for almost the entire length of the ninety mile stretch of the river in question. Each of the dams is equipped with an apron or slide through which timber being brought downstream may be passed, and these have been approved as required by The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act above mentioned.\nIt is the contention of the appellant that its costs of operation have been greatly increased by the necessity of towing logs which formerly floated freely in the current and that additional expenditures are required to enable it to carry on its operations: that, in common with all other persons who float or drive logs down the Ottawa River, it is entitled to the benefit of the natural current of the river and that the action of the respondent in depriving it of that right is actionable.\nWhile the title to the bed of the river to midstream and the river\u2019s northerly banks between Lake Temiskaming and the city of Ottawa is in the Province of Quebec in the portion of the river flowing through that province, the pleadings treated the matter as if the laws of Ontario were alone to be considered in determining the issues and the case was argued either on that footing or on the assumption that there was no difference between the rights of the parties under the laws of Quebec and of Ontario at the trial and in the Court of Appeal. When the appeal was brought before this Court, however, the appellant applied for leave to amend the statement of claim by pleading certain present and former provisions of the laws of the Province of Quebec and, while this application was refused, the appellant was given permission to file a supplementary factum dealing with the asserted rights of the appellant under the laws of Quebec and we have had the advantage of hearing argument in support of and against this contention.\nIt is convenient to deal with the matter by considering in the first instance the rights of the respective parties, both at common law and under the existing statutes in the Province of Ontario.\nThe right of a riparian owner to dam the waters of a stream or river flowing through or past his lands for the purpose of operating a mill has been since 1792, in my opinion, a common law right in Upper Canada and in the Province of Ontario. That right was subject to certain restrictions at common law and has been made subject to certain statutory restrictions to be hereinafter referred to.\nIn the Province of Ontario the laws of England, as they stood on the 15th of October 1792, except to the extent that they have been altered or modified by statute, are to be resorted to (R.S.O. 1950, c. 293).\nFrom very early times the right of the riparian owner to utilize the current of such waters for the operation of a mill was recognized in England (see Cox v. Matthews[2], Hebblethwaite v. Palmes[3], Blackstone Commentaries, 1766, vol. 2, p. 14, Holdsworth History of English Law, vol. 7, p. 338).\nIn Wright v. Howard[4], Sir John Leach, V.C. said in part (p. 203):\nThe right to the use of water rests on clear and settled principles. Prima facie the proprietor of each bank of a stream is the proprietor of half the land covered by the stream, but there is no property in the water. Every proprietor has an equal right to use the water which flows in the stream, and consequently no proprietor can have the right to use the water to the prejudice of any other proprietor. Without the consent of the other proprietors, who may be affected by his operations, no proprietor can either diminish the quantity of water, which would otherwise descend to the proprietors below, nor throw the water back upon the proprietors above. This statement of the law was approved by Tenterden C.J. in Mason v. Hill[5].\nIn Embrey v. Owen[6], the head note reads in part:\nThe right to have a stream of water flow in its natural state, without diminution or alteration, is an incident to the property in the land through which it passes; but this is not an absolute and exclusive right to the flow of all the water, but only subject to the right of other riparian proprietors to the reasonable enjoyment of it; and consequently it is only for an unreasonable and unauthorized use of this common benefit that any action will lie.\nParke B., delivering the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber, quoted with approval what had been said in Wright v. Howard and Mason v. Hill, and said in part (p. 369):\nThe right to have the stream to flow in its natural state without diminution or alteration is an incident to the property in the land through which it passes; but flowing water is publici juris, not in the sense that it is a bonum vacans, to which the first occupant may acquire an exclusive right, but that it is public and common in this sense only, that all may reasonably use it who have a right of access to it, that none can have any property in the water itself, except in the particular portion which he may choose to abstract from the stream and take into his possession, and that during the time of his possession only. But each proprietor of the adjacent land has the right to the usufruct of the stream which flows through it.\nThis right to the benefit and advantage of the water flowing past his land, is not an absolute and exclusive right to the flow of all the water in its natural state;\u2026but it is a right only to the flow of the water, and the enjoyment of it, subject to the similar rights of all the proprietors of the banks on each side to the reasonable enjoyment of the same gift of Providence.\nBaron Parke quoted with approval a statement of the law in Kent\u2019s Commentaries, where the learned author said that all that the law required of the party from or over whose lands the stream passes is that he should use the water in a reasonable manner and so as not to destroy or materially diminish or affect the application of the water by the proprietors above or below the stream and, accordingly, he must not shut the gates of his dams and detain the water unreasonably or let it off in unusual quantities, to the annoyance of his neighbour.\nIn Miner v. Gilmour[7], where the action concerned the respective rights of riparian owners on the Granby River in Quebec, Lord Kingsdown referred to the fact that it was the French law prevailing in Lower Canada which governed the matter but said that it did not appear that, for the purposes of that case, any material distinction existed between the French and the English law. The judgment reads in part (p. 156):\nBy the general law applicable to running streams, every riparian proprietor has a right to what may be called the ordinary use of the water flowing past his land; for instance, to the reasonable use of the water for his domestic purposes and for his cattle, and this without regard to the effect which such use may have, in case of a deficiency, upon proprietors lower down the stream. But, further, he has a right to the use of it for any purpose, or what may be deemed the extraordinary use of it, provided that he does not thereby interfere with the rights of other proprietors, either above or below him. Subject to this condition, he may dam up the stream for the purpose of a mill, or divert the water for the purpose of irrigation. But, he has no right to interrupt the regular flow of the stream, if he thereby interferes with the lawful use of the water by other proprietors, and inflicts upon them a sensible injury.\nIn Chasemore v. Richards[8], the House of Lords approved the decisions in Mason v. Hill, Wright v. Howard and Embrey v. Owen. Lord Wensleydale said in part (p. 382):\nThe subject of right to streams of water flowing on the surface has been of late years fully discussed, and by a series of carefully considered judgments placed upon a clear and satisfactory footing. It has been now settled that the right to the enjoyment of a natural stream of water on the surface, ex jure naturae, belongs to the proprietor of the adjoining lands, as a natural incident to the right to the soil itself, and that he is entitled to the benefit of it, as he is to all the other natural advantages belonging to the land of which he is the owner. He has the right to have it come to him in its natural state, in flow, quantity and quality, and to go from him without obstruction; upon the same principle that he is entitled to the support of his neighbour\u2019s soil for his own in its natural state. His right in no way depends upon prescription, or the presumed grant of his neighbour.\nThe elaborate judgment of Lord Denman in the case of Mason v. Hill (5 Barn. and Ad. 1), in 1833, reviewed most prior judgments and authorities of importance up to that date, and fully established that proposition. But former authorities, and of a very early date when carefully considered, really left no room for doubt on this subject.\nWhile in some of the earlier cases it is suggested that the right to utilize the flow of the stream or to construct a dam in the bed of the stream depended to some extent upon the ownership of the bed of the stream, in Lyon v. Fishmongers\u2019 Co.[9], Lord Cairns, referring with approval to what had been said by Lord Wensleydale in Chasemore v. Richards, said that the right to the use of the stream did not depend upon the ownership of the soil, but was a right of the riparian owner. The decisions after the year 1792, in my opinion, simply declare what was the common law of England prior to that date.\nThe statutes which were passed by the Province of Upper Canada, by the Province of Canada, and thereafter by the Province of Ontario, which have dealt with the respective rights of riparian owners of all constructed dams on the streams or rivers in the province and of lumbermen driving logs upon such waters, do not in terms, except to a very limited extent, declare the right of the riparian owner but, in certain respects, restrict the manner of its exercise.\nThe first of these Acts which requires examination is c. 4 of the statutes of 1828 passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada. The preamble recited that, whereas it was expedient and found necessary to afford facility to those engaged in the lumber trade in conveying their rafts to market, as well as for the ascent of fish in various streams now obstructed by mill-dams for the accommodation of those residing at a distance from the mouths thereof, from and after May 1, 1829, every owner or occupier of any mill-dam which is or may be legally erected or where lumber is usually brought down the stream on which such mill-dam is erected and where salmon or pickerel abound therein in this province, who shall neglect to construct or erect a good and sufficient apron to the dam shall be guilty of an offence. The dimensions of the apron to be constructed were prescribed.\nThis was followed by an Act of the Province of Canada, c. 87 of the statutes of 1849, which amended the statute of 1828. It was recited that it was necessary to declare that aprons to mill-dams which are now required by law to be built and maintained by the owners and occupiers thereof in Upper Canada should be so constructed as to allow a sufficient draught of water to pass over such aprons as shall be adequate for the ordinary flow of the streams to permit saw-logs and other lumber to pass over the same without obstruction. After imposing the duty on the owner or occupier of the mill-dam to maintain such an apron or slide, s. 1 read:\nProvided always, that every such owner or occupier of any such Dam may construct a Waste Gate or put up Brackets and Slash Boards in, upon and across any such Apron for the purpose of preventing any unnecessary waste of water therefrom, and to keep the same closed at all times when no person or persons shall be ready and require to pass or float any Craft, Lumber or Saw Logs over any such Apron or Slide, but not until such Craft, Raft, Lumber or Saw Logs shall have gained the main Channel of the Stream.\nThis section not merely recognized, but authorized the damming of the waters except in the circumstances described.\nSection 5 read:\nAnd be it enacted, That it shall be lawful for all persons to float Saw Logs and other Timber Rafts and Craft down all Streams in Upper Canada, during the Spring, Summer and Autumn Freshets, and that no person shall by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across such Stream, prevent the passage thereof; Provided always, that no person using such Stream in manner and for the purposes aforesaid, shall alter, injure or destroy any Dam or other useful erection in or upon the bed of or across any such Stream, or do any unnecessary damage thereto or on the Banks of such Stream: Provided there shall be a convenient Apron, Slides, Gate, Lock or opening in any such Dam or other structure made for the passage of all Saw Logs and other Timber, Rafts and Crafts authorized to be floated down such Stream as aforesaid.\nBy c. 48 of the statutes of 1859 [consolidated] entitled An Act Respecting Mills and Mill-Dams which dealt, inter alia, with tolls payable to the owners of mills operated by water power, the owner or occupier of a mill-dam \u201clegally erected on any stream down which stream lumber is usually brought\u201d was required to maintain an apron of the nature described, and the provision for the construction of a waste-gate upon or across the apron for preventing any unnecessary waste of water therefrom and permission to keep the same closed when no person was ready to float any lumber or saw-logs over such apron or slide, contained in the Act of 1849 was repeated. By s. 15 the right declared by s. 5 of the Act of 1849 was given in an abbreviated form. Section 16 imposed upon those persons using such apron or slide, for the purpose of passing saw-logs and other timber, the duty to refrain from causing injury to such works.\nAfter Confederation the same subject-matter was dealt with in 1877 in Ontario by R.S.O. c. 113, being An Act Respecting Mills and Mill-Dams, and by R.S.O. c. 115, An Act Respecting Rivers and Streams. The first of these statutes substantially repeated the provisions of the Act of 1859 as to the requirements of the apron or slide upon such dams, and permitting the closing of the waste-gate when no person was ready to float lumber or saw-logs over the dam. The second statute provided that, so far as the Legislature of Ontario had authority to so enact, all persons may during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets float saw-logs and other timber down all streams and contained provisions imposing liability for any injury occasioned to such structure by timber floated down them. By s. 6 it was provided that the Act should not extend to the Ottawa or St. Lawrence Rivers.\nBy An Act for protecting the Public interest in Rivers, Streams and Creeks, being c. 17 of the statutes of 1884, the right to float and transmit saw-logs and other timber is restated and in s. 12 reference is made to \u201cpersons driving saw-logs other timber\u2026down any such river, creek or stream.\u201d\nThe first of the statutes passed thereafter that requires consideration is R.S.O. 1914, c. 130 entitled The Rivers and Streams Act. This by s. 3 again declared the right of all persons to float and \u201ctransmit\u201d timber, rafts and crafts down a river during the Spring, Summer and Autumn freshets, subject to the provisions of the Act. Section 17 authorized the Lieutenant\u2011Governor in Council to make regulations as to the description and dimensions of aprons and slides on dams, and such other regulations as to the mode of constructing them and the provisions to be made for the passage of timber, rafts and crafts as might be deemed necessary. Section 18 required all dams theretofore or thereafter erected upon any river down which timber is usually floated to be provided with a slide or apron, and s. 19 declared that, unless otherwise provided by the regulations, such apron shall be of the nature described. Section 21 substantially repeated the provisions of the Act of 1859 permitting the owner or occupier of a dam to keep the waste-gate closed when it was unnecessary to permit the passage of timber. Section 27 declared that where a dam or other structure for the development of a water power has been or should thereafter be constructed the Lieutenant\u2011Governor in Council may make such regulations as he may deem expedient respecting the use of the river or the waters of it.\nThe last mentioned statute was amended by c. 15 of the statutes of 1915 which declared that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council might by proclamation declare that any river, stream or creek to which The Rivers and Streams Act applied, should be subject to the Act and under the jurisdiction and control of the Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines. Section 4 provided that no person shall erect a dam, weir or other structure or work upon any river brought under the Act, except with the permission of the Minister and subject to such terms and conditions as he may see fit to impose:\nfor the efficient and proper user of such river as between the persons having a right to use the river or any works or other improvements thereon for lumbering, power or other purposes.\nThe statute in force at the time the construction of the works in question in this action was undertaken was The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 45. That statute appeared as R.S.O. 1950, c. 195.\nSection 9 of c. 195 provided in more detail for the obtaining of the approval of the Lieutenant\u2011Governor in Council to the construction of a dam in any lake or river and s. 10 specified that such approval should be obtained for any improvements to any existing dam. Section 17 provided that where a dam or other structure for the development of a water power on any river down which any timber is floated has been heretofore or shall hereafter be constructed, the Minister may make such order as he deems expedient respecting the use of the river or the waters thereof by, inter alia, persons using the river for the purpose of floating timber. Sections 20 and 21 require the maintenance of slides or aprons in dams theretofore or thereafter constructed and require that they shall afford sufficient depth of water to admit the passage of such timber as is usually floated down the lake or river on which the dam is constructed. Section 26(1) declared the public right of all persons to float timber down all lakes and rivers. Subsection (4) provides that persons \u201cdriving\u201d timber down a lake or river have the right to go along the banks to assist in \u201cfloating\u201d it.\nWhile there have been various other statutes enacted since 1828 dealing with the manner in which logs may be floated or driven upon rivers and streams in Ontario, I find nothing in their provisions which affects the matter to be considered.\nIt appears to me to be implicit in the terms of the statute of 1828 that the common law right of riparian owners to dam streams or rivers flowing through or past their lands for the purpose of utilizing the water power was recognized and the subsequent legislation to which I have referred up to the year 1915 merely regulated the manner in which that right was to be exercised for the protection of those persons desiring to obtain passage for their timber. From that date up to the present time that right can be exercised only with the permission and upon terms to be prescribed by the Minister of Lands, Forests and Mines and, in the present case, that permission was given. The right to close such dams when it was unnecessary to open them to allow passage of timber was in terms recognized by s. 1 of the statute of 1849 and by s. 1 of the statutes of 1859 and 1877. The erection of any dam in a river or stream of sufficient height to obstruct its flow must, of necessity, lessen the strength of the current, and so the log-drives of lumbermen upon such streams in Ontario during the last century must have been to a greater or lesser extent impeded by dams erected for the operation of lumber, grist or other mills from the time such operations were carried on in Upper Canada and Ontario. While we have been referred to many authorities in which there has been conflict between lumbermen and riparian owners who have exercised their right to dam streams or rivers in the province, in none of them has the question been raised as to the loss sustained by such drives being delayed. That is, no doubt, due to the fact, as disclosed by the evidence, that the first large installation of dams for the purpose of generating electrical energy in Ontario was at or about the commencement of the present century. These works, of necessity, affect the flow of rivers in which they are constructed for very much greater distances than was the case of the dams erected for the purposes I have mentioned.\nIf the common law right of the riparian owners to utilize the force of the river for the purpose of generating energy has been taken away, it must be the case that this has been done either impliedly by the rights given to lumbermen by the statutes to which I have referred or, as it is contended, by the terms of the agreement of January 2, 1943, or by the statutes authorizing and confirming the making of that agreement. There is no evidence in the case as to the existence of a custom permitting lumbermen to float or drive their logs past dams lawfully erected upon streams or rivers in Upper Canada prior to the year 1828. The statute passed that year recognized the necessity of permitting this to be done and imposed an obligation on the owners of mill-dams legally erected to provide a good and sufficient apron to the dam to permit such passage. I agree with the opinion of Patterson J.A. in McLaren v. Caldwell[10], that the right is one that has been given by statute and the statutes which gave and now give that right are those in which the common law right of the riparian owner is recognized.\nThe statute of 1828 recites that it is expedient to afford facility to lumbermen in conveying their rafts to market to provide means whereby they may pass dams upon the stream. The statute of 1849 speaks of allowing a sufficient draught of water to pass over the aprons to permit saw-logs and other lumber to pass over the same and requires that the aprons afford a depth of water sufficient to admit the passage of such logs as are usually floated down such streams, and the section which declares for the first time in express terms the right of the log\u2011owners reads that it shall be lawful for them to float the logs down all streams in Upper Canada. The same language is employed in s. 15 of the Act of 1859 and in s. 1 of c. 115 of the statutes of 1877.\nThe word \u201cdriving\u201d first appeared in the statute of 1884, s. 12 of which read:\nAll persons driving saw-logs or other timber, rafts or crafts, down any such river, creek or stream shall have the right to go along the banks of any such river, creek or stream, and to assist the passage of the timber over the same by all means usual amongst lumbermen, doing no unnecessary damage to the banks of the said river, creek or stream.\nIn subsection 4 of s. 26 of the Act of 1950 which deals with the same subject-matter the language is:\nall persons driving timber down a lake or river shall have the right to go along the banks of the lake or river for the purpose of assisting, and to assist the floating of the timber by all means usual with lumbermen doing no unnecessary damage to the banks of the river.\nAs I have pointed out, para. 44 of the agreement uses the expression\nthe lawful rights of timber owners or others to drive their logs or timber down the Ottawa River.\nIt is contended by the appellant that the meaning to be attributed to the words \u201cdriving\u201d in the statute and \u201cto drive\u201d in para. 44 of the agreement is the floating or transmission of logs and timber with the aid of the natural current. Evidence was given without objection by both parties as to the meaning the expression \u201cdrive\u201d or \u201cdriving\u201d bore in the timber trade along the Ottawa River. To some of the witnesses the expression \u201cto drive\u201d meant allowing the logs to flow freely down the current without \u201cpushing them or forcing them down\u201d. To others, the word \u201cdrive\u201d meant, as a noun, a body of logs in the process of being floated, and \u201cto drive\u201d the floating of logs or permitting them to run free with the current. I do not think this evidence is of any assistance in interpreting these expressions. While the language of the 1884 section refers to driving timber down a river or stream, the 1950 section includes driving timber down a lake where, admittedly, there is either no or no appreciable current. The contention was carefully considered by the learned trial judge and led him to the conclusion that the parties to the agreement and the legislature intended nothing more than the perpetuation of the log-owners\u2019 former rights of passage. With this I agree.\nIn Orr Ewing v. Colquhoun[11] Lord Blackburn said in part (p. 854):\nNow the public who have acquired by user a right of way on land, or a right of navigation on an inland water, have no right of property. They have a right to pass as fully and freely, and as safely as they have been wont to do, but unless there is a present interference with that right, or it can be shewn that what is now done will necessarily produce effects which will interfere with that right, there is no injuria, and I think that if there be no injuria, the foundation of the right to have the thing removed, fails.\nIn Ward v. Town of Grenville[12], which dealt with the rights of lumbermen to float timber down the River Rouge in the Province of Quebec, Girouard J., delivering the judgment of the majority of the court, said that lumbermen merely enjoy a right of servitude to transmit their logs along a floatable river. Davies J. at p. 528 said:\nThe true rule would seem to me to be that the right to float logs down such a river or stream as the one in question, being in the nature of a public easement, the rights of the log-owners and the riparian proprietors are concurrent and must be enjoyed reasonably without unnecessary interference one with the other, and without negligence. In Quyon Milling Co. v. E.B. Eddy Co.[13], Rinfret J. (as he then was), delivering the judgment of the court, said in part (p. 196):\nThe right of lumbermen or others floating or \u201cdriving\u201d timber is not a paramount right but an easement, which must be exercised with such care, skill and diligence as may be necessary to prevent injury to or interference with the concurrent rights of riparian proprietors and public corporations entitled to bridge or otherwise make use of the rivers, streams and watercourses.\nAs pointed out by Baron Parke in Embrey v. Owen and by Lord Kingsdown in Miner v. Gilmour, the right of a riparian owner to utilize the flow of the stream at common law was subject to the condition that he should not interfere with the rights of other proprietors, either above or below him. No such question arises in the present action. There is nothing inconsistent with the exercise of these rights to their fullest extent by the respondent with the exercise by the appellant of the easement or right of passage for its timber to which he is entitled under The Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act. We are asked to say in the present matter that these ancient rights of the riparian owner, so long embedded in the common law, have been taken away by inference, a conclusion which I find impossible to reach. Had the legislature intended that these rights should be restricted to any greater extent than has been done by the statute it would, no doubt, have said so in clear terms.\nIt is contended for the appellant that its right to drive its logs free in the current is made clear by para. 44 of the agreement of January 2, 1943. Apart from the fact that the appellant is not a party to that agreement, its terms clearly reserve to timber owners or others only such rights to drive their logs and timber down the Ottawa River as then existed. It does not purport to add to or implement such rights. Since there is, in my opinion, no basis for the right asserted under the legislation to which I have referred, para. 44 cannot affect the matter.\nThis action was commenced on March 31, 1954. By an amendment to the statement of claim made on March 5, 1957, a claim for damages was asserted with respect to what was said to be the practice at the dam at Des Joachims of decreasing on week-ends the amount of water flowing through the dam, with a consequent decrease in the quantity of water below it which occasioned loss of time and additional expense. Gale J. declined to deal with this claim for the reason that the damage complained of was said to have been caused after the issue of the writ, a conclusion with which I agree.\nThere remains for consideration the argument which has been addressed to us, based upon the laws of the Province of Quebec. If it had been intended by the plaintiff to assert that its rights under the laws of Quebec differed from those in Ontario, this should have been pleaded and the laws of Quebec proven at the trial (Canadian National Steamships Co. Ltd. v. Watson[14]). As this was not done, the matter was not considered either by Gale J. or by the Court of Appeal and when, as I have pointed out, an application for leave to amend the statement of claim was made before this Court, it was refused. In these circumstances, the issue is not properly before us since this is an appeal from the Court of Appeal and no such case was made before it. While it is true that in a proper case this Court requires no evidence of the laws in force of any of the provinces or territories of Canada (Logan v. Lee[15], Canadian Pacific Railway Company v. Parent[16]) such a case arises only when a law foreign to that of the lex fori has been pleaded.\nIt was said by the Judicial Committee in Miner v. Gilmour[17] and in North Shore Railway v. Pion[18], which concerned rights of riparian proprietors in Quebec, that there was no material distinction between the law of Quebec or Lower Canada and the law of England with respect to such rights and the case was conducted until it reached this Court on the assumption that this was the case. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the learned trial judge, had the issue been raised, would have been required to assume that there was no difference and, in my opinion, the matter must be treated in this Court on that basis.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs, including the costs of the motion of May 30, 1960. The judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are fully outlined in the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Locke with whose disposition of this appeal I am in full agreement.\nIt does, however, appear to me that the right of lumbermen in the Province of Ontario to use such rivers as the Ottawa for the transportation of their logs is a right which was recognized at common law as a part of the public right of navigation on such rivers, and that the statutes passed by the Province of Upper Canada, the Province of Canada and thereafter by the Province of Ontario dealing with the rights of lumbermen driving logs and the rights of riparian owners to construct dams did not have the effect of restricting the rights of riparian owners or of creating any new rights in the lumbermen but rather served to define the manner in which the common law rights of each were to be exercised concurrently.\nIn the case of Caldwell v. McLaren[19], the defendant did not claim that his right to use the stream in question for transporting lumber was a common law right, but rested his case entirely on the statutes of Upper Canada then in force. In the course of his decision Lord Blackburn said at p. 405:\nNo question arises in the present case as to this right of navigation; and, at all events up to a period later than 1849, it was a question of great doubt what the law of Upper Canada was on this subject. The right now claimed to use streams, not navigable for general purposes, to float down timber, was one which in England, if it existed at all, from the nature of the country, could not be important: it never came in question in any case of which we are aware. It is one which, in a new wild country overgrown with timber, might be very important, and it must have been a question of doubt what was the right.\nHe goes on to say:\nIt is obvious that it was very desirable that, for the purposes of encouraging the development of the country, these doubts should, as soon as possible, be solved. And as the legislature of Upper Canada had full power to enact what should be the law in that country, the real question is what did they enact? That the same considerations did not and do not apply to the Ottawa River can be seen from the decision of Strong C.J. in In Re Provincial Fisheries[20], where he says in relation inter alia to the Ottawa River:\nIt appears from several cases decided in the courts of the province of Ontario that such lakes and rivers are to be considered navigable waters and that the rule of the English law as to navigable tidal waters applies to them. I refer particularly to the cases of Parker v. Elliott, 1 U.C.C.P. 470; The Queen v. Meyers, 3 U.C.C.P. 305; The Queen v. Albert Sharp, 5 Ont. P.R. 140; Gage v. Bates, 23 U.C.C.P. 116; Dixson v. Snetsinger, 23 U.C.C.P. 235.\nIt is true that the right of fishing was not in question in any of these cases, the point in controversy in each of them having been the right of the riparian owner claiming under a grant from the Crown to the property in the bed of the river or lake opposite their land frontage. It follows, however, from the reasoning of the courts that such navigable waters were to be likened in all respects to rivers which, according to the common law, came within the definition of navigable rivers. (The italics are mine.)\nAs I read it, the passage from the judgment of Lord Kingsdown in Miner v.Gilmour[21], (a Quebec case) to which Mr. Justice Locke refers is definitive of the general law applicable to non-navigable rivers under which a riparian proprietor had the right to use the water flowing past his land for any purpose whatever, provided that he did not thereby interfere with the rights of other proprietors either above or below him. When the same passage is quoted by Lord Selborne in North Shore Railway Company v. Pion[22], (which was also an appeal from the Province of Quebec) it is immediately followed by this paragraph:\nThe question, whether this general law was, in England, applicable to navigable and tidal rivers arose, and (with the qualification only that the public right of navigation must not be obstructed or interfered with) was decided in the affirmative by the House of Lords, in Lyon v. Fishmongers\u2019 Company, (1876), 1 App. Cas. 662 at p. 683. That decision was arrived at not upon English authorities only, but on grounds of reason and principle which (if sound, as their Lordships think them) must be applicable to every country in which the same general law of riparian rights prevail, unless excluded by some positive rule or binding authority of the lex loci. (The italics are mine.)\nThe public right of navigation in the tidal rivers of England is described in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd ed., vol. 33, at p. 566, in the following terms:\nThe right of navigation in tidal waters is a right of way thereover for all the public for all purposes of navigation, trade, and intercourse. It is a right given by the common law, and is paramount to any right that the Crown or a subject may have in tidal waters, except when such rights are created or allowed by Act of Parliament. Consequently every grant by the Crown in relation to tidal waters must be construed as subject to the public rights of navigation. It is not a right of property; it is merely a right to pass and repass, and to remain for a reasonable time. (The italics are mine.)\nThe fact that this right was long ago recognized as extending to the rivers of England which are de facto navigable can be seen from a tract entitled \u201cDe Jure Maris\u201d which was published in 1787 and is attributed to Lord Hale. In this tract, under the heading \u201cConcerning public stream\u201d, the following paragraph is to be found:\nThere be some streams or rivers, that are private not only in propriety or ownership, but also in use, as little streams and rivers that are not a common passage for the king\u2019s people. Again, there be other rivers, as well fresh as salt, that are of common or publick use for carriage of boats and lighters. And these, whether they are fresh or salt, whether they flow and reflow or not, are prim\u00e2 facie publici juris, common highways for man or goods or both from one inland town to another.\nThat the right of navigation extends to the movement of logs down the navigable rivers of Canada has been recognized in a great number of Canadian cases, including The Queen v. Meyers, supra, at p. 341, Rowe v. Titus[23], Esson v. M\u2019Master[24], Keewatin Power Company v. Town of Kenora[25], per Anglin J., Ward v. The Township of Grenville[26], and The Queen v. Robertson[27].\nThe fundamental issue raised by this appeal, as I see it, is whether the log-owners\u2019 common law \u201cright of passage\u201d on such rivers as the Ottawa includes a right to the benefit of the flow of the waters thereof which has not been extinguished by statute and therefore constitutes one of \u201cthe lawful rights of timber owners and others to drive their logs or timber down the Ottawa River\u2026\u201d which are expressly reserved by the terms of para. 44 of the agreement of January 2, 1943, between The King in the right of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the respondent and the Quebec Streams Commission. It is clear that the rights of log-owners are not paramount to the rights of riparian proprietors and other users of the river, and this is specificially noted by Girouard J. in Ward v. The Township of Grenville, supra, at p. 524, where he said:\nWe are now brought to face the proposition of law set up by the appellant, that \u201cthe use of the river as a highway for logs is the paramount use\u201d, and that the municipal bridge, although lawfully erected, was an obstruction to the river. I cannot assent to this proposition of law. It is contrary to the well settled jurisprudence not only of the Province of Quebec, but throughout the whole Dominion and the continent of America.\nIn the same case, Davies J. (as he then was) said of the rights of loggers at p. 531:\nI think their right to float logs down the river is a concurrent right which they can enjoy reasonably with those of the riparian owners and the municipalities which have by statutory authority constructed bridges in the public interest across the river, and not a paramount right, and must be exercised with due regard to the rights of these others.\nIn Caldwell v. McLaren, supra, at p. 404, Lord Blackburn put the matter thus:\nOne of the practically most important rights of the owner of a portion of the soil of the river is the right to use the water for a mill, and in order to do so, or indeed for any other lawful purpose, to erect a dam on it. The public may have rights to navigate the stream, and whenever such a right exists, the right of the mill-owner and the right of the public come into conflict. They may co-exist, but when they do one or the other must be modified.\nThe respective rights of riparian owners and those using the waters of the river for purposes of navigation are carefully distinguished in the case of Orr Ewing v. Colquhoun[28], where Lord Hatherley said at p. 846:\nNow it appears to me that there are two totally distinct and different things; the one is the right of property, and the other is the right of navigation. The right of navigation is simply a right of way, and with that right of way you must not interfere in any manner by any course you take.\nIn the same case at p. 871 Lord Gordon made the following statement with which I respectfully agree:\nBut, in my opinion, the interests of the public in such a case as your Lordships are considering are very different from those of conterminous proprietors. The rights of the public are of a limited nature. They possess no right of property in the water itself. They have a right to the use of it only for the purpose of navigation. They have no rights as regards the flow of the water, or the withdrawing of water, if the right of navigation is not affected. If that right is not interfered with, they are not, in my opinion, entitled to complain of operations by proprietors for the beneficial use and occupation of their properties. In my view the rights of loggers are in no way greater than those of other members of the public. As they possess no right of property in the water they have no rights as regards its flow, and so long as their right to pass their logs down the river is maintained in the manner provided by statute they have no cause of action against a riparian owner exercising his right to dam the river.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Locke and the learned trial judge that the use of the words \u201cdriving\u201d and \u201cto drive\u201d as they occur in certain sections of the relevant statutes and in para. 44 of the agreement in no way affects or enlarges the common law rights of loggers and in my view the parties to the agreement and the legislature intended nothing more than the perpetuation of the log-owners\u2019 common law right of passage, subject to such modifications as are necessary to enable this right to coexist and be exercised concurrently with the right of the riparian owner to dam the river. The formula adopted by the legislature was to impose the requirement that riparian owners should construct and maintain slides or aprons for the passage of logs in the dams erected by them, and under this legislation the log-owners\u2019 right of passage is limited to the use of such slides or aprons.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs, including the costs of the motion of May 30, 1960.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter, Weir & Boeckh, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Tilley, Carson, McCrimmon & Wedd, Toronto.\n[1] [1959] O.R. 473, 19 D.L.R.

The transmission lines of the defendant power company were above the lot. The lot was open from all sides and was used by children to play. The municipality dumped snow up to a level of six to seven feet from the lines. A child, while playing on the snow, suffered severe burns when he came into contact with an 18 inch steel cable hanging from one of the lines.\nThe trial judge found both defendants jointly and separately liable. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed. The accident was the result of the common fault of both defendants.\nThe fault of the City was in the fact that it participated in the creation of a danger by dumping snow in such a dangerous place which was frequented by and accessible to young children. As to the power company, it was negligent in omitting to do anything, since it knew or should have forseen the danger caused by the accumulation of snow under its transmission lines.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Cliche J.

Sa m\u00e8re tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice, a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de la Southern Canada Power Company et de la Corporation Municipale de la Cit\u00e9 de Granby, la somme de $67,000.\nL'honorable Juge Cliche de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de Qu\u00e9bec a condamn\u00e9 les d\u00e9fenderesses conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 payer la somme de $31,658 sur la demande principale, et $1,302.50 sur la demande incidente. La Cour du banc de la reine2 a unanimement confirm\u00e9 ce jugement. Le montant accord\u00e9 n'est pas contest\u00e9 devant cette Cour, et seule la question de responsabilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nLes faits de cette cause ne pr\u00e9sentent pas de difficult\u00e9s et peuvent se r\u00e9sumer ainsi.\nIl y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es, la Southern Canada Power, l'une des d\u00e9fenderesses-appelantes, a construit une ligne de transmission de pouvoir \u00e9lectrique, sur un terrain appartenant en partie \u00e0 la Miner Rubber Company et en partie \u00e0 M. W. H. Miner. Ces derniers ont consenti en faveur de la compagnie un droit de servitude. Une ruelle partant de la rue Cowie divise les cimeti\u00e8res protestant et catholique dans la cit\u00e9 de Granby, et aboutit \u00e0 un versant assez escarp\u00e9 born\u00e9 au sud par la rivi\u00e8re Yamaska. C'est au bas de cette pente que se trouve, courant dans une direction est-ouest, la ligne de transmission, parall\u00e8le \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re.\nCette ligne \u00e0 haut voltage, a \u00e9t\u00e9 construite suivant les r\u00e8gles de l'art, et la distance r\u00e9glementaire de 25 pieds entre le sol et les fils \u00e9lectriques a \u00e9t\u00e9 soigneusement observ\u00e9e. Mais il est arriv\u00e9, comme d'ailleurs la chose s'\u00e9tait produite dans le pass\u00e9, que la Ville de Granby, l'une des d\u00e9fenderesses-appelantes, avec le consentement des propri\u00e9taires, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la neige \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 s'exerce la servitude de la Southern Canada Power. C'est l\u00e0 que se trouvait le d\u00e9potoir de la ville pour y jeter la neige qu'on ramassait dans les rues. Ceci a eu pour effet, \u00e9videmment, de r\u00e9duire substantiellement la distance s\u00e9parant les fils du sol. A la date o\u00f9 l'accident qui fait l'objet de ce litige s'est produit, soit le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1955, les enfants de la ville, avec le consentement tacite des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, sont venus comme d'habitude par la petite ruelle s\u00e9parant les deux cimeti\u00e8res, jouer et prendre leurs \u00e9bats, propres \u00e0 leur jeune \u00e2ge, sur les bancs de neige d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et accumul\u00e9e l\u00e0 par la ville.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que comme cons\u00e9quence de l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation du niveau de la neige, les fils \u00e9lectriques ne se trouvaient plus qu'\u00e0 environ 6 ou 7 pieds du sol, et qu'un fil d'environ 18 pouces de longueur pendait accroch\u00e9 \u00e0 la ligne, et offrait un danger additionnel. C'est pendant qu'il jouait avec ses compagnons sur l'amoncellement de la neige, que le jeune Turgeon a touch\u00e9 ce fil suspendu et a re\u00e7u les blessures pour lesquelles on r\u00e9clame.\nComme la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et celle du banc de la reine, je suis d'opinion que cet accident est le r\u00e9sultat de la faute commune des deux appelantes. La faute de la Ville se trouve dans le fait qu'elle a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation du danger qui a eu les tristes cons\u00e9quences que l'on conna\u00eet. Le fait d'accumuler ainsi de la neige sous la ligne de transmission, dans un endroit o\u00f9 le public avait acc\u00e8s, pr\u00e9sentait sans doute un danger pour la jeunesse tol\u00e9r\u00e9e sur ces lieux. Cette accumulation dans ce d\u00e9potoir r\u00e9duisait la hauteur des fils, contrairement aux r\u00e8glements qui prescrivent une plus grande distance afin d'offrir plus de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Je suis d'opinion que la Ville ne peut \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e de la faute qui lui est imput\u00e9e.\nLa faute de la compagnie est une faute d'omission. Cette derni\u00e8re savait ou devait savoir le danger que faisait na\u00eetre cette accumulation de neige sous sa ligne de transmission. Cependant, elle n'a rien fait pour pr\u00e9venir le danger. La derni\u00e8re inspection a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le 21 d\u00e9cembre de l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, et depuis cette date elle est demeur\u00e9e passive, alors qu'elle ne pouvait ignorer que la Ville d\u00e9posait de la. neige sous ses fils \u00e9lectriques. Elle a n\u00e9gligemment ferm\u00e9 les yeux devant un danger probable et facilement pr\u00e9visible. Son inaction doit n\u00e9cessairement engendrer sa responsabilit\u00e9.

On the day of his conviction, but before the time set for the sentencing, notice was given by the Crown that an application would be made 10 days later to impose upon him a sentence of preventive detention on the ground that he was an habitual criminal. The notice set out prior convictions and alleged that the accused was leading persistently a criminal life. A period of 25 months had elapsed since the accused was released from imprisonment for the last of these offences and his commission of the substantive offence in the present case. The trial judge found the accused to be an habitual criminal and took into consideration the nature and circumstances surrounding the commission of the substantive offence. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco. The accused appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\n1. Notice of the application required by s. 662(1) (a) (ii) of the Criminal Code may be given at any time that allows 7 clear days before the application and is also before the day of sentence on the substantive offence. There is nothing in the present Criminal Code to preclude such notice being initiated, as it was in the present case, by the giving of 7 days notice after conviction but before sentencing, although notice given 7 days before the trial, as was done under the provisions of the former Code, would still be valid as this would necessarily be 7 days before the conviction and therefore before the time of making the application. R. v. Stepanoff, 33 C.R. 273, overruled.\n2. The object of the notice is to prevent the accused from being taken by surprise as to the circumstances upon which the Crown intends to rely, but as the statute makes consideration of the substantive conviction a prerequisite to the hearing of the application, the Court is entitled to treat it as a material circumstance in reaching its conclusion on the merit of the application, whether such conviction is specifically mentioned in the notice or not. The trial judge, in reaching his conclusion, was fully justified in considering the conviction for the substantive offence and the circumstances surrounding it in light of the accused's past record. The finding of the trial judge should not be disturbed, as the nature of the substantive offence which was not only carefully planned but was similar in nature to four other crimes for which the accused had been previously convicted, was in itself evidence that he was leading persistently a criminal life.\n3. The fact that a conviction which had not been specified in the notice of application and which had occurred before the appellant was 18 years of age, was wrongly admitted together with evidence of an acquittal, did not influence or prejudice the trial judge against the accused.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco1, affirming a judgment of Ilsley C.J.

Jones, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by leave of this Court from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc1 affirming the finding of Ilsley C.J. that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the consequent imposition of a sentence of preventive detention pursuant to the provisions of s. 660 of the Criminal Code.

Guild Limited, situate at Musquodoboit and did there and then commit the indictable offence of theft contrary to Section 292 of the Criminal Code.\nOn the day of the conviction but before the time had arrived for considering the question of sentence thereon, the appellant was served by the prosecutor with notice that an application would be made to the Court on the 15th of February to impose upon him a sentence of preventive detention on the ground that he was an habitual criminal. This notice specified seven separate and independent occasions on which the appellant, since attaining eighteen years of age, had been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and proceeded to allege that the appellant practised no trade or profession, lived without employment on the proceeds of crime and was leading persistently a criminal life.\nAt the hearing held before the Chief Justice pursuant to this notice, the Crown produced the very considerable criminal record of the appellant, and in the course of so doing inadvertently introduced evidence of a conviction and an acquittal which had not been mentioned in the notice. At this hearing evidence was given by police officers that the appellant had been under police surveillance since his last release from prison in October 1957, that he had no regular employment, and that his general reputation in the community where he lived was not good, but there was no suggestion that he had been convicted or even arrested between the time of his last release and the time when he committed the substantive offence and it appeared that he had made some money by selling beer bottles to the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission.\nIn determining that the appellant was an habitual criminal and sentencing him accordingly, the learned Chief Justice undoubtedly took into account the nature and circumstances of the offence of which he had just been convicted which is hereinafter referred to as \"the substantive offence\". In dismissing the appellant's appeal from this determination, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc held that, having regard to the nature of the substantive offence and the circumstances of preparation, planning and deliberation which accompanied it, the evidence as a whole supported the conclusion that the accused was leading persistently a criminal life and found that the Chief Justice had not been influenced by the fact that the evidence of an acquittal and a conviction referred to above had been admitted at the hearing.\nIn holding that the notice of the application required by s. 662(1) (a) (ii) of the Criminal Code \"may be given at any time that allows seven clear days before the application and is also before the day of sentence on the substantive offence\", Mr. Justice Doull had occasion to state:\nI am quite clear that it (the notice) is sufficient and I am of opinion that R. v. Stepanoff (32 C.R. 362) was wrongly decided by following words of the former Act which have now been carefully omitted and by reading Section 662(a) (ii) as if it were the same as former Section 575C(4)(b).\nThe case of R. v. Stepanoff2 to which the learned judge referred was a decision of Lazure J. of the Quebec Court of Queen's Bench, Crown Side, which was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal3, holding that \"the notice called for in s. 662 must be given before the trial on the primary charge commences\". In the course of his reasons for judgment on appeal Mr. Justice Hyde said at p. 276:\nThere is nothing in the terms of these sections of the new Code indicating any reason for a change in the practice followed under the old one. Furthermore, as the learned trial judge points out in his notes, the economy of our criminal law requires that an accused shall know before he makes his plea the exact nature of the charge with which he is faced and the consequences thereof.\nAs a conflict plainly exists between the Appellate Courts of Nova Scotia and Quebec respecting the very important question of the time at which notice of application for imposition of the sentence of preventive detention is to be initiated and as the difference of opinion turns in some degree on the wording of both the present Criminal Code and that of c. 55 of the Statutes of Canada, 1947, it will perhaps be convenient to consider the relevant provisions of these two statutes together:\nTHE PRESENT CRIMINAL\nCODE\nCHAPTER 55, STATUTES OF CANADA, 1947\n660. (1) Where an accused is con-\nvicted of an indictable offence the\ncourt may, upon application, impose\na sentence of preventive detention\nin addition to any sentence that is\nimposed for the offence of which he\nis convicted if\n(a) the accused is found to be an\nhabitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion\nthat because the accused is\nan habitual criminal, it is\nexpedient for the protection\nof the public to sentence him\nto preventive detention.\n575B. Where a person is convicted\nof an indictable offence committed\nafter the commencement of this\nPart and subsequently the offender\nadmits that he is or is found by a\njury or a judge to be a habitual\ncriminal, and the court passes a\nsentence upon the said offender, the\ncourt, if it is of the opinion that,\nby reason of his criminal habits and\nmode of life, it is expedient for the\nprotection of the public, may pass\na further sentence ordering that he\nbe detained in a prison for an inde-\nterminate period and such detention\nis hereinafter referred to as preven-\ntive detention and the person on\nwhom such a sentence is passed\nshall be deemed for the purpose of\nthis Part to be a habitual criminal.\n660. (2) For the purposes of sub-\nsection (1), an accused is an habit-\nual criminal if\n(a) he has previously, since at-\ntaining the age of eighteen\nyears, on at least three\nseparate and independent\noccasions been convicted of\nan indictable offence for\nwhich he was liable to im-\nprisonment for five years or\nmore and is leading per-\nsistently a criminal life, or\n(b) he has been previously sen-\ntenced to preventive deten-\ntion.\n575C. (1) A person shall not be\nfound to be a habitual criminal\nunless the judge or jury as the case\nmay be, finds on evidence,\n(a) that since attaining the age\nof eighteen years he has at\nleast three times previously to\nthe conviction of the crime\ncharged in the indictment,\nbeen convicted of an indict-\nable offence for which he was\nliable to at least five years'\nimprisonment, whether any\nsuch previous conviction was\nbefore or after the commence-\nment of this Part, and that\nhe is leading persistently a\ncriminal life; or\n(b) that he has on a previous\nconviction been found to be\na habitual criminal and sen-\ntenced to preventive deten-\ntion.\n575C. (2) In any indictment\nunder this section it shall be suffi-\ncient, after charging the crime, to\nstate that the offender is a habitual\ncriminal. 662.(1) The following provisions\napply with respect to applications\nunder this Part, namely\n(a) an application under subsec-\ntion (1) of section 660 shall\nnot be heard unless\n(i) the Attorney General of\nthe province in which the\naccused is to be tried\nconsents,\n(ii) seven clear days' notice\nhas been given to the\naccused by the prosecutor\nspecifying the previous\nconvictions and the other\ncircumstances, if any,\nupon which it is intended\nto found the application,\nand\n(iii) a copy of the notice has\nbeen filed with the clerk\nof the court or the magis-\ntrate, as the case may be,\n662. (2) An application under this\nPart shall be heard and determined\nbefore sentence is passed for the\noffence of which the accused is con-\nvicted and shall be heard by the\ncourt without a jury.\n662. (3) For the purposes of sec-\ntion 660, where the accused admits\nthe allegations contained in the\nnotice referred to in paragraph (a)\nof subsection (1), no proof of those\nallegations is required.\n575C. (3) In the proceedings on\nthe indictment the offender shall in\nthe first instance be arraigned only\non so much of the indictment as\ncharges the crime, and if on arraign-\nment he pleads guilty or is found\nguilty by the judge or jury, as the\ncase may be, unless he thereafter\npleads guilty to being a habitual\ncriminal, the judge or jury shall be\ncharged to enquire whether or not\nhe is a habitual criminal and in that case it shall not be necessary to\nswear the jury again.\n575C. (4) A person shall not be\ntried on a charge of being a habitual\ncriminal unless\n(a) the Attorney General of the\nprovince in which the accused\nis to be tried consents there-\nto; and\n(b) not less than seven days'\nnotice has been given by the\nproper officer of the court by\nwhich the offender is to be\ntried and the notice to the\noffender shall specify the pre-\nvious convictions and the\nother grounds upon which it\nis intended to found the\ncharge.\nIn the 1947 statute these sections are grouped under the heading \"PART X(A) HABITUAL CRIMINALS\" whereas the sections of the present Code appear in Part XXI under the heading \"PREVENTIVE DETENTION\". That these headings reflect a basic difference in approach to the question with which both enactments are concerned can be seen from the fact that the 1947 statute provides for a trial \"on a charge of being a habitual criminal\" whereas the proceeding for which provision is made in the present Criminal Code is the hearing and determination of an application to impose a sentence of preventive detention. The following differences between these two enactments are at once apparent:\n1. Under the 1947 statute the method of bringing the matter before the Court was to include in the indictment for the substantive offence a statement that \"the offender is a habitual criminal\" (s. 575C(2)) whereas under the present Code the matter is to be raised by an application to impose a sentence of preventive detention (s. 660(1)).\n2. Under the 1947 statute the decision as to whether or not a sentence of preventive detention was to be imposed was not to be made until after sentence had been passed for the substantive offence (s. 575B) whereas under the present Code the application for imposition of such sentence is to be heard and determined before sentence is passed on the substantive offence (s. 662(2)).\n3. Under the 1947 statute the issue of whether or not the accused is an habitual criminal may be tried by a jury (s. 575C(3)) whereas under the present Code the application to impose preventive detention is to be heard by the Court without a jury (s. 662(2)).\nThe case of Brusch v. The Queen4 clearly establishes that \"the charge of being a habitual criminal\" referred to in s. 575C(4) was not a criminal offence and it is noteworthy, as has been indicated, that the new Code omits all reference to such \"a charge\" and the relevant sections do not purport to make provision for its trial but are carefully restricted to the hearing and determination of an application to impose sentence of preventive detention.\nThe fact that the 1947 statute, like that in force in England, (Prevention of Crime Act, (1908), c. 59) provided for the inclusion of the allegation of being an habitual criminal in the indictment charging the substantive offence (s. 575C(2)) has a significant bearing on the question of the time when notice was required to be given. It has been held under the equivalent provisions of the English statute that\n\u2026 when a prisoner is found guilty of the first charge, the charge as to being a habitual criminal must be tried at the same sessions, and cannot be postponed. You cannot split an indictment. \u2026\n(per Phillimore J. in The King v. George Jennings5).\nIt follows that as the substantive offence and the habitual criminal charge were required to be disposed of at the same sessions, the seven days' notice required under the old s. 575C(4)(b) was necessarily referable to seven clear days before the trial of the indictment which contained both allegations.\nAs was said by Mr. Justice Estey in Brusch v. The Queen, supra, at p. 381:\nWhat is more significant is that even in the indictment it is sufficient \"to state that the offender is a habitual criminal\" (575C(2)) and this statement can be added only after \"not less than seven days' notice\" (575C(4)(b)).\nIt can be seen, therefore, that whereas under the 1947 statute notice that the offender was to \"be tried on a charge of being a habitual criminal\" had to be given seven days before the trial of the substantive offence with which it was linked in the indictment, there is nothing in the present Criminal Code to preclude the notice of an application for preventive detention being initiated as it was in the present case by the giving of seven days' notice after conviction but before sentence, although notice given seven days before the trial as heretofore would still be valid as this would necessarily be seven days before the conviction and therefore before the time of making the application.\nIn the case of Regina v. Stepanoff, supra, both the trial judge and the judges of appeal appear to have placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Parkes v. Regina6, as holding that the preventive detention application contemplated by s. 660 must be heard \"immediately after conviction of the substantive offence\".\nIn the course of his decision, Lazure J. says:\nFrom the various reasons for judgment given in the Parkes case, it is evident that this notice must be given at least seven days before the trial of the accused and that immediately after the verdict, the Crown must request the judge to defer sentence and forthwith hear the evidence supporting the allegations contained in the notice.\nWith all respect, I am unable to find support for such a contention in the reasons of this Court in Parkes v. The Queen, supra, and I can only think that the learned judge fell into the error of attributing the meaning of \"forthwith\" to the word \"immediately\" as used in that case. In the course of his reasons in Parkes v. The Queen, supra, Mr. Justice Rand traces the history of the use of the word \"immediately\" in this connection and at p. 773 refers to the meaning attributed to it by Branson J. in Rex v. Vale7, where he said at p. 356:\n\"Follow immediately\" means dealing with the case without hearing the man's previous history and before sentencing him.\nParkes v. The Queen, supra, is certainly authority for the proposition that statements concerning the character or past life of an accused person are not to be interposed before the court between the time of his conviction and the opening of the hearing on the application to sentence him to preventive detention, but the fact that no such step is to be taken between the entering of the conviction and the opening of the hearing does not mean that the one must follow the other immediately in point of time. It is true that in Parkes v. The Queen, supra, this Court approved of the notice of application which in that case was given before the trial of the substantive charge, but as Mr. Justice Doull has said in the course of his reasons in the present case, \"\u2026 it does not follow that a notice at any time that is seven clear days before the 'application' is not sufficient.\"\nIn support of the contention that our criminal law requires that an accused shall know before he makes his plea the exact consequences of conviction of the offence with which he is charged, counsel for the appellant cited the provisions of s. 572(1) of the present Criminal Code which are as follows:\nWhere an accused is convicted of an offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous convictions, no greater punishment shall be imposed upon him by reason thereof unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that the accused, before making his plea, was notified that a greater punishment would be sought by reason thereof.\nIn my view this section has no application to the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. There is no valid analogy between the imposition of punishment \"by reason of previous convictions\" and the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention; in the former case \"previous convictions\" automatically expose the offender to greater punishment, whereas in the latter the separate and distinct issue of whether or not he is \uf84fn habitual criminal must be determined against him before the sentence of preventive detention can be imposed.\nWith the greatest respect for the views expressed by the courts of the Province of Quebec in the case of Regina v. Stepanoff, supra, I share the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Doull that the notice of an application for imposition of a sentence of preventive detention may be given at any time that allows seven clear days before the application and is also before the day of sentence on the substantive offence. There can, accordingly, be no valid objection to the notice given in the present case.\nIt was, however, strongly contended before this Court that this appeal should be allowed on the ground that the evidence leading to the conviction on the substantive offence should not have been taken into consideration by the learned trial judge in making his determination under s. 660 of the Code. This contention was supported on the ground that the conviction for the substantive offence was not set out in the notice of application as one of the \"previous convictions and other circumstances upon which it is intended to found the application\" which are required to be specified in such notice under the terms of s. 662(1)(a)(ii). It is to be remembered, however, that an accused must have been convicted of the substantive offence before the Court can hear the application to which the notice relates (see s. 660(1)). Such conviction is, therefore, not one of \"the previous convictions\" referred to in s. 662(1) (a) (ii) but the conviction upon which the jurisdiction of the Court to hear the application is founded. The object of the notice is to prevent the accused from being taken by surprise as to the circumstances upon which the prosecution intends to rely, but as the statute itself makes consideration of the substantive conviction a prerequisite to the hearing of the application, the Court is also entitled to treat it as a material circumstance in reaching its conclusion on the merits of the application whether such conviction is specifically mentioned in the notice or not.\nIn the present case, however, the conviction of the substantive offence was recited in the first paragraph of the notice in the following terms:\nTAKE NOTICE that, whereas you have been convicted for that you did at or near Musquodoboit Harbour in the County of Halifax on or about the 6th day of December, A.D. 1959, unlawfully break and enter the store of H. G. Guild Limited, situate at Musquodoboit Harbour and did then therein commit the indictable offence of theft contrary to Section 292 of the Criminal Code.\nThere can be no doubt that the learned trial judge was fully justified in considering the conviction for the substantive offence and the circumstances surrounding it in light of the appellant's past record in reaching his conclusion.\nAlthough the evidence taken at the trial for the substantive offence was not before this Court, I accept Mr. Justice Currie's statement that it shows\na system, a deliberate planning, a careful preliminary examination of the premises where the safe was blown open at night and money stolen therefrom.\nAs Mr. Justice Doull says, \"This was no crime on the spur of the moment, but a carefully planned crime.\"\nConsideration must, of course, be given to the fact that the appellant had not been convicted of any offence since his release from prison in October 1957, that there is some evidence of his having made a little money selling beer bottles and that the police evidence as to his criminal character and reputation was largely based on past experience, but these circumstances which were primarily for the consideration of the learned trial judge are not sufficient in my view to counteract the effect of the substantive crime which was not only carefully planned but was similar in nature to four other crimes for which the appellant had been previously convicted.\nIn the case of Kirkland v. The Queen8, the accused had been out of prison for six months before the commission of the substantive offence, the circumstances of which were consistent with the view that he yielded to a sudden temptation, and in the course of his decision allowing the appeal from a sentence of preventive detention Mr. Justice Cartwright said:\nIt was argued on behalf of the respondent that the appellant's criminal record coupled with the conviction of the substantive offence formed a sufficient basis for the finding that he was an habitual criminal. As to this I agree with the view expressed by Lord Reading L.C.J. giving the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Jones (1920) 15 Cr. App. R. 20 at 21:\n\"The legislature never intended that a man should be convicted of being a habitual criminal merely because he had a number of previous convictions against him.\" There have however been cases in which the Court of Criminal Appeal has upheld a finding that a prisoner was an habitual criminal on the ground that the nature of the substantive offence viewed in the light of his previous record was in itself evidence that he was leading persistently a criminal life.\nIn my view the present case comes within the latter category and the evidence of the appellant selling beer bottles and perhaps doing other odd jobs between convictions is subject to the consideration referred to by Darling J. (as he then was) in Rex v. George Jennings, supra, at p. 122, when he said:\nIf a man occupies a day or two of his time in doing work, that does not prevent him from being a habitual criminal. The word \"habitual\" is used in other collocations than in the phrase \"habitual criminal\". For instance, it is applied to drunkards, but a habitual drunkard does not mean a person who is never sober. Drunkenness is not continuous, nor are the acts of committing crimes.\nI am accordingly of opinion that the finding and the sentence imposed by Chief Justice Ilsley should not be disturbed on this ground.\nIt was also contended on behalf of the appellant that evidence of a conviction which had not been specified in the notice of application and which had occurred before the appellant was eighteen years of age was wrongly admitted together with evidence of an acquittal.\nApparently these items were inadvertently not deleted when the appellant's record was put in evidence but no objection was taken to their admissibility, and I agree with Currie J. that\nIt is seriously to be doubted if the learned Chief Justice did more than glance at the matters to which objection is now taken. It is inconceivable that such an experienced judge would be influenced or prejudiced against the accused to even the slightest extent even if he did look at them.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

As the nursery business had been established prior to the passage of a by-law which zoned the property for single family detached residences, it was a legal non\u2011conforming use of the land. A municipal by-law expropriated a strip from the frontage of the land for a grade separation and the subsequent raising of the grade cut off access to the street. The appellants could not get out on the second side of their property because of a railway line, nor for business purposes on the remaining side, where they had sold a parcel of land but had made no reservation for right of access for business purposes. The purchaser had conveyed a one-foot reservation to the township, which initially permitted the reservation to be crossed for any purpose, but later only on condition that the appellants used their property in conformity with the zoning by-law. As a result, the appellants could use the land only for residential purposes. The appellants appealed to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal reducing the amount of the award made by the arbitrator in arbitration proceedings resulting from the expropriation.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed, subject to a correction in the item of land for growing purposes.\nThe only difference in the amount of compensation between the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal was in the value of the land. The former reached his figure by allowing a specified amount per foot on an assumed frontage, whereas the Court of Appeal separated the value of that part of the land used as a sales station from that part used for growing purposes.\nThe Court of Appeal was right in its finding of error in the award of the arbitrator in his finding of value to the owner based on a valuation of land as though it were open for unrestricted commercial development, whereas it had but a limited non-conforming use.\nThe Court of Appeal correctly regarded the earnings record of the business as significant in arriving at value to the owner. This evidence had been overlooked by the arbitrator. The appellant\u2019s evidence of higher earnings to be attributed to the business based upon an annual accretion in the value of the inventory, which did not show in the income tax return, was not entitled to any weight.\nEvidence of value of commercial property used for a sales station, and evidence of value of commercial properties in the neighbourhood had little or no relation to the valuation of the appellant\u2019s non-conforming user, when the only alternative use to which the land would be put was for residential purposes. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reducing the amount of the award of the arbitrator in arbitration proceedings. Appeal dismissed.\nB.W. Grossberg, Q.C., and H.J. Bliss, for the claimants, appellants.\nA.P.G. Joy, Q.C., and G.M. Mace, for the contestant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellants were the claimants in arbitration proceedings resulting from the expropriation of part of their lands on the south side of Dundas Street in the Township of Etobicoke. The arbitrator awarded them the sum of $143,000. On the appeal of the municipality the Court of Appeal reduced this to $55,825. The appellants now seek to have the arbitrator\u2019s award restored or, in the alternative, an increase in the amount awarded by the Court of Appeal.\nIn 1936, the appellants purchased a parcel of land containing 8.77 acres for the sum of $4,000. In 1953, they sold 6 acres for $45,000. They were then left with a parcel of 2.77 acres roughly triangular in shape and fronting on Dundas Street. The frontage on Dundas Street was 563 feet but because of the shape the usable frontage has been taken to be about 400 feet.\nThe appellants grew and sold nursery stock on the premises. They also had a larger property at Caledon which they used for the growing of other stock which they used in their landscaping business.\nThe lands on Dundas Street were zoned by the municipality for single family detached residences. The nursery business was established before the zoning by-law was passed and was therefore a legal, non-conforming use of the land.\nOn March 6, 1956, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto passed a by-law which expropriated a strip of land on the Dundas Street frontage containing 773 acres for a grade separation at the railway. The subsequent raising of the grade on Dundas Street has cut the appellants off from access to that street. They cannot get out on the east side because of the Canadian Pacific Railway line; they cannot get out on the south side for business purposes because of their sale of the 6 acres. When they sold this property they made no reservation of a right of access for business purposes. The purchaser of the 6 acres conveyed a one-foot reservation to the Township of Etobicoke and this blocks the end of Cedarcrest Drive which was established on the six-acre subdivision. The township permitted the reservation to be crossed for any purpose up to October 31, 1958, but only afterwards on the condition that the appellants used their property in conformity with the zoning by-law. The appellants were, therefore, finally in this position. They had a house on a two-acre lot which they could use only for residential purposes. They had no access to Dundas Street and they could not continue their business on the property.\nThe arbitrator accepted the appellants\u2019 submission that the highest and best use of the land before the expropriation was for the nursery business and determined the compensation on that basis as follows:\nValue before expropriation\u2014Land............................................................\n$120,000.00\nBuildings.........................................................\n35,000.00\n$155,000.00\nLess value after expropriation\u2014Land and buildings...............................\n25,000.00\n$130,000.00\nCompulsory taking 10 per cent..................................................................\n13,000.00\nTotal...................................................................................................\n$143,000.00\nThe Court of Appeal also valued the land before expropriation on the basis of its business use but divided it into two parts and made separate valuations of that part of the land used for the growing of stock and that part used for its sale. On this basis, the Court of Appeal determined the compensation as follows:\nLand for sales station purposes ...............................................................\n(approximately \u00bd acre)\n$30,000.00\nLand for growing purposes........................................................................\n(about 1\u00bd acres)\n10,750.00\nBuildings......................................................................................................\n35,000.00\n$75,750.00\nLess value of remaining property..............................................................\n25,000.00\n$50,750.00\nCompulsory taking 10 per cent..................................................................\n5,075.00\nTotal..................................................................................................\n$55,825.00 It is apparent from these figures that the only difference between the learned arbitrator and the Court of Appeal is in the value of the land\u2014in the one case $120,000 and in the other $40,750. The arbitrator reached his figure by allowing $300 per foot on an assumed frontage of 400 feet. The Court of Appeal, being of opinion that the appellants were carrying on a combined business, allowed $30,000 for that part used as a sales station, calculated on the basis of $300 per foot frontage of 100 feet and $7,500 per acre for that part used for growing purposes.\nThe Court of Appeal found error in the award of the learned arbitrator in his finding of value to the owner based on a valuation of land as though it were open for unrestricted commercial development, whereas it had but a limited non-conforming use. What is being expropriated here is a strip of land containing 773 acres and the non-conforming use. The task of determining value to the owner, on the evidence given in this case was not an easy one but evidence of value based upon a right of commercial development could be of no assistance. In my respectful opinion the Court of Appeal was right in approaching the problem as it did. The compensation of $30,000 as the value of the land attributable to the sales station was generous, based as it was upon the high figures which were given for commercial land. The value of $7,500 per acre for land used for growing purposes was the highest permitted by the evidence and on this point, as is pointed out in the reasons of the Court of Appeal, there was no contradiction.\nThe learned arbitrator made a finding that the claimant as a prudent man would pay $143,000 rather than be deprived of the property expropriated. To me this is a startling figure. I cannot see how the claimant or any prudent man in his position could possibly think of paying such a sum. The Court of Appeal correctly regarded the earnings record of this business as significant on this point. The income tax returns, which included earnings attributable to the Caledon property, showed the following net earnings:\n1951..................................................................\n$3,801.18\n1952..................................................................\n4,347.84\n1953..................................................................\n4,514.01\n1954..................................................................\n4,925.04\n1955..................................................................\n4,641.77\n1956..................................................................\n3,678.13\n1957..................................................................\n7,116.02 In arriving at these earnings no deductions were made for wages of the claimant nor for interest on invested capital. I think that it is clear on these statements that the business was doing nothing more than producing a modest wage for one of the owners. Yet the original award gives the owners a sum which would produce, if invested at 5 per cent per annum, more than the entire business ever brought in, and that, without risk or the necessity of working. In addition they are left with the house and 2 acres.\nThe appellant submits that the Court of Appeal was in error in its emphasis upon the significance of the earnings of the business as shown by the income tax statements and also in its failure to attribute higher earnings to the business based upon an annual accretion in the value of the inventory which did not show in the income tax return. On the second point it is quite impossible to come to a conclusion which differs from that of the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal. Neither tribunal thought that the evidence on this matter, which came entirely from the appellant, was entitled to any weight. I am also of the opinion that there was no error in the Court of Appeal in its estimate of the importance of the earnings from the business in arriving at value to the owner and that this evidence was overlooked by the arbitrator when he made his finding that the appellant \u201cas a prudent man would pay $143,000 rather than be deprived of the property expropriated\u201d.\nThe award of the arbitrator ignored the fact that the use of the land was a non-conforming use and that the only change that could be made was to a use for single family detached residences. The Court of Appeal was right in its opinion that evidence of value of commercial property on Yonge Street, used for a sales station, and evidence of value of commercial properties in the neighbourhood had little or no relation to the valuation of the appellant\u2019s non\u2011conforming use when the only alternative use to which the land would be put was for residential purposes as above defined.\nMy conclusion therefore is that the Court of Appeal was correct in its review of this award and that no error has been shown except in the item of land for growing purposes (about 1\u00bd acres)\u2014$10,750. Both parties agree that this figure, as a matter of calculation, should be approximately $18,000. The parties can agree on the precise figure and the total amount to which the award should be increased. Subject to this, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIt should be noted that both the arbitrator and the Court of Appeal made a 10 per cent allowance for compulsory taking. The arbitrator stated that loss of stock and merchandise arising out of business disturbance was included in this item. There was no cross-appeal on this point. I mention this matter because the propriety of this allowance is under consideration in this Court in two other reserved cases and has not been raised in this case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Levinter, Grossberg, Shapiro & Dryden, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. Frank Moore, Toronto.\n"}

(Applicant) Respondent.\n1961: February 21; 1961: May 29.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSale of land\u2014Contract made in contemplation of compliance with planning statute\u2014Whether contract illegal as being in contravention of statutory prohibition\u2014The Planning Act, 1955 (Ont.), c. 61, s. 24.\nThe vendor who had entered into a contract for the sale of 95 building lots subsequently moved for a declaration that the contract was one that was prohibited by s. 24 of The Planning Act. Subsection (1) of the section prohibits agreements for the sale and purchase of land in an area of subdivision control unless the land is described in accordance with and is within a registered plan of subdivision. The lots, which were within such an area, were described by reference to a plan which was to be registered in the county Registry Office. At the hearing the declaration was made as asked and affirmed on appeal. The assignee\u2011purchaser appealed to this Court. Held (Martland J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The contract was not void for illegality as being made in contravention of a statutory prohibition. On the contrary, the contract was entered into in contemplation of compliance with the statute, which, by s. 24(3) (c), provides for this very situation by way of exception to the prohibition. The statute permits vendor and purchaser to enter into a contract subject to the condition of subsequent consent of the planning board. This was all that the parties had done in this case. Zhilka v. Turney, [1956] O.W.N. 369 and 815; Re Karrys Investments Ltd., [1959] O.W.N. 325, approved; Glenn v. Harvic Construction Co., [1958] O.W.N. 406, disapproved.\nPer Martland J., dissenting: The entering into the agreement was prohibited by subs. (1) of s. 24 of The Planning Act. The fact that it contemplated future registration of a plan did not take it out of that prohibition. The agreement was not saved by subs. (3)(c) of s. 24 because the necessary consent of the planning board was not obtained, nor was the agreement conditional upon its being obtained. Boulevard Heights, Limited v.

(1929), 43 C.L.R. 91, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming an order of Wilson J. declaring a certain agreement to be illegal in view of s. 24(1) of The Planning Act (Ont.). Appeal allowed, Martland J. dissenting.\nW.J. Smith, Q.C., for the respondent, appellant.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the applicant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Locke, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant Frances Truman is the assignee from the trustee-in-bankruptcy of Queensway Construction Company Limited of a contract for the purchase of land. It is admitted that she has all the rights of the original purchaser. The contract was for the purchase of 95 building lots which were described by reference to a plan which was to be registered in the Registry Office of the County of Halton. The contract was made in February 1956, and in April 1959 the respondent-vendor moved, pursuant to Rule 605 of the Consolidated Rules of Practice, for a declaration that the contract was one that was prohibited by s. 24 of The Planning Act, 1955, c. 61. At the hearing the declaration was made as asked and affirmed on appeall[2]. The assignee-purchaser now appeals. The purchase price for the 95 lots was $285,000. $2,500 was paid as a deposit on the signing of the contract; $62,500 was to be paid within 30 days of the installation of certain services later referred to in the contract. This date is called \u201cthe date of completion\u201d. The balance of the purchase price was to be paid within 12 months after the date of completion.\nTo find the date of completion one has to turn to para. 14 of the contract, which reads:\n14. It is a condition of this Agreement that the following installations and services will be furnished in respect of the said lands at the sole cost of the Vendor, graded and gravelled roads, watermains, main sanitary sewers, as may be required by the Township.\n(a) The Vendor will, on or before the time of granting a deed to the Purchaser, have paid to the Township of Trafalgar the sum required by them in respect to contributions to the parks and schools, sewage scheme, sidewalks and roads.\n(b) The purchaser shall pay to the vendor for sewer and water connections the sum of ($200) TWO HUNDRED dollars for each lot at the time of taking up a deed.\nThe statutory prohibition in s. 24 upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal is founded is not an absolute one. The section first permits a municipality by by-law to designate any area within the municipality as an area of sub-division control. Then follows the prohibition. After the passing of such a by-law\nno person shall convey land in the area by way of a deed or transfer on any sale, or enter into an agreement of sale and purchase of land in the area,\u2026unless the land is described in accordance with and is within a registered plan of subdivision,\nThese are the parts of the prohibition relevant to this appeal. Then the exception is stated in the following terms:\n(3) Nothing in subsection 1 or 2 prohibits any conveyance or agreement respecting land\n(c) if the consent,\n(i) of the planning board of the planning area in which the land lies, or\n(ii) where the land lies in more than one planning area, of the planning board designated by the Minister from time to time, or\n(iii) where there is no planning board, of the Minister, is given to the conveyance or agreement.\nIn addition to the exception by way of consent to the conveyance or agreement there are two other well defined exceptions where no consent is needed. These are not relevant to this appeal. The section ends with a penalty provision. A person who contravenes the section is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than $500.\nWith respect, I differ from the conclusion of the Court of Appeal. I do not think that this contract is void for illegality as being made in contravention of a statutory prohibition. On the contrary, this contract was entered into in contemplation of compliance with the statute and, as I read s. 24, the statute provides for this very situation by way of exception to the prohibition. The exception speaks of consent to a conveyance or agreement not of consent to a proposed conveyance or agreement. The statute permits vendor and purchaser to enter into a contract subject to the condition of subsequent consent and this is all that the parties have done in this case.\nThe conditional nature of the contract is shown by an analysis of the terms of payment and the obligations assumed by the vendor. After the payment of the deposit no further performance is required of the purchaser before the date of completion and before that date arrives the vendor must have complied with para. 14\u2014a performance which presupposes a compliance with The Planning Act and the completion by the vendor of the application for registration of the plan of subdivision. The consent provision in the Act permits the parties to enter into a contract of this kind and the contract itself provides for no illegal performance. Beyond the payment of the deposit, there is to be no further performance until the Act has been complied with. This is not illegality. The purpose of the prohibition is by the very terms of the section defined as subdivision control and there is nothing in this contract to do anything but carry out this purpose.\nThe course of judicial decision in Ontario on this statutory prohibition has not been uniform. In Zhilka v. Turney[3], the vendor agreed to sell a farm property with the exception of an ill-defined area on which the buildings stood. The purchaser obtained a decree for specific performance at the trial subject to compliance with The Planning Act within a reasonable time. The defence of illegality for non-compliance with s. 24 of The Planning Act was raised at the trial and also argued on appeal and there is no suggestion in the reasons of either Court that the contract could be declared void for illegality. The case was before the Court of Appeal on two occasions. On the first occasion the Court suspended judgment until the final disposition of the application for consent under The Planning Act. On the second occasion, when the appeal had to be re-argued because of the death of one of the appellate judges, the consent had still not been obtained, no doubt because of the uncertainty of the description of the property excepted from the sale. Nevertheless the Court allowed further time for it and directed a reference to the Local Master to ascertain the description.\nImplicit in the reasons of the Court of Appeal up to this point, with the defence of illegality squarely raised, is the principle that parties may make a contract and subsequently obtain the consent under s. 24 of the Act. On appeal to this Court[4] it was held that the contract could not be enforced because of the uncertainty in the description of the lands to be retained and non\u2011performance of a condition precedent. The Court declined to express any opinion on the defence based upon non-compliance with The Planning Act. Schatz J. in Re Karrys Investments Ltd.[5] correctly, in my respectful opinion, followed the principle which underlay the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe contrary line of authority in Ontario is to be found in Glenn v. Harvic Construction Company[6] and in the case presently under appeal. In the Glenn case the plaintiff was the vendor of a landlocked 5 acre parcel. The case was one where the consent of the planning board was required. The plaintiff applied for and obtained this consent to the conveyance of this land. The consent of the board was given upon the condition that the purchase of the parcel in question was for the purpose of land assembly. The plaintiff had mistakenly but innocently represented to the board that Harvic owned adjoining land. The board then withdrew its consent. The action for specific performance at the suit of the vendor and the counterclaim for the return of the deposit were both dismissed on the ground that the agreement of sale was illegal when entered into.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal raises certain difficulties. The Court did not decide the case on the simple ground of illegality. Its first finding was that the planning board had no power to give a conditional consent. Then followed the conclusion that, with the withdrawal of the consent, the contract was one prohibited by the section and therefore illegal. I can, of course, understand the result in the Harvic case. Without the consent, the vendor could not succeed in a claim for specific performance. I can also understand as an alternative basis for the decision a finding of illegality in the making of the contract. I cannot understand why illegality in the making of the contract should be made to depend upon the withdrawal of a conditional consent.\nFor the reasons I have given, I am of the opinion that a contract may be made in contemplation of planning board approval and that on this point the Zhilka case was well decided rather than Glenn v. Harvic and the case presently under appeal. This is all that has to be decided on this appeal and I express no opinion on the rights and obligations of the parties relating to the performance of the contract.\nI would allow the appeal with costs both here and in the Court of Appeal. Judgment should be entered dismissing with costs the motion for the declaration of illegality.\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting): The circumstances giving rise to this appeal and the relevant portions of s. 24 of The Planning Act, Statutes of Ontario 1955, c. 61, have been set out in the reasons for judgment of my brother Judson.\nIn my opinion the conclusions reached by the learned trial judge and by the Court of Appeal were correct. Subsection (1) of s. 24 expressly prohibits any person from entering into an agreement of sale and purchase of land in an area in a municipality which the council of that municipality, by by-law, has designated as an area of subdivision control, unless the land is described in accordance with and is within a registered plan of subdivision. The lands in question here were within such an area and were not described in accordance with a registered plan of subdivision. The description is of a number of lots on a plan \u201cto be registered in the County Registry Office of Halton\u201d.\nSubsection (3) (c) of s. 24 enacts that nothing in subs. (1) prohibits any agreement respecting land if the consent of the planning board of the planning area in which the land lies is given to the agreement. However, no such consent was given to this agreement. Furthermore there is nothing in the agreement to indicate that there was any intention that application should be made to the planning board to give its consent to the agreement. The agreement did contemplate that, pursuant to s. 26 of the Act, an application would be made to the Minister of Planning and Development for the approval of a subdivision plan. But that approval could only be granted by the Minister. It could not be given by the consent of the planning board. In my view, therefore, this is not the case of an agreement for sale of lands made conditionally upon consent being given pursuant to s. 24(3).\nMy conclusion is that the entering into the agreement in question here was prohibited by subs. (1) and that the fact that it contemplated the future registration of a plan does not take it out of that prohibition. The agreement is not saved by subs. (3)(c) of s. 24 because the necessary consent was not obtained, nor was the agreement conditional upon its being obtained. I find some support for the conclusion which I have reached in the judgment of this Court in Boulevard Heights, Limited v. Veilleux[7], and in the judgment of the High Court of Australia in George v. Greater Adelaide Land Development Company Limited[8].\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, MARTLAND J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the respondent, appellant: Prouse & Mackie, Brampton.\nSolicitors for the applicant, respondent: Cameron, Weldon, Brewin, McCallum & Skells, Toronto.\n[1] [1960] O.W.N. 183, 22 D.L.R.

He did not deny the killing, and he gave to the police a statement the admissibility of which was affirmed in the Courts below and is now unchallenged. After drinking heavily in a hotel until closing time, the accused met a woman who asked him to take her out in his car. While in the car she made sexual advances to him. After driving through various streets, he drove into a service station parking area. He then stabbed her with a knife, some fifteen times, pushed her out of the car and drove off.\nA psychiatrist was called by the Crown to give expert evidence on hypothetical questions in which were substantially included the material facts related in the accused\u2019s statement. He expressed the opinion that any one, able to do what the accused was alleged to have done, would have the capacity to form the intent to murder. The defence was accused\u2019s lack of capacity, on account of drunkenness, to form the intent to commit murder either under s. 201(a) (i) or s. 201(a) (ii) of the Code.\nThe conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal, the dissent being in respect of the admissibility of the psychiatrist\u2019s evidence. The accused appealed to this Court (1) on questions of law as to which there was a dissent in the Court below and (2) on other questions of law by leave of this Court granted under s. 597(1) (b) of the Code.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe evidence of the psychiatrist had been properly admitted.\nThe instructions given by the trial judge to the jury as to the intent required under s. 201 (a) (ii) of the Code and those he gave in answer to the questions put to him by a juror were in both respects according to law.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the accused\u2019s conviction on a charge of murder. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.B. Pomerant, for the appellant.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014At the conclusion of a jury trial presided over by Thomson J., at Toronto, the appellant was convicted of the murder of one Margaret \u201cPeggy\u201d Bennett, on or about the 10th of June, 1960, at the municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.\nHis appeal from this conviction was dismissed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2].\nAppellant then appealed to this Court (i) on questions of law as to which there was a dissent in the Court below, as provided under s. 597(1) (a), and (ii) on other questions of law by leave of this Court granted under s. 597(1) (b).\nThe circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence are described mainly in a statement made to the police by appellant some ten days after the fatal occurrence. The admissibility of this statement in evidence was affirmed in the two Courts below and is now unchallenged.\nFor the purposes of this appeal, this summary of the facts is sufficient. At about 9 o\u2019clock in the evening of the 9th of June, 1960, appellant, his wife, Douglas Zachariah and Hubert Vincent Baker went to the Wembley Hotel on Danforth Avenue, in Toronto. Shortly after they arrived, Mrs. Fisher returned home and the men, who had consumed beer in her company in the Ladies\u2019 Beverage Room, moved to the Men\u2019s Beverage Room where they drank beer and remained up to closing time, shortly after midnight The material events that took place thereafter are related with minute details in appellant\u2019s statement. Upon leaving the hotel, he met Peggy Bennett, whom he knew by sight as a patron of the hotel beverage room, and was asked if he had his car. He told her to wait while he went home to get it. He came back with the car and, upon her suggestion that they go to a restaurant to have some coffee, declared that he did not have any money. As they drove away, she asked him for a cigarette and he stopped at a restaurant where he knew he could get some and pay the next day. He thus obtained a package of Black Cat filter tips. They sat in the car outside the restaurant, smoking, and she commenced \u201cfondling\u201d him. He drove off again and she continued the fondling. He then indicated the various streets on which he travelled, with particulars as to traffic lights and signs. Finally, he told her that if she wanted to get it, she was going to get it, and wheeled into a service station parking area. There, with a knife, which he carried in his car, he stabbed her\u2014some fifteen times, according to the evidence. of the pathologist who performed the autopsy\u2014pushed her out of the car and drove off. On his way home, he threw away one of her shoes and part of the contents of her purse.\nTowards the end of his statement, he said, with respect to the actual time of the fatal stabbing:\nI really went off my rocker, I guess, or I must have been drunk, or a combination of both.\nAt trial, both Zachariah and Baker gave evidence as part of the case for the Crown and were then cross-examined by defence counsel as to the quantity of beer consumed by appellant at the hotel. According to Zachariah, appellant had four glasses of beer with him, but in the course of the evening visited other tables where, he assumes, appellant also drank. Baker declared that appellant had, that night, a \u201cconsiderable quantity\u201d of beer.\nBefore closing the case for the prosecution, the Crown called Dr. Norman Lewis Easton, Director of Psychiatry at the Ontario Hospital, New Toronto, and a practitioner of long standing in that particular branch of medical treatment. Having read appellant\u2019s statement and being asked an hypothetical question, in which were substantially included the material facts related in the statement, he expressed the opinion that any one, able to do what appellant was alleged to have done, would have the capacity to form the intent to murder, even if he had consumed twenty-five glasses of beer or more. Appellant, testifying subsequently in his own defence, swore that he had drunk, on that occasion, about twenty-five glasses of beer and that he had no recollection of what took place after he left the hotel.\nThat appellant killed Mrs. Bennett by the infliction, with a knife, of numerous kinds of wounds, including the perforation of the aorta, is not in issue. The defence was appellant\u2019s lack of capacity, on account of drunkenness, to form the intent to commit murder either under s. 201 (a) (i) or s. 201(a) (ii).\nThe dissent in the Court of Appeal is with respect to the admissibility of the evidence given by Dr. Easton. In the view of the minority, that evidence was inadmissible on grounds related to the qualifications of Dr. Easton, the nature of the opinion he gave, the form of the questions put to him to elicit that opinion, the facts he took into consideration to form it and the manner in which he expressed it. It is particularly emphasized that by giving that opinion, which, it is said, required no scientific knowledge or training and which any layman was in as good a position to form, Dr. Easton usurped the function of the jury. If admissible at all, it is added, it was at least inadmissible as part of the case for the prosecution when, at that stage of the trial, the issue of drunkenness as affecting the capacity to form an intent, had not been raised. The Judges of the majority considered that the Crown had to prove beyond doubt, as an essential element of its case, the intent required to constitute the offence of murder; that the issue of drunkenness had been raised in the cross-examination of Zachariah and Baker by counsel for the defence and in the appellant\u2019s statement; that Dr. Easton was qualified and in a better position than a layman to form an opinion in the matter and that there was no fault in the manner in which this opinion was elicited by the Crown or formed and expressed by the expert. They concluded that the evidence had been properly admitted.\nWith deference to the views of the learned Judges who dissented in the Court below, we are all in substantial agreement with the reasons expressed by Aylesworth J.A., who spoke for the majority, and concur in the conclusion which he reached.\nThe grounds upon which leave to appeal was granted are related (i) to the directions given by the trial Judge as to the intent required under s. 201 (a) (ii) and to those he gave in answer to the questions put to him by a juror. After carefully considering the submissions made at the hearing by counsel for appellant, in his full and able argument, we are all satisfied that the instructions given, in both respects, were according to law.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.B.

Her will, by which she devised and bequeathed all her property to her daughter and appointed her sole executrix, was admitted to probate. Subsequently, but within the policy period, the automobile, while being driven by L with the consent of the executrix, was involved in a collision with an automobile owned and driven by F. In an action for damages, judgment was given against the executrix in her capacity as such, and against L. Recovery was sought from the insurance company by F under s. 214(1) of The Insurance Act. An action against the same company was commenced by L, who claimed payment of his legal expenses incurred in defending the action brought against him and R.C.\u2019s daughter, which action the company had refused to defend. At trial the actions were dismissed, but on appeal both F and L were successful. The Court of Appeal granted the defendant special leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nOn the true construction of the policy, the claims against R.C.\u2019s daughter as executrix of the estate, and L, who was driving the automobile with the daughter\u2019s consent, were covered.\nThe matters which the plaintiff F was required to prove to maintain his action under s. 214(1) of the Insurance Act were: (1) the motor vehicle liability policy, and (2) that he had recovered judgment against a person insured under the policy for a claim for which indemnity was provided by the policy. As to item (1) the policy was proved and filed and its issue and terms were admitted in the pleadings. As to the matters set out in item (2) the plaintiffs made out a prima facie case in regard thereto by proving: (i) the formal judgment in the action of Finlay et al. v. Layng and Campbell; (ii) the record in the action; and (iii) the reasons for judgment. Continental Casualty Co. v. Yorke, [1930] S.C.R. 180, distinguished; Dokuchia v.St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. [1947] O.R. 417 and [1949] O.R. 170, discussed.\nIn the present case no attempt had been made to impeach any of the findings in Finlay et al. v. Layng and Campbell except the finding that at the time of the accident the automobile was owned by the daughter in her capacity as executrix. That point had been decided adversely to the defendant at trial and was not now questioned.\nThe trial judge was right in his conclusion that in the circumstances of this case the fact that at the time of the accident the automobile was owned by the daughter in her capacity as executrix was sufficiently established by proof of the judgment in Finlay et al. v. Layng and Campbell, the record of the action, and the reasons for judgment, and that it was unnecessary for counsel for the plaintiffs to call further evidence.\nThe judgment in that action, from which no appeal was taken, read in the light of the pleadings, furnished the best evidence of the nature of the claim against R.C.\u2019s daughter in her capacity as executrix for which the judgment had been recovered; and the question whether or not that claim, which had become merged in the judgment, was covered became simply a question of the construction of the terms of the policy.\nAPPEALS, argued together, from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing judgments of Spence J. Appeals dismissed.\nG.L. Mitchell, Q.C., R.E. Shibley, and J.K. MacKenzie, for the defendant, appellant, in both appeals.\nM. Lerner, Q.C., and M.A. Bitz, for the plaintiff, respondent, Harold Finlay.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and W.E. Bell, for the plaintiff, respondent, Ivan Layng.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014These appeals, which were argued together, are from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 pronounced on February 26, 1960, allowing appeals from judgments of Spence J. delivered on July 7, 1959.\nRegal Insurance Company Limited, the predecessor of the appellant, issued a standard automobile policy (owner\u2019s form) to Mrs. Rheta Campbell. The automobile described in the policy was a Chevrolet Sedan. The policy period was from June 14, 1957, to June 14, 1958. The perils insured against were (i) third party liability up to the limit of $100,000 resulting from any one accident, (ii) medical expenses incurred by persons who sustain bodily injury while in the automobile up to the limit of $500 for each person, and (iii) loss or damage to the automobile except by collision or upset but including fire and theft up to the actual cash value of the automobile at the time of loss or damage. The perils of damage to the automobile by collision or upset were not covered.\nRheta Campbell died on January 10, 1958. By her will, which was admitted to probate on February 3, 1958, she devised and bequeathed all her property to her daughter, Margaret Jean Campbell, and appointed her sole executrix.\nOn April 20, 1958, the respondent Layng was driving the automobile with the consent of Margaret Jean Campbell. It was found by the learned trial judge and by the Court of Appeal that at this time Margaret Jean Campbell was the owner of the automobile in her capacity as executrix; this finding was not questioned on the argument before us. While so driving the automobile Layng was involved in a collision with an automobile owned and driven by the respondent Harold Finlay, as a result of which Harold Finlay suffered injuries, his wife was killed and his six infant children were injured.\nOn August 5, 1958, the six infants by their next friend Harold Finlay and the said Harold Finlay commenced an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against the respondent Layng, Margaret Jean Campbell and Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as executrix of the last will of Rheta Campbell, claiming damages for the personal injuries sustained by them and damages under The Fatal Accidents Act. Prior to the date of the commencement of this action Margaret Jean Campbell and Layng had called upon the appellant to defend any proceedings against them which might result from the accident but it refused to do so on the ground stated in the following words in a letter from its solicitors:\nWe have advised the Insurance Company that under the existing circumstances the policy contract in question afforded no coverage to either Miss Jean Campbell or Ivan Layng, nor to the executrix of the will of Rheta Campbell deceased, in respect of loss or damage arising from the ownership, use or operation of the automobile described in the policy, on April 20, 1958 (the date of the accident in question), the insured person Rheta Campbell having died January 10, 1958.\nUnder the circumstances the Company is denying coverage and\/or liability under the policy and the Company has no intention of defending any actions which may be commenced against any or all of the said parties for damages allegedly resulting from the said accident although the Company will be obliged to receive notice of any such actions so that it may apply under the provisions of Section 214(9) of the Insurance Act to be added as a Third Party thereto.\nCopies of the writ and statement of claim served on Margaret Jean Campbell and Layng were furnished to the appellant\u2019s solicitors but the appellant did not make application to be added as a third party.\nMargaret Jean Campbell and Layng were separately defended. The statement of defence of each defendant denied negligence on the part of Layng and claimed that the collision was caused by the negligence of Harold Finlay. The action was tried before Stewart J., without a jury, and on February 3, 1959, that learned judge gave judgment finding that both Layng and Harold Finlay were negligent, apportioning the blame 90 per cent to Layng and 10 per cent to Finlay, and directing judgment to be entered in favour of the plaintiffs against Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as executrix of the last will and testament of Rheta Campbell and against Layng for the following amounts:\nHarold Finlay.......................................................................\n$20,287.96\nElizabeth Finlay..................................................................\n1,350.00\nJohn Finlay..........................................................................\n630.00\nMary Finlay..........................................................................\n855.00\nEmma Finlay.......................................................................\n2,610.00\nJames Finlay......................................................................\n4,230.00\nMargaret Finlay..................................................................\n1,530.00\nand also for the costs of the action which were taxed at $2,447.55.\nThe action as against Margaret Jean Campbell in her personal capacity was dismissed without costs.\nThe solicitor and client costs payable by Layng to his solicitors for defending the Finlay action were taxed at $3,932.75. On February 24, 1959, the respondent Finlay brought action against the appellant pursuant to section 214(1) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, which reads as follows:\n214(1) Any person having a claim against an insured, for which indemnity is provided by a motor vehicle liability policy, shall, notwithstanding that such person is not a party to the contract, be entitled, upon recovering a judgment therefor against the insured, to have the insurance money payable under the policy applied in or towards satisfaction of, his judgment and of any other judgments or claims against the insured covered by the indemnity and may, on behalf of himself and all persons having such judgments or claims, maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money so applied.\nThe statement of claim alleged the judgment of Stewart J., the issue of the policy to Rheta Campbell and its relevant terms including the description of the insured automobile, the death of Rheta Campbell, the issue of letters probate of her will to Margaret Jean Campbell, and continued:\n6. The said motor car while being driven by one Ivan Layng, with the consent and knowledge of the said executrix, was in a collision with a motor car owned and operated by the Plaintiff, Harold Finlay, in which the other persons referred to in Paragraph 3 above were passengers, at the intersection of the Poplar Hill Sideroad, and the 12th Concession of the Township of Lobo, in the County of Middlesex, on Sunday, April 20, 1958.\n7. Following the trial of the action instituted on August 5, 1958 in the Supreme Court of Ontario by the parties referred to in Paragraph 3 above for their damages arising out of the said collision, Mr. Justice Stewart who presided at the said trial reserved Judgment and pronounced Judgment on February 3, 1959 in the terms set forth in Paragraph 3 above.\nIn its statement of defence the appellant pleaded the terms of the policy, the death of Rheta Campbell on January 10, 1958, the grant of letters probate to Margaret Jean Campbell on February 3, 1958, the date of the accident April 20, 1958, and continued:\n5. At the time of the said accident the said vehicle was being driven by one Ivan Layng and the Judgment referred to in the Statement of Claim was granted against him as well as against the said Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as Executrix of the last will and testament of Rosieta Martha Campbell, also known as Rheta Campbell.\n6. Upon the death of the named insured Rheta Campbell, that part of the insuring contract relating to third party liability as set forth in Section A thereof, came to an end, and any right of indemnity thereunder became confined to any claim which may have raisen prior to such death.\n7. The Defendant submits that no obligation exists under the said policy of automobile insurance to indemnify Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as Executrix of the last will and testament of Rosieta Martha Campbell, also known as Rheta Campbell, in respect of the amounts awarded under the Judgment referred to in Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim because:\u2014\n(a) The insurer agreed \u201cto indemnify the insured, his Executors or Administrators. against the liability imposed by law upon the insured\u201d, the insured being Rheta Campbell;\n(b) The liability imposed by the said Judgment upon Margaret Jean Campbell arose by reason of the negligence of Ivan Layng while driving the vehicle described in the policy with the consent of the said Margaret Jean Campbell, and there is no obligation upon the Defendant to indemnify her against the said liability under the circumstances;\n(c) In any event, at the date of the accident in question April 20, 1958, the vehicle described in the policy was owned by Margaret Jean Campbell in her personal capacity and she was not insured by the policy.\nThe Defendant, therefore, submits that this action be dismissed with costs.\nOn April 20, 1959, Layng commenced action against the appellant. In his statement of claim he alleged the issue and terms of the policy, the death of Rheta Campbell, the appointment of Margaret Jean Campbell to be her executrix, the consent of Margaret Jean Campbell as executrix to his having possession of the automobile, the happening of the accident, the bringing of the action by the Finlays against him and Margaret Jean Campbell, the giving of notice of the action to the appellant, its refusal to defend, the trial before Stewart J. and his judgment, the retaining by Layng of his own solicitors to defend the action and the incurring by him of the liability to pay their costs of $3,932.75. The prayer for relief asked for payment of this amount.\nIn its statement of defence the appellant admitted the giving of notice of the action to it and its refusal to defend and set out the facts as to the issue of the policy and the death of Rheta Campbell. Its grounds of defence were set out in paragraphs 5 and 7 which reads as follows:\n5. Upon the death of the named insured Rheta Campbell, that part of the insuring contract relating to third party liability as set forth in Section A thereof, came to an end, and any right of indemnity or defence thereunder became confined to any claim which may have arisen prior to such death.\n* * *\n7. At the time of the accident mentioned in paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim, the plaintiff was not driving the automobile with the consent of the person insured by the said policy of insurance, she having previously died as aforesaid and the terms of the policy relating to consent having thereby become terminated; and the plaintiff was not entitled to have the action Harold Finlay et al. vs. Ivan Layng et al. defended on his behalf by the defendant; nor is he now entitled to be indemnified against the costs of defence incurred by him, as claimed in this action.\nThe two actions came on for trial at London in June, 1959, before Spence J. and were ordered to be tried together.\nBefore any evidence was tendered there was some discussion between the Court and counsel in the course of which the following appears:\nMr. Mitchell (counsel at the trial for the appellant):\nIn order perhaps to clarify the issues, which are set forth fairly clearly in the pleadings, if your lordship would refer for a moment to the Statement of Defence it sets forth our position. Your lordship will notice paragraph Six in what we call a Fresh Statement of Defence:\nMr. Mitchell then read the whole of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the statement of defence in the Finlay action which have been quoted above and the discussion continued:\nHIS LORDSHIP: Certainly, the late Mrs. Campbell was not driving the vehicle. There is a judgment against her estate on the ground of her ownership, and surely that is res judicata, and I do not deal with that defence\u2014\nMr. MITCHELL: I submit it is not res judicata as against the Global General Insurance Company. We were not a party to those proceedings.\nHIS LORDSHIP: I presume the estate gave you notice and you preferred not to defend, and I am afraid you are going to be bound by it under those circumstances. However, we will not argue the case at the beginning\u2014\nMr. MITCHELL: I submit that it is not res judicata and it is one of the things to be determined before your lordship.\nHIS LORDSHIP: Well, proceed.\nCounsel for Finlay then called the local registrar of the Court at London and filed as Exhibit 1 a certified copy of the formal judgment of Stewart J. of February 3, 1959, and as Exhibit 2 the record in that action. He then tendered a copy of the reasons for judgment of Stewart J., and counsel for the appellant objected as follows:\nMr. MITCHELL: May I object to the production and filing of the reasons for judgment. I do not think they are evidence in this action\u2014the judgment is evidence, but surely the reasons for judgment cannot be evidence in this action. I know of no rule that would make those reasons for judgment evidence. After hearing argument on the objection the learned judge admitted the evidence and the reasons were filed as Exhibit 3. The ruling was expressed as follows:\nHIS LORDSHIP: Well, I will have all the material\u2014I do not see how a judgment was recovered in that action against the estate of Rosieta Martha Campbell unless the estate of Rosieta Martha Campbell was the owner of the vehicle at the time the accident occurred. If there was that judgment recovered, then it is res judicata between the parties, and I am going to have all the material before me before I determine that it is res judicata, so I will permit it to be filed. Your objection is noted.\nHowever, Layng was later called as a witness and on his evidence the learned trial judge found as a fact that at the time of the accident the automobile was owned by Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as executrix; that finding was affirmed in the Court of Appeal and, as has been mentioned, it was not questioned before us.\nCounsel for the plaintiffs filed the insurance policy, the letters probate of the will of Rheta Campbell, the certificate of taxation of the costs in the action of Finlay v. Layng et al., the certificate of taxation of the bill payable by Layng to his solicitors, and a number of letters establishing that due notice of all relevant claims and proceedings had been given to the appellant and that it had refused to defend the action on behalf of either Margaret Jean Campbell or Layng.\nHarold Finlay was called and proved that nothing had been paid on account of the judgment awarded to him.\nIt would appear from the reasons of the learned trial judge that only two questions were argued before him, (i) whether the third party liability coverage afforded by the policy terminated upon the death of Rheta Campbell except as to any claim which might have arisen prior to her death, and (ii) whether at the time of the accident giving rise to the judgment obtained by Finlay the automobile was owned by Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as executrix.\nThe learned trial judge decided the first of these questions in favour of the appellant and the second in favour of the respondents and accordingly dismissed both actions.\nBoth Finlay and Layng appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and their appeals were allowed. The Court of Appeal granted the appellant special leave to appeal to this Court in the Layng action and in the Finlay action with respect to the interests of those persons represented by the plaintiff whose interests do not exceed $10,000.\nThe reasons for the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal were delivered by Schroeder J.A. They deal fully with the question of the proper construction of the policy in the light of the relevant statutory provisions. I am in substantial agreement with those reasons and wish to adopt the following conclusions stated by the learned Justice of Appeal:\nOn a careful consideration of the words used, read in the light of the provisions of statutory condition l(a)(b)(i) to which I shall refer later, it is evident that the parties had in contemplation the continuance of the insurance protection provided in section A of the insuring agreement in favour of the executors or administrators of the insured applicant in the event of her death occurring during the currency of the policy. In the view which I take the policy, in its primary import, is doubtless a single insurance for the benefit of a single insured. The identity of the insured changes, however, when her death occurs, and her executor or administrator is then substituted in her place as the insured for the balance of the term of the policy with all the rights to indemnification of the primary insured so long as the executor or administrator remains the owner of the vehicle specified in the policy. If that be the correct view then the words \u201cevery other person who with the insured\u2019s consent personally drives the automobile\u201d refer to the consent of the primary insured\u2019s executor or administrator and the words \u201cagainst the liability imposed by law upon the insured\u201d are to be construed in the same manner.\n* * *\nThe executrix of the primary insured is an insured person within the meaning of this policy to the same extent as she would be if she had been identified therein suo proprio nomine, because the executor or administrator of an insured is a person who is readily identifiable, and the maxim certum est quod certum reddi potest applies. It follows that the executrix has been sufficiently named as the insured to entitle her to recover, and the same right enures to the benefit of the plaintiff Layng who, on the occasion in question, was driving the automobile with the consent of the then named insured, the executrix of the deceased policyholder.\nThere remains a question argued before us but not dealt with in the reasons of the learned trial judge or in those of the Court of Appeal, and not included in Part II of the factum filed by the appellant in this Court. In the course of the argument set out in Part III of the appellant\u2019s factum the point is stated as follows:\nThe plaintiffs maintain these actions under s. 214(1) of the Insurance Act.\nIn order to succeed under this section a judgment creditor must prove:\n(1) The Agreement to indemnify; (2) That his loss or damage arose from the use or operation of the motor vehicle in respect of which the policy of insurance was issued;\n(3) That the insured person was legally liable to him in damages for such loss or damage.\n* * *\nProof that loss or damage arose from the use or operation of the motor vehicle in respect of which the policy of insurance was issued, and that the insured was legally liable to a judgment creditor for damages for such loss or damage, is not established by merely filing the formal judgment and reasons therefor in the action giving rise to an action under Section 214(1) supra.\n* * *\nIt is submitted that the plaintiffs failed to make out their case at the trial of this action because they attempted to do so by filing the formal judgment and the Reasons for Judgment in the action Finlay et al. vs. Campbell and Layng and did not prove the fundamental requisites required by the decision in the Yorke case. (i.e. Continental Casualty Co. v. Yorke [1930] S.C.R. 180).\nIn support of this submission counsel for the appellant cites the Yorke case, supra, and the two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Dokuchia v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company[2].\nIn my view the matters which the respondent Finlay was required to prove to maintain his action under s. 214(1) may be more accurately stated as follows:\n(1) The motor vehicle liability policy;\n(2) That he had recovered judgment against a person insured under the policy for a claim for which indemnity was provided by the policy.\nItem (1) presents no problem, the policy was proved and filed and its issue and terms were admitted in the pleadings.\nIt could well be argued that the matters set out in item (2) were sufficiently admitted in the pleadings which have been quoted above, particularly in paragraph 5 and in the first sentence of clause (6) of paragraph 7 of the Statement of Defence in the Finlay action:\n5. At the time of the said accident the said vehicle was being driven by one Ivan Layng and the Judgment referred to in the Statement of Claim was granted against him as well as against the said Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as Executrix of the last will and testament of Rosieta Martha Campbell, also known as Rheta Campbell.\n* * *\n(b) The liability imposed by the said judgment upon Margaret Jean Campbell arose by reason of the negligence of Ivan Layng while driving the vehicle described in the policy with the consent of the said Margaret Jean Campbell. However, I do not rest my judgment on this point on the precise form of the pleadings; in my opinion the plaintiffs made out a prima facie case in regard to the matters set out in item (2) by proving, as they did, the formal judgment of Stewart J., the record in the action of Finlay et al. v. Layng and Campbell, and the reasons for judgment of Stewart J., all of which were, in my view, rightly admitted in evidence by the learned trial judge.\nIn so far as the judgment of this Court in Continental Casualty Co. v. Yorke, supra, appears to decide anything to the contrary it is clearly distinguishable on the facts and also by reason of the substantial changes that have been made in the relevant statutory provisions that were then in force, particularly the replacement of what was then s. 85(1) of The Insurance Act by s. 214(1) and the enactment of s. 214(9). I have examined the complete record in that case. At the trial before Raney J. no oral evidence was given. Six exhibits were filed; (i) the formal judgment of Riddell J. in the action of Jeanne Yorke v. Elizabeth Schwartz and A.C. Schwartz directing that the plaintiff do recover from the defendants damages in the sum of $2,067.25 and costs, (ii) the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the defendants\u2019 appeal with costs, (iii) the certificate of the taxing officer, (iv) a letter from the Sheriff reporting that his return to a writ of execution issued pursuant to the judgment was \u201cnulla bona\u201d, (v) the insurance policy, and (vi) a birth certificate to shew the age of the defendant A.C. Schwartz.\nIt will be observed that there was nothing in any of these exhibits to indicate the nature of the claim on which the plaintiff\u2019s judgment was founded beyond the fact that it was a claim for damages. However, at the trial counsel for the insurance company admitted that the judgment was for damages claimed to have been caused by the negligent driving by A.C. Schwartz of the insured automobile which was owned by the other defendant Elizabeth Schwartz. Indeed, he made it clear that the only defence was one based on statutory condition 5 in the policy which read:\n5. The insurer shall not be liable under this policy while the automobile, with the knowledge, consent or connivance of the insured is being driven by a person under the age limit fixed by law, or, in any event, under the age of sixteen years, or by an intoxicated person. It was admitted that A.C. Schwartz was driving the insured automobile, that he was under 18 years of age and that he did not have a permit to drive as required by statute for a person under that age; but counsel for the plaintiff made it quite clear that he did not admit that A.C. Schwartz was driving with the consent of Elizabeth Schwartz. Counsel for the defendant at first proposed to call Elizabeth Schwartz in an endeavour to prove the giving of consent but changed his mind and took the position that the giving of her consent was sufficiently proved by the judgment of Riddell J. which had already been filed. This was the only point which this Court was called upon to decide or did decide. Lamont J. who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court rejected the argument that the consent of Elizabeth Schwartz must be presumed from the fact of judgment having been given against her; he said at page 188:\nFurthermore, I do not see anything in the Act (i.e. the Highway Traffic Act) that would prevent Mrs. Schwartz from being liable at common law for the damage caused by her son\u2019s negligence if it were shewn that he was in her employ and, at the time of the accident, in the course of his employment. It does not necessarily follow, therefore, that because judgment was given against her, Mrs. Schwartz had any knowledge that her son was driving her automobile, or that she consented thereto.\nLamont J. also pointed out that the pleadings in the action of Yorke v. Schwartz had not been put in evidence.\nIn the first Dokuchia case the plaintiff was given judgment at the trial against the insurer. The Court of Appeal examined the formal judgment and the pleadings in the action in which Dokuchia had recovered judgment against Domansch (the insured) for the purpose of ascertaining whether the claim which had become merged in the judgment was one covered by the policy. The action failed because it was impossible to determine from the record whether Dokuchia at the time he was injured was in the employ of Domansch and if he was so employed his claim was excluded from coverage by the terms of the policy. The Court of Appeal accordingly set aside the judgment against the insurer and directed a new trial.\nAt the new trial the whole record in the case of Dokuchia v. Domansch[3], was filed including the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal for affirming the trial judgment. Once again, however, the claim of Dokuchia against the insurance company failed because in upholding his judgment against Domansch the Court of Appeal had decided that his injuries did not arise from the use or operation of the insured vehicle, and it was held as appears in [1949] O.R. at page 179, that this adjudication was binding upon Dokuchia in his action against the insurance company. In applying this decision it must be remembered that all the documents referred to were admitted in evidence by consent and that Dokuchia, who was held to be bound by the judgment, and the reasons therefor, given in his action against Domansch, had put that judgment and those reasons in evidence as part of his case. It is not necessarily decisive of the question whether the judgment and reasons would have been binding also on the insurance company, although there is nothing in the reasons to suggest the contrary.\nTurning now to the facts of the case at bar it is my opinion that the best evidence by which a party bringing action under section 214(1) of The Insurance Act can establish the nature of the claim for which he has recovered judgment against an insured is to prove the formal judgment, the reasons therefor and the record, including of course the pleadings, in the action in which the judgment was recovered. All of these are admissible in evidence and nothing in the Yorke case or the Dokuchia cases decides, or indeed suggests, the contrary.\nIn the case at bar no attempt was made either in the appellant\u2019s pleadings or in the evidence to impeach any of the findings made in the action of Finlay et al. v. Layng and Campbell except the finding that at the time of the accident the insured automobile was owned by Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as executrix. It has already been pointed out that the learned trial judge heard evidence on that point and decided it adversely to the appellant and that this finding is not now questioned. This, in my opinion, is sufficient to dispose of the ground of appeal with which I am now dealing.\nHowever, I wish to rest my judgment on this point also on the view that the learned trial judge was right in his conclusion that in the circumstances of this case the fact that at the time of the accident the insured automobile was owned by Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity of executrix was sufficiently established by proof of the judgment of Stewart J., the record in the action of Finlay et al. v. Layng and Campbell and the reasons of Stewart J. and that it was unnecessary for counsel for the plaintiffs to call the further evidence which, as a matter of precaution, they did call.\nSo long as the judgment of Stewart J. stood (and it was proved that no appeal was taken from it and that the time for appealing had expired) it, read in the light of the pleadings, furnished the best evidence of the nature of the claim asserted against Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as executrix for which the judgment had been recovered; and the question whether or not that claim, which had become merged in the judgment, was covered became simply a question of the construction of the terms of the policy. I have already expressed my agreement with the view of the Court of Appeal that on the true construction of the policy the claim was covered.\nIn an action brought under s. 214(1) the question to be determined is whether the plaintiff has made against an insured a claim for which indemnity is provided by a motor vehicle policy and has recovered a judgment therefor; the question is not whether that judgment was correct.\nThe judgment of Stewart J. was a final judgment pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction and constituted conclusive evidence against all the world of its existence, date and legal consequences; (vide Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 15, p. 395 and the cases there collected). The legal consequence of that judgment was to impose upon Margaret Jean Campbell in her capacity as executrix a liability arising from the ownership of the automobile described in the policy. That liability was clearly one imposed by law and fell within the terms of the insuring agreements set out in section A of the policy. I can find no support for the appellant\u2019s submission that it was necessary for the respondent to prove again in the action against the insurer under s. 214(1) the facts on which the judgment of Stewart J. was founded. To so hold would be to disregard the maxim, interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium.\nFor the above reasons I would dismiss both appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.

Groner (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1961: February 23, 24, 27; 1961: June 12.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMaster and servant\u2014Contract containing termination of employment clause\u2014Contract altered by oral agreement\u2014Terms of oral agreement subsequently set out in undated letter\u2014Employee inserting false date\u2014Whether termination clause consistent with altered contract\u2014Dismissal justified by employee\u2019s deceitful conduct\u2014Whether fees payable in Canadian or United States funds.\nThe plaintiff, a mechanical engineer, was employed in a substitute capacity to supervise construction of a cement manufacturing project. The contract contained a clause for termination of employment on ten days\u2019 notice. About three months after his engagement the plaintiff resigned, but following negotiations with the president of the defendant company he entered into an agreement on September 27, 1956, as a result of which he withdrew his resignation. In July 1957, an undated letter, setting out the terms of the oral agreement, was typed by the plaintiff and signed by the president. The plaintiff later filled in the date as October 15, 1956, without telling the president he was doing so, and in the course of the subsequent proceedings he perjured himself with respect to the circumstances under which this letter was written.\nIn September 1957, a new president advised the plaintiff that his services were no longer desired and gave him ten days\u2019 notice under the original contract. The plaintiff\u2019s claim for wrongful dismissal was dismissed at trial; his appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal. The defendant appealed to this Court, and the plaintiff cross-appealed against the disallowance of his claim for the difference in exchange between Canadian dollars to which he claimed to be entitled and the American dollars with which he was paid for his services.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed. The agreement evidenced by the letter dated October 15, 1956, was to be read with the original agreement because it was expressly stated to be supplementary thereto, and the nature of the work to which it related was described as being outlined in the earlier agreement. The ten-day termination clause was just as consistent with a contract engaging the plaintiff\u2019s services full time until the acceptance date of the plants as it was with the original contract which engaged them in substitution for those of the engineer in charge of construction \u201cuntil the project is completed and in production\u201d. Accordingly, the letter of dismissal written by the new president, giving ten days\u2019 notice, was effective to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s contract of employment.\nAlso, the defendant was justified in dismissing the plaintiff without notice by reason of his deceitful conduct with respect to the document dated October 15, 1956. The fact that the defendant did not know of the plaintiff\u2019s dishonest conduct at the time when he was dismissed, and that it was first pleaded by way of an amendment to its defence at the trial did not detract from its validity as a ground for dispensing with his services. Federal Supply & Cold Storage Co. of South Africa v. Angehrn and Piel (1910), 103 L.T. 150; Aspinal v. Mid West Colleries, [1926] 3 D.L.R. 362, referred to.\nThe plaintiff had agreed to an arrangement whereby his disbursements were to be paid in Canadian funds and his fees in United States funds. Accordingly, his claim for the equivalent of Canadian dollar value for his fees was disallowed. The plaintiff\u2019s claim for his car allowance was allowed.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal and allowing in part a cross-appeal from a judgment of McRuer C.J.O. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C. and R.L. Shirriff, for the defendant, appellant.\nD.A. Keith, Q.C., and D.H. Carruthers, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario1 allowing the appeal of the respondent from a judgment of Chief Justice McRuer and awarding him the sum of $15,000 as damages for wrongful dismissal in breach of his contract of employment with the appellant and $814.50 for out\u2011of\u2011pocket expenses in the use of his car. The respondent cross-appeals against the disallowance by the Court of Appeal of his claim for reimbursement for the difference in exchange between Canadian dollars to which he claims to be entitled and the American dollars with which he was paid for his services. The appellant company was incorporated in the spring of 1956 at the instance of the H.J. McFarland Construction Company Limited (an Ontario company) and Johnson, Drake and Piper, Incorporated (a Minnesota corporation) for the purpose of financing the construction of a cement manufacturing plant at Picton, Ontario, to be built by the last-named companies who became joint venturers in this undertaking under the name of \u201cCement Plant Constructors\u201d.\nOn May 4, 1956, a contract was entered into whereby Cement Plant Constructors agreed to build the necessary plant for the appellant company and arrangements were made by the appellant for public financing to defray the cost of construction.\nBefore any offering of shares was made to the public, Senator W.A. Fraser was secured as the president of the appellant company with H.J. McFarland and D.P. Jesson as vice\u2011presidents representing the constituent companies of Cement Plant Constructors.\nThe respondent who is a mechanical engineer, although not a member of the Association of Professional Engineers of the Province of Ontario, was employed on this project by means of a letter from Cement Plant Constructors confirming an arrangement with him whereby he was \u201cengaged to render services as we designate until the project mentioned below is completed and in production in the absence of Mr. A.J. Anderson.\u201d (The italics are mine.) This letter which is hereafter set forth in full includes the following paragraphs:\nIf at any time your services are no longer desired, this agreement may be terminated upon ten (10) days written notice by us.\nAt any time, this agreement may be assigned by us to the owner of the above mentioned plants, written notice of the assignment to be given to you.\nIt is assumed that inasmuch as you are acting in a substitute capacity for A.J. Anderson, that any decisions that have been made by him will not be altered unless definite mistakes are found, and then only after these have been called to our attention and approved for change by us.\nA. J. Anderson, who was also a mechanical engineer, had been engaged to act as the appellant\u2019s engineer in charge of construction, but previous commitments prevented him from being on the job with any regularity, and the respondent\u2019s contract of employment which was duly assigned to the appellant on June 26, 1956, as I interpret it, constitutes an agreement engaging the respondent\u2019s services as a substitute for and in the absence of Mr. A.J. Anderson \u201cuntil the project\u2026 is completed and in production\u2026\u201d.\nAbout three months after his engagement, the respondent tendered his resignation in a letter to Senator Fraser in which he complained that the original agreement was not possible of fulfilment as he was not being given the necessary full responsibility and authority and, amongst other things, that everything was required to be approved by an engineering firm in the employ of Cement Plant Constructors so that responsibility was divided and his position made untenable.\nSenator Fraser was greatly upset by this letter as he felt that in the interests of the shareholders it was necessary that an engineer should represent the appellant on the job, and he, accordingly, arranged to meet with the respondent in Toronto on September 27, 1956, for the purpose of inducing him to reconsider his resignation.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the respondent and Senator Fraser reached an agreement at this time, as a result of which the respondent withdrew his resignation, but the nature and effect of the understanding arrived at between them is the subject of what can only be described as a bitter dispute between the respondent and the appellant. No memorandum of the terms of that agreement was made at the time by either Senator Fraser or the respondent, but in July 1957, at a time when his relations with many members of the board of directors had gravely deteriorated and his dismissal had been seriously considered, the respondent typed a letter addressed to himself on the appellant\u2019s note-paper, setting out what he now says those terms were, and including a provision whereby he was to be employed on a full\u2011time basis instead of being a substitute for A.J. Anderson. Leaving this letter undated, he obtained Senator Fraser\u2019s signature to it and thereafter, without telling the Senator that he was doing so, he filled in the date as October 15, 1956. This underhand action was compounded by the respondent perjuring himself on more than one occasion in the course of these proceedings with respect to the circumstances under which the letter was written, and it must be borne in mind that in changing the date on the letter and in lying on the witness stand the respondent was acting deliberately and for the purpose of furthering his own interest. It was not until after the respondent had given his evidence that the appellant\u2019s counsel felt in a position to apply for an amendment to his defence to set up the predating of the letter as a ground for dismissal. Leave to amend having been granted, the following paragraph was then added to the defence:\nThe Defendant was justified in dismissing the Plaintiff from its employment by virtue of the misconduct of the Plaintiff in predating a letter purporting to amend his contract of employment dated June 1st, 1956 and thereafter concealing from and misrepresenting to the Defendant the fact of such predating in order to deceive the Defendant.\nIt is noteworthy that in the month of January 1957 the respondent conferred at length with two members of the board of directors and the appellant company\u2019s solicitor with a view to revising his terms of employment as set forth in the contract of June 1st. No conclusion was reached as a result of these conferences, but four separate proposals were drafted with the respondent\u2019s assistance, and the remarkable feature of the matter is that the respondent at no time during the course of these negotiations made any mention whatever of the agreement which he now claims to have been made between himself and Senator Fraser three months earlier.\nSenator Fraser resigned from the board of directors on August 22, 1957, and on September 30 the new president, Mr. G.D. Wotherspoon, wrote to the respondent on behalf of the board referring to the initial contract of employment, saying:\nYour employment contract provides for termination on ten days\u2019 written notice and as your services are no longer desired by this Company we hereby, pursuant to your employment contract, give you ten days\u2019 written notice of termination of such services, effective October 12, 1957.\nThe respondent\u2019s case rests in large measure upon his interpretation of the agreement of September 27, 1956, as evidenced by the letter dated October 15, 1956. It is alleged on his behalf that it constituted a contract engaging his services on a full-time basis until he had accepted the plants on behalf of the appellant and that it had the effect of cancelling the provision for termination of his employment on ten days\u2019 notice which was invoked by Mr. Wotherspoon in his letter of dismissal. In rendering his decision at the trial of this action, Chief Justice McRuer found that the letter dated October 15, 1956, accurately recorded the terms of the contract of September 27 and that the ten-day termination clause was not intended to be in effect after this later agreement was concluded, but he held also that the fraudulent conduct of the respondent constituted just cause for his dismissal, even although the appellant did not know of it at the time when the notice of dismissal was given. The learned trial judge also held that the respondent was entitled to succeed in his claim for reimbursement for the difference in exchange between the United States funds in which he was paid and Canadian funds, and that his claim for out\u2011of\u2011pocket expenses for car allowance was made out.\nIn allowing the respondent\u2019s appeal, Mr. Justice Morden affirmed the decision of the Chief Justice to the effect that the letter dated October 15, 1956, correctly expressed the earlier oral agreement and found that the respondent\u2019s misconduct was not incompatible with the proper discharge of the duties for which he was employed and, therefore, did not afford justification for his dismissal. Mr. Justice LeBel who was alone in expressly affirming the finding of the Chief Justice to the effect that the understanding of September 27 cancelled the ten-day termination clause of the original contract was also of opinion that the respondent\u2019s fraud was unrelated to the business in which he was engaged and did not justify his dismissal.\nIn a dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal, Gibson J.A. agreed with the reasons of the Chief Justice for dismissing the action.\nThe Court of Appeal was unanimous in dismissing the respondent\u2019s claim for reimbursement for loss on exchange between Canadian dollars and the American dollars with which he was paid. No costs were allowed with respect to the trial, but the costs of the appeal were awarded to the plaintiff and those of the cross-appeal to the defendant.\nIn my view, the disposition of the present appeal depends in large measure on the effect to be given to three letters:\n(1) The letter of June 1, 1956, from Cement Plant Constructors containing the initial terms of the respondent\u2019s contract of employment; (2) The respondent\u2019s letter of resignation dated September 17, 1956; and\n(3) The letter dated October 15, 1956, which purports to record the agreement reached on September 27 of that year.\nThe letter of June 1, 1956, reads as follows:\nIn confirmation of our arrangement, you are engaged to render services as we designate until the project mentioned below is completed and in production in the absence of Mr. A.J. Anderson.\nIt is our understanding that you are to be our technical advisor and engineer in charge of the design and construction by us of a complete operating dry process Portland cement manufacturing plant and a complete operating commercial limestone aggregate production plant at Picton, Ontario as well as bulk storage docking and bagging facilities at Picton, Ontario, Toronto, Ontario and Rochester, New York. Your duties will include but not be limited to the following.\n1) Supervise the design, preparation of specifications of all equipment and machinery, preparation of plot plan layout and machinery layout, preparation of flow diagram and the structural, mechanical and electrical layouts, details, and specifications.\n2) Supervise the construction so that the plants are built in accordance with the plans and specifications.\n3) Set up mechanical controls and organize operating personnel.\nIt is our understanding that you shall be paid $100 per day for your time actually spent in connection with the aforementioned duties, plus travel, subsistence and other proper expenses.\nIf at any time your services are no longer desired, this agreement may be terminated upon ten (10) days written notice by us.\nAt any time, this agreement may be assigned by us to the owner of the above mentioned plants, written notice of the assignment to be given to you.\nIt is assumed that inasmuch as you are acting in a substitute capacity for A.J. Anderson, that any decisions that have been made by him will not be altered unless definite mistakes are found, and then only after these have been called to our attention and approved for change by us.\nIf the foregoing is satisfactory to you, please sign, date and return the duplicate original of this letter whereby it will constitute the sole agreement between us.\nAs the vitally important agreement of September 27, 1956, was reached for the purpose of inducing the respondent to withdraw the resignation which he had tendered in his letter of September 17, it seems to me to be very relevant to consider the reasons which prompted the respondent to write that letter. That letter reads in part as follows:\nIt was my understanding that I was given full charge and responsibility with the backing of the Board of Directors at the meeting which I attended on July 30, 1956 in Picton. Such has not proven to be the case. It was recently pointed out to me that approval was either by the contractor or the owner\u2019s representative according to the agreement between the contractor and the engineers. This situation divides the responsibility thus completely nullifying our agreement\u2026\nThe conditions which make impossible the fulfillment of my contract or agreement are as follows:\n1. Schedule \u201cF\u201d\n2. Approval required by Kennedy-Van Saun.\n3. Agreement of May 4, 1956 between engineers and joint venturers. Page 9, Paragraph 6 which reads, in part, as follows:\n\u201cAll decisions and approval by either the Owner or Joint Venturers\u201d.\n4. Cost estimate. Decisions are influenced and limited by said original cost estimates covering the entire project.\nThe above outlined conditions are part of the basic structure or contractual arrangement for the project which I do not believe can be altered to make my agreement workable.\nTherefore, in conformity with my agreement to serve the Owners as engineer in charge only if I had full responsibility and authority as stipulated in the letter agreement dated June 1, 1956 quoted above and inasmuch as this agreement is not possible of fulfillment, I do hereby tender my resignation to be effective within a reasonable length of time.\nThe firm of Kennedy-Van Saun had been employed as engineers by the Cement Plant Constructors who are referred to as the \u201cJoint Venturers\u201d in the above letter, and Schedule \u201cF\u201d, which had been prepared and was interpreted by Kennedy-Van Saun, was the document which controlled the construction of the project.\nIt is quite evident that it was the division of authority between himself and Kennedy-Van Saun which was the main source of the respondent\u2019s complaint, and that he was tendering his resignation because he did not have full responsibility and authority.\nFurther light is thrown on the agreement of September 27 by the respondent\u2019s own evidence as to his interpretation of the understanding existing between himself and Senator Fraser a few days before that agreement was reached. His words are:\nThe understanding at that point was that I was to continue as chief engineer, that Mr. Anderson would not replace me, and that he was coming back as general manager, and that, in order to protect the interests of the stockholders and the Senator\u2019s interest and reputation with the company I was to continue as adviser and owner\u2019s representative.\nIt is against this background that the terms of the agreement of September 27, as recorded in the disputed letter of October 15, must be read. These terms are:\nFirst, you are to serve the Lake Ontario Portland Cement Co. Ltd. as the \u201cOwners\u2019 Representative and Chief Engineer\u201d in complete and full charge of design and construction of the plants being built at Picton, Toronto, and Rochester, all as outlined in your written agreement with Cement Plant Constructors dated June 1st, 1956, which agreement was assigned to Lake Ontario Portland Cement Co. Ltd., on June 26th, 1956.\nSecondly, you are to devote all the time possible to this work until you have completed your business on the West Coast and thereafter you are to devote full time to the Lake Ontario Portland Cement Co. Ltd., until the plants at Picton, Toronto and Rochester are completed and in full operation. Your services are to continue until the plants are accepted by yourself in the name of the Lake Ontario Portland Cement Co. Ltd., from the contractors as being complete and fully satisfactory in every way.\nThis agreement is supplementary to, but in no way limits or nullifies the agreement mentioned above other than to extend the length of your services to Lake Ontario Portland Cement Co. Ltd., to the acceptance date of the plants being built for us by the Cement Plant Constructors. (The italics are mine.)\nIn accepting this letter as a correct account of the earlier oral agreement, Chief Justice McRuer said:\nBoth Mr. Groner and Senator Fraser say that that document correctly sets out the agreement that they had entered into on September 27th, and for the purposes of this case I am prepared to accept that statement.\nThis finding is endorsed by the Court of Appeal and should not, in my view, be disturbed in this Court.\nThe learned Chief Justice continues with respect to this letter:\nIt is argued by Mr. Williston that this is to be read with the original agreement, and that one is to read into this the ten-day termination clause. I think that this is quite inconsistent with that ten-day termination clause being a part of this agreement, and if there is any ambiguity, the oral evidence clearly establishes that that was not so intended. Senator Fraser says that at that time he did not even know the termination clause existed. So what he was doing was making an agreement to terminate when the plant was accepted.\nWith the greatest respect, it seems to me that the agreement evidenced by the letter dated October 15 must be read with the original agreement of June 1 because it is expressly stated to be supplementary thereto, and the nature of the work to which it relates is described as being \u201coutlined in your agreement with Cement Plant Constructors dated June 1, 1956.\u201d\nThe following oral evidence with respect to the question of whether or not the ten-day termination clause was discussed at the time of making the agreement of September 27 is given by the two people who made that agreement:\nQ. As of that time did you have any understanding with the Senator that you would not be given ten days\u2019 notice? A. That was discussed at the time that we made the agreement in the King Edward Hotel\u2014\nBy His Lordship\nQ. What was discussed at the King Edward Hotel?\nA. The extension date of my contract.\nQ. You say it was discussed; what was said?\nA. Well, that the basic change in the contract was to extend my services to the completion and acceptance dates of the plant.\n* * *\nQ. You were asked something about the ten days\u2019 notice, and you said that was discussed at the King Edward Hotel, and I asked you what it was\u2014was there anything said about the ten days\u2019 notice in the King Edward Hotel?\nA. Yes, that that part of the contract was no longer in effect, and that the completion date of my contract was extended to the completion date of the plant.\nOn the same subject, Senator Fraser had this to say:\nQ. Was there any specific talk about the ten-day termination clause?\nA. I did not mention it. I did not even know it was there.\n* * *\nQ. There was no discussion with Mr. Groner about a ten-day termination clause?\nA. No, I did not discuss it with him. I do not think I knew that it was there, and I was only interested in one thing\u2014\nQ. The real point was this\u2014you wanted to get him to come back and work full time?\nA. Yes.\nI agree with the learned Chief Justice when he says in an earlier part of his decision, \u201cI would not base a judgment on Mr. Groner\u2019s evidence unless it was very substantially corroborated\u201d, and in face of Senator Fraser\u2019s denial of any mention having been made of the ten-day termination clause, I conclude that the matter was never discussed at the meeting of September 27. Accordingly, if there be any inconsistency between the agreement reached on September 27 and the continued existence of the ten-day termination clause, it must be found in the context of the letter dated October 15 itself.\nThe first paragraph of that letter does little more than assure the respondent that he is \u201cto be in complete and full charge of design and construction of the plants\u201d. This assurance would appear to have been necessary in order to persuade the respondent to withdraw his letter of resignation in which the main complaint was that he was not \u201cin complete and full charge\u201d. There is nothing in this paragraph which can, in my view, be construed as dispensing with the ten-day termination clause.\nThe second paragraph appears to me to have been drawn in accordance with the respondent\u2019s understanding that he would continue as chief engineer and that Mr. Anderson would not replace him. It changes the character of his employment from that of a substitute for Mr. Anderson to that of a full-time employee, but the only change in the length of the respondent\u2019s services is that while the earlier contract engaged his services \u201cuntil the project\u2026 is completed and in production\u2026\u201d this paragraph provides that they \u201care to continue until the plants are accepted by yourself\u2026\u201d.\nBy the third paragraph of this letter it is specified that the agreement which it evidences \u201cin no way limits or nullifies the agreement\u201d of June 1 \u201cother than to extend the length\u201d of Groner\u2019s \u201cservices\u2026 to the acceptance date of the plants\u2026\u201d, and it seems to me that the ten-day termination clause is one of the provisions which is preserved by this stipulation unless the extension of the length of service is found to be inconsistent with it.\nIn my view the ten-day termination clause is just as consistent with a contract engaging the respondent\u2019s services full time until the acceptance date of the plants as it was with the original contract which engaged them in substitution for those of Mr. Anderson \u201cuntil the project\u2026 is completed and in production.\u201d\nHaving reached this conclusion, I am of opinion that the letter of dismissal written by Mr. Wotherspoon in his capacity as president of the appellant company on September 30, 1957, was effective to terminate the respondent\u2019s contract of employment on October 12, 1957, but I am also of opinion, as was the learned Chief Justice, that the appellant was justified in dismissing the respondent without notice by reason of the fraudulent manner in which he dealt with the document dated October 15, 1956.\nThe fact that the appellant did not know of the respondent\u2019s dishonest conduct at the time when he was dismissed, and that it was first pleaded by way of an amendment to its defence at the trial does not, in my opinion, detract from its validity as a ground for dispensing with his services. The law in this regard is accurately summarized in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd ed., vol. 22, p. 155, where it is said:\nIt is not necessary that the master, dismissing a servant for good cause, should state the ground for such dismissal; and, provided good ground existed in fact, it is immaterial whether or not it was known to the employer at the time of the dismissal. Justification of dismissal can accordingly be shown by proof of facts ascertained subsequently to the dismissal, or on grounds differing from those alleged at the time.\nIt may be, as Mr. Justice Morden says in the course of his judgment in the Court of Appeal, that the respondent\u2019s misconduct \u201cwas not incompatible with the proper discharge of the duties for which he was employed\u201d, but in my view it is not so much the misconduct itself as the fact that he was capable of it which justifies the respondent\u2019s dismissal. The respondent\u2019s own evidence disclosed to the directors that they, on behalf of the shareholders, had been depending for their technical information respecting the progress of the construction of this expensive project on the reports of a man who turned out to be capable of deliberately putting a false date on a document after it had been signed by the company\u2019s president and who was afterwards prepared to lie about his actions under oath. As was said by Lord Atkinson in Federal Supply & Cold Storage Company of South Africa v. Angehrn and Piel[2], \u201cit is the revelation of character which justifies the dismissal\u201d.\nAspinall v. Mid West Collieries[3], was a case which had many factors in common with the present one. In that case a mine manager had obtained from his employers an extension of his holiday for the express purpose of taking his family for a boat trip to Skagway. Having stayed away for the extra period without taking the trip at all, he wrote a letter to the secretary-treasurer of the company which employed him, saying, \u201cGot back the other day from my trip and I am glad to say that Mrs. A. is much improved by the sea voyage...\u201d This deception was not discovered until the trial when the pleadings were amended to set it up as one of the causes for his dismissal. Speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal for Alberta, Harvey C.J.A. said:\nWe thus have 3 cases of misconduct on the part of the plaintiff, the one respecting the coal, his absence at the time of his dismissal and the matter of the Alaska trip. Whether any one of these alone would be sufficient to justify his dismissal need not be considered because no one of them was alone and, though the knowledge of the last was not obtained by the defendant until the trial, it is quite clear that it may be relied on to justify a dismissal for misconduct and the pleadings were amended, by leave, to set it up.\nThese instances of disobedience and deceit combined, emphasized as they are by the deliberate perjury of the plaintiff, establish clearly the untrustworthiness of the plaintiff and bring the case well within the principles enumerated in such cases as Beattie v. Parmenter (1889), 5 Times L.R. 396 and Federal Supply & Cold Storage Co. of S. Africa v. Angehrn & Piel (supra)\u2026\nIn my view the same considerations apply to the present circumstances.\nIn view of all the above, I have concluded that the respondent\u2019s contract of employment was terminated in accordance with its terms by the giving of ten days\u2019 written notice, and that, in any event, the deceitful conduct to which the respondent admitted on the witness stand would have justified the appellant in dismissing him even if no notice had been given.\nAs to the cross-appeal, the evidence satisfies me that the respondent had agreed to an arrangement whereby his disbursements were to be paid in Canadian funds and his fees in United States funds, and I, accordingly, agree with the Court of Appeal that his claim for the equivalent of Canadian dollar value for his fees should be disallowed. The cross-appeal should, therefore, be dismissed.\nI am unable to see any answer to the respondent\u2019s claim for his car allowance at the rate of ten cents per mile, and would accordingly allow this item, but in all other respects I would allow the appeal.\nThe appellant should have its costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal in this Court and its costs of the appeal in the Court of Appeal, but I would not disturb the order of the learned Chief Justice with respect to the costs of the trial.\nAppeal allowed, cross-appeal dismissed, with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Keith, Ganong, Carruthers & Rose, Toronto.\n[1] [1960] O.W.N. 292, 23 D.L.R.

O. Ltd. brought an action to recover the balance owing on a general account for goods sold and delivered by L. O. Ltd. to the defendant in Saskatchewan. The debt owing by the defendant to L. O. Ltd. was the subject of five assignments, the parties to each of which were resident in Alberta. All the assignments were executed in that province. The action was dismissed at trial on the ground that the plaintiff's right to sue arose by virtue of an assignment governed by the law of Alberta, under which an action could not be maintained in the plaintiff's name, since no notice of the assignment to him had been given to the defendant. This decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal, where it was held that there was no contest here as between an assignor and an assignee of the debt; that the claim was for the enforcement of a debt locally situate in Saskatchewan; and that the law of that province would govern, under which the action was maintainable in the name of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed to this Court, contending that the law of Alberta should be applied, and further that even if the law of Saskatchewan applied, the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain the action.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe plaintiff had a valid, equitable assignment under the laws of Alberta, but in order to obtain judgment in that jurisdiction he would have had to join, as a party, the person who held the legal right to the debt under The Judicature Act. Republica de Guatemala v. Nunez [1927] 1 KB. 669; In re Anziani, [1930] 1 Ch. 407, distinguished; Dawson v. Leach and Hazza, [1935] 3 W.W.R. 547, referred to.\nHowever, the plaintiff did not sue on the debt in Alberta, but in Saskatchewan, and the question whether he could maintain his action there in his own name fell to be determined by the lex fori, for the question, in the circumstances of the case, was one of procedure and not of substance. It was not a question of the validity of the assignment, or of the capacity of the parties to it, but as to the proper parties to the proceedings in Saskatchewan, which was a question of procedure to be governed by Saskatchewan law, as set out in The Choses in Action Act, under which the plaintiff was entitled to maintain the action.\nThe item of $10,911.30 charged by the plaintiff against the defendant's account related to a debt owing by the defendant to A.G.S. Ltd., which company assigned the debt to L.O. Ltd. The claim in this action was for the balance due upon a running account between the defendant and L.O. Ltd., which balance was substantially composed of those items most recently sold to the defendant. Those items were sold by L.O. Ltd. subsequent to the date when the assignment of the debt from A.G.S. Ltd. occurred and after it had been paid by subsequent credits in favour of the defendant. The items in issue in this action did not, therefore, include that debt.\nIn the light of the evidence, the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal that interest should be paid at 5 per cent on the balance owing after the account became static, was not erroneous.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Hall C.J.Q.B. Appeal dismissed.\nR. M. Balfour, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nA. W. Embury, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan2, which had allowed an appeal from the judgment at trial dismissing the respondent's claim against the appellant.\nThe respondent's claim was for the balance owing on a general account for goods sold and delivered by Lion Oils Ltd. to the appellant, in Saskatchewan, in the years 1949 and 1950, together with interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum on the balance due. The appellant did not, on this appeal, question the amount which had been found to be owing by it in the Court below, save as to one item of $10,911.30 which had been charged against the appellant. The appellant did dispute the right to collect interest upon the balance owing.\nLion Oils Ltd., by a special resolution of its shareholders dated November 24, 1950, went into voluntary liquidation and the respondent, Leon Louis Plotkins, was appointed liquidator.\nThe debt owing by the appellant to Lion Oils Ltd. was the subject of five assignments, as follows:\n1. 27 December, 1950, Leon Louis Plotkins, as liquidator of Lion Oils Ltd., to Leon O. Beauchemin.\n2. 28 December, 1950, Leon O. Beauchemin to Lion Oils of Canada Limited.\n3. 28 May, 1954, Stewart Petroleums Limited (formerly Lion Oils of Canada Limited) to Leon O. Beauchemin and Jackson Stewart.\n4. 30 September, 1955, Leon 0. Beauchemin and Jackson Stewart to Thomas W. Smith.\n5. 30 September, 1955, Thomas W. Smith to Leon Louis Plotkins. Smith had been secretary and comptroller of Lion Oils Ltd. and, when it went into liquidation, was assistant to the liquidator.\nEach of the individual parties to these assignments resided in Calgary and Stewart Petroleums Limited had its head office there. Each of the assignments was executed in that city. Notice of the first three assignments was given to the appellant by a letter dated February 2,1955, although the letter, in referring to the third assignment, did not make any reference to Jackson Stewart.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that the respondent's right to sue arose by virtue of an assignment governed by the law of Alberta, under which an action could not be maintained in the respondent's name, since no notice of the assignment to him had been given to the appellant.\nThis decision was reversed on appeal. Gordon J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that in this case there was no contest as between an assignor and an assignee of the debt. The claim was for the enforcement of a debt locally situate in the Province of Saskatchewan and he held that the law of that Province would govern, under which the action was maintainable in the name of the respondent. He held also that the respondent was entitled to recover interest on the debt and that the item of $10,911.30 had properly been charged against the appellant.\nThe main question for consideration in this appeal is as to whether or not the respondent was properly entitled to maintain this action in the Province of Saskatchewan. The appellant contends that the law of Alberta should be applied and further argues that, even if the law of Saskatchewan applies, the respondent was not entitled to maintain the action.\nThe law relating to a legal assignment of a debt or chose in action in Alberta is stated in subs. (15) of s. 34 of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164, as follows:\n(15) Where a debt or other legal chose in action is assigned by an absolute assignment made in writing under the hand of the assignor and not purporting to be by way of charge only, if express notice in writing of the assignment has been given to the debtor, trustee or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or claim the debt or chose in action, the absolute assignment is effectual in law to pass and transfer\n(a) the legal right to the debt or chose in action from the date of the notice of the assignment,\n(b) all legal and other remedies for the debt or chose in action, and\n(c) power to give a good discharge for the debt or chose in action without concurrence of the assignor,\nand is subject to all equities that would have been entitled to priority over the right of the assignee if this subsection had not been enacted.\nThis provision is identical in its effect to the provision which first appeared in Alberta in 1907, by the enactment of s. 7 of c. 5 of the Alberta Statutes of that year, amending The Judicature Ordinance of the Northwest Territories. That amendment was clearly patterned on s. 25(6) of the English Judicature Act, which, after the fusion of the Courts of Common Law and Equity, introduced, for the first time, a statutory assignment of a legal chose in action which would take effect at law. Prior to that time a legal chose in action could only be assigned in equity and the action had to be brought in the name of the assignor.\nThe appellant contends that the identity of the legal owner of the debt must be determined by the proper law of the contract of assignment from which he derives his title, in this case, the law of Alberta. Under that law, he submits, the original creditor, who was the plaintiff in this action, had been deprived of his legal title to the debt and could not give an effectual discharge therefor. In support of his contention he relied upon two English decisions, one a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Republica de Guatemala v. Nunez3, and. In re Anziani4.\nThe facts of the former case were as follows: In 1906 Cabrera, who was then the President of Guatemala, deposited a sum of money with a London bank. In July, 1919, while still President, he addressed a letter to the bankers requesting them to transfer this sum to Nunez, his illegitimate son. Cabrera was deposed and imprisoned in 1920. While imprisoned he assigned, under duress, the sum to the Republic, acknowledging that he had misappropriated it from the public funds. In an action brought by the Republic to recover the money, Nunez claimed ownership by virtue of the assignment of 1919. This assignment was valid by English law, but void by the law of Guatemala because (1) being unsupported by consideration, it should have been made on stamped paper and signed by Nunez before a notary, and (2) Nunez, being a minor, lacked capacity to accept a voluntary assignment.\nIt will be observed that English law was the lex situs of the debt and the proper law of the transaction out of which the debt arose, but that Guatemalan law was the lex loci actus and the proper law of the assignment and also the lex domicilii of the assignor and the assignee.\nIt was held, both at trial and by the Court of Appeal, that the validity of the assignment to Nunez must be determined by the law of Guatemala.\nThe judgment of Bankes L.J. in the Court of Appeal was upon the ground that, as both the Republic and Nunez were domiciled and resident in Guatemala at the date of their respective assignments, and as the English depositary claimed no interest in the fund, the question should be determined by the law of their domicile and residence.\nScrutton and Lawrence L.JJ. took the position that the question involved was that of the capacity of Nunez to take the assignment and that this question fell to be determined by the law of his domicile. Scrutton L.J. further held that the non-compliance with the formalities of the assignment to Nunez made the assignment void. Lawrence L.J. held that, as the contract of deposit was made in England and the money recoverable there, it was an English debt locally situated in England and accordingly the validity of the assignment, as distinct from the capacity of Nunez, would have been governed by English law.\nIn the Anziani case it was held that an assignment executed in a foreign jurisdiction, by a person there domiciled, of a chose in action locally situate in England is void if the assignment is void on grounds of substance according to the local law.\nIn my opinion the present action differs materially from these two cases. The question of the validity of the assignment to the respondent, or of the capacity of the assignor or of the assignee, does not here arise. Although the assignment to the respondent was not a legal assignment, within the requirements of the Alberta Judicature Act, it was not, for that reason, ineffective. It did constitute, under the law of Alberta, a valid, equitable assignment of the debt.\nThat such an assignment can be properly made and enforced in Alberta is clearly stated by Harvey C.J.A. in Dawson v. Leach and Hazza5, where he says at p. 549:\nThe defendants argue that by virtue of sec. 37 (m) of The Judicature Act, R.S.A., 1922, ch. 72, the assignee of a chose in action is the only person who can maintain an action in respect of the chose in action so assigned. The section provides that an absolute assignment upon notice being given \"shall be effectual in law \u2026 to pass and transfer the legal right of such debt or chose in action from the date of such notice and all legal and other remedies for the same and power to give a good discharge for the same without the concurrence of the assignor.\" Without and before this enactment there could be an equitable assignment passing all equitable rights and this provision made the legal form conform to the equitable procedure. It is clear too that it is dealing with nothing but the legal right as between the assignor and assignee and there is nothing to suggest that while the assignee has all the legal rights and remedies of the assignor some one may not have equitable rights in the chose in action which becomes legally vested in the assignee. That being so the question arises whether he can maintain an action to enforce them.\nHarvey C.J.A., after then citing from the judgment of Viscount Cave L.C. in Performing Right Society v. London Theatre of Varieties6, continued his own judgment as follows:\nIt would seem from that that it could not be said that this plaintiff has not a right to come into Court to enforce his equitable rights but that probably he could not obtain judgment without having the legal owner made a party to the action.\nThe position here is, therefore, that the respondent had a valid, equitable assignment under the laws of Alberta, but that in order to obtain judgment in that jurisdiction he would have had to join, as a party, the person who held the legal right to the debt under The Judicature Act.\nHowever, the respondent did not sue on the debt in Alberta, but in Saskatchewan, where the debt had been incurred for goods sold and delivered in that Province to the debtor, who resided there. The question is whether he can maintain his action there in his own name and that question, in my opinion, falls to be determined by the lex fori, for the question, in the circumstances of this case, is one of procedure and not of substance. It is not a question of the validity of the assignment, or of the capacity of the parties to it, but as to the proper parties to the proceedings in Saskatchewan, which is a question of procedure which should be governed by Saskatchewan law.\nThe Saskatchewan law on this point is set out in The Choses in Action Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 360. The relevant provisions of that statute are as follows:\n2. Every debt and every chose in action arising out of contract shall be assignable by any form of writing containing apt words in that behalf, but subject to such conditions and restrictions with respect to the right of transfer as may appertain to the original debt or as may be connected with or be contained in the original contract; and the assignee thereof may bring an action thereon in his own name as the party might to whom the debt was originally owing or to whom the right of action originally accrued, or he may proceed in respect of the same as though this Act had not been passed.\n3. The word \"assignee\" in section 2 includes any person now being or hereafter becoming entitled by any first or subsequent assignment or transfer or any derivative title to a debt or chose in action and possessing at the time when the action is instituted the right to receive the subject or proceeds thereof and to give effectual discharge therefor.\n4. The plaintiff in an action for the recovery of the subject of an assignment made in conformity with sections 2 and 3 shall in his statement of claim set forth briefly the chain of assignments showing how he claims title, but in all other respects the proceedings may be the same as if the action were brought in the name of the original creditor or of the person to whom the cause of action accrued.\n* * *\n6. If an assignment is made in conformity with this Act, and notice thereof is given to the debtor or person liable in respect of the subject of the assignment, the assignee shall have, hold and enjoy the same free of any claims, defences or equities which may arise subsequent to the notice by any act of the assignor or otherwise.\nThe respondent did not, in accordance with s. 4, set forth the chain of assignments previously mentioned. However, Plotkins, as liquidator of Lion Oils Ltd., was the original creditor.\nDealing with this point in the Court of Appeal, Gordon J.A. says:\nThere was considerable argument before us that even under the Saskatchewan Choses in Action Act the original creditor could not sue in his own name after the debt had been assigned and notice of the assignment given the debtor. In my view, the question was raised and decided by the Court en banc in the case of Covert v. Janzen, 9 W.L.R. 287, and as far as I know this decision has been followed ever since and I do not think that the law should now be disturbed by this Court. It was followed by this Court in the case of Krinke v. Schafter [1919] 1 W.W.R. 990 and again in the case of Kusch v. Peat [1922] 2 W.W.R. 174. I am, therefore, of the opinion that if the Saskatchewan law applies, the action is maintainable.\nThe appellant contended that, by virtue of s. 6 of the Act, Beauchemin and Stewart, being the last assignees in respect of whose assignment notice had been given to the appellant, held the debt free of any claims, defences or equities which might arise subsequent to the date of the notice and that they were the only persons who could give an effectual discharge of the debt. However, s. 6 does not in any way preclude an assignee of a debt, who has given notice to the debtor, from himself assigning the debt to another assignee, who would thereafter enjoy the rights conferred by the statute. That is what did occur here and I would agree with Gordon J.A. that, in the light of the Saskatchewan authorities to which he refers, the original creditor may bring suit on the debt even though an assignment has been made.\nThe appellant further argues that the final assignment was made to Plotkins personally and not to him in his capacity as liquidator of Lion Oils Ltd. It is true that the assignment made by Smith on September 30, 1955, was made to Plotkins and does not refer to him as the liquidator of Lion Oils Ltd., but Plotkins himself testified that the assignment was taken by him in his role as liquidator and his evidence shows that the right to the debt was held by him in that capacity.\nI am, therefore, in agreement with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal that the respondent was entitled to maintain the action in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nWith respect to the item of $10,911.30 charged by the respondent against the appellant's account, this sum related to a debt owing by the appellant to a company called Alberta Gas Services Ltd., which company assigned the debt to Lion Oils Ltd. The appellant's submission was not against the validity of the account, but that this item could not properly be claimed in an action which, by the pleadings, was one for goods sold and delivered by Lion Oils Ltd. to the appellant.\nIt appears, however, that the claim in this action is for the balance due upon a running account between the appellant and Lion Oils Ltd., which balance is substantially composed of those items most recently sold to the appellant. Those items were sold by Lion Oils Ltd. subsequent to the date when the assignment of the debt from Alberta Gas Services Ltd. occurred and after it had been paid by subsequent credits in favour of the appellant. The items in issue in this action did not, therefore, include that debt.\nThe last matter is the question of interest. The learned trial judge held that this claim had not been established because the evidence did not prove an agreement to pay interest or an amount upon which it should be calculated. The Court of Appeal held that interest should be paid at 5 per cent on the balance owing after the account became static. The conclusion reached by the learned trial judge does not appear to have been reached on the basis of the credibility of witnesses, but rather is an inference drawn from the evidence adduced, as is the case in respect of the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal.\nThe evidence on this matter is that of Plotkins, who testifies that he and Harvey, the representative of the appellant, arranged with a bank for a $25,000 credit for the appellant. However, as the bank insisted on a guarantee of the appellant's indebtedness by Lion Oils Ltd., it was then agreed that the latter company would, itself, extend the credit of approximately the same amount, on condition that the appellant would pay to it 5 per cent interest on outstanding balances as at the end of each year. Harvey, who also testified, did not deny this arrangement, but said that he could not remember it. Interest was, in fact, paid on one occasion after this arrangement was alleged to have been made. In the light of this evidence I am not prepared to say that the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal was erroneous.\nFor these reasons I am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Balfour & Balfour, Regina.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Noonan, Embury, Heald & Molisky, Regina.\n1 (1959-60), 30 W.W.R. 14, 22 D.L.R.

A third action was taken by L Co. against the Quebec Hydro-Electric Commission for damages arising out of the same cause of action, and these three actions were ordered to be tried at the same time and on the same evidence.\nThe present action for indemnification, based on a contractual relationship, was taken by the plaintiffs against the defendant. The trial judge granted the plaintiffs' motion to have these four actions tried at the same time and decided upon the same evidence as far as the pleadings permitted. This judgment was reversed by a majority judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiffs were granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nIt was not necessary to decide whether art. 292 of the Code of Civil Procedure was to be read as subject to the provisions of art. 291, because, even if a discretion was given under art. 292 to join such cases\u2014as to which no opinion was expressed\u2014the present action should not be ordered joined with the three damage actions.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of St. Germain J. Appeal dismissed.\nFran\u00e7ois Mercier, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJames E. Mitchell, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal, by leave under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench2 reversing an interlocutory judgment of the Superior Court made under art. 292 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which ordered that four actions then pending in the Superior Court be tried at the same time and decided on the same evidence in so far as the pleadings would permit.\nIn two of the said actions, appellants were the defendants and the plaintiffs were respectively the Quebec North Shore Paper Company and the Laurentian Forest Protective Association Limited, both claiming substantial damages arising from a forest fire allegedly due to negligence on the part of employees of appellants. A third action was taken by the said Laurentian Forest Protective Association Limited against the Quebec Hydro-Electric Commission, for damages arising out of the same cause of action. These three actions were ordered joined for trial by a previous judgment of the Superior Court.\nSome eighteen months after the said three actions were taken, appellants instituted the present action against respondent, asking that by reason of a contractual arrangement alleged to subsist between the parties, appellants be indemnified by respondent in the manner set forth in their declaration.\nTwo questions arise on this appeal:\n(1) Whether under art. 292 C.C.P. the court has any authority to join for trial actions in which the parties are not the same.\n(2) If such authority exists, whether it should have been exercised.\nOn the first question the substance of appellants' argument, shortly stated, is that art. 292 C.C.P. must be read independently of art. 291 C.C.P. Respondent's argument is the opposite, namely that art. 292 C.C.P. must be read as subject to the provisions of art. 291. On this point there appear to have been conflicting opinions expressed in the Quebec courts, and Mr. Mercier in his able argument suggested to us that this Court should resolve those differences. For the purposes of this appeal, however, we do not find it necessary to resolve such a difficulty if it exists. Even if a discretion is given under art. 292 C.C.P. to join such cases\u2014as to which we express no opinion\u2014after the full and helpful argument before us, we are all of the view that the present action should not be ordered joined with the three damage actions and that the court below was right in concluding that the motion to join should have been dismissed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs, appellants: Brais, Campbell, Mercier, Leduc & Pepper, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Senecal, Turnbull, Mitchell, Stairs, Culver, Kierans & Claxton, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

The defendant bought the plaintiff's share and gave a cheque which bore the notation \"in full payment for all \u2026 interest in 18 claims \u2026\" This cheque was later cashed by the plaintiff. The defendant then sold the claims to a mining company, of which he was the president. Some 15 months later the plaintiff instituted this action, claiming that he had not sold his interest in the claims to the defendant, but had been induced to consent to a sale to the mining company by the fraudulent representations of the defendant. The claim was for one-half of the purchase price. The trial judge dismissed the action and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Curriam: The contention that this claim was for a share of the price of sale of partnership property was not open to the plaintiff on the pleadings, but even on the assumption that a partnership existed between the parties for the exploitation of the claims\u2014which was doubtful\u2014such a partnership would be dissolved upon one partner requiring all the interest of his co-partner in the assets of the partnership. It is true that during the continuation of a partnership one partner cannot profit from dealings with partnership assets at the expense of a co-partner. However, one partner is always free to purchase the interest of his co-partner with a view to re-selling at a profit, and under the law of Quebec no duty was imposed upon the purchasing partner to disclose to his co-partner such intention to re-sell. Such a sale was valid and put an end to the partnership in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation. The findings of the lower Courts should not be disturbed.\nPer Martland J.: As the plaintiff failed to establish a fiduciary relationship at the time of the purchase by the defendant there was no obligation upon the defendant at that time to disclose his future intended dealings with the claims.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Smith J.

The parties were apparently well known to each other, and some time in June or July of 1954, respondent had acquired from appellant a half interest in the said claims.\nOn December 15, 1954, respondent issued to appellant his cheque for $1500, which was cashed by the latter on December 20, 1954, and which bore on the back the following notation:\nIn full payment for all of H. Coles interest in eighteen claims adjoining Zinc Lake Mines, Ltd. property to the west, in Shelley & Onaping Townships, Sudbury District, Ontario.\nUp to that time no extensive examination had been made of the said claims, but in the latter part of December 1954, after acquiring appellant's interest, respondent arranged to have a geophysical survey made, obtained certain other reports on the property, and in January 1955, through an intermediary, sold the said claims to West Malartic Mines Limited, a company of which he was then the president, for a price of $15,000 in cash and 150,000 fully paid up shares of the said West Malartic Mines Limited. It is a reasonable inference, in my opinion, that in acquiring appellant's interest in these claims, the respondent did so with a view to disposing of them at a profit to the mining company in question.\nSome fifteen months later, in March 1956, appellant took the present action, claiming that he had not sold his interest in the said claims to respondent but had been induced to consent to a sale to West Malartic Mines Limited as a result of false and fraudulent representations made to him by respondent. He claimed from respondent one-half of the purchase price, less the $1500 already received by him. Appellant's cause of action is set forth by him in his declaration in the following terms:\n3. During the latter part of the year 1954, Defendant represented to Plaintiff that he could sell the said mining claims to the WEST MALARTIC MINES LIMITED, a company of which he was the President, for the price of $3,000.00 in cash and 200,000 fully paid up shares of the said company, to which Plaintiff agreed.\n4. The said representations were false and fraudulent and made by Defendant to Plaintiff in order to induce him to accept the said price, while the true transaction was a sale by Defendant to the said WEST MALARTIC MINES LIMITED, for the price of $15,000.00 in cash and 150,000 fully paid up shares of the Capital Stock of the said company.\nRespondent's defence was that on or about December 15, 1954, appellant had sold and transferred to him all his right, title and interest in the said claims for the sum of $1500.\nIt was argued by counsel for appellant that appellant and respondent were in partnership in respect of the said mining claims and that, in effect, appellant's claim is one for a share of the price of sale of partnership property. I do not think such a contention is open to appellant on the pleadings, but even if it be assumed that a partnership did exist between the parties for the exploitation of the said claims\u2014which I think is doubtful\u2014such a partnership would be dissolved upon one partner acquiring all the interest of his copartner in the assets of the partnership.\nIt is trite law of course, that during the continuation of a partnership one partner cannot profit from dealings with partnership assets at the expense of a co-partner. However, one partner is free at any time to purchase the interest of his co-partner in the assets of the partnership with a view to reselling those assets at a profit, and under the law of Quebec no duty is imposed upon the purchasing partner to disclose to his co-partner such intention to resell. In the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, such a sale is valid and puts an end to the partnership.\nAfter a careful review of the respective contentions of the parties and of the evidence, the learned trial judge made the following findings:\nThe proposition advanced on behalf of the Plaintiff to the effect that there was no contract of sale entered into between himself and the Defendant, but that he, the Plaintiff, was induced by fraud practised by the Defendant to consent to the sale of said claims to West Malartic by the Defendant, representing the partnership, is not only unsupported by the prof but is inconsistent with the terms endorsed on the reverse of the cheque accepted by Plaintiff in consideration of the transfer of his interest in the said mining claims. On the contrary, the Court is forced to conclude that on the 15th day of December 1954 the Plaintiff sold and transferred his interest in said claims to the Defendant thereby terminating any partnership which may have existed previously in respect of said claims, and that thereafter the Defendant was the sole owner of said claims with the right to deal with them as he might see fit.\nThose findings were confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench and appellant has failed to convince me that they should be disturbed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMartland J.:\u2014After reviewing all of the evidence in these proceedings I am not satisfied that the appellant has proved the facts necessary to establish a fiduciary relationship as between himself and the respondent at the time when the respondent purchased from him his remaining one-half interest in the mining claims. That being so, there was no obligation upon the respondent, at the time the purchase was made, to disclose to the appellant the respondent's intended dealings with the mining claims after the completion of the purchase.\nWith respect to those issues which were determined by the Courts below, I agree with my brother Abbott that their conclusions should not be disturbed. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: E. Lafontaine, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Slattery, B\u00e9langer & Fairbanks, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que. Q.B. 984.\n"}

The defendant owned a large dog of the Doberman Pinscher breed which was left in the plaintiff's care. On the day of the accident the plaintiff had just finished washing the kitchen floor and was about to go out with the defendant who was also in the kitchen with the dog. The plaintiff, who was fond of the dog, went up to shake it by the paw. As he did so, he lost his balance and fell suddenly towards the dog which, in alarm and without warning, bit the plaintiff in the face. The trial judge dismissed the action and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nWhile the owner of an animal is presumed to be responsible whether it is under his own care or that of his servants, that presumption created by art. 1055 of the Civil Code, can be rebutted by establishing \"force majeure\", the action of a third party or the fault of the victim. In the present case no liability could be attached to the owner. The evidence was clear that the dog was not viscious and that the sole cause of the accident was the unintentional fall of the plaintiff.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. Appeal dismissed. M. Dumesnil, Y. Desloges and Miss M. Perreault, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nG. Allison for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 est propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accommodation des touristes, et le demandeur-appelant en est le concierge. Ce dernier, originaire de Suisse, est venu au Canada en 1950 \u00e0 la demande de l'intim\u00e9 qui est son cousin. Barman habitait avec une demoiselle du nom de Schmidt le rez-de-chaus\u00e9e de l'immeuble en question, et l'intim\u00e9 lui avait confi\u00e9 la garde de son chien, un Doberman Pinscher, de taille assez imposante. Durant une ann\u00e9e environ, soit jusqu'au mois de juin 1951, le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur habitaient cette maison, mais \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, Villard, le propri\u00e9taire, partit pour la campagne avec sa femme, et ils amen\u00e8rent le chien avec eux. Ils revinrent \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al au mois de septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, et quelque temps apr\u00e8s firent un voyage en Europe et ne furent de retour qu'au printemps de 1952. Durant ce temps, le chien resta sous la garde du demandeur-appelant, et il en fut ainsi jusqu'au 15 octobre 1952, car en revenant d'Europe, l'intim\u00e9 et sa femme habit\u00e8rent un autre logement o\u00f9 ils ne pouvaient pas garder le chien.\nA cette date du 15 octobre 1952, l'appelant venait de finir de laver le plancher de la cuisine, et se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 sortir avec l'intim\u00e9 et mademoiselle Schmidt, quand il s'approcha du chien qu'il affectionnait, afin de lui demander sa patte. En faisant ce geste, il glissa sur le plancher humide vers le chien qui \u00e9tait couch\u00e9, et ce dernier alarm\u00e9 et \u00e9peur\u00e9 par ce mouvement brusque qui semblait une menace, r\u00e9agit violemment et mordit l'appelant \u00e0 la figure lui infligeant de s\u00e9rieuses blessures. Le demandeur r\u00e9clama devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure la somme de $25,000 pour incapacit\u00e9 partielle, d\u00e9figuration, choc nerveux, soins m\u00e9dicaux, etc. etc. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 cette action avec d\u00e9pens, et la Cour du banc de la reine2 a unanimement confirm\u00e9 cet arr\u00eat. Le demandeur appelle de ces d\u00e9cisions.\nIl ne fait pas de doute qu'en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 1055 C.C., le propri\u00e9taire d'un animal est responsable du dommage que l'animal cause, soit qu'il fut sous sa garde ou sous celle de ses domestiques. Cet article du Code Civil cr\u00e9e donc une pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 contre le propri\u00e9taire, mais cette pr\u00e9somption peut \u00e9videmment \u00eatre contredite. Elle n'est pas invincible, et elle peut \u00eatre contredite par une preuve contraire. (1239 C.C.). Ainsi, dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe, si le propri\u00e9taire de l'animal \u00e9tablit cas fortuit, force majeure, l'acte d'un tiers ou faute de la victime, il ne peut \u00eatre recherch\u00e9 en dommages devant les tribunaux, car alors la pr\u00e9somption que l'art. 1055 attache au propri\u00e9taire de l'animal, ou \u00e0 celui qui s'en sert, est repouss\u00e9e. Vide: Mignault, vol. 5, pp. 339, 376, 377; Langelier, vol. 3, p. 482; Mass\u00e9 & Verg\u00e9 sur Zachariae, para. 629 ; De Lorimier, vol. 8, p. 248 ; Montreal Stockyards Co. v. Poulin3; Lafrance v. Paulhus4; Piquette v. Fr\u00e9chette5 ; Gamache v. Grondin6; Fortin v. Fournier7; McSween v. Lapointe8.\nLa question de responsabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9senterait plus de difficult\u00e9s, s'il s'agissait d'un chien vicieux, mais ce point ne se pr\u00e9sente pas ici, car l'appelant lui-m\u00eame dans son t\u00e9moignage nous dit:\nC'est un chien qui \u00e9tait doux, tranquille, plut\u00f4t nerveux, mais une parfaite b\u00eate, une bonne b\u00eate, pas m\u00e9chante du tout, craintive plut\u00f4t.\nIl me semble \u00e9vident que la seule cause de cet accident soit la conduite de la victime elle-m\u00eame. Il est certain que son acte n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnel, mais il est aussi \u00e9vident que la chute que le demandeur a faite a naturellement provoqu\u00e9 cette violente r\u00e9action de cette b\u00eate paisible, avec le r\u00e9sultat que l'on conna\u00eet. D'ailleurs, dans son t\u00e9moignage l'appellant lui-m\u00eame nous dit ceci:\nJ'ai l'impression qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de peur, c'est une b\u00eate qui \u00e9tait craintive. J'ai fait un mouvement brusque en tombant, il m'a mordu.\nEt plus loin, voici ce que l'appelant affirme:\nNon, il n'\u00e9tait pas tra\u00eetre, on pouvait lui faire ce qu'on voulait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s. C'est une peur qu'il a eue. Il a mordu. Il s'est senti menac\u00e9 peut-\u00eatre. Qu'est-ce qui se passe dans la t\u00eate d'un chien? On ne peut pas savoir.\nIl resort donc de toute la preuve que le chien de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait d'une nature douce et tranquille, qu'il s'est senti menac\u00e9, et que sa r\u00e9action subite et violente ne peut \u00eatre attribu\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 la victime elle-m\u00eame. C'est la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle sont arriv\u00e9es la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du banc de la reine, et je crois que toutes deux ont bien jug\u00e9.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: Mario Dumesnil, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Walker, Chauvin, Walker, Allison & Beaulieu, Montreal.\n1 [1958] Que.

Act, 1867. s. 96\u2014Securities Act, 1954-55 (Que.). c. 11, ss. 1, 13, 16, 44.\nThe petititioner, whose head office was in Montreal, was registered as a broker with the Quebec Securities Commission. It was engaged in the promotion of four mining companies operating in the Province, and published a weekly bulletin promoting the sale of the shares of these companies, offering advice regarding other mining and oil companies, and listing quotations on a number of other securities of Canadian companies. All the business was directed from the head office. The persons with whom the petitioner dealt and to whom the bulletin was mailed were residing outside the province.\nIts licence was cancelled but it continued to carry on business and to publish the bulletin. The Commission seized its books and documents and ordered the petitioner's bankers to seize its funds and securities.\nContending that its business activities were not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, the petitioner sought a peremptory writ of injunction. The trial judge dismissed the petition, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The petitioner appealed to this Court, and there formally abandoned any submissions involving the validity of the provisions of The Securities Act.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed; the petitioner was subject to the jurisdiction and control of the Quebec Securities Commission.\nOn the facts of this case, the petitioner carried on the business of trading in securities and acted as investment counsel in the Province of Quebec within the meaning and for the purposes of the Act. The fact that the securities traded by the petitioner were for the account of customers outside of the province or that its bulletins were mailed to clients outside of the province did not alter that conclusion. The paramount object of the Act is to ensure that persons who, in the province, carry on the business of trading in securities or acting as investment counsel, shall be honest and of good repute and, in this way, to protect the public in the province or elsewhere from being defrauded as a result of certain activities initiated in the province by persons therein carrying on such a business.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Deslaurier J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. G. Ahern, Q.C., for the petitioner, appellant.\nL. Tremblay, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014For the consideration of the points raised in this appeal, it is sufficient to summarize as follows the facts leading to this litigation.\nOn the 6th of December, 1956, and for some time prior thereto, appellant had its head office and two branch offices in Montreal, where it was engaged in the promotion of four mining companies operating in the Province of Quebec, and it also published a weekly bulletin entitled \"Gregory's Selected Securities\". As required by s. 16 of the Act Respecting Securities, 3-4 Elizabeth II, c. 11, appellant was registered, as a broker, with the Quebec Securities Commission, the body constituted, under the said Act, for the supervision and control of trading in securities. On the 26th of October, 1956, appellant was ordered by the Commission to cease the publication of its weekly bulletins ; but refused to do so. On the 6th of December, 1956, for reasons indicated in a letter addressed to appellant's solicitor by the president of the Commission, its registration as a broker was cancelled. Appellant, notwithstanding the prohibition in s. 16, continued to carry on its business. The present appeal, however, was argued on the assumption that, as from December 6, 1956, if not prior thereto, appellant dealt only with clients residing outside the Province of Quebec and that its weekly bulletins, prepared and published in Montreal, were mailed only to persons residing outside the Province of Quebec.\nIn January 1957, the Commission, following an investigation of appellant's activities and acting under ss. 39 and 44(a) of the said Act, caused the books and documents of appellant to be seized and ordered the Imperial Bank of Canada to hold in trust, until revocation of the order, funds to the amount of $49,565.50 which the bank had on deposit, under its control or safe-keeping for appellant.\nA few weeks later, appellant instituted the present proceedings against respondents, praying in its petition for injunction that they, their officers and employees be enjoined:\n(a) from continuing to prevent your Petitioner from having the use of the sum of $49,565.50 in the hands of the Imperial Bank of Canada, and withheld from Petitioner by the said Bank upon orders of Respondent-corporation;\n(b) to cease depriving Petitioner of access to its books and records, cheques, documents and other things its property, so that it may be able to carry on its business unhampered and freely;\n(c) from further interference in any way with your Petitioner in the carrying out of its business, either by raids, seizures or supplying false and slanderous information concerning your Petitioner and the companies it has financed;\nthe whole with costs; appellant reserving its right for damages in the circumstances.\nThis petition for a peremptory writ of injunction was contested and, after a hearing on the merits, was dismissed by the Superior Court, and that decision was affirmed by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec2. Hence the appeal to this Court.\nDoubts having been raised, at the beginning of the hearing, as to our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, leave to appeal was granted upon the unopposed application of counsel for appellant. At this stage of the litigation, the validity of the motives prompting the Commission to act as it did is not questioned. Indeed, the only points submitted in support of the appeal are summarized in the three following propositions :\n(i) Appellant company is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Quebec Securities Commission ; it does not have to be registered with the Commission as a broker or investment counsel for it carries on, it is said, an interprovincial and international, but not an intra-provincial, trade.\n(ii) Section 44(a) of the Act, under authority of which the order to the Imperial Bank was issued by the Commission, authorizes the freezing of funds on deposit with a bank. Under s. 91(15) of the B.N.A. Act, Parliament has exclusively the jurisdiction to legislate in relation to banks and banking; s. 44(a) of the Act Respecting Securities conflicts with s. 95 of the Bank Act, 2-3 Elizabeth II, c. 48, dealing with deposits with banks.\n(iii) The order issued by the Commission under the authority of s. 44(a) is tantamount to an injunction or a writ of attachment, both of which were always, prior to Confederation, within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to deal with. Section 44(a) offends s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act.\nWhile counsel for appellant did not ask, in the conclusion of its petition, that s. 44(a) of the Securities Act be declared ultra vires of the Legislature, it is apparent that the last two propositions bring in question the validity of the section and require determination as to the matter even if, as declared by counsel for appellant, it is raised only in aid of construction of the section. The notice prescribed in like circumstances by r. 18 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada was not given. This situation having been brought to his attention by this Court, counsel for appellant formally abandoned any submissions involving the validity of the provisions of the Act Respecting Securities.\nAccordingly, there remains to be considered only the first proposition, i.e. whether, because of the character of its activities and the manner in which they were conducted, appellant is subject to the jurisdiction and control of the Quebec Securities Commission.\nThe fact that the securities traded by appellant would be for the account of customers outside of the province or that its weekly bulletins would be mailed to clients outside of the province, does not, as decided in the Courts below, support the submission that appellant was not trading in securities or acting as investment counsel, in the province, within the meaning and for the purposes of the Act Respecting Securities.\nThe paramount object of the Act is to ensure that persons who, in the province, carry on the business of trading in securities or acting as investment counsel, shall be honest and of good repute and, in this way, to protect the public, in the province or elsewhere, from being defrauded as a result of certain activities initiated in the province by persons therein carrying on such a business. For the attainment of this object, trading in securities is defined in s. 14; registration is provided for in s. 16 as a requisite to trade in securities and act as investment counsel particularly; investment counsel is defined in s. 1 ; the business is regulated and certain actions or omissions in its conduct constitute infractions subject to sanctions. Section 14 and the relevant parts of ss. 16 and 1 enact:\n14. The following shall constitute trading in securities:\n(a) any alienation, or disposal, for a valuable consideration, of a security or of an interest in or option on a security, any solicitation for or obtaining of a subscription to a security for such a consideration and any attempt to do any of the aforesaid acts;\n(b) any underwriting of all or part of an issue of securities;\n(c) any act, advertisement, conduct, negotiation other than preliminary or transaction for the purpose or having the effect of carrying out, directly or indirectly, any operation contemplated in subparagraphs a and b or defined by the regulations as constituting a trade in securities.\n* * *\n16. No person shall:\n(a) trade in any security unless he is registered as a broker or security issuer or as salesman for a broker or security issuer registered as such;\n(b)................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n(c) act as investment counsel without being registered as such;\n(d)................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEvery person who does any of the things mentioned in this section without the required registration or when such registration is suspended commits an offence.\n* * * 1. In this act, the following terms mean or designate:\n(1) .................................................................................................................................\n(2) .................................................................................................................................\n(3) \"investment counsel\"; any person or company other than a broker or a security issuer who informs or advises the public, directly or through bulletins or other publications, as to the state of the market for securities or for certain securities; or who gives advice, makes suggestions or expresses opinions as to the expediency of buying or selling securities; or who publishes or causes to be published reports respecting certain securities; or who makes a business of studying, supervising or managing the securities portfolios of particular customers, or of advising them as to the constitution and management of such portfolios and as to the investment of their funds;\nThe nature of the business in which appellant was engaged and its mode of operation are set forth in the reasons for judgment of Hyde J.A. In its weekly bulletin, prepared and printed in Montreal, and mailed therefrom to some ten thousand clients in the other provinces of Canada and in the United States, appellant promoted the sale of the shares of the companies in which it was interested; offered advice regarding other mining and oil companies; and listed quotations on a number of other securities of Canadian companies, traded in the Montreal and Toronto markets, listed and unlisted. In the bulletin, it states:\u2014\"We execute orders on all exchanges and will be pleased to have the privilege of handling your security transactions.\" Its post-office address and telephone number in Montreal are printed on the front page. Appellant's President, who owned all of its capital stock, testified that their ordinary way of selling securities was to \"contact\" the client by telephone from Montreal and make an offer which was either accepted or refused. Payment was made by cheque sent to the appellant to its head office in Montreal from where all the business was directed. The shares of the four mining companies, appellant was actively promoting, were transferable only in the Province of Quebec. Customers were invited to communicate with appellant at its head office in Montreal and orders for securities were solicited by telephone from Montreal and were received by telephone in Montreal where they were completed. The payments by customers were made to the appellant by mail directed to its office in Montreal and, presumably, any payments to them were made from there. A substantial bank account was maintained in Montreal by appellant. On these undisputed facts, one can only conclude that appellant, within the meaning and for the purposes of the Act Respecting Securities, did, in the Province of Quebec, (i) carry on the business of trading in securities and (ii) act as investment counsel.\nThis conclusion is not affected, even if, as contended for appellant, certain contracts, with respect to sales solicited by appellant, might, on the doctrine recognized and applied in the cases of Magann v. Auger3 and Charlebois v. Baril4, have been perfected outside the province. These cases are here irrelevant.\nNor is this conclusion affected by the decisions rendered in a group of cases referred to by counsel for appellant, where the incidence of export trade of farm products on the validity of certain provincial marketing acts was considered. Lawson v. Interior Tree, Fruit and Vegetable Committee5; P.E.I. Potato Marketing Board v. Willis Inc.6; Reference re Farm Products Marketing Act7. These decisions are also irrelevant. The Act Respecting Securities, 3-4 Elizabeth II, c. 11, is not marketing legislation within the meaning attending the legislation considered in these cases. In order to protect the public against fraud, it provides for the establishment and operation of a control and supervision over the conduct, in the Province of Quebec, of persons engaged, therein, in carrying on the business of trading in securities or acting as investment counsel.\nThe object of the Act, as shown by its provisions, is similar to that of the Securities Fraud Prevention Act, 1930, of Alberta, which was considered in Lymburn and another v. Mayland and Others8 and where Lord Atkin, with reference to Part I entitled \"Registration of brokers and salesmen\", said at p. 324:\nThere is no reason to doubt that the main object sought to be secured in this part of the Act is to secure that persons who carry on the business of dealing in securities shall be honest and of good repute, and in this way to protect the public from being defrauded. Being of opinion that the Court of Appeal reached the right conclusion in the matter, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the course of this litigation are set out in the reasons of my brother Fauteux and in those delivered in the courts below.\nIn his factum and in his opening argument counsel for the appellant made, inter alia, submissions which may be summarized as follows:\n(i) That the trade in securities carried on by the appellant is interprovincial and international, that consequently it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Quebec Securities Commission and that if regulation of such trading is thought necessary its provision lies within the legislative sphere of Parliament;\n(ii) That s. 44 of the Quebec Securities Act, 3-4 Elizabeth II, c. 11, hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\", is in conflict with s. 95 of The Bank Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 12 and is consequently null and void;\n(iii) That the order issued by the respondent Commission to the Imperial Bank of Canada and which reads as follows,\nIn accordance with Section 44 of the Quebec Securities Act, we hereby order you to hold in trust, until such time as this order is revoked, in whole or in part, by this Commission, any funds or securities belonging to Gregory and Company, Inc. which you may have on deposit or under control, or for safekeeping.\nis equivalent to an injunction and that the provincial legislature cannot confer the power to make such an order on a tribunal whose members are not appointed pursuant to s. 96 of the British North America Act.\n(iv) That the provincial legislature has not the power to control the printing or dissemination of a circular which is to be distributed only to persons outside the province.\nIn the courts below the appellant did not give the notice to the Attorney-General required by art. 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and in this Court, he did not give the notices required by r. 18. At the hearing counsel made it clear that the failure to give these notices was the result of a considered decision which he did not wish to alter, and, as is pointed out in the reasons of my brother Fauteux, formally abandoned any submissions impugning the validity of the provisions of the Act.\nIn these circumstances, at the risk of repetition, I wish to make it clear that the judgment of this Court in this case does not by implication or otherwise decide anything as to the constitutional validity of the Act.\nAlthough all arguments involving an attack on the validity of the Act are withdrawn I have difficulty in satisfying myself that on its true construction the Act authorizes the Securities Commission to regulate a business of the sort carried on by the appellant, but I am not prepared to dissent from the views on this point entertained by the other members of the Court and, consequently, I concur in the disposition of the appeal proposed by my brother Fauteux.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the petitioner, appellant: Hyde & Ahern, Montreal.\nAttorney for the defendants, respondents: L.

Gordon (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1961: June 13, 26.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Sunday observance\u2014Coin-operated automatic laundry open on Sunday\u2014Owner and employees not in attendance\u2014Whether \u201ccarrying on business of ordinary calling\u201d\u2014Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, s. 4.\nThe accused was charged with carrying on business on Sunday contrary to s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C., 1952, c. 171. As the owner of an automatic laundry business, the accused operated two establishments which remained open and in use by the public on a Sunday. The premises in question contained automatic washing machines and dryers which customers could operate automatically by inserting a coin in a slot. The soap and bleach were supplied by the customers but the water and electricity were furnished by the accused. On the Sunday in question the police found customers operating the machines at both premises. Neither the accused nor any of his servants or agents were present. There was a sign on the wall with instructions as to the operation of the machines and another sign giving telephone numbers to be called in case of emergency.\nThe accused was acquitted, but the Court of Appeal directed that a verdict of guilty be entered. The accused was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The accused was guilty of carrying on the business of his ordinary calling on Sunday within the meaning of s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The evidence adduced indicated that the business carried on by the accused on the Sunday in question was \u201cof his ordinary calling\u201d. The words of s. 4 were very wide. Even in the absence of the accused or any of his servants or agents, he was carrying on business on the Sunday in question. What he did in the ordinary acceptance of the term was carrying on any business of his ordinary calling.\nThe question as to whether the accused was carrying on a work of necessity and mercy within the meaning of s. 11 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act was not raised before the County Court Judge, whose decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, and in the absence of any evidence as to what was being washed or dried in the machines, the point could not be considered.\nPer Locke, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The conduct of the accused fell within the prohibition of s. 4. The presence of the proprietor or his servants was an irrelevant circumstance in the situation disclosed by the evidence in the present case. The uncontradicted evidence given before the County Court Judge was sufficient to establish that the business carried on by the accused was that of his ordinary calling.\nIf it were intended by the accused to contend that the operation fell within the exception of s. 11 of the Act, the onus was on him to prove it. The accused, however, called no evidence and there was none in the case for the prosecution upon which such a finding could conceivably be made.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: On the facts found by the County Court Judge, the latter was right in law in holding that the accused was not carrying on the business of his ordinary calling on the day in question within the meaning of those words as used in s. 4. The Act is intended to prevent people from working on Sundays, and to come within the words \u201ccarry on business\u201d there must be some act of a positive nature, the doing of something. The Act forbids actions, it does not forbid omissions. On its true construction s. 4 makes the doing of some act on Sunday an essential ingredient of an offence against the section. In the case at bar nothing was done by the accused or any of his employees in connection with the business.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] setting aside a verdict of acquittal. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting. A.M. Ferriss, Q.C., for the appellant.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014By leave of this Court Lewis E. Gordon appeals from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing appeals by the Attorney General for Ontario against the orders of His Honour Judge Carscallen on appeals before the latter by way of trials de novo from the acquittal by a magistrate of the appellant of charges based upon two informations. In one of these it was alleged that the appellant \u201cdid unlawfully carry on the business of his ordinary calling, to wit, washing clothes (Automatic Laundry) at 469 N. Christina Street, in the City of Sarnia, contrary to The Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, s. 4\u201d; in the other he was charged with the same offence but with reference to 102 East Street, in the City of Sarnia. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeals, set aside the verdict of acquittal on each charge and directed that a verdict of guilty be entered against the appellant and a fine of ten dollars on each charge and of the costs of the proceedings before the magistrate be imposed, and that, in default of such payment, the appellant be imprisoned for a period of five days.\nSection 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act is as follows:\n4. It is not lawful for any person on the Lord\u2019s Day, except as provided herein, or in any provincial Act or law now or hereafter in force, to sell or offer for sale or purchase any goods, chattels, or other personal property, or any real estate, or to carry on or transact any business of his ordinary calling, or in connection with such calling, or for gain to do, or employ any other person to do, on that day, any work, business, or labour.\nThere is in the record a licence, dated January 5, 1959, from the City of Sarnia, to \u201cEcon\u2011O\u2011Wash, 469 N. Christina, per Lewis Gordon, to enable him to use and exercise the calling and business of keeper of a laundry until the 31st day of December, 1959\u201d. Evidence was given by the landlord of the premises at 102 East Street that he had rented them to the appellant and that the same type of business was carried on by the appellant at both addresses. There is also in the record a certified copy of a declaration by the appellant, dated March 25, 1959, under The Partnership Registration Act of Ontario, that he has had carried on and intended to carry on a coin-operated laundry business at 469 N. Christina Street, in the City of Sarnia, under the name of \u201cEcon-O-Wash\u201d; that the business had subsisted since February 20, 1959, since which date he was the sole partner of the said business.\nThe premises at each address contained automatic washing machines and dryers. Customers supplied their own soap and bleach and by inserting a coin in a slot the articles they brought with them would be automatically washed or dried in the appropriate machines by the water and electricity furnished by the appellant. On Sunday, November 22, 1959, two policemen entered the premises at each of the above addresses of which the doors were unlocked. At one of the addresses at least there was a sign on a wall with instructions as to the operation of the machines and another sign reading: \u201cThis store designed and equipped by L. Gordon, 469 N. Christina Street, Sarnia\u201d and there was also a pay telephone to which was attached a card with the information \u201cEmergency No. Call Ed6-2201, Di4-0854\u201d. A number of persons were present at each of the premises and there were a number of automatic washers or a number of dryers in operation. Neither the appellant nor any of his servants or agents were present at either of the premises.\nLeave to appeal was granted on the points mentioned in the notice of application therefore but the only important argument requiring consideration was that it was not possible to say, within the meaning of s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, that the appellant was a person who carried on or transacted any business of his ordinary calling on Sunday. The learned County Court judge found that there was evidence that the appellant was the proprietor of both stores on the date in question. He defined the issue before him as being \u201cif the evidence indicates that the accused was carrying on or transacting business on 22nd November, 1959\u201d. There is no suggestion in his judgment that if the appellant were carrying on business on that date that it was not \u201cof his ordinary calling\u201d. The evidence adduced indicates that it was, and there is no evidence to the contrary. The words of s. 4 are very wide. The decisions in the Courts of the State of New York referred to on the argument and also the later judgment of the Court of Appeals in People v. Welt[2] are interesting but do not assist me in construing s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act. I have no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that even in the absence of the appellant or any of his servants or agents he was carrying on business on the Sunday in question. Presuming that on Sunday he would not go or send someone to either establishment in order to collect the money that had been deposited in the slot machines and that he or his servant or agent would not go on a Sunday to repair any of the machines, what he did in the ordinary acceptance of the term was carrying on any business of his ordinary calling.\nCounsel for the appellant referred us to a decision of the High Court of Australia in Spence v. Ravenscroft[3], There, however, Spence was charged with an offence under a section of an Act that provided \u201cwhosoever trades or deals or keeps open any shop, store or other place for the purpose of trading or dealing on Sunday\u2026 shall be liable to a penalty\u201d. The majority of the Court held that \u201ctrades\u201d was to be narrowly construed, saying at p. 352:\nWe think that the word \u201ctrades\u201d is not used in sec. 61 in the wide sense of keeping a place of business open for trading, which is dealt with by the succeeding words of the section, but is limited to personal acts done on Sunday in the nature of trading.\nI can find no assistance in this decision in coming to a solution in the present case nor in the reasons for judgment of Laidlaw J.A., speaking for himself, in Re Pszon[4]. What was there in issue was the question as to whether a man was carrying on business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act,\u2014a statute enacted for an entirely different purpose and any decision under it can have no relevancy to the matter now before us.\nCounsel for the appellant stated that while before the magistrate the question arose as to whether the appellant was carrying on a work of necessity and mercy within the meaning of s. 11 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, no such question was raised before the County Court judge and it was from the decisions of the latter that appeals were taken to the Court of Appeal. There is nothing in the evidence to show what was being washed or dried in the machines and in the absence of any such evidence the point cannot be considered. It is, therefore, unnecessary to express any opinion as to the decision of the District Court judge in Regina v. Coin Launder-All Limited[5].\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgement of Locke, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014In the premises operated by the appellant at 102 East Street and 469 North Christina Street in Sarnia there were placed numbers of automatic washing machines and drying machines. Upon placing a sum of .20cts. in a slot the washing machine, using water supplied by the appellant, operated for 10 minutes, the motive power being electricity, also supplied by him. The drying machines operated for a similar period of time when .10cts. was placed in the slot. The public availing themselves of this service supplied their own soap or detergent. In return for the deposit of .05cts. in another slot machine the customer could purchase a supply of detergent for this purpose. In the premises there were signs instructing customers that, in case of emergency, they should call a given telephone number.\nThe carrying on of this business was thus entirely automatic. Whether either the appellant or anyone on his behalf were present on the premises during the week is not shown.\nOn the Sunday referred to in the charges, neither the appellant nor anyone on his behalf were there and the question to be determined is whether, by reason of this, the appellant was not carrying on or transacting any business of his ordinary calling or in connection therewith on the Lord\u2019s Day, within the meaning of s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.\nThe situation does not appear to me to differ in any respect from that which would arise if the proprietor of a self-service grocery store left his premises open and unattended on Sunday, thus inviting the public, to enter and to purchase his goods at the marked price. It seems to me quite impossible to suggest that such conduct would not fall within the prohibition of s.4. The presence or absence of the proprietor or his servants is, in my opinion, an irrelevant circumstance in the situation disclosed by the evidence in the present case.\nThe learned County Court judge relied in acquitting the appellant upon a passage in a judgment of Laidlaw J.A. in Re Pszon[6], in which that learned judge expressed his opinion as to what constituted carrying on business within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act. In the passage quoted it was said that a person who devoted no time or attention or labour to the working or conduct of the affairs of an enterprise does not carry on the business of that enterprise. But here the appellant actively carried on this business throughout every day of the week, merely absenting himself from the premises on Sunday. The passage quoted has, in my opinion, no application in these circumstances and does not bear the meaning sought to be assigned to it by the appellant. If it were treated as applicable, the operator of the self\u2011service grocery store above mentioned would not be carrying on business.\nReliance is also placed upon the decision of the Divisional Court in Willesden Urban District v. Morgan[7]. The prosecution in that case was under the Shops Act 1912, which required that every shop should be closed for the serving of customers on the weekly half-holiday. The accused person had affixed to the door of his shop an automatic machine by which a supply of milk was offered to the public on the insertion of a penny in the slot provided for that purpose. The court considered that the language of the relevant section should be construed as a prohibition of the personal serving of customers and that the purpose of the Act was to provide a weekly half-holiday for shop assistants which was not interfered with. The language of the sections under consideration differed materially from that of s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act and the case affords no support for the appellant\u2019s contention, in my opinion. We were also referred to three American cases: the People v. Kaplan[8]; the People v. Welt[9]; and the People v. Andob Corporation[10].\nThe section of the Penal Law considered in these three cases read:\nAll trades, manufactures, agricultural or mechanical employments upon the first day of the week are prohibited, except that when the same are works of necessity they may be performed on that day in their usual and orderly manner, so as not to interfere with the repose and religious liberty of the community.\nIn Kaplan\u2019s case it was decided that to operate a self-service automatic coin laundry on a Sunday violated this section.\nIn Welt\u2019s case the Court arrived at a different conclusion without giving reasons.\nIn the Andob Corporation case, evidence was given by several witnesses that the use of the laundry on Sunday was a necessity for them and not a mere convenience within the meaning of the section and McCullough J. who wrote the judgment of the Court quoted with approval a passage from a judgment of a lower Court in Welt\u2019s case, saying that not all businesses are prohibited on Sunday but only those which are serious interruptions of the Sabbath. It is not clear as to whether this was the ground upon which the judgment proceeded.\nThe language of the section of the Penal Law differs so materially from s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act and the evidence given in the last two is of such a different nature to that in the present matter that I obtain no assistance from them.\nIn Spence v. Ravenscroft[11], the judgment of the majority written by Griffith C.J. appears to have proceeded on the view that the history of the legislation as to Sunday observance in New South Wales indicated that s. 61 of the Police Offences Act 1901 should be construed as importing a personal act or omission of the person charged. Isaacs J. dissented in a carefully reasoned judgment and, with great respect, I agree with the opinion expressed by him. There is nothing in the history of the Lord\u2019s Day Act since it was first enacted in 1906 to justify a conclusion similar to that reached by the majority in Ravenscroft\u2019s case and I think the case has no application.\nThe uncontradicted evidence given before the County Court judge, in my opinion, was sufficient to establish that the businesses carried on by the appellant were those of his ordinary calling and, while the learned County Court judge made no finding as to this, no issue was made of the matter before us.\nIt appears from the reasons for judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal that before that Court it was contended that the operation of the business, so far as the customers were concerned, was a work of necessity and, therefore, came within the exempting provisions of s. 11 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act. The question had not been considered either by the learned magistrate nor by the learned County Court judge and no evidence was adduced as to this at the hearing before the latter. Accordingly, the Court expressed no opinion on the point.\nSection 11 provides an exception in the case of any work of necessity or mercy. If it were intended by the appellant to contend that the operation fell within this exception, the onus was on him to prove it by reason of the provisions of s. 702(2) of the Criminal Code. The appellant, however, elected to call no evidence and there is none in the case for the prosecution upon which a finding such as is suggested could conceivably be made.\nI would dismiss these appeals.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[12] pronounced on October 17, 1960, allowing appeals from orders of His Honour Judge Carscallen and directing that a verdict of guilty be entered against the appellant on each of two charges, that in each case a fine of $10.00 be imposed and that the appellant do pay the costs of the proceedings in the Magistrate\u2019s Court.,\nThe first of these charges was as follows:\nThat on or about the 22nd day of November, 1959, at the City of Sarnia, Lewis E. Gordon, 469 Christina Street, Sarnia. Did unlawfully carry on the business of his ordinary calling, to wit, washing clothes (Automatic Laundry) at 102 East Street in the City of Sarnia, contrary to the Lord\u2019s Day Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, Chapter 171, Section 4.\nThe second charge was in the same words as the first except that the words \u201cat 102 East Street\u2019\u2019 were replaced by the words \u201cat 469 North Christina Street\u201d.\nThe appellant was tried on both charges before His Worship Magistrate Dunlap and was acquitted. The informant appealed to the County Court of the County of Lambton. The appeals were heard separately by way of trials de novo by His Honour Judge Carscallen and were dismissed.\nThe informant served notice of an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against these orders of acquittal on the following ground:\n1. The learned County Court Judge erred in law in the interpretation of the words \u2018to carry on or transact any business of his ordinary calling\u2019 as they appear in Section 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, Chapter 123.\nThe jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is conferred by s. 743 of the Criminal Code which provides inter alia that, with leave of that Court, an appeal may be taken on any ground that involves a question of law alone against a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under s. 727, which was the section pursuant to which the appeals to His Honour Judge Carscallen had been heard.\nUp to a point, the relevant facts are not in dispute; they were summarized as follows by Schroeder J.A. who at the conclusion of the argument delivered orally the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe premises referred to were either owned or controlled by the respondent and they contained automatic washing machines and dryers which customers could operate automatically by inserting a coin in a slot. The soap and bleach used in the cleaning operation were supplied by the customer, but the water and electricity were furnished by the accused, as owner of the establishment.\nThe evidence indicates that on Sunday, November 22nd, 1959, both places were visited by two members of the Sarnia Police force. They found five persons in attendance at 469 North Christina Street and twelve washers and two dryers were in operation. Neither the accused nor any of his servants or agents were present. There was a sign on the wall containing instructions as to how to operate the machines and another sign which read \u2018this store designed and equipped by L. Gordon, 469 North Christina Street, Sarnia\u2019. Over the pay telephone in the premises there was a card bearing the words \u2018Emergency No. call Ed.6-2201. Di.4-0854.\u2019 At the East Street premises there were eight persons present and four dryers in operation. These premises were furnished in a manner similar to the North Christina Street premises and the same information as to operation of the machines was posted on the wall. Here again neither the accused nor his servants or agents or any of them were in attendance.\nThe reasons of the learned Justice of Appeal continue:\nThe learned trial Judge found, on the evidence, that the accused was the sole proprietor of the business in question and that the operation thereof was his ordinary calling.\nThe last quoted statement appears to be inaccurate; while the learned County Judge found that the appellant was the sole proprietor of the business at the two locations mentioned in the charges he made no express finding that the operation of those businesses was the ordinary calling of the appellant and, since he acquitted the appellant on both charges, no such finding can be said to be implicit in his reasons.\nThe appellant applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the following grounds:\n(i) The learned Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the appellant was carrying on or transacting any business of his ordinary calling within the meaning of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, Chapter 123.\n(ii) The learned Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the fact that neither the accused nor his servants or agents were on the premises to take part in or supervise the conduct of the automatic laundry, was irrelevant.\n(iii) The learned Court of Appeal erred in holding on the evidence that the operation of a coin-operated automatic laundry was the ordinary calling carried on by the appellant, the evidence being silent on this question, and erred in believing that the learned County Court Judge has so found.\nLeave was granted by this Court on November 14, 1960; the operative part of the order reads as follows:\nThis Court did Order and Adjudge that leave to Appeal from the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario should be and the same was granted.\nThe main question arising on this appeal is whether on the facts found by the learned County Court Judge, which have been summarized above, he was right in law in holding that the accused was not carrying on the business of his ordinary calling on the date stated within the meaning of those words as used in s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act. That section reads as follows:\n4. It is not lawful for any person on the Lord\u2019s Day except as provided herein, or in any Provincial Act or law now or hereafter in force, to sell or offer for sale or purchase any goods, chattels or other personal property or any real estate or to carry on or transact any business of his ordinary calling or in connection with such calling or for gain to do or employ any other person to do on that day any work, business or labour.\nIn his reasons the learned County Judge, after stating that he had not been referred to and had not found any decided case dealing with the meaning of the phrase \u201ccarry on business\u201d as used in s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act, considered the judgment of Laidlaw J.A. in Re Pszon[13]. In that case it was necessary to consider the meaning of the phrase \u201ccarrying on business\u201d as used in the Bankruptcy Act. Laidlaw J.A., after stating that it involved at least three elements (i) the occupation of time, attention and labour; (ii) the incurring of liabilities to other persons; and, (iii) the purpose of a livelihood or profit, went on to say at page 234:\nA person who devotes no time or attention or labour, by himself or by servants or employees, to the working or conduct of the affairs of an enterprise does not carry on the business of such enterprise.\nHaving quoted from this judgment the learned County Court Judge continued:\nApplying the above to the facts in the instant cases, I cannot find that the accused was carrying on business on Sunday, November 22nd, 1959. He was not, either by himself or by his servants or employees, devoting any time, attention or labour to the business of washing clothes. The very nature of the machines used for that purpose rendered his time, attention or labour unnecessary on that day. He did not give attention or perform labour for the maintenance or furtherance of the undertaking nor devote time to the accomplishment of its objects.\nI agree with the conclusion arrived at by the learned County Court Judge and I am in substantial agreement with his reasons and with those of the learned Magistrate, but in view of the importance of the question raised and the difference of opinion in the courts below and in this Court I propose to state my reasons in my own words. In Willesden Urban Council v. Morgan1[14], the Divisional Court had to consider, inter alia, whether vending milk by means of an automatic machine amounted to carrying on the retail trade or business of a dairyman. The statute there under consideration was the Shops Act, (1912) 2 Geo. V, c. 3, the wording of which differs considerably from that of the Lord\u2019s Day Act but the following observations in the judgments appear to me to be of assistance as indicating the proper approach to the problem of construction.\nAt p. 353, Ridley J. said:\nThe Shops Act, 1912, was passed for the benefit of those who serve as shop assistants; but it is an Act whose provisions are enforced by the infliction of penalties, and we have therefore to be careful how we construe it. We have to be sure that while we give it a fair reading we do not give it too wide a construction. Being intended for the benefit of those serving in shops, the Act is not intended to prevent people buying goods so long as their doing so does not interfere with the object of the Act. I should not assent to any construction of the Act which would prevent shop assistants obtaining their weekly half\u2011holiday; but I do not think that we should so construe it as to make it apply to the supply of articles by automatic machines unless the language of the Act compels us to do so. Sect. 4 is satisfied by reading the words \u2018for the serving of customers\u2019 as meaning \u2018for the personal serving of customers.\u2019\nAt p. 354 Lush J. said:\nThe case is one in which I think it is most necessary to apply that fundamental rule\u2014a rule founded on good sense rather than on law\u2014that where words in a statute are capable of two different meanings we must carefully consider, before determining which of the two meanings to attribute to them, what the mischief is which the Act was intended to obviate.\nI do not think it necessary to review the history of legislation dealing with the observance of the Lord\u2019s Day. This has been recently done in the judgments delivered in this Court in Henry Birks and Sons (Montreal) Ltd. et al. v. City of Montreal et al.[15] and a more extensive review is to be found in Holmsted, The Sunday Law in Canada (1912). I think it safe to say that the origin of this sort of legislation in Christian countries is to be found in Exodus c. 20 verses 8 to 11, where the words of prohibition are \u201cin it thou shalt not do any work\u201d. I agree with the submission of Mr. Ferriss that to come within the words \u201ccarry on business\u201d in s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act there must be some act of a positive nature, the doing of something.\nIn the case at bar the evidence is that on the Sunday in question neither the accused nor any employee of his did anything at all in connection with the laundry business. There is no evidence that either of the telephone numbers listed on the notice in the shops to be called in case of emergency was that of the accused or of any employee of his; but that is of little importance for we do not have to consider what would have been the result if either the accused or an employee had been called and had responded; that did not happen.\nI am in agreement with the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Spence v. Ravenscroft[16]. Griffith C.J. with the concurrence of Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ. says at page 352:\nPrima facie a law creating an offence imports a personal act or omission on the part of a human actor. If the day on which the act is done, or omission is made is material, it imports a personal act or omission on that day. A person may, of course, be responsible for the conduct of his agents. The subject-matter of the law or context of the enactment may require a larger construction. In this case there is no such context. As to subject\u2011matter the history of the legislation as to Sunday observance shows that it is all directed to personal conduct on that day. The provision now in question is one dealing with that subject, and not with trade in general.\nThe reasoning in this passage and particularly the sentence I have italicized appears to me to be applicable to the question now before us. It is hardly necessary to observe that the Lord\u2019s Day Act forbids actions, it does not forbid omissions.\nIn the course of the argument reference was made to a number of cases decided in the courts of the State of New York dealing with the question whether the operation of a self-service automatic coin-operated laundry on Sunday was a breach of s. 2146 of the Penal Law, which provides that all trades, manufactures, agricultural or mechanical employments on the first day of the week are prohibited \u201cexcept that when the same are works of necessity they may be performed on that day in their usual and orderly manner, so as not to interfere with the repose and religious liberty of the comunity\u201d. These decisions disclose a conflict of opinion as to whether a breach of the section is committed when the place in which the coin-operated laundry is located is left open to and used by members of the public on Sunday but neither the owner of the business nor any employee of his is present on that day.\nThat conflict appears to have been finally resolved in the State of New York by the judgment of the Court of Appeals in People v. Welt[17], delivered on July 8, 1960, in which the Court unanimously affirmed a judgment of the County Court of Nassau County reversing a conviction and dismissing the charge. The report is brief but the judgment is discussed by McCullough J. in the case of People v. Andob Corporation[18]. It appears from the last mentioned judgment that in People v. Welt, supra, the Court of Appeals had before it the judgment of the First Appellate Division in People v. Kaplan[19] and that the judgment of the majority in that case must be regarded as over-ruled. In People v. Andob Corporation, supra, the present state of the law in the State of New York is summed up as follows at page 93:\nIt is, therefore, now the law in New York that it is not a violation of s. 2146 of the Penal Law to operate an automatic coin operated laundromat on Sunday where the owner or any employee is not present on such day.\nIt follows from my agreement with Mr. Ferriss\u2019 submission that on its true construction s. 4 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act makes the doing of some act on Sunday an essential ingredient of an offence against the section that I would allow the appeal and it becomes unnecessary to deal with other matters mentioned during the argument; but I do not wish to be understood as agreeing either (i) that it was within the power of the Court of Appeal to make the finding of fact, which the learned County Court Judge did not make, that \u201cthe operation of a coin\u2011operated automatic laundromat and dryers is the business of his ordinary calling carried on by the accused\u201d, or (ii) that it was open to the Court of Appeal to substitute a verdict of guilty for that of acquittal without having reached a conclusion as to the applicability of s. 11 of the Lord\u2019s Day Act to the facts found by the learned County Court Judge. Assuming, contrary to the view which I have expressed, that the appellant did on the Sunday in question, within the meaning of section 4, \u201ccarry on the business of his ordinary calling, to wit, washing clothes (Automatic Laundry)\u201d, the question whether he was thereby doing a work of necessity or mercy within the meaning of s. 11 was put in issue by the plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d. If on the facts as found by the learned County Court Judge it became a question of law whether the conduct which the Court of Appeal regarded as a breach of s. 4 fell within s. 11, the Court of Appeal should have dealt with that question; if on the other hand it was, as the Court of Appeal indicated, a mixed question of fact and law, that Court could not deal with it and should have remitted the cases to the learned County Court Judge. In making this observation I have not overlooked the provisions of s. 702 of the Criminal Code, placing upon the accused the burden of proving that an exception prescribed by law operates in his favour; in the case at bar, the evidence given on behalf of the prosecution proved everything necessary to be known as to the nature of what was done by the accused to enable the appropriate tribunal to determine whether or not it fell within s. 11. Until a finding on that point adverse to the accused has been made by a tribunal having jurisdiction to make it I am unable to see how a verdict of guilty can validly be entered against him. However, I do not pursue these questions further.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgments of the learned County Court Judge.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Garvey, Ferriss & Murphy, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Ontario, Toronto.\n[1] [1960] O.W.N. 537, 128 C.C.C. 348.\n[2] (1960), 204 N.Y.S. 2d. 189.\n[3] (1914), 18 C.L.R. 349.\n[4] [1946] O.R. 229, 2 D.L.R. 507.\n[5] (1960), 32 W.W.R. 262.\n[6] [1946] O.R. 229, 2 D.L.R. 507.\n[7] 2 [1915] 1 KB. 349.\n[8] (1959), 188 N.Y.S. 2d. 673.\n[9] (1960), 204 N.Y.S. 2d. 189.\n[10] (1960), 206 N.Y.S. 2d. 89.\n[11] (1914), 18 C.L.R. 349.\n[12] [1960] O.W.N. 537, 128 C.C.C. 348.\n[13] [1946] O.R. 229, 2 D.L.R. 507.\n[14] [1915] 1 K.B. 349.\n[15] [1955] S.C.R. 799, 113 C.C.C. 135, 5 D.L.R. 321.\n[16] (1914), 18 C.L.R. 349.\n[17] (1960), 204 N.Y.S. 2d. 189.\n[18] (1960), 206 3N.Y.S. 2d. 89.\n[19] (1959), 188 N.Y.S. 2d. 673.\n"}

Both appealed to the County Court on the grounds, inter alia, that (i) the magistrate erroneously convicted the accused of the offence and (ii) the conviction was contrary to law, the evidence and the weight of evidence. The County Court dismissed the appeals on the preliminary objection that no proper grounds were set out in the notice of appeal. The Court of Appeal gave no reasons for its orders dismissing the appeals from these judgments. The accused were granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeals should be allowed, and the cases remitted to the County Court judge to be heard by way of trial de novo.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The grounds set forth in the notice of appeal were sufficient to clothe the County Court with jurisdiction to hear the appeals. Because the appeal under Part XXIV for which provision is made by s. 727 is by way of trial de novo, the grounds do not have to be stated with the same particularity as those required in a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal in appeals from trials of indictable offences. It is enough that such a notice evidences the appellant\u2019s sincerity of purpose in asserting his appeal for the reason that he genuinely believes that he has been wrongly convicted and this excludes grounds which are obviously irrelevant, frivolous or irreconciliable with the plea in the Court below or with the other material before the Court. Under s. 727 the appellant is not to be confined by being required to designate in advance the specific issues to be raised at the second trial.\nPer Fauteux J.: The ground that the \u201cconviction was contrary to law, the evidence and the weight of evidence\u201d met the requirements of s. 722(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. APPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing the appeals from two judgments of the County Court for the County of Peel. Appeals allowed.\nS.J.G. Lane, for the appellants.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014By order of this Court dated January 24, 1961, leave to appeal was granted to these two appellants from two judgments of the Court of Appeal of Ontario dismissing their appeals from the County Court for the County of Peel whereby it was decided that the grounds of appeal set forth in the appellants\u2019 notices of appeal from their respective convictions by different magistrates did not comply with the requirements of s. 722(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. Leave was also granted to file a single factum with respect to both appeals and the appeals were heard together.\nEach of the appellants was convicted for unlawfully driving his automobile carelessly contrary to s. 21(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, and each appealed to the County Court of the County of Peel on the same ground, namely:\n(1) That the magistrate erroneously convicted the appellant of the offence aforesaid;\n(2) That the said conviction was contrary to law, the evidence and the weight of evidence;\n(3) Upon such other grounds as counsel may be permitted to address the Court upon the hearing of the appeal.\nIn both cases preliminary objection was taken by counsel for the respondent before the County Court that no proper grounds were set out in the Notice of Appeal, and in dismissing the appeals for this reason the County Court judge appears to have followed the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in the case of Regina v. Souter[1], as opposed to the decision of that Court in Regina v. Kuusela[2]. After referring to the fact that the Court of Appeal of Ontario had characterized the grounds of appeal set forth in the Kuusela case, supra, as \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d, the learned County Court judge goes on to say:\nThe grounds set out in the case before me fall far short of this bare minimum, in that it simply states that the Magistrate erroneously convicted the Appellant of the offence. It does not refer to any of his findings that would lead to such a conviction and it provides little, if any, difference from the form of Notice set out in the Souter or Gillespie cases, and upon this ground I must dismiss the Appeal.\nThis decision was rendered in the case of Jacobs, but the Hipkin appeal was dismissed for the same reasons. The Court of Appeal gave no reasons for its orders dismissing the appeals from these judgments.\nThe applications for leave to appeal in these cases raise the following questions of law and jurisdiction:\n(1) Was the Court of Appeal for Ontario right in holding that there were not sufficient grounds set forth in the Notice of Appeal before His Honour, Judge R. Stewart Clark, to comply with Section 722 of the Criminal Code?\n(2) Was the Court of Appeal for Ontario right in holding that His Honour, Judge R. Stewart Clark, on appeal, had no jurisdiction to hear the said appeal by way of trial de novo?\nBy virtue of the provisions of s. 3 of the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 379, these are cases to which Part XXIV of the Criminal Code applies, and the appeals to the County Court judge were, therefore, governed by ss. 719 to 739 of the Criminal Code.\nThe right of appeal from the magistrate to the County Court is accorded by s. 720, the relevant portions of which are as follows:\n720. Except where otherwise provided by law,\n(a) the defendant in proceedings under this Part may appeal to the appeal court\n(i) from a conviction or order made against him, or\n(ii) against a sentence passed upon him;\u2026\nThis right is limited only by the necessity of complying with the provisions of s. 722 wherein the requisite notice of appeal is described as:\n722. (a)\u2026 a notice of appeal in writing setting forth\n(i) with reasonable certainty the conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed against, and\n(ii) the grounds of appeal;\u2026 As the setting forth of the grounds of appeal in such a notice forms a part of the foundation upon which the jurisdiction of the County Court rests, it follows that a notice which states no grounds at all cannot form the basis of an appeal, but because the appeal under Part XXIV for which provision is made by s. 727 is by way of trial de novo the grounds do not have to be stated with the same particularity as those required in a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal in appeals from trials of indictable offences.\nIn the vast majority of appeals from trials of indictable offences the Court of Appeal is required to decide the issue before it on the sole basis of the record of the proceedings at a trial which has been concluded before the notice of appeal is prepared, whereas in appeals taken pursuant to s. 727 the trial upon which the Appeal Court must base its decision cannot commence until after the notice of appeal has been filed and served. It follows that in the former cases the errors at the trial which are alleged as grounds for the appeal must be specified in such manner as to inform the respondent of the issues to be met in the Court of Appeal, but in the latter case as the appeal is by way of a new hearing and the Appeal Court is not concerned with specific errors in the conduct of the first trial, the notice of appeal takes on an altogether different character. In my view it is enough that such a notice evidences the appellant\u2019s sincerity of purpose in asserting his appeal for the reason that he genuinely believes that he has been wrongly convicted and this requirement of necessity excludes notices of appeal in which the grounds are obviously irrelevant, frivolous or irreconcilable with the plea in the Court below or with the other material to be kept by the clerk of the Appeal Court with the records of the Court in accordance with s. 726(1). See Regina v. Bamsey[3].\nIn conformity with this view, I am of opinion that the grounds set forth in the present notices of appeal are sufficient to clothe the County Court with jurisdiction to hear these appeals.\nIn the case of Regina v. Souter, supra, the Court of Appeal of Ontario held that the allegation \u201cthat the conviction was contrary to law, the evidence and the weight of evidence\u201d was not a ground of appeal at all within the meaning of s. 722 of the Criminal Code, and in so doing followed the decision of the County Court judge for Victoria County, British Columbia, in Regina v. Gillespie[4]. In the course of rendering the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[5], Porter C.J.O. said of s. 722:\nI think that the section contemplated that grounds sufficiently definite to indicate the issues to be raised on the trial de novo should be set forth in the notice of appeal. Here there were no such grounds given.\nWith the greatest respect, it seems to me to be one of the characteristics of an appeal under s. 727 that many \u201cissues to be raised on the trial de novo\u201d must arise as the evidence develops in the course of that trial and that the appellant is not to be confined by being required to designate in advance the specific issues to be raised at the second trial.\nIn the case of Regina v. Kuusela, supra, which was decided by the Court of Appeal of Ontario after Regina v. Souter, supra, that Court held that the appellant had stated grounds which were \u201csufficient within the meaning of the statute\u201d when he alleged that:\nThe learned magistrate erred on the facts and law in finding that the said William Kuusela drove his motor vehicle while his ability to drive the same was impaired by the use of alcohol.\nIn the course of rendering the decision of the Court of Appeal in this case, Porter C.J.O. said at[6]:\nIt may be that if it were intended to raise any questions such as the admissibility of certain evidence before the Magistrate or any technical matters that the notice should properly set forth such grounds specifically. Here, however, it would appear that the issues would be confined to the question of impairment while driving.\nThis passage, when read in conjunction with the decision in Regina v. Souter, supra, appears to me to indicate that the Court of Appeal of Ontario was of opinion that a \u201cquestion as to the admissibility of certain evidence before the Magistrate\u201d could be an issue at the trial de novo, whereas, with the greatest respect, I take the view that the only evidence upon which the Appeal Court judge can base his decision is the evidence introduced before him either directly or pursuant to s. 727(2), and the fact that evidence may have been wrongly admitted by the magistrate cannot be an issue at the trial de novo because the judge of the Appeal Court has control of what evidence is or is not to be admitted before him. See Regina v. Dennis[7]. No matter how grave or prejudicial the magistrate\u2019s errors may be in taking the evidence at the initial trial, they do not entitle an appellant to a favourable decision in the Appeal Court. Such errors afford good ground for the appellant believing that he was wrongly convicted but they form no part of the material upon which the appeal is to be decided.\nIn my view these considerations make it apparent that the main function of the notice of appeal required by s. 722 is to provide evidence of the appellant\u2019s sincerity of purpose in asserting his appeal rather than to indicate the specific issues to be raised at the second trial although when the appellant is seeking to change his plea or to raise pure questions of law apart from the evidence before the Appeal Court, it is desirable that the notice of appeal should be in such form as to make the respondent aware of the reasons to be urged in support of the change of plea or the nature of the legal points which are to be raised.\nAs I have indicated, I am of opinion that, subject to the limitations above referred to, it is quite legitimate in cases such as the present for the notice of appeal to confine itself to raising the broad issue of whether or not the accused has been wrongly convicted and that sufficient grounds were set forth in the notices of appeal before His Honour, Judge R. Stewart Clark, to comply with s. 722 of the Criminal Code and to clothe the said judge with jurisdiction to hear the said appeals by way of trial de novo.\nI would accordingly allow the appeals, set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal and the County Court judge and remit the cases to the County Court judge to be heard by way of trial de novo.\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014Being of opinion that the notice of appeal, to the County Court of the County of Peel, met the requirements of s. 722(1) (a) of the Criminal Code in setting as a ground of appeal in each case:\nThat the said conviction was contrary to law, the evidence and the weight of evidence I would dispose of the appeals to this Court as proposed by our brother Ritchie.\nAppeals allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Jackson, Van Every, Watson, Gillespie & Lane, Port Credit.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney-General for Ontario, Toronto.\n[1] [1959] O.W.N. 40, 29 C.R. 306, 123 C.C.C. 393.\n[2] [1959] O.W.N. 136, 30 C.R. 130, 123 C.C.C. 401.\n[3] [1960] S.C.R. 294, 32 C.R. 218, 30 W.W.R. 552, 125 C.C.C. 329.\n[4] (1957), 29 C.R. 44, 26 W.W.R. 36, 119 C.C.C. 192.\n[5] 123 C.C.C. 395.\n[6] 123 C.C.C. at 402.\n[7] [1960] S.C.R. 286 at 291, 32 C.R. 210, 30 W.W.R. 545, 125 C.C.C. 321.\n"}

The appellant in an action by petition of right claimed the sum of $17,330 (and interest) as compensation for the land expropriated, to which she alleged she was entitled by virtue of an alleged agreement made between her and the Crown as a result of certain actions taken and statements made by P, who was a solicitor and a Member of Parliament. The petition of right was dismissed.\nIn an action commenced by information the Exchequer Court allowed $11,200 as the compensation to which the appellant was entitled, less $10,080 paid on account, together with interest on the difference between these two sums from the date of giving up possession. The appellant appealed from both judgments. In the proceedings commenced by information the points argued in this Court were the trial Judge's refusal to allow ten per cent for compulsory taking and the question of interest. Held: Both appeals should be dismissed.\nPer Curiam: There was no such agreement as that claimed by the appellant that the Minister had authorized P to secure the services of a valuator and that the Minister and P had agreed that the amounts fixed by the valuator would be accepted by the several owners and by the Government The evidence failed to show any holding out by the Minister of P as an agent. P had no ostensible authority to enter into an agreement on behalf of the Crown.\nThere was no basis for the claim that the appellant should be granted interest on the difference between the value of her land over and above its value as a farm even while she was in possession.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J.: No decision of this Court had established that mere difficulty in arriving at the value to the owner of property expropriated, because of difference of opinion among the experts, would be sufficient to grant an allowance for compulsory taking. The ordinary rule is that the allowance is not to be made and that in order to justify it there must be special circumstances. Here there were no special circumstances.\nPer Locke J.: No support for the proposition that an allowance for compulsory taking is made in circumstances presenting difficulty or uncertainty in appraising values was to be found in any of the reported cases in either the Exchequer Court or this Court. The reason for the allowance of a percentage of the value of the land as part of the compensation was to provide for the expense and inconvenience to the owner in moving elsewhere, the loss of benefits enjoyed by the owner due to the location of the property taken and, where a business is carried on which the owner proposes to continue elsewhere, the loss due to the dislocation of the business, the loss of profit in the interval before it can be established elsewhere, moving costs and other unavoidable expenses. Here it appeared that expenditures necessitated for moving and establishing a home elsewhere had been taken into consideration in estimating the value of the property to the appellant.\nPer Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The problem of allowance for compulsory taking was open for a reconsideration It was possible to find at least three principles followed from time to time in this Court, (i) an allowance as a matter of course, (ii) no allowance where value to the owner had been ascertained and, (iii) an allowance in special circumstances.\nThere was no statutory basis for the allowance and no rule of law requiring it.\nIn fixing the amount of an award there are other factors, other than the market value of the property expropriated, which must be taken into account but which are not easily calculated. In such cases the tribunal of fact may decide that compensation for such factors can best be appraised in the form of a percentage of the market value. This is but a part of the process of determining value to the owner. Once that value has been assessed in accordance with .the rule in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. R., [1951] S.C.R. 504, it represents full compensation and the owner is not entitled to an additional amount for compulsory taking.\nIrving Oil Co. Ltd. v.

Drew from two judgments of the President of the Exchequer Court dated May 19, 1959. One was rendered in an action commenced June 12, 1956, by way of information to have the compensation determined for certain land belonging to Mrs. Drew, which had been expropriated on February 12, 1954, by the filing of a plan and description under s. 9 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106. The other judgment was rendered upon a petition of right filed December 23, 1958, on behalf of Mrs. Drew in which she claimed the sum of $17,330 (and interest) as compensation for the land expropriated to which she alleged she was entitled by virtue of an alleged agreement made between her and the Crown as a result of certain actions taken and statements made by Mr. John Pallett. The two actions were tried together and reasons for judgment were handed down on the same day. The petition of right was dismissed with costs. In the action commenced by information the judgment of the Exchequer Court declared (1) that the lands in question became vested in Her Majesty on February 12, 1954; (2) that the amount of the compensation money to which Mrs. Drew was entitled and all damages resulting from the expropriation were $11,200, less the sum of $10,080 paid on account, together with interest on the difference between these two sums, $1,120 at the rate of five per cent per annum from December 1, 1958, to the date of judgment, May 19, 1959. It was further declared that upon Mrs. Drew giving a valid and sufficient release of all claims she was entitled to be paid the sum of $1,120 with interest as aforesaid. Mrs. Drew was given her costs of the action to be set off against the costs of the petition of right.\nIt will be convenient to deal first with the appeal in connection with the petition of right proceedings. The first point raised by counsel for the appellant relates to the following paragraph in the reasons for judgment of the President:\u2014\"Finally it must be kept in mind that the burden of proof of the alleged agreement lies on the suppliant. In my view of the evidence she has not discharged this burden and I so find\". It is said that this finding is not justified. However, it must be read in conjunction with all of the President's reasons and particularly this immediately succeeding paragraph:\u2014\"And I am unable to find any support for the submission that the Minister clothed Mr. Pallett with authority to make an agreement that would be binding on both parties. He was never an agent of the Government and the Minister never held him out as such\". Mr. Pallett was a solicitor and a Member of Parliament. He was acting as solicitor for Mrs. Drew and on September 14, 1956, his firm filed a defence to the Crown's information of June 12, 1956. A number of properties belonging to various owners had been expropriated, including that of Mrs. Drew, for the purpose of the Malton Airport in Ontario. Some of these owners had accepted the offers of the Government but there were about fifteen who were not satisfied. These latter, including Mrs. Drew, met at the home of Mrs. Murray, another claimant, in June or July 1957. In direct examination Mrs. Drew was asked: \"Was there anyone there on that occasion representing the Government ?\", to which the reply was: \"Yes. We had called in John Pallett as our Member of Parliament\". At the meeting at Mrs. Murray's home Mr. Pallett proposed a plan which Mrs. Drew describes as follows: \"It was that they get an independent evaluator, one that was approved by the Department of Transport and by George Hees, but that we were not told who it was, and we signed an agreement \". (Mr. Hees was Minister of Transport). It is unnecessary to detail all the evidence, oral or written, as to what occurred between Mr. Pallett and Mr. Hees. It is contended that the Minister authorized Mr. Pallett to secure the services of a valuator and that the Minister and Mr. Pallett agreed that the amounts fixed by that person would be accepted by the several owners and by the Government. Reliance was placed upon a document dated October 1957 signed by Mrs. Drew and her husband, but that document is not an agreement, it is merely an offer, and, even if it were more, it does not purport to bind the Crown to pay whatever amounts the valuator should name. After a review of all the evidence and a consideration of the argument advanced by Mr. Brewin I find that there never was any such agreement. Certainly it was not accepted in writing and the record shows that it was not agreed to by the Minister. Even if the President had put the dismissal of the claim, so far as the question of fact is concerned, solely on the ground of onus, I find that the evidence goes much beyond that and that there was no such agreement as claimed.\nThe only other question raised on behalf of the appellant in connection with the petition of right is that in any event the Minister held out Mr. Pallett as an agent, i.e., that Mr. Pallett was clothed with ostensible authority by the Minister to enter into an agreement on behalf of the Crown and that the respondent is bound by an agreement which, it was argued, was made by Mr. Pallett. I agree with the last sentence in the second quotation from the reasons of the President that the evidence fails to show any such holding out. Some of the evidence is referred to by the President, but having considered all of it in the light of Mr. Brewin's submissions I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Pallett had no such ostensible authority. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the various legal points raised by counsel on behalf of the Crown and referred to by the President. The appeal from the judgment as to the petition of right should therefore be dismissed.\nIn the proceedings commenced by information any objection to the allowance of $11,200 as the value of Mrs. Drew's land expropriated was abandoned and only two points were argued. The first is as to the President's refusal to allow ten per cent for compulsory taking. It is unnecessary to consider all the decisions in this Court and in the Exchequer Court dealing with this problem under the Expropriation Act. The allowance was made in Irving Oil Company Ltd. v. The King1. While I was the only one who, with the concurrence of Chief Justice Rinfret, stated that the appellant was entitled to the allowance \"under the circumstances of this case\", undoubtedly it was the view of the majority, if not all, of the members who took part in the judgment that there were special considerations. That is borne out by the fact that Rand J., who had been a Member of the Court in the Irving Oil case, said in Diggon-Hibben Limited v. The King2, with the concurrence of Taschereau J., at p. 713:\nIn the case of Irving Oil Company v. The King it was held that while an allowance of 10 per cent for compulsory taking is not a matter of right, in circumstances presenting difficulty or uncertainty in appraising values, such as were found there, the practice of making that allowance applied. Similar circumstances are present here; in fact in the general character of the two situations there is no difference whatever. For that reason, I think the allowance should be made.\nWhile at p. 719 of the Diggon-Hibben case Estey J. who had also been a Member of the Court in the Irving Oil case, referred to \"the long established practice in the Courts\", he had already remarked at p. 717: \"The decision in Irving Oil Company Ltd. v. The King determines the issues in this case\" and later, at p. 720, after referring to three decisions, he stated: \"There are cases where, having regard to the circumstances, no allowance should be made, but, with great respect, the circumstances in this case do not distinguish it from these cases in which an amount for compulsory taking was allowed\". In The King v. Lavoie, unreported , but referred to in the reasons for judgment of the President in the present case, Taschereau J. delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court said that the allowance should not be made in all cases but only where it is difficult because of uncertainty in fixing the amount of the compensation pensation,\u2014referring to the Irving Oil and Diggon-Hibben cases.\nIt was not laid down in the Lavoie decision or in any other decision of this Court that mere difficulty in arriving at the value to the owner of the property expropriated, because of difference of opinion among the experts, would be sufficient to grant the ten per cent. The fact that the witnesses for the Crown and the witnesses for the owner differ as to the value is not a valid reason. In my view it is now settled that the ordinary rule is that the allowance is not to be made and that in order to justify it there must be special circumstances. Undoubtedly the facts in one case will differ from those in another but it is impossible to lay down the rule in any more express terms. Here there are no special circumstances.\nThe only remaining question to be dealt with is that of interest. It has been noted that Mrs. Drew has been allowed interest on the difference between the value of her land fixed by the President, $11,200 and the sum of $10,080 paid on account, from the date she gave up possession. It is argued that Mrs. Drew should be granted interest on the difference between the value of her land over and above its value as a farm even while she was in possession. There is no basis for any such claim. In examination-in-chief Mrs. Drew was asked the following questions and made the replies indicated:\nQ. I was going to ask you about the improvements on the rest of the property. For what purpose did you use the balance of the property? A. We had about an acre of raspberry canes and an asparagus patch, and we grew our own vegetables. There was about an acre of lawn, flower beds and shrubbery.\nQ. Did you do most of that work yourself, or get anyone else to do that for you\u2014you and your husband? A. We did it ourselves. We did hire a farmer to work the garden land.\nReliance was placed upon the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Re The Queen & Little3. In that case in proceedings under The Public Works Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 30, the Ontario Municipal Board had allowed interest at the rate of five per cent on the difference between the sum fixed by it as the total value and the value of the land as farm lands. Apparently there was no cross-appeal by the respondent before the Court of Appeal on that issue, but in any event, in the present case Mrs. Drew was using the property in the usual manner and there is no reason why she should be entitled, as put in the appellant's factum, to interest \"on the difference between the value of the land as farm land and its total value, including development value, from the date of expropriation\". In coming to his conclusion as to the value as of the date of expropriation the President fixed what he deemed was a proper amount and no objection is now taken to it. The appeal in the proceedings commenced by information should be dismissed.\nIn the result, therefore, both appeals should be dismissed with costs, but counsel fees as of one appeal only should be allowed.\nLocke J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice in these appeals, other than in respect of the claim for an allowance for compulsory taking.\nI have had the advantage of reading the judgment proposed to be given by my brother Judson and, subject to the following comments, I agree with what is said by him regarding claims of this nature.\nThe cases of Irving Oil Co. v. The King4, Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King5, and The King v. Lavoie, decided on December 19, 1950, in this Court and unreported, require, in my opinion, some more extended consideration than has been given to them in previous cases.\nAs the statement by Rand J. in the Diggon-Hibben case, that in circumstances presenting difficulty or uncertainty in appraising values the practice of making the allowance applies, was said by that learned judge to have been decided in the Irving Oil case, I will first consider that decision.\nThe judgment at the trial in the Exchequer Court before O'Connor J. is reported in [1945] Ex. CR. 228. The property expropriated by the Crown was a lot in the City of St. John, N.B., .for which the owner had paid $3,000 and upon which it had erected a building used as a service station at a cost of $3,947.58. Evidence was given that the replacement cost, less depreciation of the building, would be about $5,000 and that the cost of moving the equipment elsewhere would be $120, that it would depreciate in value by reason of the move to the extent of $300 and the cost of reinstalling the equipment elsewhere was estimated at $313. No evidence was given as to the fair market value of the property. The owner alleged that, because of the existing oil regulations, it could not get a permit to erect a new Station elsewhere and claimed as part of its loss its estimated profits for a period of five years. O'Connor J. disallowed the claim for loss of profit and found that the owner was entitled to compensation in the sum of $6,000. No mention is made in the reasons delivered of any claim for compulsory taking and none was allowed.\nThe appeal to this Court was heard by Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson, Rand and Estey JJ. The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin J. was delivered by the latter. He considered that the amount allowed at the trial should be increased to $8,697.88, this amount including a sum of $701.33 for compulsory taking. The amount awarded also included an amount for loss of profit. The amount upon which the ten per cent was computed would appear to have been the estimate of the value of the land and its improvements, and not upon the amount allowed in respect of loss of profit or moving the equipment.\nHudson J., in dealing with this aspect of the matter, said (p. 558):\nI am not satisfied that a thorough examination of circumstances might not reduce this sum substantially but, on such evidence as there is, it would appear to be sufficient to provide a return which would justify a valuation of somewhat over $8,000, if there be included therewith the miscellaneous items such as costs of moving equipment, etc., and special allowance for compulsory taking included by the trial judge in his computation.\nRand J. agreed with the amount of the award, as shown at p. 564 of the report. In giving the details of the award, he included an item of $701.33 for forcible taking and did not refer otherwise to the matter. This was in addition to an amount of $500 which he considered should be allowed as \"Damages through disturbance of business, etc.\"\nEstey J., who agreed in the amount of the award, said that there should be an allowance for compulsory taking, without more, and agreed with the computation of the items of the judgment given in the judgment of Kerwin J.\nAs the above figures indicate, the property expropriated was of a comparatively small value and, unless it can be said that the question as to whether the amount allowed by Rand J. for the disturbance of the business should have been allowed as a loss of profit presented any difficulty, there was nothing in the case to distinguish it from countless other expropriations of small business properties which had been considered by the courts of this country during the previous seventy-five years. As pointed out, nothing was said by any of the members of the Court to the effect that the ten per cent was allowed for compulsory taking, due to \"difficulty or uncertainty in appraising values\", or that there were any special circumstances justifying the allowance.\nIn the Diggon-Hibben case, judgments were written by Rand J. with whom Taschereau J. agreed, by Estey J. and by myself, the Chief Justice agreeing with my reasons. The statement quoted from the judgment of Rand J. was not the judgment of the Court since Estey J., while agreeing that there should be a sum of $10,000 allowed for compulsory taking, did so for different reasons. The Chief Justice and I were of the opinion that, as the reasons for judgment of the President showed that he had made what we considered a full allowance for the value to the owner of the lands and premises taken and a sum of $20,000 to cover the losses attendant on the removal of the old established business operated by the owner in Victoria to other premises in that city\u2014which losses would necessarily result from the temporary dislocation of the business\u2014the award compensated the owner to the full extent to which it was entitled and that, accordingly, no addition to that amount could be justified.\nIn my opinion, it is not clear whether the judgments delivered by the majority of the Court proceeded on the basis that the allowance made for the property and for what may be described as the dislocation of the business were insufficient or whether, contrary to the view of the minority of the Court, it was considered that the percentage might be allowed in addition to the full value to which the owner was entitled. If it were the latter, the result is inconsistent with the unanimous judgment subsequently delivered in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King6. It may be pointed out further that the right of owners of property to compensation from the Crown for properties taken for its use is purely statutory and that there is nothing either in the Expropriation Act of Canada, the Railway Act or any of the other statutes which authorize the expropriation of property which have been considered in this Court, which permit the award of compensation in excess of the value of the property to the owner, as that expression is interpreted in the Woods Manufacturing case at p. 508.\nIn Lavoie's case, the property expropriated by the Crown was situate within the limits of the City of Jonquiere in Quebec. The property in question had not theretofore been used other than for purposes of agriculture but the owner assigned a high value to it as building property and had planned to dispose of it as such and the learned trial judge had valued it on this basis. There was no claim that there was any loss by reason of the dislocation of any business being carried on upon the property, such as occurred in the Irving Oil and Diggon-Hibben cases. The Crown appealed from the award and the owner cross-appealed claiming an additional ten per cent. The reasons for judgment delivered in this Court disallowed the cross-appeal, saying:\nCe montant additionnel de 10 p. cent n'est pas accord\u00e9 dans tous les cas d'expropriation, et ce n'est que dans les causes o\u00f9 il est difficile par suite de certaines incertitudes dans l'appr\u00e9ciation du montant de la compensation, qu'il y a lieu de l'ajouter \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9.\nciting as authority Irving Oil Co. v. The King and Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King. This, with great respect, appears to me to have been error since in neither of the cases referred to had this Court declared the law in these terms. I am further of the opinion that in the circumstances, in the absence of any claim for disturbance or loss through the dislocation of a business or any other activity of the owner, there could have been no basis for such a claim. I wish to add that the passage from this judgment did not purport to declare any new principle, simply referring to decisions which, it was taken, had declared the law in the terms referred to.\nI have considered with care all of the reported cases in the Exchequer Court and in this Court in which the question of an allowance for compulsory taking has been considered and I am unable to discover in any of them any support for the proposition that such an allowance is made in circumstances presenting difficulty or uncertainty in appraising values. An examination of the authorities and the early works on compensation in England following the passing of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845 does not make clear either the reason for the making of such an allowance or the value upon which the percentage is reckoned. I have searched and have been unable to find any cases prior to 1845 where any such allowance was made.\nIn the 2nd edition of Cripps on Compensation published in 1884 it is said at p. 98 that it was customary to add ten per cent to the value of lands taken under compulsory powers, but what value is not stated. In Lloyd on Compensation , 1895, p. 70, dealing with the practice under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act and others of a like nature, the author says that when a leasehold is expropriated, ten per cent for compulsory sale is usually added to the total sum at which the value of the lease is assessed, and the ten per cent was considered sufficient compensation for compulsory sale, in addition to the assessed value of house property. In Browne and Allan on Compensation, 1903, p. 97, it is said that a percentage is regularly\nadded to the market price and this is usually right for the sum to be ascertained is not the market price but the value of the land to the owner.\nIn Dodge v. The King7, Idington J. at p. 156 said that there might be added to the market price a percentage to cover contingencies of many kinds.\nIn more recent years the practice where the allowance is made appears to have been to compute it on the value of the property to the owner, excluding therefrom any allowance made for disturbance, moving costs or loss of profits or business.\nThe principle applicable in determining compensation, stated in the Woods Manufacturing case, was not new. Thirty-four years earlier it had been stated in similar terms by Duff J. (as he then was) in Lake Erie and Northern Ry. Co. v. Brantford Golf and Country Club8. An element very often of great importance to be considered in determining what a prudent man would pay for the property rather than to be ejected from it is the expense and inconvenience of moving elsewhere, the loss of benefits enjoyed by the owner due to the location of the property taken and, where a business is carried on which the owner proposes to continue elsewhere, the loss due to the dislocation of the business , the loss of profit in the interval before it can be established elsewhere, moving costs and other unavoidable expenses. The allowance made in respect of the dislocation of any business carried on and the loss of profit in the interval before it can be established elsewhere is, of necessity, in the nature of unliquidated damages and, except in very rare circumstances, cannot be determined with complete accuracy.\nIn my opinion, and despite the expression of opinions to the contrary by individual judges in some of the decided cases, I think the reason for the allowance of a percentage of the value of the land as part of the compensation was to provide for damage and expense of this nature.\nThere was nothing of this nature to consider in Lavoie's case. Since such an allowance cannot be determined with complete accuracy, I think that, while the method is perhaps not the most desirable way of determining the damages , it is permissible to estimate them as some percentage of the value of the property to the owner, other than that part of it to be attributed to such loss or damage. It was in this manner that the allowance was computed in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King, Frei v. The Queen9, and in Gage-town Lumber Co. Ltd. v. The Queen10.\nThe property expropriated is 4.36 acres in extent upon which there had been built in the year 1948 by the appellant and her husband a one-storey frame house containing five rooms. The expropriation was in the year 1954 but the appellant did not give up possession until December 1, 1958, without payment of any rent in the interval. At that time it was necessary for the appellant to move elsewhere, which, no doubt, necessitated expenditures for moving and establishing a home elsewhere.\nIn my opinion, in estimating the value of the property to the appellant this should properly be taken into consideration and, upon the record, it appears to me that this was done. Various attempts were made on behalf of the Crown to arrive at an amicable settlement of the appellant's claim and, as pointed out by the learned President, the offer of $10,350 made on September 30, 1955, included an amount for forcible taking. This appears to have approximated. $900. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the expenses incidental to moving elsewhere would aggregate any such amount. As the reasons at the trial indicate, the learned President was of the opinion that $10,000 was the full value of the property to the appellant but that, as an offer of $11,200 had been made and had not been withdrawn, the award was in this amount. In these circumstances, there is no ground for any further claim for the forcible dispossession.\nI would dismiss both of these appeals with costs but counsel fees as of one appeal only should, in my opinion, be allowed.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice in these appeals except that I would reject the claim for the allowance of 10 per cent for compulsory taking on different grounds.\nThere appears to be little doubt that Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. R.11, has been regarded as introducing a new principle as a basis for the award of 10 per cent for compulsory taking\u2014\"circumstances presenting difficulty or uncertainty in appraising values\". This is far removed from the principle of the judgment of Fitzpatrick C.J. in R. v. Hunting12, where it was said that it had \"become so thoroughly established a rule from the innumerable cases both here and in England in which it has been awarded almost as a matter of course that I certainly should not be prepared to countenance its being questioned in any ordinary case\". I will postpone examination of the cases to test whether the award ever was a matter of course in the Canadian courts and proceed immediately to an examination of the cases subsequent to Diggon-Hibben to see what has been the effect of the application of a rule based on difficulty or uncertainty in appraising values. Almost immediately in R. v. Lavoie, December 18, 1950 (unreported), the uncertainty rule was restated in slightly different language but the allowance was refused. Since then in all cases in the Supreme Court of Canada the 10 per cent has been allowed with little or no discussion.\nIn Ontario in thirteen reported cases since 1951 the award has been made in every case(a) except two(b). In Quebec in all of the cases reported in the Court of Appeal since 1948 the allowance has been made in every case except in Belle-rose v. Talbot13. In three recent Nova Scotia decisions(c) the allowance has been made at 5 per cent. The Manitoba Court of Appeal in its most recent decision has made the allowance(d).\nWith respect, there appears to be reason to question whether a rule based upon difficulty or uncertainty in valuation is working satisfactorily when it is found that the award is made in nearly every case. This may mean that, notwithstanding the form in which the rule is stated, what is really happening is that the old matter of course rule is being applied. Difficulty and uncertainty can be found in almost every assessment of damages no matter what the cause of action may be. But this affords no logical basis for the addition of 10 per cent, when the tribunal of fact, whether judge, jury or arbitrator, has given full consideration to a claim and made every allowance for the constituent elements that enter into the assessment. The course taken by the decisions may also indicate that the rule is being used as a formula to review an award on a question of quantum. There is also reason to question whether the rule of difficulty or uncertainty followed as a consequence from the decision in Irving Oil Co. v. The King14, and also whether it was even the majority opinion in Diggon-Hibben. Locke J. with Rinfret C.J. concurring said that the 10 per cent, could only be justified as part of the valuation. I take this to mean that it was not to be given as a bonus after value to the owner had been assessed and loss caused by disturbance taken into account. Estey J., while he did say the allowance for compulsory taking was founded on long established practice, also said that it was \"a factor in the compensation separate and apart from what would be included as disturbance allowance\". Long established practice, whether or not it existed in fact, seems to be a reference to the rule enunciated by Fitzpatrick C.J. in Hunting but in the second part of the statement it is difficult to understand the emphasis on the 10 per cent allowance being part of the compensation when at the same time it is distinguished from a disturbance allowance.\nI now return to the statement of Fitzpatrick C.J. that the award had become a matter of course both here and in England. The practice in England came into being as a result of judicial decision subsequent to the enactment of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, although there was nothing in the legislation which authorized the allowance. When the case of Hunting was decided in 1916, the practice had only three years to go in England for it was abolished in 1919. The position is stated briefly in 10 Halsbury, 3rd ed., p. 95, in these words:\nIt became customary under the Lands Clauses Acts to add to the value of the land a further ten per cent as compensation for the taking being compulsory. There has never been express statutory authority for this addition, but statutory recognition of the existence of the custom was given by its prohibition in cases to which the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 (9 & 10 Geo. 5, c. 57), applied. With the subsequent extension of the application of that Act the custom can rarely apply.\nThe question is whether any such practice ever grew up in this country to justify a statement that the allowance was a matter of course based upon long established practice. The matter was never considered in this Court until the year 1906. In the Queen v. Paradis15, which restored the award of the official arbitrators after it had been increased in the Exchequer Court16, there is no mention in either Court of the supposed practice notwithstanding a thorough review in the Exchequer Court of the cases up to 1887. The first mention of the subject in this Court is in Dodge v. R.17, where it was said by Idington J. very briefly \"there may be added as usually is added a percentage to cover contingencies of many kinds\".\nThe next case is R. v. Hunting18, where Fitzpatrick C.J. said that the 10 per cent, had become an established rule not to be questioned in ordinary cases. Idington J. said that the 10 per cent, should be added to the market value. He stated that there was no rule of law rendering it an invariable consequence of compulsory taking but that in the majority of cases it was no more than justice demanded. Duff J. gave no reasons for dismissing the appeal. Anglin J. stated that the 10 per cent allowance was \"independent of and additional to any sum in excess of market value to which the owner may be entitled because of special adaptability of the expropriated premises to his purpose\". This appears to be equivalent to saying that value to the owner is first ascertained and then 10 per cent, is added to that. Brodeur J. would have disallowed the 10 per cent, because the evidence disclosed no evidence to justify its allowance. He adopted the opinion expressed in Cripps on Compensation that it was given to cover various incidental costs and charges and that it was only justifiable as part of the valuation and not as an addition thereto. There is real conflict of opinion here on the principle of the 10 per cent, and I doubt whether any common ratio decidendi can be extracted from the conflict.\nIn Rex v. Hearn19, Idington and Anglin JJ. both approved an allowance of 10 per cent. for compulsory taking.\nIn Rex v. Lariv\u00e9e20, the 10 per cent, allowance made by the arbitrator was disallowed in this Court on the ground that the award was ample and that the 10 per cent, was not to be allowed as of right in all circumstances. In St. Michael's College v. City of Toronto21, fair compensation to the college was discussed in terms which indicate that the judgment clearly had in mind value to the owner of the lands taken and diminution in value of the property retained by reason of the severance. There was no mention of any 10 per cent, allowance in the unanimous judgment of the Court. Similarly, in Canadian Provincial Power Co. Ltd. v. Nova Scotia Power Commission22, where the Court clearly had in mind the principle stated in the Pastoral Finance23 case, there was no mention of any such allowance.\nIt is apparent that prior to Hunting there had been little consideration of this matter in this Court and that in Hunting itself the principles enunciated in the various judgments are shadowy in outline and difficult to reconcile one with another. Hearn and Lariv\u00e9e add nothing to the discussion to be found in Hunting. It does, however, seem significant that in the two cases where the Court clearly had in mind the concept of value to the owner\u2014the St. Michael's College case and the Provincial Power case\u2014 there was no mention of the 10 per cent, and I cannot think that this was an oversight. It is therefore possible to find within the last fifty years that there have been at least three principles followed from time to time in this Court, first, an allowance as a matter of course, second, no allowance where value to the owner has been ascertained and, third, an allowance in special circumstances. It cannot be said that these principles have been satisfactory from the standpoint of logic, definition or application and in my opinion the door is wide open for a reconsideration of the whole problem, particularly when what was obviously the foundation of the rule\u2014and a very insecure one\u2014disappeared in the country of its origin over forty years ago.\nThe allowance of 10 per cent, has not escaped criticism. In Re Watson and City of Toronto24, Meredith C.J.C.P. said :\nIn regard to the adding of any arbitrary amount to any sum fixed by the arbitrator, it is impossible for me to think that any Judge has expressed the opinion that, after full compensation has been allowed, anything in the nature of a bonus addition is to be made to the sum of the full compensation When power to take lands is given, it is usual for some one to contend and urge that something more than full compensation should be paid to the land-owner, whether 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 per cent. : but invariably the Legislature has refused to sanction any such addition or to allow to the land-owner anything but compensation: therefore for the Courts to do so would be legislation, not adjudication, and legislation of a most flagrant character. Even if it could be that any Court should so decree, I cannot see how any juror-arbitrator, having regard for his oath of office, could give effect to it, could do otherwise than obey the statute, and let the Court take the responsibility of giving the bonus addition.\nIn the case upon this point to which the Chief Justice has directed our attention, I find nothing to warrant a contention that anything more than compensation should be awarded. In that case the arbitrator had added 10 per cent, to a sum estimated by him, not, as I understand it, as a bonus, but as part of the compensation, and a part not included in the estimated sum; that is to say, that, having taken into account certain more easily calculated amounts of compensation, for other things not easily calculated and not included in the calculated amount, 10 per cent, was added as a reasonable valuation of these things. In principle that is not wrong: whether right or wrong in that particular case as a matter of fact is unimportant in this case, for in that respect that case has no authoritative effect upon any other.\nIn this case full compensation has been awarded by the arbitrator; and so there could be no justification for adding a farthing to the amount awarded, unless taken off first for the pleasure of adding it again.\nThis is the forerunner of a more sustained criticism in the Exchequer Court. The judgment in The Queen v. The Sisters of Charity of Providence25, contains a complete historical and critical survey of the application of the supposed rule of the allowance for compulsory taking both in England and Canada and I am content to adopt this survey as part of my reasons along with the criticism that there is no statutory basis for the allowance and no rule of law requiring it. With the restatement of the value to the owner rule in Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King26, it seems to me that the anomalies have become more strongly emphasized. The rule is that\n\u2026the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\nIn fixing the amount of an award there are often factors, other than the market value of the property expropriated, which must be taken into account but which are not easily calculated. In such cases the tribunal of fact may decide that compensation for such factors can best be appraised in the form of a percentage of the market value. This is but a part of the process of determining value to the owner. Once that value has been assessed in accordance with the rule in the Woods case it represents full compensation and the owner is not entitled to an additional amount for compulsory taking.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cameron, Weldon, Brewin, McCallum & Shells, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

By leave of this Court the appellant appealed from two orders of the Court of Appeal varying the awards of the arbitrator fixing the amounts of compensation for the lands expropriated. The questions arising for determination in this Court were (1) whether the allowance of ten per cent for compulsory taking allowed by the Court of Appeal, but which had been refused by the arbitrator, should have been made, and (2) whether interest should have been allowed on the awards.\nHeld: The orders of the Court of Appeal should be set aside and the awards of the arbitrator varied.\nPer Curiam: Interest should be allowed and calculated in the case of the Ryan parcel from the date that the respondents became entitled to possession to the date of payment, and in the case of the Arkell parcel, which lands were vacant at the date of expropriation, from the date of registration of a copy of the expropriation resolution to the date of payment. In re Cavanagh and the Canada Atlantic R.W. Co. (1907), 14 O.L.R. 523, referred to.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J.: As pointed out in Drew v. The Queen, ante p. 614 where the question of allowance for compulsory taking under the Expropriation Act was considered, mere differences of opinion among experts, concerning the valuation to be put upon lands, was not a sufficient reason to make the allowance. The ordinary rule is that there is no allowance to be made and that there must be special circumstances to justify it. The same rule applied to the present case under The Schools Administration Act. Here there were no special circumstances.\nPer Locke and Abbott JJ.: In determining the question of what a person in possession would, as a prudent man, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it, there were to be taken into account, as part of the compensation payable, losses and expenses for the dislocation of any business being carried on by the owner of the property at the time of the expropriation, loss of profit, removal expenses and other matters of a like nature justifying the granting of an allowance for compulsory taking. There were no such matters in the present case nor was there any other circumstance entitling the owner to such an allowance. The amount allowed by the arbitrator represented the full value of the lands to the respondent and the statute under which the expropriation was made did not permit the payment of any further or other amount.\nPer Judson J.: The claim for the allowance of ten per cent for compulsory taking should be rejected. Drew v. The Queen, ante p. 614.\nAPPEALS from two orders of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] varying the awards of McDougall C.C.J., fixing the amounts of compensation for lands expropriated. Orders set aside and awards varied.\nK.E. Eaton, for the appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and J.J. Carthy, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014By leave of this Court the City of Ottawa Public School Board appeals from two orders of (the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 varying the awards of His Honour Judge McDougall fixing the amounts of compensation for lands expropriated by the appellant under The Schools Administration Act, 1954 (Ont.), c. 86 and amendments. Under the powers conferred by s. 57 of the Act, the appellant expropriated certain parcels of land for school sites, one known as the Ryan parcel, on March 7, 1957, and the other known as the Arkell parcel, on May 16, 1957. The amounts fixed by Judge McDougall are not in dispute and only two questions arise for determination upon these appeals.\nThe first is as to the allowance of ten per cent for compulsory taking allowed by the Court of Appeal but which had been refused by the arbitrator. Reliance was placed by counsel for the respondent upon the statement in the reasons for judgment of His Honour that \u201cthe prices vary so much it is very hard to get any sense of uniformity in the values shown\u201d, but I take this to mean nothing more than what is referred to by Aylesworth J.A., delivering the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the arbitrator \u201cwas confronted with widely varying opinions, tendered by some four experts, concerning the valuation to be put upon the lands, the basis for such valuations in each case being the value of the lands for development under plans for residential subdivisions. The valuations in some instances as tendered were double those tendered by others\u201d. In the recent appeal to this Court in Drew v. The Queen, ante p. 614, I had occasion to consider the question of this allowance under the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106, and I pointed out that mere differences of opinion among the experts is not a sufficient reason; that the ordinary rule is that there is no allowance to be made and that there must be special circumstances in order to justify it. The same rule applies to the present case under The Schools Administration Act. Particularly in view of the facts that Mr. Campeau agreed to purchase the Ryan parcel on May 11, 1956, and that Campeau Construction Company Limited, agreed to purchase the Arkell parcel in 1955, I can. find no special circumstances and the ten per cent award by the Court of Appeal is disallowed.\nThe second point is as to the question of interest. The respondent Robert Campeau had entered into an agreement of purchase of the Ryan parcel from Mr. Frank Ryan (the latter\u2019s wife joining to bar her dower) and had made substantial payments thereon but was not entitled to possession until February 1, 1959. Mr. and Mrs. Ryan were not appellants before the Court of Appeal and are not parties to this appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed no interest down to February 1, 1959, but did allow interest at the rate of five per cent per annum upon the whole amount of the award from that date until payment. As to the Arkell parcel, the Court of Appeal allowed interest at five per cent per annum from the date of registration in the Registry Office of a copy of the resolution of the Board expropriating the land.\nUnder s. 61 of the Act, where the owner and a board, such as the appellant, are unable to agree on the compensation to be paid to the owner, the amount is to be fixed and determined by the County Court Judge. By s. 62 \u201cthe judge shall determine what interest, if any, shall be paid to the owner\u201d. By s. 59 at any time after a board passes a resolution declaring that any land is required for a school site and that immediate possession thereof is required by it, the board, by leave of the County Court Judge and upon payment into the Supreme Court of a sum sufficient, in the opinion of the County Court Judge, to satisfy the compensation, may enter upon and take possession of the land. No such proceedings were taken and we were not informed as to when possession of either parcel was taken. There is no provision in the Act providing for the registration of the resolutions but a copy of the resolution dealing with the Ryan property was registered in the Registry Office on March 13, 1957, and a copy of the resolution relating to the Arkell property was registered on May 21, 1957.\nSo far as the Ryan property is concerned, it is argued on behalf of the respondent Campeau that since Ryan was in possession at the date of the arbitration and was entitled to remain in possession under his agreement with Campeau until February 1, 1959, it could not be said that Campeau was in the same position as an owner who was permitted to remain in possession without payment of rent but with full use of the expropriated property. Aylesworth J.A. puts the matter thus:\u2014\u201cRyan had remained in possession and had devoted that possession to precisely the same use that those lands were devoted to before expropriation proceedings\u201d. So far as the Arkell property is concerned, apparently nothing was done as to possession up to the time of the hearing of the arbitration, and it is argued on behalf of Campeau Construction Company Limited that in view of the provisions of s. 62 of the Act the Court of Appeal was justified in allowing interest from the date of registration of a copy of the expropriation resolution.\nI agree that interest should be allowed. The result of not doing this is set forth by Riddell J. in In re Cavanagh and the Canada Atlantic R.W. Co.[2], in an expropriation case under the Railway Act of Canada. Ryan was entitled to possession of the Ryan parcel down to February 1, 1959, and, as to the Arkell parcel, the lands were vacant at the date of expropriation. The respondents are therefore entitled to interest from the dates mentioned in the order of the Court of Appeal but, in view of the fact that I have disallowed the ten per cent, such interest will be calculated in the case of the Ryan parcel upon the sum of $40,000 from February 1, 1959, to the date of payment. In the case of the Arkell parcel, interest will be calculated on the sum of $21,630 at the rate of five per cent per annum from May 21, 1957, the date of registration of a copy of the expropriation resolution, to the date of payment.\nThe orders of the Court of Appeal are set aside and the awards of His Honour Judge McDougall are varied in accordance with the foregoing reasons. There will be no costs in this Court or in the Court of Appeal.\nThe judgment of Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The lands expropriated in this matter were some 16 acres in extent and, prior to the taking, had been used for farming purposes only. The learned arbitrator, His Honour Judge McDougall, considered that the most profitable use to which this property could be put by the owner was for residential purposes and awarded compensation on that footing. There is no appeal from the amount of this award.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal has added ten per cent to these amounts for compulsory taking. As to this, I refer to the judgments to be delivered contemporaneously with this judgment in the appeals in Drew v. The Queen, ante p. 614 by my brother Judson and by myself, dealing with the circumstances in which such an allowance may properly be made.\nIn the present matter, no business activity of any nature was being carried on by the owner on the property at the time of the expropriation, so that there was no compensation necessary for the dislocation of any business, for loss of profit, removal expenses or other matters of a like nature justifying the granting of any such allowance. In determining the question of what a person in possession would, as a prudent man, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it, there is to be taken into account as part of the compensation payable losses and expenses of this nature, but there were none in the present case nor any other circumstance entitling the owner to such an allowance. The amount allowed by the arbitrator represented the full value of the lands to the respondent and the statute under which the expropriation was made does not permit the payment of any further or other amount.\nI agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice dealing with the allowance of interest and with the form of the judgment and the order as to costs proposed by him.\nJUDSON J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice in these appeals except that I would reject the claim for the allowance of 10 per cent for compulsory taking for the reasons which I gave in Drew v. The Queen, ante p. 614.\nOrders of the Court of Appeal set aside and awards varied.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Greenberg, Wright & Gorsky, Ottawa.\n[1] [1960] O.W.N. 396.\n[2] (1907), 14 O.L.R. 523 at 531, 6 C.R.C. 395.\n"}

As to the first point the judgment at trial declared that the by-laws in question were invalid. As to the second point it declared that the lands were subject to certain covenants which it was held ran with the land as set forth in the company\u2019s by-laws and that save as aforesaid the said lands were free of the restrictive covenants set out in a deed of the part of the island in question from F (a grantee in fee simple from the company) to the plaintiff, including the by-laws of the company annexed thereto. This judgment having been set aside by the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff appealed to this Court asking that the judgment at trial be restored except in so far as it declared that the lands were subject to the covenant in the relevant part of by-law 19 which read: \u201cOccupation of a dwelling or premises by persons who are not members of the Club shall be only by special permission of the Board of Directors\u201d.\nHeld: Appeal allowed. Judgment at trial restored with modifications.\nPer Curiam: With respect to the first claim, the provisions of the company\u2019s charter governed. As the ground covered by the by-laws in question was already dealt with by the charter, the matter was disposed of. In so far as it extended beyond the terms of the charter, it was problematical if any situation would arise calling for the consideration or use of the by\u2011laws and, therefore, no declaration as to the invalidity of any of them should be made.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J.: As to the second point, in view of the admissions expressed in its statement of defence the defendant was not entitled to argue that the directors had exceeded their powers as defined in the company\u2019s by-laws. The Tasmania, 15 App. Cas. 223; SS. Tordenskjold v. SS. Euphemia (1909), 41 S.C.R. 154; David Spencer Ltd. v. Field, [1939] S.C.R. 36, referred to. By-law 17 authorized the directors to convey the islands by deed subject to the conditions set forth. The defendant admitted that a deed had been given to the intent, i.e., with the intention, that the burden of the covenants should run with the land but not (i) that they did not bind the plaintiff, and (ii) that they were invalid. The lands in question were subject only to the restrictions contained in by-laws 18(a) and (b) and 28, but not those contained in by-law 19.\nPer Curiam: If the plaintiff as assignee of the servient land taking with notice was to be bound by the covenant in by-law 19 certain essential requirements were to be satisfied: (i) the covenant must touch and concern the dominant land, (ii) the club as covenantee must retain land capable of being benefited by the covenant, and (iii) there must be express annexation of the covenant to the dominant land. All three requirements were lacking in this case. Noble and Wolf v. Alley, [1951] S.C.R. 64; Canadian Construction Co. Ltd. v. Beaver Lumber Ltd., [1955] S.C.R. 682, followed; Tulk v.

Wheldrake, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by John S. Galbraith from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing his action against The Madawaska Club Limited, hereinafter referred to as the Company. The claims of the plaintiff were two-fold: (1) on behalf of himself and all other shareholders of the Company for a declaration that those provisions of the by\u2011laws of the Company which purport to restrain the transfer of its shares were void; (2) as one of two joint tenants in fee simple, (the other being his wife) of part of an island in Georgian Bay in Ontario known as No. 122 for a declaration that these lands were not subject to specified restrictions.\nAs to the first point the judgment at the trial declared that the by-laws of the Company nos. 2, 5, 6, 9 and 30 were invalid. As to the second point it declared that the lands were subject to the following covenants which it was held ran with the land as set forth in the Company\u2019s by-laws nos. 18, 19 and 28:\n18. (a) The decision on all matters pertaining to the delimitation and allotment of sites shall rest with the Board of Directors. In all cases of dispute between members as to the limits and boundaries of lots, or the location of buildings, wharves, etc., the Board of Directors shall have full power to make final decision.\n(b) No building or structure shall be erected on any site unless the plan and location thereof shall have been approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may, after due notification, order or cause to be removed any building or structure, which, after December 1, 1904, may be erected without such approval having previously been secured.\n19. (In Part) Occupation of a dwelling or premises by persons who are not members of the Club shall be only by special permission of the Board of Directors.\n28. Not more than one dwelling house shall be erected on any member\u2019s holding, nor shall any building on such holding, allotted to a member, be used for the purpose of keeping boarders or paying guests.\nand that save as aforesaid the said lands were free of the restrictive covenants set out in a deed of the part of island No. 122 in question from Ella R. Firth to the plaintiff, dated January 24, 1947, including the by-laws of the defendant Company annexed thereto. With these exceptions the judgment dismissed the action without costs.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal only with respect to the declaration that the property was subject to that part of by-law 19 set forth above. The defendant cross-appealed on the ground that the restrictions on the transfer of shares were authorized by its letters patent, that the provisions of the by-laws affecting land were binding in equity and that, in any event, the trial judge improperly exercised his discretion in making any declaration. The Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, allowed the defendant\u2019s cross-appeal and, setting aside the judgment at the trial, dismissed the action with costs and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant its costs of the appeal and of the cross-appeal. On the appeal to this Court the plaintiff asks that the judgment at the trial be restored except in so far as it declared that the lands were subject to the covenant in the relevant part of by-law 19. On July 12, 1898, the defendant was incorporated under The Ontario Companies Act, R.S.O. 1897, c. 191, by letters patent containing the following provisions:\nAND WE DIRECT that the right to acquire and hold shares in the said Club shall be limited to the persons mentioned in this Our Charter and to any Graduate or Under\u2011Graduate of the University of Toronto or of the School of Practical Science or any official connected with either the said The University of Toronto or the said The School of Practical Science.\nAND WE FURTHER DIRECT that the capital stock of the Club shall be deemed to be incapable of being assigned or transferred to any body corporate whatever or to any individual (other than those specified in this Our Charter) who is not a graduate or under-graduate of the said The University of Toronto or of the said The School of Practical Science or who is not an official connected with either the said The University of Toronto or the said The School of Practical Science AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE all other persons from the right to acquire and hold a share or shares in the said Club.\nThe Company was incorporated \u201cfor the purpose and objects following that is to say (a) SUBJECT to the provisions of the laws respecting the protection of Fish and Game TO protect preserve and propagate fish and game and to pursue hunt capture and take the same in over and upon the lands waters and property of the Club and (b) TO conduct experimental work in Forestry Biology and other branches of Natural Science.\u201d The share capital was $2,000 divided into eighty shares of $25 each. We are not concerned with designated free grant lands mentioned in the letters patent as about to be acquired by the Company from the Province of Ontario. Under various Ontario statutes the Company had power to acquire by purchase and to hold and sell other lands and on October 12, 1911, the Department of Indian Affairs of Canada granted to the Company a number of islands in Georgian Bay, of which No. 122 is one. The Company still owns a number of these islands or parts thereof.\nWhile the plaintiff applied for membership in the Company on November 21, 1952, his testimony shows that nothing occurred as a result thereof and Exhibit-1 is Share Certificate No. 288 in his name for two fully-paid-up shares in the Company and dated as recently as November 29, 1952. There is in the record a certificate for two fully-paid-up shares of the Company of $25 each in the name of Ella R. Firth, dated January 18, 1947, on the back of which certificate is an assignment by her to the plaintiff dated January 24, 1947. A witness for the respondent testified that it was on the basis of this assignment that the plaintiff became a shareholder and the plaintiff gave evidence that he became a shareholder only about the time of the conveyance to him by Ella R. Firth of January 24, 1947, of part of island No. 122.\nOn October 17, 1945, the Company conveyed the said part of island No. 122 to Ella R. Firth, her heirs and assigns for her sole and their sole and only use forever\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nSubject nevertheless to the reservations, limitations, provisos and conditions expressed in the original grant thereof from the Crown; To the intent that the burden of these covenants may run with the lands aforesaid during the Corporate existence of The Madawaska Club, Limited, the said Grantee for herself, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, DOTH COVENANT AND AGREE WITH THE said Grantor its successors and assigns as follows: that she the said Grantee, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns\n(a) Will not or will any of them transfer said land by Deed of Ownership or any similar agreement to any person not a member of the Club, and that any such sale, lease or transfer to any person not a member of the Club, or attempted alienation of the said land to take it out of the control of the by-laws of the Club shall be null and void;\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n(d) Will observe and carry out the by-laws of The Madawaska Club, Limited, annexed hereto marked \u201cA\u201d and will hold the said land subject to the terms herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions imposed upon the said land by the said by-laws.\nThe deed signed by the grantee contained a covenant on her part to observe the Company\u2019s by-laws, a copy of which was annexed to and made part of the deed. Ella R. Firth conveyed the same lands to the plaintiff by grant dated January 24, 1947, the same date that she assigned the two shares to him. The plaintiff signed the conveyance, covenanted with the grantor in the same terms set forth above in the conveyance to her and also covenanted with the grantor to observe and carry out the by-laws of the Company, a copy of which was annexed to and made part of the document. On February 21, 1951, the plaintiff conveyed the lands to himself and his wife as joint tenants,\u2014the deed containing none of the covenants included in the conveyance to Ella R. Firth or in that from her to the plaintiff.\nAs to the first claim of the plaintiff in this appeal the provisions of the Charter govern. It is argued on his behalf that ss. 17 and 39 of The Corporations Act, 1953 (Ont.), c. 19, are applicable. These sections are in Part II of the Act and by s. 17 that Part applies \u201c(c) to every company incorporated by or under a general or special Act of the Legislature\u201d,\u2014which includes the defendant Company. By subs. (2) of s. 39, \u201csubject to subs. (3) (which is not relevant) no by-law shall be passed that in any way restricts the right of a holder of fully-paid shares to transfer them but by-laws may be passed regulating the method of transfer thereof\u201d. Section 39(2) was in substance first enacted in 1912 by 2 Geo. V, c. 31, s. 54(2), which was subsequent to the date of the Company\u2019s Charter. This subs. (2) looks to the future and in any event the provisions of the Charter are explicit.\nThe trial judge held by-laws 2, 5, 6, 9 and 30 to be invalid. These read:\n2. The membership shall be limited to 120, and shall consist of charter members, and of graduates and undergraduates of the University of Toronto or of the School of Practical Science, and of any officials connected therewith.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n5. Election of new members shall take place at the annual meeting only. All applications for membership shall be made in writing to the Board of Directors at least three weeks before the annual meeting, on a form to be approved by the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors shall cause the names of such applicants as are eligible under the charter to be inserted in the notice calling the annual meeting.\n6. The election of new members shall be by ballot, each member present in person or by proxy being entitled to cast one vote, and any applicant receiving six adverse votes shall be rejected.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n9. No member shall at any time hold more than ten shares of the capital stock of the Club.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n30. An undivided holding and the shares attached may be devised and bequeathed by will to a single devisee and legatee, provided that the devisee or legatee is eligible for membership under the By-laws; and the said devisee or legatee shall become a member of the Madawaska Club without election, by submitting proper documentary proof of the devise or legacy to the Board of Directors, and shall be entitled to acquire possession of the property so devised or bequeathed on paying the entrance fee required from new members; and shall thereafter hold said property subject to the terms of the By-laws of the Club.\nAccording to Exhibit-3 all of these, except 30, were \u201cadopted May 18, 1932, as amended, 194?\u201d However, Exhibit-21 shows that the by-laws were first passed December 12, 1904, that is prior to s. 54(2) of 2 Geo. V, c. 31, including the first four of those mentioned (with a slight variation as to 6). In so far as the ground covered by these by-laws is already dealt with by the Charter, the matter is disposed of and this includes by-law 30 as the Charter directs \u201cthat the right to acquire and hold shares in the said Club shall be limited to the persons mentioned in this Our Charter and to any Graduate or Under-Graduate of the University of Toronto or of the School of Practical Science or any official connected with either the said The University of Toronto or the said The School of Practical Science\u201d. In so far as it extends beyond the terms of the Charter, I agree with the Court of Appeal that it is problematical if any situation will arise calling for the consideration or use of the by-laws and that, therefore, no declaration as to the invalidity of any of them should be made.\nIn connection with the second point it should first be stated that the circumstance that Mrs. Firth or her representatives were not parties was never alluded to even when counsel were asked to argue certain additional points before the Court of Appeal, but, in any event, it cannot affect the matter as it does not appear that she or they have any interest in any other part of island No. 122 or any part of any other island in Georgian Bay. Next, it should be noted that irrespective of the date when the plaintiff actually became a shareholder, he is, under The Registry Act of Ontario, charged with notice of the covenants including those in the by-laws which appear in and are attached to the deed from the Company to Ella R. Firth and that, furthermore, he signed the deed from her to him even though \u201cunder protest\u201d. It is now necessary to examine the pleadings. Paragraphs 7A and 7B of the amended statement of claim were as follows:\n7A. By deed of grant dated October 17th, 1945, and registered in the Registry Office at Bracebridge, Ontario, for the Registry Division of Muskoka as number 393 for the Township of Gibson, the Defendant granted to Ella R. Firth, widow, that part of island number 122 in the Georgian Bay hereinafter more particularly described.\n7B. By the said deed of grant the said Ella. R. Firth for herself, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, to the intent that the burden of the covenants hereinafter referred to might run with the lands, covenanted as follows:\n(a) That she would not nor would any of them transfer the said lands to any person not a member of the Club and that any such sale, lease or transfer to any person not a member of the Club or attempted alienation of the said lands to take it out of the control of the By-Laws of the Club shall be null and void. (b) That she would continue to be liable for and will pay all taxes, dues and charges imposed upon her as holder of the said land under the By-Laws of the Club dealing with the holding of sites which are in force at the time of the purchase of the said property save only that the payments under By-Law 15, Section (b) subsection (1) shall cease from this date and that the regular payments of all annual dues, taxes and charges save as aforesaid shall be a condition of the transfer and sale of the said lands.\n(c) That she would pay her due share of all Municipal and Parliamentary or other taxes, which may at any time be levied upon the property owned or leased by the Club, such share to be determined by resolution of a general meeting of the shareholders.\n(d) That she would observe and carry out the By-Laws of The Madawaska Club Limited annexed to the said deed of grant and would hold the said land subject to the terms therein contained and subject to the terms and conditions imposed upon the said lands by the said By-Laws.\nThese paragraphs are expressly admitted by para. 1 of the statement of defence. This was a trial and not a motion as in Noble and Wolf v. Alley[2]; the rule expressed in The Tasmania[3],SS. Tordenskjold v. SS. Euphemia[4] and David Spencer Limited v. Field[5], applies and the Company was not entitled to argue in the Court of Appeal and may not argue in this Court that the directors exceeded their powers as defined by the Company\u2019s by-laws. The Chief Justice of Ontario refers to a number of by-laws which, in his view, demonstrated that the directors had no power under the by-laws to grant land acquired from the Indian Department in fee simple, but he does not in my view give sufficient weight to by-law 17 which provides, as well in the by-laws adopted December 12, 1904, as in the by-laws adopted May 18, 1932, as amended, (the underlining has been added):\n17. Any member to whom a site has or shall have been allotted and who desires to own the said site instead of leasing it from the Club, may do so, subject (in the case of sites upon the mainland) to the provisions of the charter and patent granted by the Ontario Government, and (in the case of sites upon the islands) to the provisions of the agreement with the Dominion Government; and such ownership shall be further subject to the following conditions:\n(1) Such member shall pay to the Treasurer of the Club the amount at which the Dominion Government values the land in question, or (in the case of sites upon the mainland) the amount of $2 per acre. He shall also pay all the costs, charges and expenses of the transfer of the said property. (2) Such member shall continue to be liable to all dues, taxes and charges imposed upon the holders and lessees of sites by the by-laws dealing with the holding of sites which may be in force at the time he purchases the said property; save only that the payments under By-law 15, section (b), sub-sections (1) and (2) shall cease from the time of such purchase. The regular payment of all such annual dues,; taxes and charges shall be a condition of the transfer and sale of the property in question, and shall be so expressed in the deed; and the said purchaser shall execute the deed in the terms of the said conditions, and the covenant containing such conditions shall run with the land.\n(3) It shall also be stipulated and provided in the deed as a condition of the transfer of said property, that it shall not subsequently be transferred by deed of ownership or lease, or any similar agreement to any person not a member of the Club, and that any such sale, lease, transfer or alienation of the property in question as shall take it out of the control of the by-laws of the Club, shall be null and void.\nThe by-law therefore authorizes the directors to convey the islands by deed subject to the conditions set forth. The defendant admitted that a deed had been given to the intent, i.e., with the intention, that the burden of the covenants should run with the land but not (1) that they did not bind the plaintiff, and (2) that they were invalid.\nIn this Court the main argument was in connection with part of by-law 19 which, for convenience, is again reproduced:\n19. Occupation of a dwelling or premises by persons who are not members of the Club shall be only by special permission of the Board of Directors,\nas counsel for the plaintiff admitted that the trial judgment was correct in holding that by-laws 18(a) and (b) and 19 ran with the land. However by the wide terms of that judgment, it was declared that, with the exceptions mentioned, the lands were free not only of the restrictive covenants set out in the deed from Ella R. Firth to the plaintiff but also free of all restrictive covenants in the Company\u2019s by-laws and the plaintiff asks for the restoration of the trial judgment except as to by-law 19. The by-laws were not referred to before us in detail but a careful examination of them in order to ascertain which ones except 19 might have any relation to the matter under discussion indicates that only 17, 21, 22, 24 and 30 need be considered, all of which are referred to by Chief Justice Porter except 24. These read as follows:\n17. Any member to whom a site has or shall have been allotted and who desires to own the said site instead of leasing it from the Club, may-do so, subject (in the case of sites upon the mainland) to the provisions of the charter and patent granted by the Ontario Government, and (in the case of sites upon the islands) to the provisions of the agreement with the Dominion Government; and such ownership shall be further subject to the following conditions:\n(1) Such member shall pay to the Treasurer of the Club the amount at which the Dominion Government values the land in question, or (in the case of sites upon the mainland) the amount of $2 per acre. He shall also pay all the costs, charges and expenses of the transfer of the said property.\n(2) Such member shall continue to be liable to all dues, taxes and charges imposed upon the holders and lessees of sites by the by-laws dealing with the holding of sites which may be in force at the time he purchases the said property; save only that the payments under By-law 15, section (b), subsections (1) and (2) shall cease from the time of such purchase. The regular payment of all such annual dues, taxes and charges shall be a condition of the transfer and sale of the property in question, and shall be so expressed in the deed; and the said purchaser shall execute the deed in the terms of the said conditions, and the covenant containing such conditions shall run with the land.\n(3) It shall also be stipulated and provided in the deed as a condition of the transfer of said property, that it shall not subsequently be transferred by deed of ownership or lease, or any similar agreement to any person not a member of the Club, and that any such sale, lease, transfer or alienation of the property in question as shall take it out of the control of the by-laws of the Club, shall be null and void.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n21. In the. case of the death of any member of the Club holding a site by lease or purchase according to the by-laws, then, upon the regular annual payment of all dues, taxes and charges prescribed for such member by the by-laws, his immediate family may continue to occupy the premises formerly held by the deceased, for a period of two years, and thereafter from year to year, upon the annual permission of the Board of Directors. During the period of occupancy the legal representative of the estate of the deceased member may dispose of the said member\u2019s interest in the said premises to any member of the Club, subject to the by-laws of the Club.\n22. (a) In case the premises formerly held by a deceased member are not disposed of as provided in By-law 21, then upon six months\u2019 notice being given in writing, either by the legal representative of the estate of the deceased member, or by the Board of Directors, of the discontinuance of occupancy, an allowance may be made to the estate of the deceased for the interest in the site held by the deceased, for such buildings as may have been on the said site at the date of the passing of this by-law, and such buildings as may thereafter be erected thereon by permission of the Board of Directors, and for such improvements as may have been made on the said site. (b) The amount of such compensation shall be determined conjointly by a representative of the estate and a representative chosen by the Board of Directors from among themselves; in case of non-agreement between these two arbitrators, a third arbitrator shall be chosen by the aforesaid arbitrators, and the Board of Arbitration so constituted shall finally determine the amount of compensation to be allowed.\n(c) The Board of Directors may elect to take over the interests of the deceased member at the valuation fixed by the said Board of Arbitration, and if they fail to make such election within six months after the decision of the Board of Arbitration has been received by the Board of Directors, the legal representative of the estate of the deceased member may dispose of the said member\u2019s interest in the said site, and the buildings and improvements upon the said site, to any person whomsoever, subject to the conditions under which the Club holds the land in question from the Ontario or Dominion Government; and subject also to the terms under which the deceased member held the site in question, with such modifications or alterations as may be approved by the Board of Directors; and such person shall execute the assignment of the lease, or deed, as the case may be, and covenant with the Club to observe and perform all the terms, covenants and conditions therein contained, with such modifications or alterations as may have been approved by the Board of Directors.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n24. The use of fire-arms shall be prohibited from the first day of June to the thirty-first day of August, inclusive, except by special permission of the Board of Directors; and the use of rifles shall be prohibited at all times.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n30. An undivided holding and the shares attached may be devised and bequeathed by will to a single devisee and legatee, provided that the devisee or legatee is eligible for membership under the By-laws; and the said devisee or legatee shall become a member of the Madawaska Club without election, by submitting proper documentary proof of the devise or legacy to the Board of Directors, and shall be entitled to acquire possession of the property so devised or bequeathed on paying the entrance fee required from new members; and shall thereafter hold said property subject to the terms of the By-laws of the Club.\nI agree with Judson J. that for the reasons given by him the lands in question of the plaintiff John S. Galbraith are subject only to the restrictions contained in by-laws 18(a) and (b) and 28, but not to those contained in by-law 19.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside. The judgment at the trial should be restored except that Paragraph 1 should be amended by striking out the declaration that the lands of the plaintiff John S. Galbraith are bound by by-law 19 and by striking out Paragraph 2 thereof. The order as to costs at the trial should stand; there should be no costs in the Court of Appeal, but the appellant should have one-half of his costs in this Court. The judgment of Taschereau, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice on the first branch of the case that the appellant fails in his claim for a declaration concerning the restrictions on the transfer of shares. I also agree that the appellant and his wife are joint tenants in fee simple of the land and not licensees as the Court of Appeal held. In my opinion the result of this litigation is that the plaintiff is bound only by the restrictions contained in by-laws 18(a) and (b) and 28 but not by by-law 19 and to this extent I would modify the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAfter a trial in which he was largely successful, Galbraith appealed to the Court of Appeal on one point only\u2014whether he was bound by by-law 19. He was, of course, a purchaser with notice. By-law 19, so far as it is applicable, reads:\nOccupation of a dwelling or premises by persons who are not members of the Club shall only be by special permission of the Board of Directors.\nThe Club cross-appealed on all points. The Court of Appeal held, as a result of a point raised before them for the first time in the litigation, that Galbraith was a licensee of the land and not an owner in fee simple and consequently subject to all the restrictions. On appeal to this Court, he seeks to have the judgment at trial restored with the above mentioned modification as to not being bound by the restrictive covenant contained in by-law 19. He has never appealed against the declaration that he is bound by by-laws 18(a) and (b) and 28.\nThe chain of title in this case is short. The Club acquired the fee simple to the land in question by grant from the Dominion of Canada. I mention this because other club lands were acquired by grant from the Province of Ontario. The provincial grant contains special conditions limiting the persons who may become interested in the lands and nothing that I say in these reasons has any application to the lands contained in the provincial grant. In 1945 the Club granted in fee simple to Ella R. Firth part of island 122. The grantee covenanted in the following terms:\nto the intent that the burden of these covenants may run with the lands aforesaid during the Corporate existence of The Madawaska Club Limited, the said Grantee for herself, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, DOTH COVENANT AND AGREE with the said Grantor its successors and assigns as follows: that she the said Grantee, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns\n(a) Will not nor will any of them transfer said land by Deed of Ownership or any similar agreement to any person not a member of the Club, and that any such sale, lease or transfer to any person not a member of the Club, or attempted alienation of the said land to take it out of the control of the by-laws of the Club shall be null and void;\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n(d) Will observe and carry out the by-laws of The Madawaska Club Limited, annexed hereto marked \u201cA\u201d and will hold the said land subject to the terms herein contained and subject to the terms and conditions imposed upon the said land by the said by-laws.\nBy-law 19, which was the main subject-matter of argument on this branch of the appeal, is thus introduced by way of covenant (d) contained in the deed.\nIn 1947 Mrs. Firth conveyed in fee to Galbraith and took from him the same covenants. In 1951 Galbraith conveyed to himself and his wife as joint tenants and this deed did not contain the covenants. Thus, notwithstanding the fact that the action is one brought by Galbraith for a declaratory judgment, the dispute is really one between the Club as the original covenantee and a subsequent purchaser of the restricted land who takes with notice but claims to be free of the covenant.\nIf Galbraith, as assignee of the servient land taking with notice, is to be bound by this covenant, certain essential requirements must be satisfied. I will take it that the covenant is negative in substance, if not form, for the negative implication is very clear. The requirements are that this covenant must touch and concern the dominant land, that the Club as covenantee must retain land capable of being benefited by the covenant and that there must be express annexation of the covenant to the dominant land. In my opinion all three requirements are lacking in this case.\nThe juridical basis for the enforcement of these covenants has undergone a marked change since Tulk v. Moxhay[6]. The doctrine of notice was the decisive factor in that case. The presently developed theory of enforceability is that expressed by Rand J. in Noble and Wolf v. Alley[7]:\nCovenants enforceable under the rule of Tulk v. Moxhay (1848) 11 Beav. 571; 50 E.R. 937, are properly conceived as running with the land in equity and, by reason of their enforceability, as constituting an equitable servitude or burden on the servient land. The essence of such an incident is that it should touch or concern the land as contradistinguished from a collateral effect. In that sense, it is a relation between parcels, annexed to them and, subject to the equitable rule of notice, passing with them both as to benefit and burden in transmissions by operation of law as well as by act of the parties.\nAssuming for the moment that there has been an annexation of this covenant to some land of the Club capable of being benefited at the time of the conveyance to Mrs. Firth, does this covenant relating to occupation of the servient land touch or concern the dominant land for it is that land which must be \u201ctouched or concerned\u201d (Rogers v. Hosegood[8])? There is no privity of contract between Galbraith, as owner of the restricted land, and the Club. The Club has parted with the fee simple. If the Club is to enforce the covenant against Galbraith, it must be done for the benefit of land retained by the Club at the date of the covenant. It is this protected land which must be touched and concerned by the covenant, within the classic definition of Farwell J. in Rogers v. Hosegood, supra, p. 395:\nThe covenant must either affect the land as regards mode of occupation or it must be such as per se, and not merely from collateral circumstances, affects the value of the land.\nThe covenant in question here gives the Club the right to choose the persons who shall occupy the servient land, if the owner wishes to go outside the club membership. This has nothing to do with the use to which the land may be put, but relates only to the kind of person who may be given occupation. It is imposed by the vendor for its own benefit as a club. It does not touch or concern the land, as being imposed for the benefit of or to enhance the value of land retained by the Club. It calls into being the exercise of an unfettered personal discretion by the club management and its plain purpose is to preserve the amenities of the Club. That such a covenant does not touch or concern the dominant land is concluded in this Court by the decision in Noble and Wolf v. Alley, supra. The covenant in that case covered occupation as well as alienation in the following terms:\nThe lands and premises herein described shall never be sold, assigned, transferred, lease, rented or in any manner whatsoever alienated to, and shall never be occupied or used in any manner whatsoever by any person of the Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood, it being the intention and purpose of the Grantor, to restrict the ownership, use, occupation and enjoyment of the said recreational development, including the lands and premises herein described, to persons of the white or Caucasian race not excluded by this clause.\nIt was held that this was not a covenant touching or concerning the land and I can see no possible ground for any distinction between a covenant restricting alienation and one restricting occupation.\nThere is nothing in the conveyance from the Club to Mrs. Firth which attempts to annex the benefit of the covenant to any land retained by the Club. Further, there is no evidence anywhere in the record to indicate whether the Club had any such land capable of being benefited. The grantee simply covenants for herself, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, with the grantor, its successors and assigns, to the intent that the burden of the covenants should run with the lands during the corporate existence of the Club but nothing is said about any other lands. This fails to meet what I think must be regarded as the minimum requirements that the deed itself must so define the land to be benefited as to make it easily ascertainable (Zetland v. Driver[9]).\nThere was exactly the same situation in Canadian Construction Company Limited v. Beaver Lumber Limited[10]. In that case Beaver Lumber was the owner of two parcels of land, A and B. It conveyed parcel A in 1944 and took a covenant that the grantee would not, for a period of 25 years, carry on a lumber business on the lands. The lands eventually came into the hands of Canadian Construction Company with notice of the covenant. There was nothing in the agreement containing the covenant which annexed its benefit to parcel B on which Beaver Lumber Limited was carrying on a lumber business. The inference drawn by the learned trial judge was that the covenant was intended by the parties to be personal to the covenantee and not for the benefit of parcel B. The Court of Appeal reversed the finding of the trial judge but the judgment at trial was restored in this Court. The majority of the Court did not find it necessary to consider the extent of the admissibility of evidence of surrounding circumstances, for the purpose of indicating the existence or situation of other land of the covenantee intended to be benefited. However, the plain implication in the judgment of this Court in affirming the trial judgment was that a restrictive covenant contained in an agreement which omits all reference to any dominant land, although it sets out the restrictions placed upon the servient land, is unenforceable by the covenantee against a successor in title of the covenantor, since such an agreement expresses no intention that any other lands should be benefited by the covenant. A covenant running with the land cannot be created in this manner and in the absence of any attempted annexation of the benefit to some particular land of the covenantee, the covenant is personal and collateral to the conveyance as being for the benefit of the covenantee alone.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal which dismissed the action with costs. I would restore the judgment at trial with these modifications:\n(a) Paragraph 1 should be amended by striking out the declaration that the plaintiff is bound by by-law 19;\n(b) Paragraph 2, declaring by-laws 2, 5, 6, 9 and 30 to be invalid insofar as they restrict or purport to restrict the transfer of shares, should be struck out.\nThe order as to costs at trial should stand. As success was divided in the Court of Appeal there should be no order as to costs. In this Court I would allow the appellant one-half his costs. For him an appeal was necessary to establish that he was an owner in fee simple and that he was not bound by by-law 19. On these points he succeeded. He failed on the issue relating to the shares.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Johnston, Sheard & Johnston, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Day, Wilson, Kelly, Martin & Campbell, Toronto.\n[1] (1960), 23 D.L.R.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1961: May 30; 1961: June 26.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Martland JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nPhysicians and surgeons\u2014Municipal clinic\u2014Damages\u2014Negligence\u2014Doctor giving injection to child\u2014Broken needle\u2014Child's arm paralysed for a time and permanently scarred\u2014Standard of care\u2014Burden of proof\u2014 Liability of doctor and municipality\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1053, 1054.\nThe plaintiff's son, who was 5\u00bd years old, was taken to the City Health Clinic to be vaccinated. As he became frightened after the first vaccination, the mother asked the doctor not to proceed with the second vaccination, which was to be given by means of a hypodermic needle. The doctor nevertheless proceeded to vaccinate the boy. The child resisted and despite the fact that he was held, he suddenly jerked his arm and the needle broke inside his arm. The broken fragment of steel could not be removed and the arm was paralysed for some time. Three operations to remove the fragment were unsuccessful, leaving permanent scars on the boy's arm. The City and the doctor were held jointly and severally liable by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nIt is true that doctors could not be held liable for unforseeable accidents, but where it is shown that the patient's injury was due to the doctor's failure to exercise the required degree of care, the burden of proving that the injury was brought on by some unforseen cause, shifts to the doctor. In the present case, it is not the movement of the arm, as claimed by the doctor, that cause the accident. The doctor knew that the boy was nervous and should not have vaccinated him at that time. Having decided to proceed, the doctor was negligent when he failed to take the necessary precaution of having the boy's arm completely immobilized. The scars were the direct result of this negligence.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Ferland J. Appeal allowed.\nJean Goulet, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nPhilippe Beauregard, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Taschereau J.:\u2014Il s'agit dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d'un appel d'un jugement rendu par la Cour du banc de la reine2, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, qui a infirm\u00e9 un arr\u00eat de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et rejet\u00e9 l'action du demandeur es-qual. avec d\u00e9pens.\nDans le cours du mois d'ao\u00fbt 1955, madame L\u00e9on Cardin, l'\u00e9pouse du demandeur es-qual., conduisit son jeune fils Caroll, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 5\u00bd ans, \u00e0 la clinique du Service de Sant\u00e9 de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, afin de lui faire administrer par \u00e9gratignures un vaccin dit de rappel. Apr\u00e8s avoir administr\u00e9 ce premier vaccin, le Dr Huard, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la clinique de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, jugea \u00e0 propos de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'injection d'un autre vaccin avec une aiguille hypodermique. Il arriva que cette aiguille se brisa dans le bras du jeune enfant, avec le r\u00e9sultat que durant plusieurs mois, il eut le bras droit paralys\u00e9 et que les interventions chirurgicales infructueuses qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9es ont laiss\u00e9 sur le bras des cicatrices disgracieuses d'un caract\u00e8re permanent.\nLe demandeur es-qual. a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la somme de $40,000 du Dr Huard et de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivis conjointement et solidairement, l'H\u00f4pital Ste-Justine o\u00f9 l'enfant a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment conduit pour y subir une intervention, et le Dr Rivard de cet h\u00f4pital qui a pratiqu\u00e9 l'op\u00e9ration. Le demandeur es-qual. s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 sans frais de son action contre l'H\u00f4pital Ste-Justine, et sa r\u00e9clamation contre le Dr Rivard a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e sans frais. Quant au d\u00e9fendeur Huard et la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 payer au demandeur es-qual. la somme de $3,000 avec d\u00e9pens. La Cour du banc de la reine a maintenu l'appel et rejet\u00e9 l'action, MM. les Juges Choquette et Lizotte dissidents.\nIl ne fait pas de doute que le jeune Cardin r\u00e9agit tr\u00e8s mal apr\u00e8s le premier vaccin par \u00e9gratignures. Il manifesta une grande nervosit\u00e9, \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9, et tous ceux pr\u00e9sents, y compris le m\u00e9decin, ont constat\u00e9 l'\u00e9tat dans lequel se trouvait l'enfant. \u00abIl se d\u00e9battait\u00bb dit la m\u00e8re. \u00abLes bras, les jambes, tout son corps. Je le retenais tout ce que je pouvais\u00bb. Le m\u00e9decin insista cependant pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'injection, malgr\u00e9 les protestations de la m\u00e8re qui voulait revenir un autre jour, alors que l'enfant serait plus calme et que les risques d'accident seraient \u00e9videmment moindres. Il d\u00e9cida de proc\u00e9der quand m\u00eame, dit \u00e0 la m\u00e8re que cela ne serait pas long, lui dit de tenir l'enfant, sans lui expliquer de quelle fa\u00e7on, et introduisit son aiguille dans le bras du jeune Caroll. Sous le coup de cette piq\u00fbre, et d\u00e9j\u00e0 surexcit\u00e9 par la r\u00e9ception du vaccin pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, l'enfant devint agit\u00e9 davantage, avec le r\u00e9sultat que l'aiguille se brisa \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur des chairs. Une parcelle pointue se logea entre l'os principal et le nerf radial, la pointe tourn\u00e9e vers l'os. Le m\u00e9decin explique dans son t\u00e9moignage que contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'il s'attendait, l'enfant a fait un geste de son bras de haut en bas, au lieu de bas en haut.\nImm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s, le Dr Huard conseilla \u00e0 madame Cardin de retourner chez-elle avec son enfant, lui dit que malgr\u00e9 que l'aiguille fut cass\u00e9e et \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9e dans le bras de son fils, de ne pas s'\u00e9nerver, que ce n'\u00e9tait pas un accident grave, et l'avisa de mettre des pansements humides chauds sur le bras. Ce traitement devait, selon lui, en quelques jours provoquer la sortie de ce corps \u00e9tranger. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il allait s'occuper personnellement de ce cas.\nPlus tard, dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi, une garde-malade de la clinique se rendit \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de l'appelant, constata l'\u00e9tat de l'enfant, puis retourna \u00e0 la clinique pour en informer le m\u00e9decin. Celui-ci se rendit imm\u00e9diatement chercher l'enfant pour le conduire \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Ste-Justine. L\u00e0, il subit trois op\u00e9rations. La premi\u00e8re fut pratiqu\u00e9e le m\u00eame jour par le Dr Collin, en pr\u00e9sence du Dr Huard, mais on ne r\u00e9ussit pas \u00e0 enlever cette aiguille. Le lendemain matin, on fit une nouvelle intervention sans plus de succ\u00e8s. Enfin, le 23 ao\u00fbt, le Dr Rivard de Ste-Justine fit une troisi\u00e8me tentative qui donna encore des r\u00e9sultats n\u00e9gatifs.\nApr\u00e8s ces infructueuses visites \u00e0 la clinique et \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital pour recevoir des vaccins contre les maladies infectieuses, le jeune Cardin en est sorti, avec un bras paralys\u00e9 durant plusieurs mois, une aiguille dans le bras qui peut lui causer dans l'avenir de s\u00e9rieux inconv\u00e9nients, et une cicatrice dont il portera les marques toute sa vie.\nLe demandeur es-qual. s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9. de sa r\u00e9clamation contre l'H\u00f4pital Ste-Justine, et l'action contre le Dr Rivard a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e sans frais. Il ne reste donc que la r\u00e9clamation contre la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et le Dr Huard, le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la Ville. Je suis clairement d'opinion que cet appel doit r\u00e9ussir, et que toute la responsabilit\u00e9 doit reposer sur la Cit\u00e9 et le m\u00e9decin qui a inject\u00e9 les vaccins. Le fait brutal demeure que le jeune Cardin est entr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital plein de sant\u00e9, et qu'il en est sorti infirme. Certainement, les m\u00e9decins ne doivent pas \u00eatre tenus responsables d'accidents impr\u00e9visibles qui peuvent se produire dans le cours normal de l'exercice de leur profession. Il arrive n\u00e9cessairement des cas o\u00f9, malgr\u00e9 l'exercice de la plus grande vigilance, des accidents surviennent et dont personne ne doit \u00eatre tenu responsable. Le m\u00e9decin n'est pas un garant de l'op\u00e9ration qu'il fait ou des soins qu'il procure. S'il d\u00e9ploie une science normale, s'il donne les soins m\u00e9dicaux que donnerait un m\u00e9decin comp\u00e9tent dans des conditions identiques, s'il pr\u00e9pare son patient avant l'intervention suivant les r\u00e8gles de l'art, il sera difficilement recherch\u00e9 en dommages, si par hasard un accident se produit. Pas plus pour le m\u00e9decin que pour les autres professionnels, avocats, ing\u00e9nieurs, architectes, etc., le standard de perfection est l'exigence de la loi. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement tenir compte des accidents, des impond\u00e9rables, de tout ce qui est pr\u00e9visible et de tout ce qui ne l'est pas.\nDans son livre intitul\u00e9 \"Malpractice Liability of Doctors and Hospitals\" Meredith s'exprime ainsi aux pages 62 et 63:\nA doctor is responsible for injury to a patient if it can be shown that it resulted from a lack of the standard of professional proficiency which it is reasonable to presume he should possess. Whether the services were rendered gratuitously or for reward is immaterial.\n* * *\nThe standard of proficiency required by law has been defined as that of \"the ordinary competent medical practitioner.\"\n* * *\nProof of proficiency, however, is no defence to a malpractice suit if it is shown that the patient's injury was due to the doctor's failure to exercise the required degree of care.\nVide \u00e9galement sur la responsabilit\u00e9 des m\u00e9decins: Elder v. King3; Nesbitt v. Holt4; The Sisters of St. Joseph of London v. Fleming5; X v. Meilen6; G. v. C.7; Wilson v. Swanson8. Ce sont ces principes reconnus et souvent r\u00e9affirm\u00e9s par les auteurs et la jurisprudence, qui doivent nous guider dans la d\u00e9termination de cette cause. De plus, il est essentiel de ne pas oublier, comme cette Cour l'a rappel\u00e9 dans Parent v. Lapointe9, que quand dans le cours normal des choses un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ne doit pas se produire, mais arrive tout de m\u00eame, et cause un dommage \u00e0 autrui, et quand il est \u00e9vident qu'il ne serait pas arriv\u00e9 s'il n'y avait pas eu n\u00e9gligence, alors, c'est \u00e0 l'auteur de ce fait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu'il y a eu une cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re dont il ne peut \u00eatre tenu responsable, et qui est la source de ce dommage. C'est sur lui que repose le fardeau de la preuve.\nNormalement, l'accident pour lequel r\u00e9clame le demandeur es-qual. ne devait pas se produire. Pour obtenir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l'exon\u00e9ration, le m\u00e9decin intim\u00e9 soutient que l'enfant a fait un faux mouvement, et que c'est l\u00e0 qu'il faut chercher la cause unique et d\u00e9terminante de cet accident. Je ne puis admettre cette pr\u00e9tention.\nL'enfant, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un premier vaccin par \u00e9gratignures contre la v\u00e9role, devint tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9, tr\u00e8s excit\u00e9, fit des gestes des bras et des jambes, et il me semble \u00e9vident qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas dans l'\u00e9tat de stabilit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour recevoir dans le bras la piq\u00fbre qu'on lui a donn\u00e9e. Le m\u00e9decin aurait d\u00fb laisser le patient se calmer, revenir du choc du premier vaccin. Il aurait pu \u00e9galement suivre le conseil de la m\u00e8re qui, voyant le danger probable, sugg\u00e9ra de remettre \u00e0 un autre jour cette injection, mais il d\u00e9cida de proc\u00e9der en vitesse apr\u00e8s avoir tent\u00e9, avec le secours de la m\u00e8re, d'immobiliser l'enfant, ce qui, \u00e9videmment a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de fa\u00e7on imparfaite. L'immobilisation compl\u00e8te du bras, \u00e9tait la pr\u00e9caution qui s'imposait pour pr\u00e9venir le danger qui s'est r\u00e9alis\u00e9. Le d\u00e9faut d'assurer cette immobilisation constitue la faute du m\u00e9decin.\nIl eut \u00e9t\u00e9 plus sage et plus prudent d'agir de la sorte, et d'attendre un. moment plus propice pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette injection qui pouvait certainement \u00eatre remise \u00e0 plus tard. Je crois que ce jeune patient n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 son extr\u00eame \u00e9tat de surexcitation, et que le r\u00e9sultat qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e9tait s\u00fbrement pr\u00e9visible. Le m\u00e9decin a choisi de prendre un risque dont la m\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame pr\u00e9voyait les cons\u00e9quences, et je suis alors d'opinion qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 imprudent, et que sa responsabilit\u00e9 est engag\u00e9e. Il y a eu, \u00e0 mon sens, une absence de soin et de pr\u00e9caution qu'un homme prudent n'omettrait pas dans des conditions semblables.\nJe suis peu impressionn\u00e9 par l'argument que la m\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb ramener son fils chez-elle, si v\u00e9ritablement elle croyait que l'injection ne devait pas \u00eatre faite. Evidemment, domin\u00e9e par l'ascendant du m\u00e9decin qu'elle \u00e9tait all\u00e9e voir en toute confiance, il lui \u00e9tait difficile de s'affranchir de son autorit\u00e9, et on ne peut lui reprocher, malgr\u00e9 qu'elle ait fait une premi\u00e8re suggestion, de ne pas avoir insist\u00e9 davantage.\nOn a aussi soutenu que le v\u00e9ritable dommage est le r\u00e9sultat des trois op\u00e9rations \u00e0 l'H\u00f4pital Ste-Justine, o\u00f9 l'on n'a pu r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 enlever la parcelle de l'aiguille demeur\u00e9e dans le bras du jeune Cardin. Je suis au contraire d'opinion que la cause d\u00e9terminante du pr\u00e9judice subi est l'injection donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la clinique de fa\u00e7on imprudente et maladroite, et que tout le reste n'est que la cons\u00e9quence de cette premi\u00e8re intervention.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le jugement du juge au proc\u00e8s r\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens devant cette Cour, et la Cour du Banc de la Reine.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Lefran\u00e7ois, Goulet & Lalonde, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendants, respondents: Berthiaume & MacDonald, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que.

The jury found the appellant guilty on the first charge and not guilty on the second. Leave to appeal to this Court was given on the following questions of law:\n1. Did the Trial Judge err in admitting the statements of the accused made to the police or to the Canadian Pacific Railway investigating Officer?\n2. Did the Trial Judge err in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to \u201cwilfully\u201d and as to the burden of the Crown to prove a specific intent?\n3. Was there any evidence upon which the jury could have convicted or should the Trial Judge have directed the jury to acquit?\nI have gone over the entire record and I adopt as correct the following statement of facts contained in the respondent\u2019s factum. The evidence discloses that some time prior to 10.17 p.m. on the evening of February 10, 1960, the appellant turned his motor car off the travelled portion of the highway at a level crossing and proceded a short distance along the railway tracks. At 10.17 p.m. a train crashed into the car and carried it over a 1,000 foot-long bridge before coming to a stop. The engineer saw no lights on the car before the impact. The motor had been shut off and the keys were missing. At 10.30 p.m. the appellant called at the house of the witness Ogden, which was about 1,000 yards away from the railway crossing, and asked him to call a taxi. He left before the taxi came. Ogden described him as being drunk. At 11.45 p.m. two police officers, Bodley and Cooper, found the appellant at the home of one Delany, two or three doors from Ogden\u2019s. They asked where his car was and he replied that it was parked on the railway track, that he did not think trains travelled on that track, that he had taken the keys and turned off the lights and that he had walked four miles for help. He produced the keys. When told of the collision he repeated the story but said the car was stuck rather than parked. The appellant could walk without assistance but staggered and appeared to be intoxicated. He was placed under arrest and taken to Ogden\u2019s house which he identified as the place from which he had tried to make a telephone call. He identified Ogden as the man to whom he had spoken.\nAs to the first question of law it is necessary to refer only to the evidence of the police officers, Bodley and Cooper. The County Court judge carefully considered their testimony and the arguments presented by counsel and decided that notwithstanding the evidence of drunkenness on the part of the appellant the latter knew what he was saying. It is not a case where a trial judge considered that the words used by an accused did not, because of his condition, amount to his statement. After having admitted the statements in evidence the judge then left it to the jury to assess what weight should be attached to them. I have no doubt that the statements were made voluntarily and that no threats or promises had been held out by the police officers.\nAs to the second question of law, after having read and considered the charge of the trial judge several times, I have no difficulty in concluding that he instructed the jury properly and adequately as to what was necessary for them to find that the appellant wilfully obstructed the lawful use of property.\nFinally, as to the third question, there was evidence upon which the jury could have convicted and the trial judge should not have directed the jury to acquit. It was argued that the finding by the jury that the appellant was not guilty of the second charge showed that the jury were perverse in finding the appellant guilty on the first charge. It is impossible to agree with this contention as quite likely the jury decided that having found the appellant guilty on the first charge they would be merciful in dealing with the second charge.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Malcolm Robb, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario, Toronto.\n"}

After driving some distance on the main highway, they took a road which was built and maintained by the company. A sign read: \"Private road, Consolidated Paper Corp. Ltd., at your own risk, speed 20 miles\". At a gate on that road, where there was another warning sign, the men were issued badges and were told where to drive in order to apply for work. After driving for some ten miles, they reached the top of a slope which led down to a bridge across a river. There was a hand-rail and a ramp 4 inches high on each side of the bridge. Light snow and ice covered the bridge. The driver of the car drove down the slope in second gear, at about 10 miles per hour. When the car reached the middle of the bridge, it broke through the guard rails and fell into the river. The plaintiff's husband and one son were drowned.\nThe trial judge held that the danger presented by the slippery condition of the road required that the three passengers should have stepped out of the car to guide it across. He also held that the defendant company should have warned them since it knew of the danger and that the four men had never travelled on the road before. The driver was therefore held liable to the extent of 20% and the company to the extent of 80%. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, dismissed the action and held that the company had no obligation to warn the men of the danger. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nThe men were invited to take the dangerous road. They were entitled to presume that if they drove carefully they would reach their destination without having to take the unusual precautions required of them by the trial judge. No doubt the presence of the guard rails gave them a sense of false security. The defendant was negligent in not warning the four men.\nThe signs denying liability were not clear enough to afford a good defence. They could be interpreted to apply only to the general public, but not to the company's invitees.'

Apr\u00e8s avoir parcouru plusieurs milles sur la voie publique, ils s'engag\u00e8rent dans un chemin, construit et maintenu par l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e duquel une affiche indiquait:\nCHEMIN \u2014 PRIVE\nCONSOLIDATED PAPER CORPN LTD\nA VOS RISQUES\nVITESSE 20 MILLES\nVers dix heures et demie de l'avant-midi, ils arrivaient \u00e0 une barri\u00e8re \u00e9rig\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e en travers du chemin pour permettre \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de contr\u00f4ler l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 sa r\u00e9serve foresti\u00e8re.

Apr\u00e8s avoir parcouru, en automobile, quelque dix milles en for\u00eat, sur un chemin devenu glissant par suite des conditions atmosph\u00e9riques de la nuit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et de la matin\u00e9e, les Tass\u00e9 arriv\u00e8rent au sommet d'une pente en bas de laquelle se trouvait un pont permettant la travers\u00e9e de la rivi\u00e8re Mattawin.\nCe pont a une longueur de 140 pieds, ou 210 pieds avec les approches, et une largeur de 12 pieds. Deux poutres d'acier reposant sur les piliers en supportent le tablier c\u00f3nstitu\u00e9 de billots sci\u00e9s sur deux faces et plac\u00e9s sur le travers de ces poutres. Par-dessus ces billots, deux lisi\u00e8res de madriers dispos\u00e9es parall\u00e8lement en centre et sur la longueur du pont \u00e0 une distance de six pieds l'une de l'autre, constituent la partie du tablier sur laquelle roulent les voitures. Ces madriers ont trois pouces d'\u00e9paisseur et chaque lisi\u00e8re a 2 pieds de largeur. Pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des voyageurs, il y a, de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, un garde-fou et, fix\u00e9e au tablier, une rampe de bois. Cette rampe devait, d'apr\u00e8s le plan livr\u00e9 au constructeur du pont, avoir 12 pouces de hauteur; en fait, elle n'en avait que quatre.\nPar suite d'une pluie tomb\u00e9e la nuit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, le pont \u00e9tait couvert d'une couche de glace, elle-m\u00eame recouverte par une neige fine tomb\u00e9e au cours de la matin\u00e9e. Suivant certains t\u00e9moignages, cette neige voilait partiellement, sinon totalement, la pr\u00e9sence et d\u00e9limitation de ces lisi\u00e8res de madriers. Le pont \u00e9tait si glissant qu'on ne pouvait s'y tenir debout sans difficult\u00e9.\nLe conducteur, de la voiture, Jean-Guy Tass\u00e9, entreprit, en seconde vitesse, la descente de la pente et la travers\u00e9e du pont, allant \u00e0 peine \u00e0 dix milles \u00e0 l'heure. La voiture avait atteint \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la moiti\u00e9 du pont lorsque, soudainement, les roues d'arri\u00e8re d\u00e9rapant vers la droite et celles d'avant vers la gauche, elle passa \u00e0 travers le garde-fou fix\u00e9 sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 du pont et, dans un mouvement de bascule, tomba dans la rivi\u00e8re avec tous les passagers. Tass\u00e9 p\u00e8re et son fils Jean-Guy s'y noy\u00e8rent.\nL'appelante, tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice \u00e0 huit enfants mineurs issus de son mariage avec feu Edmond Tass\u00e9, poursuivit l'intim\u00e9e en dommages pour lui r\u00e9clamer la somme de $39,252.50 \u00e0 titre personnel, et $10,161.53 en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure consid\u00e9ra que la travers\u00e9e de ce pont pr\u00e9sentait un danger extr\u00eame n\u00e9cessitant un degr\u00e9 correspondant de prudence; que ce degr\u00e9 de prudence, aux vues de la Cour, pouvait exiger que trois des occupants de la voiture en descendissent pour la guider de l'ext\u00e9rieur et la soutenir au besoin; qu'en raison de la condition du chemin d\u00e9j\u00e0 parcouru, les voyageurs ne pouvaient, cependant, ignorer l'\u00e9tat glissant de ce pont; que s'il n'y avait pas lieu, sous toutes les circonstances, de leur reprocher de ne pas avoir rebrouss\u00e9 chemin, il \u00e9tait juste, nonobstant toute la prudence avec laquelle le conducteur de la voiture avait entrepris la travers\u00e9e du pont, d'imputer \u00e0 ce dernier une part de responsabilit\u00e9, soit 20 pour cent. La Cour trouva, d'autre part, que l'intim\u00e9e connaissait parfaitement la gravit\u00e9 de tous les risques auxquels allaient s'exposer les Tass\u00e9 qui, \u00e0 sa connaissance, n'\u00e9taient jamais all\u00e9s sur cette route et ce pont; qu'on ne pouvait retenir comme faute le fait qu'elle n'avait pas encore compl\u00e9t\u00e9 les op\u00e9rations de sablage qu'elle avait jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d'entreprendre le matin pour \u00e9liminer le danger, mais que son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb, au lieu de se contenter d'indiquer aux voyageurs la route \u00e0 suivre pour se rendre au camp Gouin et de les inviter \u00e0 s'y engager, les avertir clairement des risques auxquels ils s'exposaient et, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable et m\u00eame imp\u00e9ratif, les emp\u00eacher de s'aventurer sur la route. La Cour attribua 80 pour cent de responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e et, sur cette base, la condamna \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la demanderesse personnellement $11,849 et, en sa qualit\u00e9 de tutrice, $6,677.04.\nSeule l'intim\u00e9e appela de ce jugement; de sorte qu'il n'y a pas \u00e0 revenir sur la faute attribu\u00e9e au conducteur de la voiture; sur le point, il y a chose jug\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure fut infirm\u00e9 en Cour d'Appel2 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire. En substance, les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e8rent que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait aucune obligation d'avertir les Tass\u00e9 de dangers qui, dans l'opinion de ces Juges, \u00e9taient apparents, et que, de toutes fa\u00e7ons, un avertissement n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d'aucune utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 ces voyageurs. On d\u00e9clara incidemment qu'en raison du droit du public d'utiliser les chemins \u00e9tablis sur des limites foresti\u00e8res, Loi des Terres et For\u00eats, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 93, art. 103, l'intim\u00e9e ne pouvait emp\u00eacher les Tass\u00e9 de s'y engager, ainsi que l'avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9, comme mesure imp\u00e9rative de prudence, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nD'autre part, les Juges de la minorit\u00e9 ont jug\u00e9 qu'un homme prudent et diligent, agissant comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re, aurait cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 dissuader ces voyageurs de s'aventurer sur le chemin ou, tout au moins, les aurait-il clairement pr\u00e9venus des dangers, et qu'en omettant de ce faire, le commis \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re a fait une faute d'omission engageant la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e. D'o\u00f9 l'appel \u00e0 cette Cour.\nLes montants accord\u00e9s pour dommages ne sont pas en question; le seul point \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer est celui du principe de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e.\nRien dans la preuve ne permet d'inf\u00e9rer que ce d\u00e9rapage soudain soit attribuable \u00e0 une fausse man\u0153uvre du conducteur de la voiture. L'unique explication qu'on y trouve appara\u00eet au t\u00e9moignage non contredit de l'un des occupants, Maurice Tass\u00e9. Ce dernier a rapport\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant remont\u00e9 sur le pont apr\u00e8s l'accident, il a constat\u00e9, en suivant les traces laiss\u00e9es sur la neige par les roues de la voiture, que ce d\u00e9rapage fatal s'\u00e9tait produit au point m\u00eame o\u00f9 les roues d'arri\u00e8re avaient quitt\u00e9 les lisi\u00e8res de madriers pour tomber de trois pouces sur les billots plac\u00e9s en travers du pont, provoquant ainsi l'embard\u00e9e qui se produisit.\nQue la possibilit\u00e9 d'un tel d\u00e9rapage ait pu \u00eatre anticip\u00e9e et conjur\u00e9e par ceux qui connaissaient ce pont,\u2014ce qui fut le cas particuli\u00e8rement, ce matin-l\u00e0, pour l'agent de district de l'intim\u00e9e qui le traversa bien avant que les Tass\u00e9 n'arrivent \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re,\u2014il ne s'ensuit pas qu'elle devait l'\u00eatre par ces derniers qui y passaient pour la premi\u00e8re fois, alors surtout que la neige voilait partiellement, sinon totalement, la d\u00e9limitation des madriers. Invit\u00e9s, \u00e0 la barri\u00e8re, \u00e0 s'engager sur cette route \u00e9tablie, maintenue et contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, aux fins m\u00eames des op\u00e9rations foresti\u00e8res auxquelles on venait de leur faire prendre l'obligation de s'employer, les Tass\u00e9 \u00e9taient en droit d'assumer en toute confiance que nonobstant l'\u00e9tat glissant de la route, ils pouvaient, en conduisant prudemment sur ce pont, comme ils l'avaient fait sur les dix milles de chemin d\u00e9j\u00e0 parcourus, se rendre \u00e0 destination sans avoir \u00e0 prendre, sur ce pont, des pr\u00e9cautions aussi inusit\u00e9es que celles indiqu\u00e9es par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance. La pr\u00e9sence du garde-fou et de la rampe fix\u00e9e au tablier offrait raisonnablement \u00e0 leur vue un facteur de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 contre la possibilit\u00e9 de ce danger qui, par la suite, est devenu une r\u00e9alit\u00e9. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, il n'y avait l\u00e0 qu'une apparence de protection. et non une protection v\u00e9ritable. Dans Letang v. Ottawa Electric Railway Co.3, on rel\u00e8ve, \u00e0 la page 731, un passage ayant une singuli\u00e8re pertinence en la pr\u00e9sente cause:\nIt is clear from his evidence that he knew there was some danger, but the contention on behalf of the defendants, that this circumstance is sufficient to entitle them to succeed, entirely gives the go-by to the observations of Lord Esher M.R. in Yarmouth v. France. (1887) 19 Q.B.D. 647, 657. ................... In the present case the plaintiff may well have misapprehended the extent of the difficulty and danger which he would encounter in descending the steps; \u2026\nDans cette cause de Letang v. Ottawa Electric Railway Co., supra, on jugea, comme l'on sait, que la maxime Volenti non fit injuria n'offre aucune d\u00e9fense \u00e0 une action en dommages pour blessure corporelle due aux conditions dangereuses de l'endroit auquel la victime a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e par affaires, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit \u00e9tabli qu'elle ait librement et volontairement, en pleine connaissance de la nature et de l'\u00e9tendue du risque encouru, express\u00e9ment ou implicitement consenti de l'encourir. La vigilance des Tass\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tromp\u00e9e par cette invitation, aussi bien que par l'omission des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e de leur signaler la gravit\u00e9 des risques attenant \u00e0 la travers\u00e9e du pont. On aurait d\u00fb les inviter \u00e0 diff\u00e9rer leur d\u00e9part jusqu'au parach\u00e8vement des op\u00e9rations de sablage. Ces mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 s'imposaient; les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e avaient, envers les Tass\u00e9, le devoir, et d'ailleurs toutes les facilit\u00e9s, d'y satisfaire. Leur conduite, dans les circonstances, constitue une faute dont l'accident fut la suite directe, naturelle et imm\u00e9diate, et cette faute engage la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e.\nLe fait qu'en vertu de la Loi des Terres et For\u00eats, supra, les Tass\u00e9, tout comme le public, pouvaient avoir le droit de passer sur ce chemin est, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e9tranger \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration, en l'esp\u00e8ce, des devoirs et responsabilit\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. L'intim\u00e9e a soumis que les affiches plac\u00e9es sur le chemin comportent une stipulation de non responsabilit\u00e9 et partant une d\u00e9fense absolue \u00e0 l'action de l'appelante. Les r\u00e8gles relatives aux stipulations de non responsabilit\u00e9, \u00e0 leur interpr\u00e9tation et \u00e0 leur op\u00e9ration, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9es par le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Canada Steamship Lines Limited v.

In 1946, it entered into a contract with a notary whereby the latter undertook to find the money required and in exchange for the money it received the appellant issued certificates called \"certificates for preferred shares\" and which contained an endorsement on the back providing for the unconditional payment of interest semi-annually at the rate of 5 per cent. The appellant deducted from its income for the years 1947 to 1953 the interest paid in respect of these certificates on the grounds that the sums paid represented interest on borrowed money, deductible from income by virtue of s. 5(1)(b) of the Income War Tax Act and s. 11(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act, and that the certificates conferred a creditor's rights on the owners thereof but not the rights of a shareholder. The Minister claimed that the sums paid out by the appellant were dividends to preferred shareholders and as such not deductible. The Income Tax Appeal Board reversed the Minister's decision, but on appeal to the Exchequer Court the deductions were disallowed.\nHeld: The appellant was entitled to the deductions. The semi-annual payments made to the holders of the certificates were amounts paid pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on money borrowed by the appellant, and as such were deductible as interest on money borrowed for the purpose of earning income.\nThe provisions of the certificates and of the loan contract with the notary were entirely inappropriate to describe the rights of a holder of preferred shares; they were an unequivocal and unconditional promise to pay the principal amount received from the holder at maturity and to pay interest thereon semi-annually until the principal had been paid. The governing intention of the parties, as expressed in these documents, was to create the relationship of borrower and lender, rather than that of company and shareholder. Those parts of the documents which referred to the issue of preferred shares should be rejected or ignored as mere mistaken nomenclature. The conduct of the appellant in making the payments was consistent throughout with that view and quite inconsistent with the view that it was that of company and shareholder; no dividend on the shares was ever declared; the interest which the appellant had bound itself to pay was disbursed semi-annually as a matter of routine.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Fournier J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, reversing a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal allowed.\nA. Bissonnette and J. Monet, for the appellant. P. Boivin, Q.C., and P. M. Ollivier, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Fournier J. pronounced on February 2, 1959, in an appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board, dated: July 9, 1957, whereby an appeal of the appellant in respect of re-assessments made for the taxation years 1947 to 1953 inclusive had been allowed in part.\nBy the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board it was directed that the respondent should deduct from the income of the appellant the amounts of $14,806.60, $17,633.53, $18,068.03, $22,823.97, $13,176.52, $10,742.92 and $8,913.52 for the taxation years 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952 and 1953 respectively. By the decision of the Exchequer Court all of these deductions were disallowed.\nOn the appeal to this Court the appellant asks that the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board be restored except that for the taxation year 1950 the amount of the deduction claimed is reduced from $22,823.97 to $15,585.87.\nThere is no dispute as to these amounts having been disbursed by the appellant in the years in question to holders of certificates in the form of Exhibit \"A 6\", to be referred to later. The sole question is whether these were payments of dividends to holders of preferred shares of the capital stock of the appellant or were payments of interest on money borrowed by the appellant.\nThe appellant is a cooperative agricultural association incorporated under the provisions of the Cooperative Agricultural Associations Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 120. It has its principal place of business in the City of Granby in the province of Quebec, and commenced operations in 1938. The first of the taxation years under appeal, namely the year 1947, was also the first taxation year of the appellant, as in prior years cooperatives were not taxable under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act.\nThe capital required for the operations of the appellant was initially raised by the issue to its members of common shares. Later further capital was raised by the issue of preferred shares; the form of preferred share certificate issued to subscribing members was produced as Exhibit \"A-1\". No question arises oil this appeal as to the deductibility of payments made by the appellant during the taxation years under appeal to holders of certificates in the form of Exhibit \"A-1\". At the hearing before the Income Tax Appeal Board it was admitted by counsel for the appellant that it was not entitled to deduct these payments.\nStill later, in 1944, as the affairs of the appellant prospered, it decided to extend its activities and undertake the manufacture of powdered milk; this necessitated the building of a factory and the installation of special machinery; to pay the costs of these and to discharge certain debts a sum of $275,000 was required. The appellant first endeavoured to raise this sum from its own members but without success; subsequently another attempt was made to raise the money from the members by retaining an amount of 10 cents on every 100 lbs. of milk sold for the members, which retention was to take the form of preferred share capital, but this method also proved unsuccessful. The appellant then approached investment dealers and various financial institutions with a view to borrowing the money required, but these attempts to borrow failed for the reason that under the law governing co-operatives at that time the appellant could not hypothecate its immoveable property.\nFollowing these unsuccessful attempts the appellant approached a notary of the City of Granby who undertook to find the money required. The arrangements between the appellant and the notary were set forth in a contract dated May 10, 1946, which was approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the appellant of the same date. Detailed reference will be made to these documents hereafter.\nThe mandate given to the notary by the officers of the appellant was to raise $275,000 by way of loan. The notary's recommendation to the appellant was that the loan be made by way of the issue of preferred shares. He explained in his evidence that he had not had much experience at that time and was unaware of the contradiction in terms involved in this recommendation and in the contract of May 10, 1946, which he prepared. The notary was successful in obtaining somewhat more than the $275,000 required; each person from whom money going to make up this total was obtained received a certificate in the form of Exhibit \"A-6\".\nThere appears to be no disagreement between the parties as to the facts stated above; but throughout the hearing before the Income Tax Appeal Board counsel for the respondent objected to any testimony being given to vary the terms of the written documents.\nThe contract dated May 10, 1946, is as follows:\nCONVENTIONS SOUS SEING PRIV\u00c9 ENTRE LA SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 COOP\u00c9RATIVE AGRICOLE DU CANTON DE GRANBY ET Me JACQUES NOISEUX, NOTAIRE \u00c0 GRANBY.\nL'AN MIL NEUF CENT QUARANTE-SIX, le dix mai, sont intervenues aux pr\u00e9sentes:\nI\u2014LA SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 COOP\u00c9RATIVE AGRICOLE DU CANTON DE GRANBY, corporation d\u00fbment constitu\u00e9e en vertu de La Loi des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Coop\u00e9ratives de la, Province de Qu\u00e9bec, S.R.Q.

Conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du 2e paragraphe de l'article 5 de la Loi des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s coop\u00e9ratives agricoles, les actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es ne conf\u00e8rent pas \u00e0 leurs d\u00e9tenteurs le droit d'assister et de voter aux assembl\u00e9es g\u00e9n\u00e9rales.\nThe principal of all the monies received by the appellant from the holders of certificates in the form of Exhibit \"A 6\" was repaid in full by July 15, 1956. Interest was paid half-yearly, in accordance with the undertaking contained in the certificates, to the holders of all of these certificates outstanding from time to time. The payments of interest were made by the officers of the company without the passing of any resolution by the Board of Directors to authorize such payments other than that of May 10, 1946, quoted above.\nThe right of the appellant to deduct the amounts claimed was governed for the years 1947 and 1948 by the provisions of s. 5(1)(b) of the Income War Tax Act and for the years 1949 to 1953 inclusive by those of s. 11(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act. For the purposes of the question which we have to decide there is no significant difference between these provisions.\nThe question is whether the semi-annual payments made to the holders of certificates in the form \"A 6\" were amounts paid pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on money borrowed by the appellant. It is not disputed that the money obtained from the holders of the certificates was used by the appellant for the purpose of earning income from its business. The contention of the respondent is that such money was not borrowed but formed part of the paid-up capital of the appellant having been received from subscribers to its preferred shares.\nThe solution of this question depends primarily on the construction of the terms of the certificate in the form of Exhibit \"A 6\" which was the document received by each of the persons who provided the money. The wording on the face of the certificate would indicate that its holder was a purchaser of preferred shares subject to the provisions stated on the back of the certificate. These provisions are however entirely inappropriate to describe the rights of a holder of preferred shares; they are an unequivocal and unconditional promise to pay the principal amount received from the holder at maturity and to pay interest thereon at 5 per cent per annum half-yearly on July 15, and January 15, until the principal has been paid. The date of maturity is not fixed in the certificate and it becomes necessary to refer to the resolution of May 10, 1946, according to which it is stated on its face to have been issued; this resolution in turn refers to the contract of the same date. It appears from paragraphs 2 and 4 of the contract under the heading \"Conditions du pr\u00eat\" that the whole of the principal is to be repaid in ten years from July 15, 1946, and that meanwhile at least $27,500 is to be paid annually on account of principal, the certificates upon which such annual payments are made being selected by lot.\nThe contract exhibits the same inconsistencies as the certificate. The appellant agrees to borrow $275,000 but by means of an issue of preferred shares; the term of the loan is to be ten years with annual repayments but such repayments are to be made to the holders of shares selected by lot; the right of prepayment reserved by the appellant is expressed as the right to redeem the present issue of preferred capital.\nThe task of construing documents containing such inconsistencies is not easy, as is evidenced by the difference of opinion between the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court; but I have reached the conclusion that the governing intention of. the parties, as expressed in the documents, was to create between the appellant and those who paid over their money in exchange for certificates in form \"A 6\" the relationship of borrower and lender rather than that of company and shareholder.\nThe appellant had power to borrow money and also power to issue preferred shares so that no question arises as to either of such courses being ultra vires. If, however, the appellant in fact chose the course of issuing preferred shares it did not have power to bind itself unconditionally to pay interest regardless of whether or not there were profits available for that purpose and it did so bind itself in clear words. This circumstance distinguishes the case at bar from that of Minister of National Revenue v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Coop\u00e9rative Agricole du Comt\u00e9 de Ch\u00e2teauguay2, a decision of Saint-Pierre D.J., which was affirmed without recorded reasons by this Court on April 8, 1954.\nIn the case at bar, in my opinion, the governing intention to create the relationship of borrower and lender appears with sufficient certainty from the relevant documents, and those parts of the documents which refer to the issue of preferred shares should be rejected or ignored as mere mistaken nomenclature by the application of the maxim falsa demonstratio non nocet.\nThe course of conduct of the appellant in making payment was consistent throughout with the view that the true relationship between it and the holder of the certificates was that of borrower and lender and quite inconsistent with the view that it was that of company and shareholder; no dividend on the \"shares\" was ever declared; the interest which the appellant had bound itself to pay was disbursed semi-annually as a matter of routine.\nThe appellant appears to have prospered and to have made sufficient profits to defray the instalments of interest as they fell due, but this could not be foreseen with certainty and it is clear that the position of those who paid their money in exchange for the certificates in form \"A 6\" would be better if they were held to be lenders, and therefore creditors, than if they were held to be holders of preferred shares and so postponed to the claims of creditors. The relevant documents were prepared by or for the appellant and if their terms were ambiguous the holders of the certificates could have relied on the maxim verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem.\nI do not find it necessary to decide whether we are free to consider the evidence given at the hearing, under reserve of objections made by counsel for the respondent, as to what the notary represented to the lenders, ninety per cent of whom he dealt with personally, or the evidence as to the representations in the advertisements of \"the loan\" which were widely circulated. Were we free to consider this evidence it would strengthen the case of the appellant but I do not rely upon it.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and order that the matter be referred back to the Minister with a direction to deduct from the income of the appellant the amounts of $13,301.09, $15,046.61, $13,670.67, $15,585.87, $13,176.52, $10,742.92 and $8,913.52 for the taxation years 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952 and 1953 respectively. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stikeman & Elliot, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A. A.

Mandamus\u2014Trade unions\u2014Whether mandamus available against unincorporated union for reinstatement of illegally suspended member\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 81a, 81b, 992(2), (5).\nFollowing the refusal of a hotel in Montreal to rent rooms to members of the defendant union, the union adopted a resolution declaring the hotel \"unfair\" and threatened to \"place on charge\" any members having dealings with the hotel. Shortly afterwards, the plaintiff was found patronizing the hotel beverage room. He was told that he was placed on charge and was requested to surrender his membership card. This he refused to do and was subsequently found guilty of violating the order of boycott and failing to surrender his card. He was suspended for a year and fined $200. The plaintiff applied for an order of mandamus to have the penalties imposed upon him set aside and to be reinstated. He also claimed damages. The trial Judge ordered the reinstatement of the plaintiff and awarded damages. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was nothing in the union's constitution to suggest that the freedom, possessed by a member of the union like any other member of the public, to patronize a commercial establishment, as was done in this case, was one of the matters within the jurisdiction of the union to attend and regulate. Having therefore no power to order and enforce such a boycott, the union had no right to impose any penalties in respect thereof. The plaintiff was consequently entitled to an order setting aside as null and void all proceedings taken by the union, and to compensation.\nFurthermore, even if the union had such a power under its constitution, it was doubtful that a trade union could attribute to itself the power to coerce its members, by threats of suspension of the right to obtain work, to boycott third parties for the reasons and in the circumstances such as were present in this case.\nMandamus could obtain in this case to compel reinstatement. It could not lie under art. 992(2), which deals with the reinstatement by a corporation of such of its members as have been removed without lawful cause, since a voluntary association, such as the defendant union, is not a legal entity and is not made so by the provisions of art. 81a of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, under art. 992(5) mandamus is authorized in all other cases in which is required the performance of any act or duty which is not of a merely private nature. The duty required of the defendant was to restore to the plaintiff his right to all union membership privileges, which are essential to earn a living in cases of closed shop and virtually so in nearly all of the other cases. This right and corresponding duty could not be of a merely private nature. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to the order of reinstatement.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Smith J. Appeal dismissed. J. G. Ahern, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. M. Schlesinger, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014During the month of July 1957, appellant union, referred to as SIU, ordered its members to refrain from patronizing the York Hotel in Montreal and threatened to prefer union charges against any one failing to comply with this injunction. The resolution adopted in this respect at a \"Headquarters' meeting\", held in Montreal, on July 17, 1957, reads as follows:\nIt was moved by Brother Hunter, H.82, and seconded by E. Gaudreau, G.176, that in view of the fact that the York Hotel had refused to rent rooms to SIU members, that this membership go on record to declare this hotel unfair and to place on charge any SIU member dealing with this hotel.\nThe policy implemented by this resolution had been forecast in \"The Canadian Sailor\", a newspaper published by appellant. As it appears in the relevant extract of the newspaper, all trade unionists, as well as SIU members, were requested to boycott the York Hotel:\nYORK HOTEL IN MONTREAL UNFAIR\nSIU members, and trade unionists from all unions, are advised that the York Hotel on Notre Dame Street in Montreal is unfair.\nThis hotel refuses to rent rooms to union seamen and other union marine workers on the grounds that a man's occupation shall determine who shall be permitted by the York Hotel to stay at the York Hotel.\nAll labour unionists and SIU members are requested not to patronize the York Hotel, and to patronize its bar-rooms, cocktail lounges, restaurant, cigarette counters, nor any avenue of revenue operated by this anti-union concern.\nViolation of this notice by SIU members shall constitute full and proper reason for regular union charges to be preferred against the member concerned.\nSome fifteen days after the date of this resolution, respondent, a member in good standing of the union, was seen by an officer thereof, one Baxter, in the beverage room of the York Hotel consuming beer with other fellow members of the union. Baxter approached him, told him that he was violating the order, that he was placed under charge and requested him to surrender his membership certificate. With this request, respondent did not immediately comply.\nHe was thereafter formally charged, tried and found guilty by a \"trial committee\" to have (i) violated the order of boycott and (ii) failed to surrender his membership cer- tificate, when requested to do so. The committee recommended that respondent be suspended from all union privileges for a period of one year and that he be required to pay a fine of $200 before again shipping out on an SIU vessel. These findings and recommendations were subsequently approved at a headquarters' meeting. Respondent sought to appeal and, for that purpose, gave the appropriate notice. His appeal was not heard by the officers of the union who contended they never received the notice of appeal although the latter was given in the prescribed manner.\nRespondent then took action against appellant in which he asked the Court (i) to set aside, as irregular, null and void, all the proceedings and decisions of appellant; (ii) to order appellant to reinstate him in all his union privileges, and (iii) to condemn it to pay him $2,000 as compensation for illegal suspension and loss of earnings resulting therefrom.\nThe Superior Court found that appellant had no power, expressed or implied, to order and enforce such a boycott; that there was no right or power to impose the penalties purported to have been imposed and that although respondent was entitled, upon surrender of his membership certificate, to an identification card permitting him to obtain work until the final disposal of the charges, such a card had not been issued to him; and that, as a result of appellant's action, respondent had been deprived of all membership privileges, denied entry to union headquarters and to employment, from the date of confiscation of his union certificate to that of the service of the action. The Court ordered appellant to reinstate respondent in all his privileges, condemned it to pay the compensation prayed for, and reserved to respondent such other rights and recourses as may appertain.\nThe union appeal from this judgment was dismissed by a unanimous decision of the Court of Queen's Bench2, the Court concurring in the view that appellant had acted beyond its constitutional powers in making this order of boycott and in imposing on respondent the above sanctions for his failure to comply with it.\nThe present appeal is from that decision. The primary question is whether the appellant could validly order a boycott of such a nature for, if it could not, all which it did in pursuance of its resolution is null and void.\nWhile described in the writ of summons as being \"a body politic incorporate and duly incorporated under the law\", appellant is, as it was conceded and as it appears by its constitution filed in the record, a voluntary association of persons having, as a group, no legal entity. Thus the question really is twofold, to wit, whether appellant did have, according to its constitution, the power to order such a boycott and, if it did, whether it could, under the law, attribute to itself such a power.\nWith respect to the first point, appellant relies on Article I of the constitution and, specifically, on the part thereof which is here italicized:\nARTICLE I\nNAME AND POWERS\nThis Union shall be known as the Seafarers' International Union of North America, Canadian District, affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress, and the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Its powers shall be legislative, judicial and executive. It is a grant of powers from the members and the Union shall not exercise any power unless specifically granted, or implied and needed in the exercise of power directly granted. The Seafarers' International Union of North America, Canadian District, shall be an industrial form of Union, composed of seamen in the Marine Industry.\nThis article, which prima facie purports to give to the union unlimited legislative, executive and judicial powers, must be read, however, with the opening statement of the constitution where are enumerated the principles for the promotion of which the union is established by the constitution. Inaccurately entitled \"Preamble\", this opening statement must, for the determination of the point under consideration, be here recited at length:\nPREAMBLE\nWe, the Seafarers' International Union of North America, Canadian District, realizing the value and necessity of an organization of seamen, have determined to form one Union, the Seafarers' International Union of North America, Canadian District, affiliated with the A.F. of L., based on the following principles:\nWhatever right belongs to one member belongs to all members alike, as long as they remain in good standing in the Union. First of thesis rights is the right of the Canadian seamen to receive their employment through their own Union Halls without interference from Government controlled bureaus or other detrimental groups.\nThat it is the right of each member to receive fair and just remuneration for his labour and to gain sufficient leisure for mental cultivation and physical recreation.\nFurther we consider it is our right to receive healthful and sufficient food and properly appointed forecastles in which to rest.\nNext, is the right to be treated in a decent and respectful manner by those in command.\nTo assist other bona fide labour organizations whenever possible in the attainment of their just demands.\nRecognizing the foregoing as our inalienable rights, we are conscious of corresponding duties to those in command, our employers, our craft and our country.\nBased upon these principles, it is among our objectives to use our influence individually for the purpose of maintaining and developing skill in seamanship and effecting a change in the law governing the activities of the seamen in Canada, the Canada Shipping Act and the Merchant Seamen's Compensation Act, so as to render both these acts more equitable and to make them an aid to the development of a Merchant Marine and a body of Canadian Seamen.\nTo support a journal which shall voice the sentiments of the seafaring class and through its columns seek to maintain the knowledge of and interest in maritime affairs.\nTo regulate our conduct as a Union and as individuals so as to make seamanship what it rightly is\u2014an honourable and useful calling. And, bearing in mind that we are migratory, that our work takes us away in different directions from any place, where the majority might otherwise meet to act, that meetings can be attended by only a fraction of the membership, that the absent members who cannot be present, must have their interest guarded from what might be the results of excitement and passions aroused by persons or conditions and that those who are present may act for and in the interest of all, we have adopted this constitution.\nManifesting the true object of the association, this opening statement is effective to reduce to its proper and, indeed, its intended dimensions, the otherwise unlimited scope of the legislative, executive and judicial powers given in Article I. The declared object of the association is to attend such matters as relationship between members, between them and their employers, between the union and other labour organizations, labour conditions, promotion of skill and seamanship, betterment of legislation concerning seamen. There is nothing, however, in this declaratory part of the constitution suggesting that the freedom, possessed by a member of the union like any other member of the public, to patronize a commercial establishment as did respondent in the present case, is one of the matters within the jurisdiction of the association to attend and regulate. Between the union or its members and York Hotel, there was, in the circumstances, no connection whatever related to any of these matters. In joining the union, respondent did contract with the other members thereof to abide, not to any order, but only to those for the making of which there was authority. I agree with the Courts below that appellant had no power, expressed or implied, to order and enforce such a boycott.\nOn the second point. It is doubtful that a trade union could attribute to itself the power to coerce, by threats of suspension of the right to obtain work, its present or future members\u2014who are virtually forced to maintain union membership in order to obtain employment\u2014, to boycott third parties in the exercise of their calling, for reasons and in circumstances such as are present in this case. Boycotting may, in certain circumstances, become a form of oppressive combination which the law condemns. Pratt et al. v. British Medical Association et al.3 The criminal law has been amended to grant immunity to trade unions from prosecution for agreements in restraint of trade. This is a qualified immunity which flows from a policy designed to promote legitimate endeavours of the working classes. It does not follow that this special immunity will operate in cases of combinations absolutely foreign to such endeavours and of which the end or the means are unlawful. It is unnecessary, however, to pursue the matter, the opinion reached as to the first point being decisive of the question.\nRespondent was therefore entitled to the order setting aside, as being null and void, all the proceedings taken by respondent in pursuance of its resolution of July 17, 1957, and to the compensation granted for loss and damage sustained up to the issuance of the writ.\nThere remains to consider the order compelling appellant to reinstate respondent in all his privileges as a member of the union, which raises the question whether mandamus proceedings could obtain in this case. Article 992 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:\n992. If there is no other remedy equally convenient, beneficial and effectual, a mandamus lies to enforce the performance of an act or duty in the following cases: 1. Whenever any corporation or public body omits, neglects or refuses to perform any act or duty incumbent upon it by law;\n2. Whenever any corporation omits, neglects or refuses to make any election which by law it is bound to make, or to recognize such of its members as have been legally chosen or elected, or to reinstate such of its members as have been removed without lawful cause;\n3. Whenever any public officer, or any person holding any office in any corporation, public body, or court of inferior jurisdiction, omits, neglects or refuses to perform any duty belonging to such office, or any act which by law he is bound to perform;\n4. Whenever any heir or representative of a public officer omits, refuses or neglects to do any act which, as such heir or representative, he is by law obliged to do;\n5. In all other cases in which the plaintiff is interested in requiring the performance of any act or duty which is not of a merely private nature.\nRelying on the opening part of the article, appellant contended that the claim for damages constituted a remedy barring mandamus proceedings. As it appears in the second Report of the Commission charged with the Revision and Amendment of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1867, the words \"equally convenient, beneficial and effectual\", which, at the suggestion of the Commissioners, were inserted in the opening paragraph of art. 992 of the 1897 Code of Civil Procedure, are designed to check an extreme tendency of the Courts to refuse mandamus whenever there is another legal remedy, although such remedy is not so advantageous or effectual. Seriatim issuance of actions to claim damages is a doubtful method of earning a living and can hardly be regarded as a remedy equally convenient, beneficial and effectual as the remedy of mandamus. Appellant's submission cannot be entertained.\nA substantial question, however, is whether mandamus proceedings can be taken against a voluntary association such as is appellant union. In Comtois v. L'Union locale 1552 des Lambrisseurs de Navires4, the Court of Appeal, relying on 1938 (Que.), 2 Geo. VI, c. 96, reproduced in R.S.Q. 1941, c. 342, as ss. 28 and 29, affirmatively answered the question. The point is dealt with by Mr. Justice Casey, at page 679, and his opinion in the matter is concurred in by Chief Justice Galipeault, Barclay and St-Germain, JJ., the latter after much hesitation. The Report makes no mention of the view of Mr. Justice Pratte. The statute relied on allows a group of persons, like appellant union, which, as a group, has no collective civil personality recognized by law, to be sued in the name of one of the officers thereof, at the ordinary or recognized office of the group, or collectively under the name by which they are commonly designated or known. Having referred to ss. 28 and 29 of the statute, Mr. Justice Casey said:\nIt cannot be denied therefore, that the statute gave to such groups generally, an existence separate and distinct from that of its individual members.\nThis legal existence and this availability of assets evidence the intention of the Legislature that these groups should be as amenable to the Courts as any other artificial person, should one seek to exercise against them \"any recourse provided by the laws of the Province\". This in my opinion is sufficient to make such a group subject to par. 2 of art. 992 C.P., and to expose it to the sanction of art. 1001 of the same Code.\nThis, in effect, is to say that these groups are thus given a status equal to that of a corporation, with the consequence that a voluntary unincorporated trade union is to be treated, as if it were, for all legal purposes, a corporation subject to the restraints and disabilities imposed by law upon artificial persons.\nWith deference, however, this view is in conflict with that expressed in this Court by Rinfret J., as he then was, with the concurrence of Crockett, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ., in International Ladies Garment Workers Union v. Rothman5, a decision which does not appear to have been brought to the attention of the Court of Appeal when it dealt with the Comtois case, supra. Chief Justice Rinfret said, at page 393:\nThe statute does not purport to incorporate the groups or persons therein described, nor does it purport to confer upon them a collective legal personality. It does exclusively what is therein stated: It allows persons who have claims against them to summon them in the name of one of the officers thereof, at the ordinary or recognized office of the group, or collectively under the name by which they are commonly designated or known.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal in the Comtois case, supra, does not appear to have settled the question, in the Provincial Courts, as is shown particularly by the subsequent decision of the Superior Court in Dupont v. Steam- ship Checkers et al.6 Indeed the point is still debated, as may be seen in \"Les conflits de droit dans les rapports collectifs du travail\", Marie-Louis Beaulieu, pp. 132 et seq. and 288 et seq.\nIn this Court, the matter has been finally disposed of by what was said in International Ladies Garment Workers Union v. Rothman, supra.\nIn 1960, the provisions of the 1938 statute have been incorporated in the Code of Civil Procedure, as s. 81a by 8-9 Elizabeth II, c. 99. Also added to the Code, on the same occasion, was s. 81b. The latter gives the right to such group of persons, which constitutes an association of employees within the meaning of the Labour Relations Act, to act as plaintiff in judicial proceedings. Nothing in s. 81b can affect the conclusion reached in this Court, with respect to s. 81a, in International Ladies Garment Workers Union v. Rothman, supra. These amendments to the general law are inapt to give to these groups a legal entity separate from that of their members. The object of these amendments is to allow them to sue or to be sued, and permit that judgments, which might be rendered against them, be executory against all the moveable and immoveable property of the group. To this extent only was the general law altered. The following comments, which are found in Maxwell, \"On Interpretation of Statutes\", 10th ed., at page 81, find here their application:\nThere are presumptions against implicit alteration of the law. One of these presumptions is that the Legislature does not intend to make any substantial alteration, in the law beyond what it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear implication or, in other words, beyond the immediate scope and object of the statute.\nHence, with deference, mandamus proceedings against appellant union cannot be justified on the basis of the provisions of s. 2 of art. 992.\nOne must consider, however, s. 5 of that article, which authorizes mandamus \"in all other cases in which the plaintiff is interested in requiring the performance of any act or duty which is not of a merely private nature.\" The nature of the act or duty, of which the performance by appellant is here sought by respondent, may be determined by the nature of the right of which the latter is seeking active recognition. This right is the right to be reinstated in all union membership privileges. Union mark for members of the working classes is now a requisite to obtain work. This requisite is clearly essential in cases of closed shop and virtually so in nearly all of the other cases. In the words of Mr. Justice Rand in Orchard et al. v. Tunney7:\nMembership is the badge of admission and continuance and, vis-\u00e0-vis the employer, to remove the badge is directly and immediately to defeat the right.\nThese are facts that are now given effective recognition in labour and industrial laws where labour relations, labour conditions, collective agreements and industrial peace are, amongst other matters, dealt with. The right here involved is the right which respondent shares with any other member of the working classes to maintain himself in a position to obtain work and, for all practical purposes, it is the right to earn his living. And those who exercise a control over union membership hold, towards the working classes, a position which the law effectively raises above the level of a merely private nature.\nUnder like conditions, the right claimed by respondent and the duty required to be performed by appellant cannot be of a merely private nature. On these views mandamus can obtain under s. 5 of art. 992 and respondent was entitled to the order of reinstatement made in the Superior Court and affirmed in the Court of Appeal.\nFor all these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Hyde & Ahern, Montreal.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, respondent: J.

Act. The plaintiff carried on a business whereby he secured loans from various people, giving in return therefor promissory notes in the form of documents entitled \"Promissory Note and Collateral Covenants\", each of which was payable in less than one year from the date of issue. The funds borrowed were used to acquire equities in real property which were put in the hands of trustees as security for the repayment of the funds so acquired. The plaintiff's action followed an order of the Securities Commission made under the provisions of s. 20(3) of the Act, whereby the plaintiff was deprived of the exemption from registration under s. 20(2) (f). The order further stated that the registration of the plaintiff as a salesman was cancelled. An application by the plaintiff for an interim injunction was by agreement turned into a motion for judgment. The Court of Appeal by a majority dismissed the action and granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Judson JJ.: The Securities Act is not one relating to promissory notes; its pith and substance is the regulation of trading in securities. Lymburn v. Mayland, [1932] A.C. 318, applied; Attorney General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd., [1941] S.C.R. 87; Attorney General for Alberta v. Attorney General of Canada, [1943] A.C. 356, distinguished. Per Cartwright J.: The main object of The Securities Act is to secure that persons who carry on, in the province, the business of dealing in securities shall do so honestly and in this way to protect the public from being defrauded. Such legislation is within the power of the provincial legislature. Lymburn v. Mayland, supra; Smith v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 776, referred to.\nThe statute restricts the right of a person trading in securities to issue promissory notes, but it does not purport to alter or affect the character of promissory notes issued in contravention of its provisions, nor does it destroy their negotiability. It followed that the impugned sections are not legislation in relation to the matter of promissory notes; they form part of a valid scheme of provincial legislation for regulating the raising of money for business ventures in the province in such manner as to prevent the practice of fraud.\nR. E. Jones Limited v. Waring and Gillow Limited, [1926] A.C. 670; Lewis v. Clay (1897), 67 L.J. Q.B. 224, referred to.\nPer Ritchie J.: The legal nature and effect of promissory notes has been exhaustively dealt with by Parliament in the Bills of Exchange Act, but this in no way prevents the provincial legislature from regulating the conduct of persons who issue such documents as the plaintiff's \"Promissory Note and Collateral Covenants\" within the province. The fact that Parliament has enacted the law governing promissory notes does not preclude the provincial legislature from imposing registration requirements on individuals seeking to issue them. The sections of The Securities Act under attack neither relate to nor purport to deal with the law of bills and notes; the legislation is a valid exercise of provincial power. Attorney General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd., supra, distinguished.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: It was implicit in the terms of the Bills of Exchange Act, as first enacted in 1890 and as it now reads, that all persons throughout Canada may freely contract by bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques and that such instruments, created by promissors; should be freely negotiable in the manner prescribed by the Act, and that when thus placed in circulation they could be transferred in the manner provided and vest in the transferees the rights indicated. The Act did not. exhaustively deal with all of the rights given to persons desiring to contract in this manner or to holders of these instruments under the law merchant. These rights were reserved to the holders of such instruments by s. 10. It was a common law right of the subject prior to the Act of 1890 in this country to freely negotiate bills of exchange and promissory notes and that right was preserved by s. 10.\nThe portions of The Securities Act complained of constitute a direct infringement of the rights of all persons wishing to contract in this manner in the Province of Saskatchewan and are invalid. Lymburn v. Mayland, supra; Attorney General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd., supra, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, dismissing an appeal from dismissal of an application for an injunction and application to the Court of Appeal for an interim injunction which was turned into a motion for judgment. Appeal dismissed, Locke J. dissenting.\nM. C. Shumiatcher, Q.C., and B. Goldstein, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nE. C. Leslie, Q.C., and B. L. Strayer, for the defendants, respondents, and for the Attorney General of Saskatchewan.\nN. A. Chalmers, for the Attorney General of Canada.\nE. R. Pepper, Q.C., for the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nE. H. Coleman, Q.C., for the Attorney-General of Manitoba.\nJ. J. Frawley, Q.C., for the Attorney General of Alberta.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014By leave of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan Alfred A. Duplain appeals from a judgment of that Court2. We are not concerned with all the steps taken by the appellant in the Courts of Saskatchewan in connection with his claims that he and the business carried on by him were not covered by the provisions of The Securities Act of that Province, 1954 (Sask.), c. 89 and amendments thereto, or that certain sections thereof were ultra vires the Legislature. It suffices to commence with the action brought by him in the Court of Queen's Bench against the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and the third member of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission in which the statement of claim asks:\n(a) A declaration that those sections of The Securities Act 1954 and amendments thereto, which relate to and purport to deal with promissory notes, are ultra vires the Legislature of the Province of Saskatchewan being legislation in relation to Head 18 of Section 91 of The British North America Act, 1867.\n(b) A declaration that the Order of the Chairman of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission dated the 24th day of May 1960 and purportedly made pursuant to Section 20(3) of The Securities Act, 1954 is a nullity and ultra vires the power of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission insofar as it relates to promissory notes, for the reasons stated in paragraph (a) hereof; (c) An injunction restraining the Defendants and each of them and any and all of their officers, agents, employees, investigators and persons acting under their authority or instructions:\n(i) from taking any proceedings, making any orders, issuing any notices or doing any other act under the purported authority of The Securities Act, 1954, and amendments thereto in respect of the business operations of the Applicant, Alfred A. Duplain and that of his sole proprietorship, Western Diversified Mortgage Company, and\n(ii) from investigating or inquiring into the affairs of the Plaintiff, Alfred A. Duplain, and of persons to whom the Plaintiff has given promissory notes or with whom the Plaintiff has entered into negotiations for the borrowing of money.\nThe appellant secured an ex parte injunction in that action but his motion to continue it until the trial was dismissed. A notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal from that dismissal was filed and served and an application to that Court having been made for an interim injunction in terms similar to the injunction dissolved, the parties, at the suggestion of the Court, entered into an agreement as to the facts and as to the substantive questions which the Court would be required to adjudicate upon in the action, and in accordance therewith the Attorney General of the Province was added as an intervenant and was deemed to have received all necessary notices in the action as required under the provisions of The Constitutional Questions Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 78. This agreement was filed with the Registrar and was thereupon deemed to be enforceable as an order of the Court of Appeal. The application by the plaintiff for an interim injunction having thus been turned into a motion for judgment, the Court of Appeal after considering the arguments rendered judgment dismissing the action with costs, Chief Justice Martin and McNiven J.A. dissenting. It is from that judgment that the present appeal is taken. Pursuant to Rule 18 of this Court, a copy of the notice of appeal and of a statement of the issues arising for determination was served upon the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of each Province. The Attorney General of Canada filed a factum and was represented by counsel at the hearing. So far as the Provinces are concerned, only the Attorney-General for Ontario, the Attorney-General of Manitoba and the Attorney-General of Alberta filed factums and appeared by counsel and they adopted the submissions of counsel for the Attorney General for Saskatchewan who also represented the original defendants in the action.\nIt is not without significance that The Securities Act is intituled \"An Act for the Prevention of Fraud in Connection with the Sale of Securities\". Provision is made by s. 3 for the appointment of a Securities Commission consisting of a chairman, vice-chairman and a third member, and by s. 4 the chairman may execute the powers and duties vested in or imposed upon the Commission by the Act or the regulations, and by s. 5 a Registrar may be appointed. By subs. (1) of s. 6\nNo person or company shall:\n(a) trade in any security unless such person or company is registered as a broker, investment dealer, broker-dealer, security issuer or as a salesman of a registered broker, investment dealer, broker-dealer or security issuer;\n..................................................................................................................................\nand such registration has been made in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the regulations. . . .\nBy subs.

He had stationery and other appropriate forms printed and established an office in Saskatoon. He intended to acquire equities in real property with the proceeds of money which he might acquire by way of loan and to place such equities in the hands of trustees who would then hold them to secure the repayment of the funds so acquired, and for this purpose a firm of solicitors agreed to act as such trustees under the terms of a deed of trust made between Western Diversified Mortgage Company of the first part and the solicitors of the second part.\nAfter the execution of the trust agreement the plaintiff and his representatives secured loans from various people giving temporary receipts therefor. Ultimately a document called \"Promissory Note and Collateral Covenants\" was issued to each lender in the following form:\nW\nD WESTERN DIVERSIFIED MORTGAGE COMPANY\nM Saskatoon, Sask.\n$ 196\nFace Value Series & Number Date of Maturity\nPROMISSORY NOTE AND COLLATERAL COVENANTS\nTwelve calendar months after the...........day of...................A.D. 196 for value received, WESTERN DIVERSIFIED MORTGAGE COMPANY PROMISES TO PAY TO.............................................or Order at THE CANADIAN BANK OF COMMERCE, MAIN BRANCH, SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN, the sum of.............................($................)

DUPLAIN and\nWESTERN DIVERSIFIED MORTGAGE COMPANY\n1. PURSUANT TO subsection 3 of section 20 of The Securities Act, 1954 the Commission rules that, whereas Alfred A. Duplain has been guilty of acts or conduct which, in the opinion of the Commission, would warrant the Commission refusing to grant registration to him under The Securities Act, 1954, clause (f) of subsection 2 of section 20 of The Securities Act, 1954, shall not apply to the said Alfred A. Duplain.\n2. PURSUANT TO section 8 of The Securities Act, 1954 registration of Alfred A. Duplain as a salesman is hereby cancelled.\nDATED at Regina this 24th day of May A.D. 1960.\nSASKATCHEWAN SECURITIES COMMISSION\n\"W. W. Cameron\"\nChairman\nThe effect of this order was to bring the notes obtained by the plaintiff, which were for twelve months, into the category of promissory notes maturing after one year.\nThe parties agreed that the word \"note\" in the definition section of the Act, 2(19) (e), includes \"promissory note\" and that the negotiation of promissory notes is \"trading\" in them within the meaning of that term as defined in the Act. However, the Act is not one relating to promissory notes. Its pith and substance is the regulation of trading in securities. Although the appellant took steps in an endeavour to protect those who loaned him money on the strength of the promissory notes and covenants, a second charge of land in Saskatchewan, as Gordon J.A. points out, is not a first class security and there would not be a return within a year sufficient to pay the notes as they fell due. The case falls clearly within the decision of the Privy Council in Lymburn v. Mayland3 and as in Smith v. The Queen4, the words of Lord Atkin in the Lymburn case are particularly apt:\nThere was no reason to doubt that the main object sought to be secured in this part of the Act is to secure that persons who carry on the business of dealing in securities shall be honest and of good repute, and in this way to protect the public from being defrauded.\nThe appellant relied upon the decision of this Court in Attorney General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd.5 However, there it was held that the fact that no permit had been issued to the plaintiff by the Debt Adjustment Board of Alberta was no defence because a certain section of the Act there in question took away a right given to a holder of a promissory note by the Bills of Exchange Act, namely, the right to sue and recover judgment upon it against the maker. In the present case there is nothing to prevent the holder of a Promissory Note and Collateral Covenants from suing upon the document. In Attorney General for Alberta v. Attorney General of Canada6, it was held that The Debt Adjustment Act of Alberta was ultra vires in toto as being legislation in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency but no such question arises here.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellant to the respondents and intervenants. There will be no costs to or against the Attorney General of Canada or the Attorney General of any of the other Provinces.\nLocke J. (dissenting) :\u2014The terms of the instruments negotiated by the appellant are stated in other reasons to be delivered in this matter. It is conceded that they are notes, within the meaning of that word in s. 2(19) (e) of The Securities Act, 1954, and that they are promissory notes, within the meaning of s. 176 of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15.\nThe question to be determined is whether the sections of The Securities Act, which purport to render it necessary for a person wishing to negotiate such notes in the ordinary course of his business to register as a \"security issuer\" or a salesman, as required by s. 6 of the Act and the regulations, and receive written notice of such registration from the registrar are ultra vires the Provincial Legislature. It is upon this ground alone that the dissenting judgment of Martin C.J.S. proceeded, a judgment concurred in by the late Mr. Justice McNiven. The constitutional validity of the Act as a whole is not attacked and need not be considered.\nThis question is not dealt with in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland7. In the sense that The Securities Act does not in terms deny access to the courts to the promissee or subsequent holder of such a note, the case differs from the issues dealt with in the judgments delivered in this Court in Attorney-General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd.8 The cases, however, have this similarity that the question arose in each as to whether a person may be deprived of rights given to him by the Bills of Exchange Act by provincial legislation. It is only upon this aspect of the matter that the case was treated as relevant in the judgment of the Chief Justice.\nThe facts, in so far as it is necessary to refer to them are as follows:\u2014Duplain, desiring to negotiate these promissory notes to obtain loans and to invest the moneys borrowed in securities (using that term in its commonly accepted sense) of the nature referred to in the instrument, registered under the provisions of the Saskatchewan Partnership Act and obtained a certificate declaring his intention to carry on business as a sole proprietorship under the name of Western Diversified Mortgage Company. Thereafter he borrowed considerable sums of money from various Saskatchewan residents, giving to each a promissory note in the form mentioned, each of which was payable in less than one year from the date of issue. Promissory notes so maturing might be negotiated by persons other than those registered under the provisions of s. 6 by reason of the terms of s. 20(2) (f) of the Act. After notes in a total amount in excess of $115,000 had been negotiated, the Saskatchewan Securities Commission after conducting an investigation made an order which recited that Duplain had been guilty of conduct which, in the opinion of the Commission, would warrant it in refusing him registration under The Securities Act and, invoking the provisions of subs. (3) of s. 20 of the Act, declared that clause (f) of subs. (2) of s. 20 above mentioned should not apply to Duplain. The order further stated that the registration of Duplain as a salesman was cancelled. The record contains no particulars of the conduct complained of.\nIn the result, the further negotiation of these notes by the appellant could be done only at the risk of prosecution under the provisions of the Act and the action followed.\nSection 91 of the British North America Act declares, inter alia, that notwithstanding anything in that Act the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to bills of exchange and promissory notes and that any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in the section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces. The Bills of Exchange Act of 1890 was, with some modifications, in the same terms as the Bills of Exchange Act of 1882 passed by the British Parliament. That statute was the first statute codifying any branch of the English common law. With certain changes it codified in part the rules of the common law, including the law merchant, under which bills of exchange and promissory notes payable to bearer passed freely by delivery only and, when payable to order, by endorsement and delivery. These instruments in this respect differed materially from agreements containing covenants which passed by assignment and had further distinct characteristics, such as that which enabled persons to become holders in due course freed from any equities attaching to them in the hands of the holder in described circumstances. These were then, as they now are, the conditions defined in s. 56 of the Bills of Exchange Act.\nThe Bills of Exchange Act does not merely define the form in which such instruments may be negotiated. Section 47 provides that capacity to incur liability as a party to a bill is co-extensive with the capacity to contract. Section 56 defines a holder in due course and the rights of a holder, whether for value or not who derives his title through a holder in due course, are declared by s. 57. Sections 60 to 73 provide the manner in which a bill may be negotiated and some of the consequences of such negotiation, and s. 74 (which was considered by Duff C.J. in Winstanley's case) the rights of the holder of a bill, a section which applies equally to the holder of a promissory note.\nIt has been for centuries the right of all persons in England, and for a lengthy, though lesser, time in Canada, to negotiate such bills of exchange or promissory notes freely in the conduct of their business and to vest in the promissee or endorsee of such instrument the rights given to them at common law, and since 1890 by the Canadian statute.\nThe question is, assuming that the negotiation of a promissory note by the maker is a trade in a security within the meaning of s. 6 of The Securities Act, whether the exercise of the right of negotiation may by provincial legislation be made contingent upon obtaining the permission of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission. The subject matter of the present Securities Act was first dealt with by the Saskatchewan Legislature by the Security Frauds Prevention Act, 1930 (c. 74). In that Act the definition of the word \"security\" (s. 2(8)) did not in terms include promissory notes. Section 3(j), however, excepted notes or commercial paper maturing in less than one year, as does the present Act, which may have indicated an intention to control the negotiation of notes maturing after a longer period.\nThe title of this Act was changed by c. 90 of the statutes of 1950 to The Securities Act and, by that name, it appeared as c. 361 of R.S.S. 1953. The definition of the word \"security\" was in the terms of the original Act. The present Act repealed c. 361 and by subs. (19) of s. 2 the definition of \"security\" was extended to include, inter alia, a note. The definition of the term \"trade\" or \"trading\" was materially extended, but the portion relevant in the present matter, contained in para. (a) of subs. (21) of s. 2, was not materially altered and reads:\n\"Trade\" or \"trading\" includes:\n(a) any solicitation for or obtaining of a subscription to, disposition of or trade in or option upon a security for valuable consideration whether the terms of payment be upon margin, instalment or otherwise.\nThe Act as drawn in 1930 appears to have been directed primarily to the prevention of frauds in connection with the sale of shares of stock, debentures and bonds of corporations and certain other miscellaneous interests such as units in a syndicate, commonly designated in the business world as securities. In the present statute s. 37 provides the means whereby members of a prospecting syndicate may file an agreement with the Commission containing certain defined provisions and limit the liability of the members to the extent provided. Such interests are treated as securities and may not be traded in by any person registered in trading in securities under the Act.\nSubsection (5) of s. 37 deals with an unrelated matter and reads:\nNo person or company registered for trading in securities under this Act shall trade in a security issued by a person, other than a prospecting syndicate, either as agent for such person or as principal unless:\n(a) written permission, upon such terms as the commission may require, has been obtained from the commission; and (b) information satisfactory to the commission relating to such person and such security has been accepted for filing by the commission.\nThis would apply to the negotiation of a promissory note when it was not an isolated \"trade\" within the meaning of s. 20(1) (b), as amended by c. 31 of the statutes of 1959.\nSections 38, 39 and 40 require the filing of a prospectus by mining, industrial and investment companies respectively and prohibit the trading in the securities of such companies until the required information has been received and accepted by the commission as sufficient.\nSubsection 5 of s. 37 appeared for the first time in the Act of 1954. According to the notice given by the chairman of the Commission to the appellant on May 24, 1960, he had been registered as a salesman under the Act and that registration was thereby cancelled. Clause (f) of subs. (2) declared that registration to trade was not necessary in the case of negotiable promissory notes or commercial paper maturing not more than a year from the date of issue and the effect of the order, if it was validly made, was to require registration by the appellant as a condition precedent to the negotiation of the notes, even though they matured in less than a year from the date of issue.\nWhile, in my opinion, there is grave doubt that the negotiation of a promissory note in the manner permitted and provided for by the Bills of Exchange Act is a trading within the meaning of the definition above mentioned, we were informed by counsel that it had been agreed on the argument before the Court of Appeal that such negotiation fell within the definition and the matter has been dealt with by that court on this footing. In the circumstances, I think we should deal with the matter in the same manner in this Court.\nThe grounds upon which the Saskatchewan Securities Commission acted in rescinding the registration of the appellant are not part of the record. In the absence of any suggestion of misconduct on the part of the appellant, it is perhaps fair to assume that the real reason for the order was the fact that the Commission did not consider the collateral security for the payment of the note, consisting, as we are informed by the agreed statements of facts, of mortgages and agreements for sale available for purchase at a discount, was satisfactory. As Mr. Justice Procter has pointed out, this is an irrelevant consideration where the question to be determined is as to the constitutional powers of the province.\nIn the result, since The Securities Act requires registration by a person proposing to negotiate his own promissory notes in other than isolated transactions of the nature referred to in s. 20(1)(b), the effect of the order of the Commission is to prohibit the appellant from negotiating notes in this manner.\nFor the respondent it is said that The Securities Act is in pith and substance an Act to regulate trading in securities in the province and that its validity is established by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland, above referred to. This, however, does not answer the appellant's case which is that those portions of the statute which assumed to vest in the Securities Commission the power at its discretion to prohibit the negotiation of promissory notes in the province is beyond the powers of the legislature. A provincial legislature may not extend its own jurisdiction, so as to trench upon the exclusive jurisdiction vested in Parliament by one of the heads of s. 91, by annexing to legislation within its power provisions which trespass upon such a field.\nIn Union Colliery v. Bryden9, it was not suggested that the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1890, of British Columbia was in its entirety ultra vires, but merely that s. 4 which prohibited Chinese of full age from employment in underground coal workings was beyond the powers of the legislature, and it was that section alone which, it was held, exceeded such powers. In Lymburn's case the requirement of registration as a condition precedent to the right of a public company to sell its shares was held to be a valid exercise of the powers conferred upon the legislature by head 13 of s. 92. No question arose as to the right of a province to limit or prohibit the negotiation of bills of exchange or promissory notes or other instruments, as to which exclusive jurisdiction was vested in Parliament under head 18 of s. 91.\nSection 10 of the Bills of Exchange Act reads:\nThe rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, apply to bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques. This section reproduced subs. (2) of s. 97 of the Imperial Act of 1882.\nIt is, in my opinion, apart altogether from s. 10, implicit in the terms of the Bills of Exchange Act, as first enacted in 1890 and as it now reads, that all persons throughout Canada may freely contract in this manner and that such instruments, created by promissors, should be freely negotiable in the manner prescribed by the Act and that when thus placed in circulation they could be transferred in the manner provided and vest in the transferees the rights indicated. It was, no doubt, for the reason that the free use of such instruments was considered essential in carrying on business throughout the country and that it was a matter of national importance that the law throughout Canada upon the subject should be uniform that the exclusive jurisdiction was vested in Parliament.\nThe Act, while intended as a code, did not exhaustively deal with all of the rights given to persons desiring to contract in this manner or to the holders of these instruments under that branch of the common law referred to as the law merchant. These rights were reserved by s. 97(2) and are reserved to the holders of such instruments by s. 10. An illustration of this is to be found in Re Gillespie, Ex parte Robarts10, where Cave J. held that the right to recover the expenses of re-exchange of a dishonoured bill, which existed prior to the Act of 1882, was preserved in the circumstances by subs. (2) of s. 97. On appeal, that judgment was upheld by the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Lindley L.J. It was a common law right of the subject prior to the Act of 1890 in this country to freely negotiate bills of exchange and promissory notes and that right is, in my opinion, preserved by s. 10.\nI consider that the portions of this legislation complained of constitute a direct infringement of the rights of all persons wishing to contract in this manner in the Province of Saskatchewan and are invalid.\nIt is quite correct, as has been pointed out, that in Winstanley's case the judgment of Duff C.J., with whom the present Chief Justice of this Court agreed, and of Rinfret J. (as he then was) proceeded on the ground that the legislation was invalid since it prevented the holder of the promissory note from enforcing in the courts the right of action given by the Bills of Exchange Act. That differs from the present case in this respect that, while there the right to sue upon such an instrument without the consent of the Debt Adjustment Board was prohibited, here the legislation goes farther and prohibits the negotiation of promissory notes, except to the limited extent mentioned, unless a permit to do so is obtained from the Saskatchewan Securities Commission.\nI would allow this appeal and declare that the sections of the Saskatchewan Securities Act which prohibit or authorize the prohibition of the negotiation of promissory notes, whatever their date of maturity, by any person in the province, and the requirement that persons desiring to negotiate such notes must be registered under the Act are ultra vires.\nI would allow the appellant his costs throughout.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The relevant facts and statutory provisions and the questions in issue in this appeal are stated in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nI agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Ritchie but in view of the differences of opinion in the Court of Appeal and in this Court I propose to state my reasons in my own words as briefly as possible.\nIt is clear that the main object of The Securities Act, 1954 of Saskatchewan is to secure that persons who carry on, in the province, the business of dealing in securities shall do so honestly and in this way to protect the public from being defrauded. For authority that legislation of this sort is within the powers of the Provincial Legislature it is sufficient to refer to the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Lymburn v. Mayland11 and that of this Court in Smith v. The Queen12.\nThe appellant does not contend that the Act as a whole is ultra vires but argues that certain sections constitute legislation in relation to the subject of Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes to which the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament extends. In dealing with this argument it is first necessary to determine what effect, if any, the impugned sections have upon the law in relation to bills and notes or, in the words used by my brother Ritchie, the \"law of bills and notes in the strict sense\". This is a matter of construction and the rule is well settled that, if the words used permit, the statute must be construed in accordance with the presumption which imputes to the legislature the intention of limiting the operation of its enactments to matters within its allotted sphere.\nSo construed the statute does, in my opinion, restrict the right of a person trading in securities to issue promissory notes; he is prohibited from so doing unless he has complied with the provisions of the Act as to registration and the Securities Commission may refuse registration or may revoke a registration which it has allowed. A person who disregards this prohibition is liable to prosecution but the statute does not purport to alter or affect the character of a promissory note which is in fact issued in breach of the statute. The rights of the holder of such a note are not impaired; he is free to enforce payment of the note, to negotiate it or to deal with it in any manner in accordance with the law of bills and notes.\nIf this view as to the construction of the statute is correct it follows, in my opinion, that the impugned sections are not legislation in relation to the matter of promissory notes; they form part of a valid scheme of provincial legislation for regulating the raising of money for business ventures in the province in such a manner as to prevent the practice of fraud. Persons who obtain money from members of the public in violation of the regulations imposed by the statute are rendered liable to prosecution regardless of the form of instrument issued to the persons from whom the money is obtained; if, as in the case at bar, that instrument is in the form of a promissory note the person violating the regulations does not thereby escape liability to prosecution but the rights of the holders of the notes are in no way affected.\nIf, contrary to the view that I have expressed, the statute had the effect of altering the character of promissory notes issued in contravention of its provisions, and particularly if it destroyed their negotiability, I would share the view of my brother Locke that its provisions are pro tanto invalid. I am in complete agreement with his statement that a provincial legislature may not extend its own jurisdiction, so as to trench upon the exclusive jurisdiction vested in Parliament by one of the heads of s. 91, by annexing to legislation within its power provisions which trespass upon such a field.\nTo conditionally prohibit the issue of promissory notes (in common with the other securities set out in the Act) for the purpose of raising money for business ventures in the province, the condition being that the issuer must first comply with regulations designed to protect the public from being defrauded, is not, in my opinion, to forbid the negotiation of promissory notes. If A makes a promissory note payable to B, he does not negotiate the note by delivering it to B. Negotiation, in the law of bills and notes, involves the transfer of the instrument from one holder to another. The meaning given to the word \"negotiate\" in the Dictionary of English Law by Earl Jowitt accords with that in all the legal dictionaries that I have consulted:\nTo negotiate a bill of exchange, promissory note, cheque or other negotiable instrument for the payment of money is to transfer it for value by delivery or endorsement.\nThis appears to be in accordance with the views expressed in the House of Lords in Jones (R. E.) Limited v. Waring and Gillow Limited13, particularly at pages 680, 687 and 695. While in that case the instrument in question was a cheque, the judgment of Lord Russell in Lewis v. Clay14 was expressly approved. The last mentioned case was that of a promissory note; at p. 226 Lord Russell said:\nFurther an examination of sections 20, 21, 29, 30 and 38 relating expressly to bills, and sections 83, 84, 88 and 89, relating to promissory notes, will make it quite clear that \"a holder in due course\" is a person to whom, after its completion by and as between the immediate parties, the bill or note has been negotiated. In the present case the plaintiff is named as payee on the face of the promissory note, and therefore is one of the immediate parties. The promissory notes have, in fact, never been negotiated within the meaning of the Act.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice. Ritchie J.:\u2014The somewhat unusual procedural background of this case is fully described in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice with whose disposition of this appeal I am in full agreement.\nThe agreement as to facts upon which the appeal is founded discloses that in January 1960, while the appellant was in the process of organizing a business designed to acquire mortgages and other interests in land with money which he proposed to borrow from the public, he formed the opinion that \"the proposed business venture would have to be organized in such manner as to be outside the scope of The Securities Act, 1954\" of Saskatchewan.\nIn order to achieve this end, the appellant. evolved a scheme whereby he registered under the Saskatchewan Partnership Act as the sole proprietor of a firm which he called the \"Western Diversified Mortgage Company\" and caused documents to be printed bearing the name of this firm and entitled \"Promissory Note and Collateral. Covenants\". These documents, the wording of which is reproduced in the reasons of the Chief Justice, were printed on coloured paper and so designed in format and general appearance as to bear a superficial resemblance to share certificates.\nIt is to be noted that the promissory note embodied in these documents is made payable 12 months after date and that the last covenant provides for deferment of the maturity date for a further period of 12 months and for an extension of the covenants for that further period.\nPromissory notes are \"securities\" within the meaning of The Securities Act, and the combined effect of ss. 6(1), 65(e) and 66(1) of that Act is to make it an offence punishable at the discretion of the provincial secretary for any person to trade in securities without being registered as therein provided, but by virtue of s. 20(2) (f) registration is not required to trade in \"negotiable promissory notes \u2026 maturing not more than a year from the date of issue\".\nIt seems to me to be obvious that in preparing his \"Promissory Note and Collateral Covenants\" the appellant phrased his firm's main undertaking to pay in the form of a promissory note \"maturing not more than one year after the date of issue\" for the express purpose of bringing the documents within the exception described in s. 20(2) (f) and thus being enabled to trade without registration in a security for trading in which registration would otherwise have been required.\nThis design was, however, thwarted by the Saskatchewan Securities Commission which exercised the powers conferred on it by s. 20(3) of the Act and ruled that the provisions of s. 20(2) (f) were not to apply to the appellant whose registration as a salesman was accordingly cancelled.\nIt is against this background that the appellant now seeks to have s. 20(3) and certain other sections of The Securities Act declared ultra vires as being legislation relating to \"Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes\", a matter allocated to the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(18) of the British North America Act.\nIt is not contended on behalf of the appellant that The Securities Act as a whole is invalid, the attack being limited to those sections which, in the appellant's submission, \"relate to and purport to deal with promissory notes\".\nAs the Chief Justice has said, the language used by Lord Atkin, speaking of The Security Frauds Prevention Act of Alberta in Lymburn v. Mayland15, applies to the statute here in question as it was found to apply to The Securities Act of Ontario in Smith v. The Queen16.\nThere can, in my view, be no doubt that the main object of The Securities Act of Saskatchewan is the regulation of trading in securities within that province but, as I understand the matter, this does not entirely dispose of the appellant's contention which involves the proposition that certain specific sections of The Securities Act are in conflict with and repugnant to the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15.\nThe latter argument appears to have found favour with Martin C.J.S. who said in the course of his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal with which McNiven J.A. concurred:\nCounsel for the plaintiff in his factum called attention to some of the sections of The Securities Act which could affect promissory notes when they were not protected by clause (f) of Section 20(2). Reference was made to section 6(1), which prohibits \"trading\" in securities (which includes promissory notes), unless the person or company trading is registered with the Commission. Under sections 7, 8, and 15, the Commission has complete discretion to refuse registration and under Section 2(21) (b), \"trading\" includes dealing in or disposing of promissory notes. By Section SO of The Securities Act the Commission has authority to declare any contract unreasonable and it is then no longer binding upon a person acquiring a security. Section 37(4) prohibits a person or company registered for \"trading\" under the Act from trading in a security of a prospecting syndicate; a person or company not registered may not so trade because of the provisions of section 6(1) referred to above. Counsel also referred to Section 32 of the Act which authorizes the Commission to impose a sequestration order as a result of which all trading in securities by the person or company affected is prohibited. The Bills of Exchange Act, Chapter 15, R.S.C. 1952, provides, in Section 47(1), that capacity to incur liability as a party to a bill is co-extensive with capacity to contract; and Section 10 of the Act provides that the rules of the common law of England, including the \"law merchant\" except insofar as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, apply to bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques.\nIt would appear that some of the provisions of The Securities Act affect promissory notes which are not protected by clause (f) of Section 20(2) and also the class which is protected by clause (f) when the protection is removed by order of the Commission under the provisions of Section 20(3). Insofar as the provisions affect promissory notes, they are ultra vires the province.\nThe Securities Act, therefore, is an Act in relation, inter alia, to promissory notes, and is, therefore, an Act in relation to a subject which, under Section 91 of the British North America Act, has been assigned exclusively to the Parliament of Canada.\nCounsel for the appellant in this appeal presented an elaborate argument in support of the contention that certain sections of The Securities Act were in conflict with the common law of England applicable to promissory notes and, therefore, repugnant to s. 10 of the Bills of Exchange Act which reads as follows:\n10. The rules of the common law of England, including the \"law merchant\" except in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, apply to bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques.\nThe true effect of this provision is, in my opinion, most succinctly and accurately stated by Dean Falconbridge in his work on \"Banking and Bills of Exchange\", 6th ed., at p. 46 where he says:\nThe effect of s. 10 would appear to be that the background of law applicable to transactions in which bills, notes or cheques play a part may be either (1) the common law of England, so far as that background consists of rules of the law of bills and notes, in the strict sense, or (2) the commercial law of a particular province, outside of the limits of the law of bills and notes in the strict sense. It is submitted that the law of bills and notes in the strict sense includes the essential elements of that law as such, and that legislation defining those elements is necessarily legislation in relation to a matter coming within item 18 of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, and therefore that, even in the absence of further federal legislation, provincial legislation would be ineffective to change the rules of the common law of England made applicable by s. 10 of the Bills of Exchange Act. On the other hand, outside of the limits of the law of bills and notes in the strict sense, as regards transactions more or less involving the use of bills or notes, the applicable law may be the law of a particular province, and not the common law of England, and in this field provincial legislation may be valid, so far as it is legislation in relation to a matter, or for a purpose, coming within any of the classes of subjects assigned to the provincial legislatures by s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act and so far as it is not inconsistent with valid federal legislation.\nIn the case of Attorney General for Alberta and Winstanley v. Atlas Lumber Co. Ltd.17, which was strongly relied on by the appellant, it was found that s. 8 of The Debt Adjustment Act of Alberta had the effect of placing a limitation on the unqualified right of the holder of a promissory note to sue, a right which, as Rinfret J. (as he then was) said in that case at p. 101, \"is of the very essence of bills of exchange\". In the present case, on the contrary, in my view none of the sections of The Securities Act of Saskatchewan which are now under attack has any effect on the form, content, validity or enforceability of promissory notes or is otherwise concerned with the \"law of bills and notes in the strict sense\". \"Issue\" is defined by s. 2(j) of the Bills of Exchange Act as meaning, \"The first delivery of a bill or note complete in form to a person who takes it as holder\". Issue without registration may expose the issuer to proceedings under the Act if the provincial secretary consents to such proceedings being instituted (see s. 66), but failure to register has no bearing on the law governing the note itself.\nThe legal nature and effect of promissory notes has been exhaustively dealt with by Parliament in the Bills of Exchange Act, but in my opinion this in no way prevents the provincial legislature from regulating the conduct of persons who issue such documents as the appellant's \"Promissory Note and Collateral Covenants\" within the province. The fact that Parliament has enacted the law governing promissory notes does not preclude the provincial legislature from imposing registration requirements on individuals seeking to issue them. With the greatest respect to those who may hold a different view, I am of opinion that these sections neither relate to nor purport to deal with the law of bills and notes and that the legislation is a valid exercise of provincial power.\nAs I indicated at the outset, I would dispose of this matter as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Schumiatcher, Moss & Lavery, Regina.\nSolicitor for the defendants, respondent and the intervenant: Roy S.

Ltd. for the purpose of determining the respective rights of the parties to the compensation. The city had conveyed the property to Maritime Telegraph and Telephone Co. for a cash consideration of $87,520 and certain covenants on the part of that company obliging it to construct a building or buildings on the land or to reconvey for the cash consideration if it determined not to build. With the consent of the city, the telephone company arranged to transfer the property to Vaughan Construction in exchange for other property and the execution by the transferee company of covenants in favour of the city similar to those already executed.\nThe trial judge held that the city was entitled to the whole of the compensation with the exception of $87,520. On appeal, it was held that it was for the arbitrator to determine both the amount and the apportionment of the compensation. On appeal from the award which followed, whereby the arbitrator fixed compensation for both claimants, the Supreme Court in banco held, with one member dissenting, that Vaughan Construction was entitled to the whole of the compensation on the ground that the city was not an owner of the property as defined by the Expropriation Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 91. The city appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nWhen Vaughan acquired the fee simple, it did so subject to an equitable interest in the land held by the city as a result of the covenant to reconvey in certain defined circumstances. This right to reconveyance was not distinguishable from a right of pre-emption, a right which will be specifically enforced and its violation restrained by injunction. The rights of the city were superior to those held by one who has merely a right of pre-emption because the respondent company had no uncontrolled right to determine whether or not it would reconvey. Unless it complied with the building covenants within a reasonable time, the city could have enforced a reconveyance. Birmingham Canal Co. v. Cartwright (1879), 11 Ch. D. 421, referred to; London & South Western Railway Co. v. Gomm (1882), 20 Ch. D. 562, applied; Manchester Ship Canal Co. v. Manchester Racecourse Co., [1901] 2 Ch. 37, explained; Frobisher v. Canadian Pipelines & Petroleums Ltd., [1960] S.C.R. 126, followed.\nThe interests of Vaughan and of the city in the land were destroyed by the expropriation and the owners of these interests were both entitled to share in the compensation. The $87,520, being the equivalent of the land which Vaughan had transferred to the telephone company in order to acquire the property, should first be deducted from the compensation money. The balance should then be divided equally between Vaughan and the city, disallowing any allowance for compulsory taking but allowing interest as proposed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco1, denying the appellant's right to share in a compensation award on expropriation of certain land. Appeal allowed.\nF. P. Varcoe, Q.C., R. M. Fielding, Q.C., and I. Goldsmith, for the appellant.\nA. G. Cooper, Q.C., for the respondent, Vaughan Construction Co. Ltd. M. C. H. Jones, for the respondent, Her Majesty the Queen.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Cartwright, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The City of Halifax appeals from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco2, which denied its right to share in a compensation award on the ground that the city had no interest in the property expropriated. In my opinion the city had an interest in the property and the appeal should be allowed.\nThe city acquired the property in 1947 by grant from the Government of Canada. It was valuable land on which the city wished to see erected a modern tax producing building. Consequently, in 1951, the city conveyed the property to Maritime Telegraph and Telephone Company for a modest cash consideration of $87,520 and certain covenants on the part of the telephone company obligating it to build or to reconvey for the cash consideration paid if it determined not to build.\nThe telephone company decided that the land was unsuitable for its purposes and it arranged, with the consent of the city, to transfer the property to Vaughan Construction Company Limited in exchange for other property and the execution by the transferee company of covenants in favour of the city similar to those already executed.\nThe covenants are that Vaughan Construction Company Limited, its successors or assigns\n1. Will construct upon the lands hereinbefore described a building or buildings of the type described as \"first-class buildings\" in the Halifax City Charter;\n2. That one at least of such buildings shall be an office building;\n3. That the construction of such building or buildings shall commence as soon as practicably may be after delivery of These Presents;\n4. That prior to the commencement of the actual construction thereof it will submit to the City of Halifax the general plans of any building proposed to be erected, together with a plan showing the location upon the said lands of such buildings;\n5. That a first-class building to be erected on the said lands shall be subject to taxation under the provisions of the Halifax City Charter as real property assessable in the name of the owner thereof; 6. That if, after the delivery of These Presents to the City of Halifax, Vaughan Construction Company Limited, its successors or assigns, shall determine not to proceed with the construction of a building or buildings upon the lands hereinbefore described, as hereinbefore provided, Vaughan Construction Company Limited, its successors or assigns, at the request of the City of Halifax will reconvey the said lands to the City of Halifax for the cash consideration of Eighty-seven Thousand Five Hundred and Twenty Dollars ($87,520.00).\nThe deed further provided:\nIt is intended by the parties hereto that the burden of the foregoing covenants shall run with the lands hereinbefore described until such building or buildings shall have been constructed and no longer; and that upon the construction of such building or buildings in compliance with the foregoing covenants the burden of the foregoing covenants shall no longer run with the lands; and this Deed of Covenants is accepted by the City of Halifax and the said consideration paid upon such intent and understanding.\nExcept for the substitution of the new contracting party, covenants 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are the same as those entered into by the telephone company. The fifth covenant is new.\nThis transaction was completed in November of 1954. Within three months Vaughan Construction, without the knowledge of the city, was negotiating for the sale of the property with the Government of the Province of Nova Scotia and with other possible purchasers. The province expropriated the property on August 4, 1955. The city, on receiving notice of this event, filed a claim for compensation. The arbitrator made an award of $280,000 together with interest from June 18, 1956 at 5 per cent per annum and an allowance of 5 per cent for compulsory taking. He did not, however, attempt to apportion the award between the conflicting claimants.\nIn January of 1957 the city commenced an action against Vaughan Construction for the purpose of determining the respective rights of the parties to the compensation. In June of that year Mr. Justice Doull held that the city was entitled to the whole of the compensation with the exception of the sum of $87,520, which is the sum stated in the sixth covenant. On appeal from this judgment, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco held that it was for the arbitrator to determine both the amount of the compensation and its apportionment between the conflicting interests. Consequently, in April 1959, the arbitrator decided that of the total award of $280,000 the city was entitled to $50,000, together with interest on this sum and a 5 per cent allowance for compulsory taking. On appeal from the arbitrator's award, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, with Doull J. dissenting, held that Vaughan Construction was entitled to the whole of the compensation on the ground that the city was not an owner of the property as defined by the Nova Scotia Expropriation Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 91. It is from this judgment that the city appeals and, in my opinion, it is entitled to succeed on the ground that the covenant to reconvey in certain defined circumstances, gave the city an interest in the land.\nThe first 5 covenants are self-explanatory. The city had valuable vacant land which it was ready to sell to a suitable purchaser in order to produce tax revenue. The first 4 covenants are positive covenants. They could not be the subject-matter of an action for specific performance and their breach would give rise only to an action in damages.\nThey do, however, impose an obligation on Vaughan Construction to commence construction as soon as it was practicable, which means within a reasonable time. The company could not postpone its determination not to proceed with construction within the terms of covenant 6 for an indefinite time. It acquired the property on November 6, 1954. The province expropriated on August 4, 1955. If the province had not done this, I would have said that the time was approaching when the city, in a properly constituted action, would have been in a position to claim a reconveyance on payment of $87,520 on the ground that the company, after the lapse of a reasonable time, had determined not to build. During a period of 9 months' ownership the company had demolished the old buildings. It had been looking for possible purchasers but it had made no effort to comply with the first five covenants.\nI do not, however, rest my judgment on the probability that such a finding of fact might have been made. My opinion is that when Vaughan acquired the fee simple, it did so subject to an equitable interest in the land held by the city as a result of covenant 6. If before expropriation Vaughan had contracted to sell these lands, without the consent of the city, the sale could have been restrained and the right to a reconveyance enforced. Why then should it be held that Vaughan is entitled to all the compensation award for a forcible taking?\nThe majority opinion of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco held that the rights of the city were solely contractual and that covenant No. 6 did not confer an interest in land on the city. In my respectful opinion, there is error in this finding. It is true that the city was not the holder of an option which it could exercise at any time. On the other hand, Vaughan could not prevent the exercise of the city's right under covenant 6 by doing nothing and asserting at the same time that it had made no determination. Vaughan had to build within a reasonable time and only by compliance with covenants 1 to 5 could it defeat the city's right to the reconveyance under covenant 6.\nWhat is the juridical nature of this right to reconveyance? I do not think that it is distinguishable from what has been called a right of pre-emption or a right of first refusal. An owner of land contracts that if he decides to sell he will give X the first right to buy at a stated price or at a price to be determined according to a bona fide offer made by another. The owner may decide never to sell and X cannot compel him to sell. Nevertheless, X has an equitable interest in the land. The rights of the city in this case are superior to those held by one who has merely a right of pre-emption because Vaughan had no uncontrolled right to determine whether or not it would reconvey. Unless it complied with the building covenants within a reasonable time, the city could have enforced a reconveyance. The rule is that a right of preemption will be specifically enforced and its violation restrained by injunction. (Fry, Specific Performance, 6th ed., 24; Birmingham Canal Co. v. Cartwright3.)\nThe decision in the Birmingham Canal case was that the covenant containing the right of pre-emption was not obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities. But I do not take the reasoning to be that the matter sounds in contract and not in property. This is quite clear when Fry J. said:\nI think that wherever a right or interest is presently vested in A or his heirs, although the right may not arise until the happening of some contingency which may not take effect within the period limited by the rule against perpetuities, such right or interest is not obnoxious to that rule and for this reason. The reason given is that the total interest in the land is divided between covenantor and covenantee, who together can alienate the land absolutely. It was this theory of destructibility of interest as preventing an infraction of the rule that was rejected in London & South Western Railway Company v. Gomm4, both at the hearing and on appeal.\nIn Gomm, however, where the covenant was to reconvey should the land at any time be required for railway purposes, Kay J. was of the opinion that such a covenant did not create an interest in land. In that finding, he was expressly over-ruled by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the right to call for a conveyance is an equitable interest or equitable estate. It should be noted that in Gomm the right was contingent in this sense that it did not arise until the land was required for railway purposes. In the present case the right to the conveyance does not arise until there is default under the building covenants indicating a determination not to proceed or an express declaration to that effect but in my opinion there is no difference between Gomm and the present case except that the interest created by the covenant in Gomm offended the rule against perpetuities and this one does not.\nThe Court of Appeal, in Gomm, agreed with Kay J. up to and including his consideration of the Birmingham Canal case. The rejection of the Birmingham Canal case in the reasons of Jessel M.R. was based on his rejection of the theory of Fry J. that a limitation does not offend the rule against perpetuities when it may be terminated by the agreement of all interested parties and not upon any theory that a covenant to reconvey did not create an interest in land.\nThe law on this subject is stated in 29 Halsbury, 3rd ed., 298, in these terms:\nAn option to arise on any intended sale or other particular kind of alienation by the owner, for example, a right of pre-emption or first refusal, is subject to the rule against perpetuities, and to bind the land or property must comply with it, unless the right is conferred by statute.\nThe case of Manchester Ship Canal Company v. Manchester Racecourse Company5, raises a certain difficulty. The racecourse company agreed with the canal company that if it should be at any time proposed to use their racecourse for dock purposes, the racecourse company would give the canal company the right of first refusal. Farwell J. held at the trial, on the authority of Gomm, that this right of first refusal created an interest in land and could be enforced against an intending purchaser with notice. He also held that even if the right did not create an interest in land, the intending purchaser with notice of the prior contract could be restrained from carrying out the purchase. His ratio on the first point is contained in the following paragraph:\nNow, having regard to the way in which London and South Western Ry. Co. v. Gomm (20 Ch. D. 562) was decided, it is plain, I think that the words used in clause 3, although inartistic, may give an interest in the land in the sense that they may be construed so as to limit a use to arise on an event in the future very similar to the use suggested to be raised in Gomm's Case. Gomm's Case was also a case of an option of pre-emption, in that case at a price named. In this case the price is ascertainable by the fact that it is to be the same as that offered by any other company or person.\nThe Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of Farwell J. but on different grounds. They held that the clause did not create an interest in the land but they did hold that the canal company was entitled to enforce their right as against the racecourse company and the intending purchaser on the ground that the contract to give the canal company the first refusal involved a negative contract not to part with the racecourse to anyone else without giving them that first refusal. The case was held to be within the principle of Lumley v. Wagner6. The previous decision in Gomm was not mentioned in the Court of Appeal.\nI can understand the difficulties of construction of the covenant in the Manchester Ship Canal case. The clause in question was part of an agreement which had received statutory confirmation. A good part of the reasons of Farwell J. was concerned with the problem of uncertainty\u2014whether he could assign any meaning to the clause at all. At p. 360 he said:\nThere is of course a greater difficulty here, because, although the legislature has declared the contract intelligible, that does not necessarily enable me to comprehend it.\nHe then proceeded to work out the rights and obligations of the parties in a context where the racecourse company was purporting to comply with its obligation to give a right of first refusal by making an offer to the canal company at a price far in excess of what it was prepared to take from a third party. An injunction was granted restraining the racecourse company from selling the racecourse to any person without first offering it to the canal company at the same cash price which the intending purchaser was offering.\nThe Court of Appeal in affirming Farwell J. held that an opportunity of exercising the right of first refusal had not in fact been given. But in dealing with the right of action against the intending purchaser they founded their judgment on the principle of Lumley v. Wagner, supra, rather than upon the finding of Farwell J. that the right of first refusal created an equitable interest in land which would be binding upon a purchaser with notice. They did not think that the clause in question did create an interest in land and in view of the uncertainties inherent in the clause their finding may be supportable on that ground. But I do not take it that they were enunciating any general principle or that they intended to ignore the principle enunciated in Gomm. On this point, which has already been considered in this Court, I wish to adopt the statement of principle of Cartwright J. in Frobisher v. Canadian Pipelines & Petroleums Ltd.7:\nAn expression of opinion by the learned Lords Justices who composed the Court in the Manchester case is, of course, entitled to great weight but if they had intended to negative the principle enunciated in Gomm it seems to me that they would have stated their reason for so doing. Be this as it may, in so far as the two cases are in conflict I prefer the decision in Gomm on the point with which we are concerned and think that we should follow it.\nMy conclusion is that at the time of expropriation both Vaughan and the city had an interest in this land. Vaughan held the fee simple subject to the equitable interest of the city to enforce a reconveyance in certain defined events. Both these interests were destroyed by the expropriation and the owners of these interests are both entitled to share in the compensation. I do not know how the arbitrator came to award $50,000 as compensation for the city's interest. It appears to be a purely arbitrary figure. If at the moment of expropriation Vaughan had come to the city with an offer to purchase, the completion of that offer would have required the agreement of both Vaughan and the city. Neither could have imposed terms on the other. Vaughan could, however, have destroyed the city's interest by complying with its covenants. In the circumstances, I would first deduct from the compensation money the $87,520, being the equivalent of the land which Vaughan had transferred to the telephone company in order to acquire the property, and then divide the balance equally between Vaughan and the city, disallowing any 5 per cent allowance for compulsory taking but allowing the interest as provided in the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs both here and in the Supreme Court in banco against Vaughan Construction Company Limited. There should be no costs to or against Her Majesty the Queen in the right of the Province of Nova Scotia. The order for costs made by Judge Pottier on June 19, 1959 should stand. Out of the compensation award of $280,000 Vaughan Construction Company Limited is entitled to $183,760 and the City of Halifax to $96,240, both sums bearing interest at 5 per cent per annum from June 18, 1956.\nLocke J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment to be delivered in this matter by my brother Judson and I agree with his opinion that at the date of the expropriation the City of Halifax had an interest in the land within the meaning of that term in s. 1 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 91. This appears to me to follow from the decision of this Court in Frobisher v. Canadian Pipelines & Petroleums Ltd.8, which approved the judgment of the Court of Appeal in London and South Western Railway v. Gomm9.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that judgment be entered in the terms proposed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T. C.

The plaintiff brought an action for a declaration that the lease terminated at the expiry of the said period, i.e. September 16, 1959. The lease contained a clause giving the lessee the right and power at any time to pool or combine the leased lands with other adjoining lands (any one such, pool or unit not to exceed one drilling unit) when such pooling or combining was necessary to conform with any government regulations or orders. Drilling operations on, or production of leased substances from, any land included in such unit were to have the same effect in continuing the lease as if such operations or production were upon the leased land.\nThe defendant S acquired leases of the oil and gas rights on the three other quarters of the same section, on one of which a gas well was completed in 1952. As there was no market for the gas at that time the well was shut in and so remained until July 1959. In May 1959 a market was available and, as it was necessary under the regulations to obtain a permit to produce the well and to establish a spacing unit, an application was made to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board for an order to establish a special spacing unit, to consist of the north half and the southwest quarter of the section. Such an order was made to come into force on July 1, 1959. The defendants contended that the lease was in full force and effect at all times, that a pooling notice given to the plaintiff in 1955 was necessary in order to conform with government regulations and, in the alternative, pleaded that if the pooling notice of 1955 was ineffective then the pooling was accomplished when the special spacing unit was prescribed in 1959.\nThe trial judge held that the lease terminated on September 16, 1959. An appeal from that judgment was dismissed by the Appellate Division and the defendants then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. There were no regulations in existence which affirmatively required the pooling of the plaintiff's land with the adjoining lands, and it was inconceivable that the Board would, of its own motion or on the application of either party, direct such pooling when the parties had themselves agreed upon the terms upon which such pooling should be brought about. The language of the pooling clause of the lease was to be construed literally in accordance with the plain meaning of the language employed and, as the defendants had not shown that in the circumstances pooling was necessary to conform to the regulations, the appeal consequently failed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Primrose J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. H. Laycraft, for the defendants, appellants.\nJ. M. Robertson, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Locke, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 dismissing the appeal of the present appellants, the defendants in the action, from the judgment at the trial delivered by Primrose J.\nBy a lease in writing dated September 16, 1949, the respondent leased to Wilbur L. Griffith all the petroleum and natural gas and related hydrocarbons, except coal and valuable stone, within, upon or under the southwest quarter of section thirteen in township 21, range 29, west of the 4th meridian in Alberta, for a term of ten years from the date of the instrument. The lessee's interest subsequently, by assignments, became vested in the appellant companies in varying proportions.\nThe action was brought for a declaration that the lease terminated at the expiry of the said period. The appellants contend that it was continued in full force and effect by reason of the matters to be now stated.\nBy the terms of the lease the lessee was entitled to enter upon the said lands for the purpose, inter alia, of drilling for oil and gas and it was provided that, if operations for the drilling of a well were not commenced within one year from the date of the lease, it should terminate unless the lessee should have paid to the lessor $160 as annual acreage rental, such payment to confer the privilege of deferring the commencement of drilling operations for a period of one year, and in like manner and upon like payments the commencement of drilling operations should be further deferred for like periods successively.\nParagraph 9 reads as follows:\nThe Lessee is hereby given the right and power at any time and from time to time to pool or combine the said lands, or any portion thereof, with other lands adjoining the said lands, but so that any one such pool or unit (herein referred to as a \"unit\") shall not exceed one drilling unit as hereinbefore defined, when such pooling, or combining is necessary in. order to conform with any regulations or orders of the Government of the Province of Alberta or any other authoritative body, which are now or may hereafter be in force in relation thereto. In the event of such pooling or combining, the Lessor shall, in lieu of the royalties elsewhere herein specified, receive on production of leased substances from the said unit, only \"such portion of the royalties stipulated herein as the area of the said lands placed in the unit bears to the total area of lands in such unit. Drilling operations on, or production of leased substances from, any land included in such unit shall have the same effect in continuing this Lease in force and effect during the term hereby granted, or any extension thereof, as to all the said lands, as if such operation or production were upon or from the said lands, or some portion thereof.\nThe expression \"drilling unit\" was defined in para. 1 as follows:\n\"Drilling unit\" shall mean a section, legal sub-division or other unit of land representing the minimum area in which any well may be drilled on or in the vicinity of the said lands as defined or prescribed by or under any law of the Province of Alberta now or hereafter in effect governing the spacing of petroleum and\/or natural gas wells.\nThe payment of royalties referred to in para. 9 was provided for by para. 2. If gas or oil were produced from the leased lands the lessor was to receive in effect one eighth of its market value, such royalty to be paid monthly.\nThe appellant Shell Oil Company acquired leases of the oil and gas rights on the three other quarter sections in section 13 and drilled a well on the northeast quarter, which was spudded in on July 4, 1952 and completed as a gas well on November 4, 1952. Natural gas was produced from the well for test purposes in varying periods in the years 1952, 1954, 1958 and from April 20 to April 25, 1959. When, however, the well was completed there was no available market for the gas and the well was shut in. On August 2, 1955, the appellant Shell Oil Company, which at that time held by assignment from Griffith the entire lessee's interest, gave a written notice to the lessor in the following terms:\nTake notice that Shell Oil Company as Lessee by assignment from Wilbur L. Griffith named as Lessee in a Petroleum and Natural Gas Lease, dated the 16th day of September, A.D. 1949, granted by you and covering all the petroleum and natural gas and related hydrocarbons except coal and valuable stone, within, upon or under the SW\u00bc of Section 13 in Township 21, Range 29, West of the 4th Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, hereby pools and combines the said SW\u00bc of Section 13 in Township 21, Range 29, West of the 4th Meridian with the NE\u00bc, the NW\u00bc and the SE\u00bc of the said Section 13, so as to form a drilling unit as defined in the said lease and as prescribed by regulations of the Government of the Province of Alberta.\nThere was no production from the gas well on the north-east quarter at the time this notice was given. No well was drilled at any time upon the respondent's lands.\nThe said appellant gave a similar notice under the terms of a lease of the southeast quarter, expressed in similar terms, granted by Herbert Morris on July 19, 1950. Morris had died and the notice was given to E. M. Gunderson, the executor of his estate. That lease was for a five year term and, in an action between the Shell Oil Company and the executor decided at a time when there was no production of gas from the northeast quarter, it was held that the lease had expired by effluxion of time.\nThe decision at the trial of this action was sustained by the Appellate Division on appeal and that judgment was affirmed by the judgment of this Court3.\nIn May 1959 a market for gas was available. The well on the northeast quarter had been shut in for nearly seven years and it was necessary under the regulations to obtain a permit to produce the well and to establish a spacing unit. On May 21, 1959, Devon-Palmers Oils Ltd. applied to the Board for an order to establish a special spacing unit, to consist of the north half and the southwest quarter of section 13, and such an order was made dated June 24, 1959, to come into force on July 1,1959. It was a term of the order that in the event it was not rescinded before October 31, 1959, the Board should review it and might call a public hearing during the month of November 1959 for that purpose. The order was not varied in any manner material to the issues in this action and continued in effect at the time this action was commenced.\nOn July 27, 1959, Devon-Palmer Oils Ltd. sent to the respondent a copy of the order of the Board and informed him that a cheque for his royalty for the month of July would be forwarded to him on the 20th of August, and cheques were sent for such royalty for that month and for the month of August. The statements enclosed with these payments stated that the royalty was payable pursuant to the pooling notice dated August 2, 1955. The respondent returned the cheques and the company informed him on December 7, 1959, that it would thereafter hold the royalties to which he was entitled in trust for his account.\nUnder the provisions of The Oil and Gas Resources Conservation Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 66, as amended, which was in force when the lease was made and the provisions of The Oil and Gas Resources Conservation Act, 1950, and the regulations made thereunder, which were in force when the well was drilled on the northeast quarter, a person desiring to drill a well was required to obtain a license from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board set up under these statutes, permitting this to be done.\nThe expression \"spacing unit\", which did not appear in the earlier statute, was defined to mean the area allocated to a well for the purpose of drilling for and producing oil and gas. Section 20 provided that no person shall apply for a license to drill a well within a spacing unit unless he is entitled, or is the authorized representative of the person who is entitled, to all the drilling and producing rights for the oil and gas for the recovery of which the well is to be drilled.\nThe appellant Shell Oil Company, as stated, had acquired all such rights for the four quarter sections comprising section 13. No evidence was given at the trial as to the terms of the license obtained in advance of drilling the well on the northeast quarter and no spacing unit appears to have been established prior to June 24, 1959.\nThe extensive powers vested in the Board included the power to determine the area of the spacing unit for every well in the province, and the regulations in force at the time the well was drilled provided that, subject to the provisions of the regulations, the spacing unit for an oil well should be approximately 40 acres and for a gas well approximately 640 acres. The regulations provided, however, that the Board might, in a case where in its opinion it was proper to do so, prescribe a spacing unit of any size or shape or with any boundaries, and evidence was given by the witness Brant that in some gas fields such units were four sections in extent, whereas others were as little as one quarter section.\nAs pleaded, the respondent's case was that the pooling notice given on August 2, 1955, was ineffective since the appellant at that time had no interest in the southeast quarter by reason of the expiry of the Morris lease and, further, that when that notice was given the pooling or combining was not necessary \"in order to conform with any regulations or orders of the Government of the Province of Alberta or any other authoritative body which were then in force in relation thereto.\" This referred to the provisions, of the first sentence of para. 9 of, the agreement.\nThe statement of defence alleged that the lease from the respondent was in full force and effect at all times, that the pooling notice referred to was necessary in order to conform with the regulations and; in the alternative, pleaded that if the pooling notice of 1955 was ineffective then the pooling was accomplished when the special spacing unit was prescribed by the Board, effective July 1, 1959.\nThe defendants also counterclaimed for a declaration that the lease was in full force and effect. The plaintiff did not file any reply to the statement of defence and simply repeated the statement of claim by way of defence to the counterclaim.\nThe lease in question is upon a printed form, the names of the parties, the description of the land and other formal provisions being typewritten. According to the respondent, the document in this form was handed to him by Griffith and returned by the former signed some days later. Shortly thereafter the lease was assigned by Griffith to the Shell Oil Company.\nAt the time the lease was made, the regulations of the Board approved by order in council under the statute of 1942, as amended on December 2, 1947, provided that, subject to the other provisions of the regulations, well spacing should be one well to every 40 acres, and in surveyed territory one well to every legal subdivision, provided that the Board might prescribe surface locations at which wells may be drilled and well spacing other than one well to every 40 acres. It was not until the adoption of the regulations under the Act of 1950 that the normal areas of the spacing units differed as between gas and oil wells. This fact renders obscure the meaning to be attributed to para. 1(b) defining drilling unit as meaning a section, legal subdivision or other unit of land representing the minimum area on which any well may be drilled. Had the lease been made after the 1950 regulations were passed, it might properly be inferred, in my opinion, that the reference to a unit one section in extent was intended to apply if gas were discovered, but no such inference is permissible in this situation.\nThe difficult question to determine is whether, in the circumstances in this case, pooling or combining was necessary in 1959 to conform with the regulations. While the statement of claim merely alleged that it was not necessary when the notice was given on August 2, 1955, the defence put in issue the question as to whether it was necessary at any time during the term of the lease and this must be determined. The lease, as stated, was proposed in its present form by Griffith and, in my opinion, if there were ambiguity in the language employed and doubt raised as to the meaning of such language, it should, if need be, be construed in accordance with the maxim verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem (Leake: 8th ed., p. 158).\nThis rule of construction is to be applied only where other rules of construction fail. In the present matter I find it difficult to understand in what circumstances it could have been contemplated that it was necessary to pool the respondent's land with the adjoining lands to conform with the regulations. There were no regulations in existence which affirmatively required any such pooling and it seems to me inconceivable that the Board would, of its own motion or on the application of either party, direct such pooling when the parties had themselves agreed upon the terms upon which such pooling should be brought about. If, as I think to be the case, what the proposed lessee intended to provide for was a provision for pooling when it was necessary to include the leased land with other lands in order to obtain the approval of the Board to a spacing unit and to obtain a permit, if one were required, to produce gas or oil discovered on any part of the proposed unit, unfortunately the language employed is quite insufficient for such purpose. To assign any such meaning to the clause would be to read into it words that are not to be found in the clause as drafted.\nIn my view, this portion of the language of para. 9 is to be construed literally in accordance with the plain meaning of the language employed and, as the appellants have not shown that in the circumstances pooling was necessary to conform to the regulations, the appeal must fail.\nI would add that, with great respect, I am unable to agree with the opinion of Mr. Justice Johnson that any formal written notice of the election of the lessees to exercise the option to pool was necessary. That the lessees had elected to exercise the option was, in my opinion, sufficiently indicated by the application to the Board to fix the special spacing unit in May 1959 and the letters directed to the respondent enclosing the royalties to which he would have been entitled had the pooling been effective.\nI come to the conclusion that this appeal should fail with regret as I am by no means satisfied that the result accords with the intention of the parties to the instrument. However, since it is not sought to impeach the instrument or to suggest that through mutual mistake it fails to express the real agreement, the matter must be determined upon what I consider to be the clear meaning of the language employed.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brother Locke and also, subject only to one reservation, with his reasons.\nI do not find it necessary to form an opinion as to whether the lessee in the lease made by the respondent, dated September 16, 1949, intended that that document should include a provision for pooling if it became necessary to include the leased land with other lands in order to obtain the approval of the Board to a spacing unit and to obtain a permit, if one were required, to produce gas or oil discovered on any part of the proposed unit. I agree that the lease, on its true construction, does not so provide.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Locke.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Chambers, Might, Saucier, Peacock, Jones, Black & Gain, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\n1 (1961), 34 W.W.R. 117, 26 D.L.R.

Fleming, Deceased (Claimants) Respondents.\n1961: June 08; 1961 October 03.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nExpropriation\u2014Previous sale of parcels adjoining expropriated strip\u2014Purchasers agreeing to purchase portions of strip at a higher price under option clause\u2014Proper valuation\u2014Allowance for compulsory taking denied.\nThe appellant municipality expropriated part of the respondents\u2019 farm for a parkway, the expropriated lands forming a strip which bisected the said farm from south to north approximately at its centre. The respondents had previously entered into agreements of sale of the west and east parcels of the farm, but had reserved from sale the parkway lands and a small additional strip. Each of the agreements contained a provision under which the respective purchasers were to purchase one-half of the parkway lands lying between their respective purchases at $15,000 per acre, if called upon by the respondents to do so at any time within three years.\nThe appellant\u2019s offer, following expropriation, was refused and the parties went to arbitration. The resulting award was appealed on two grounds: (1) that the arbitrator had erred in taking into account the option provisions in the agreements of sale in arriving at the amount of compensation to be awarded and (2) that he erred in awarding any allowance for compulsory taking. The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal with respect to the second ground but the majority dismissed the appeal with respect to the first ground.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nIt was undisputed that the respondents were entitled to receive from the expropriating authority the value to them of the parkway lands at the date of expropriation. On the uncontradicted evidence it also could not be disputed that\u2014except for the effect of the agreements of sale\u2014the highest value to the respondents of those lands was $12,500 per acre. The form of words used in the agreements could therefore have no other purpose than to assure to respondents a total price worked out on the basis of $12,800 per acre for all their lands.\nWhile the respondents were free to make any bargain the purchasers were willing to agree to, they could not by attributing a higher value to the strip to be expropriated and a correspondingly lesser value to the balance of their property, thereby throw upon the expropriating authority the obligation to pay out of public funds more than the expropriated lands were in truth worth to the respondents as owners.\nPer Kerwin C.J., dissenting: The arbitrator was correct in finding that the value to the owners was not less than the amount at which they could have sold the expropriated lands under valid enforceable contracts at any time within three years from the restrictive dates of purchase of the parcels which had been sold. As found by the Courts below, the agreements were bona fide.\nPer Curiam: A motion that the amount of the award should be varied by the addition of 10 per cent for compulsory taking was dismissed in view of the judgment in Drew v. The Queen, [1961] S.C.R. 614.\nAPPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing in part an appeal from an award of compensation by Forsyth C.C.J for certain lands expropriated by the appellant. Appeal allowed, Kerwin C.J. dissenting.\nHon. R.L. Kellock, Q.C., and A.P.G. Joy, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and J.J. Carthy, for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014Although counsel for the appellant studiously avoided describing the agreement between the Fleming estate and responsible purchasers as fraudulent, it appears impossible to allow the appeal unless one comes to the conclusion that the parties thereto and their advisers conspired to concoct a scheme which was a sham and which was entered into for the express purpose of forcing the appellant to pay at the rate of $15,000, instead of $12,500 per acre. It was suggested that if the parties could agree upon the figure of $15,000, they might have agreed to twice that sum, but I am satisfied that, even if one could imagine the parties entering into any such pact, the Courts would be able to deal with that sort of contrivance. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the arrangement was not arrived at between parties dealing at arm\u2019s length. In fact, no attempt was made by the municipality to suggest that this was not the case.\nThe arbitrator was correct in finding that the value to the owners was not less than the amount at which they could have sold the lands under valid enforceable contracts at any time within three years from the restrictive dates of purchase of the parcels which the estate had sold. The Court of Appeal had no difficulty in determining that the agreements were bona fide and affirmed the order of the arbitrator. Not only has no good reason been shown to set aside the concurrent findings of the Courts below, but upon a review of the evidence I have come to the same conclusion.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The respondents served notice that they would contend that the amount of the award should be varied by the addition of an allowance of ten per cent for compulsory taking. In view of the judgment of this Court in Drew v. The Queen[2], this motion must be dismissed but without costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, dismissing in part an appeal from an award made by His Honour Judge Forsyth of the County Court of the County of York fixing the compensation payable to respondents for certain lands expropriated by appellant for the Don Valley Parkway pursuant to by-law 902 of the Council of the appellant municipality passed on February 10, 1959.\nThe lands expropriated (hereinafter referred to as the parkway lands) consisted of 29.33 acres of raw farm lands forming part of a farm of the respondents of approximately 241.08 acres, bounded on the south by Eglinton Avenue East in the appellant municipality, and running north to the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Don Mills Road forming its westerly boundary and the Canadian National Railways its easterly boundary.\nGenerally speaking the parkway lands consist of a narrow strip some 2,000 feet in length and 200 feet in width, which bisects the said farm from south to north approximately at its centre, the said strip widening slightly at its northerly end and more so at its southerly end to allow for a clover leaf at Eglinton Avenue. A parcel composed of approximately 97 acres of the farm lies to the west of the parkway lands and a parcel of approximately 111.26 acres lies to the east.\nOn September 22 and October 7, 1958 respectively, the respondents entered into agreements of sale of these two parcels but retained from sale the parkway lands and a small additional strip along part of the west limit of the parkway lands of 2.995 acres, the reason given for the retention of the additional strip being the possibility in the minds of the respondents that it might also be required for the parkway.\nThe sale of each of the two easterly and westerly parcels was at a price of $12,500 per acre, except for the extreme easterly part of the easterly parcel which was subject to a zoning restriction for residential purposes. The agreement of sale of this parcel, however, provided that if this zoning could be changed so as to permit of the construction of apartment houses, the price of the lands subject to the said restriction would be increased by $6,250 per acre, bringing the price up to the $12,500 per acre figure. The purchaser undertook to apply for such rezoning.\nEach of the agreements for sale contained a somewhat unusual provision under which the respective purchasers were to purchase one-half of the parkway lands lying between their respective purchases at $15,000 per acre, if called upon by the respondents to do so at any time within three years. This option was not exercised by the respondents with respect to either purchaser. On February 10, 1959, by-law 902 of the appellant municipality was passed expropriating the parkway lands. On October 15, 1959, the appellant offered to pay the respondents for the lands taken for the parkway at the rate of $12,500 per acre, but that offer was refused and the parties went to arbitration.\nThe learned arbitrator awarded the respondents compensation in the amount of $439,150, being at the rate of $15,000 per acre plus 5 per cent for compulsory taking, with interest at 5 per cent from the date of by-law 902, and in so doing based himself upon the option provisions contained in the said agreements. He held that apart from these provisions the value of the lands taken for the parkway, for the highest and best use to which they could be put, was $12,500 per acre.\nAppeal was taken to the Court of Appeal on two grounds\u2014(1) that the arbitrator erred in taking into account the option provisions in the agreements of sale above referred to in arriving at the amount of compensation to be awarded, and (2) that he erred in awarding any allowance for compulsory taking.\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal with respect to the second ground but the majority dismissed the appeal with respect to the first ground. LeBel, J.A. dissenting, would have allowed the appeal with respect to that ground as well.\nThere are concurrent findings of fact as follows.\n(i) That the best use to which the lands in question could be put was industrial development.\n(ii) That their market value for this purpose was $12,500 per acre.\n(iii) That the agreements entered into by the respondents under which they had a right exercisable within three years to compel the purchasers to purchase the lands which have now been expropriated at $15,000 per acre were bona fide and enforceable agreements.\nMoreover the following further matters appear to be clear on the evidence and indeed were not seriously disputed.\n(i) That before the agreements in question were entered into the respondents\u2019 advisers knew what part of the land was going to be expropriated. (ii) That it was of course possible but extremely improbable that there would be any change in the proposal to expropriate.\n(iii) That the commercial value per acre of the lands to be expropriated was certainly not more than the average per acre of the whole block of land owned by the respondents.\n(iv) That the purchasers under the agreements were willing, if necessary, to pay a total price equivalent to an average of $12,800 per acre for all the land owned by respondents.\n(v) That the clauses in the agreements under which the purchasers could be compelled to pay $15,000 per acre for the parkway lands were designed with the imminent expropriation in mind and for the purpose of fixing a \u201cfloor price\u201d which would be payable by the expropriating authority.\nNo evidence was called to show the reason why the purchasers agreed to this unusual term, but it was obviously a matter of indifference to them how the total price which they were willing to pay if necessary, was calculated.\nShortly stated, the respondents\u2019 contention is that the value of the parkway lands to them could not be less than $15,000 per acre, the amount which they were entitled to receive under the agreements, and that contention was accepted by the learned arbitrator and by the majority in the Court below.\nIt is undisputed that the respondents are entitled to receive from the expropriating authority the value of the land to them at the date of expropriation. On the uncontradicted evidence it also cannot be disputed that\u2014except for the effect of the agreements in question\u2014the highest value to respondents of the lands in question was $12,500 per acre.\nThe form of words used in the agreements could therefore have no other purpose than to assure to respondents a total price worked out on the basis of $12,800 per acre for all their lands.\nWhile the respondents were free to make any bargain the purchasers were willing to agree to, in my opinion they could not by attributing a higher value to the strip to be expropriated and a correspondingly lesser value to the balance of their property, thereby throw upon the expropriating authority the obligation to pay out of public funds more than the expropriated lands were in truth worth to the respondents as owners.\nI would allow the appeal and vary the award of the learned arbitrator by fixing compensation at the sum of $375,424, being at the rate of $12,800 per acre on 29.33 acres with interest at 5 per cent per annum from February 10, 1959. The respondents served notice that they would contend that the amount of the award should be varied by the addition of an allowance of 10 per cent for compulsory taking. In view of the judgment of this Court in Drew v. The Queen[3] this motion must be dismissed, but without costs.\nThe appellant is entitled to its costs here and in the Court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs, KERWIN C.J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Danby (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nAlgoma Steel Corporation Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1961: June 12; 1961: October 3.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTaxation\u2014Assessment of railway tracks\u2014Exemption claimed\u2014System used primarily for transportation of company property within plant area\u2014Meaning of \u201ctransportation system\u201d\u2014The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 24, s. 37.\nThe plaintiff company, a manufacturer of iron and steel, in an action asked for a declaration that its rails were not liable to assessment by the defendant municipality. It was claimed that the combined effect of ss. 37 and 44 of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 24, precluded the assessment of such rails, because they were part of a transportation system operated by the plaintiff. The primary function of the system was the transportation within the company\u2019s plant area of the company\u2019s own property, as an incident of its manufacturing operations. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal having held for the plaintiff, the defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nAs the result of an amendment to The Assessment Act in 1944 (Ont.), c. 7, the composite term \u201ctransportation system\u201d replaced in the predecessor of s. 37 the words \u201ctramways, street railways and electric railways\u201d in subs. (1) and \u201celectric railway\u201d in subs. (4). Those words were not apt to describe a transportation system such as that operated by the plaintiff. They did describe those kinds of transportation systems which would be expected to operate on public highways.\nThe amendment did not have the effect of extending the scope of s. 37(4) so as to make it apply to an entirely different kind of transportation system. \u201cExtraneous light\u201d was cast upon the meaning of the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d as used in that subsection, not only by the previous history of the subsection, but by the context in which the words were used in s. 37 as a whole. The words had a limited meaning and referred to a system which was operated to provide transportation as a service to the public, and not one which was operated, almost entirely, for the transportation by a company, on its own premises, of its own goods, as part of its manufacturing business.\nUnion of South Africa (Minister of Railways and Harbours) v. Simmer and Jack Proprietary Mines, [1918] A.C. 591; Hurlbatt v. Barnett & Co., [1893] 1 Q.B. 77, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Hughes J. Appeal allowed.\nH.E. Manning, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nP.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., and W.R. Herridge, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, which dismissed the appeal of the appellants from the judgment at the trial. In the action, the respondent, as plaintiff, asked for a declaration that its rails were not liable to assessment by the appellant Corporation. The respondent claimed that an ingredient of $1,721,280 in its real property assessment and $1,032,768 in its business assessment were illegally inserted in the assessment roll for the year 1959, because those figures represented the value of railway tracks, constructed within the premises of the respondent, which were exempt from assessment because they were part of a transportation system operated by the respondent. The respondent claimed that the combined effect of ss. 37 and 44 of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 24, precluded the assessment of such rails.\nThe respondent carries on the business of manufacturing iron and steel at its plant at Sault Ste. Marie. For the purpose of transferring materials from one part of its plant to another, and as part of its arrangement for receiving incoming ores and materials and dispatching finished products, the respondent has within its property, situated within the boundaries of Sault Ste. Marie, something over 49 miles of standard gauge railway track which connect with the tracks of the Algoma Central and Hudson\u2019s Bay Railway Company (a corporation which is a completely distinct entity from the respondent).\nIn addition, the respondent owns 1.3 miles of narrow gauge track not connected with the Algoma Central system and 1\u2153 miles of electrified track used for the transportation of coal in self-propelled cars. The electrified line has not been assessed.\nThe respondent owns and operates 14 standard gauge diesel locomotives, 2 small steam locomotives and some 570 freight cars, including hot metal ladles, slag cars, gondola cars, hopper and butt cars and from time to time hires additional cars for use in its plant. The respondent\u2019s tracks also serve the plants of Mannesmann Tube Company, Ltd., Dominion Tar and Chemical Limited and Algoma Contractors Limited, which companies are tenants of the respondent. The respondent\u2019s equipment is operated by a separate department presided over by a superintendent of transportation and staffed by a large and varying number of employees consisting of foremen, yard masters, locomotive engineers, switch men and personnel devoted to the maintenance and repair of rolling stock.In order to facilitate the considerable traffic within the area, there are two marshalling yards within the respondent\u2019s premises and immediately outside those premises there is a marshalling and interchange yard of the Algoma Central and Hudson\u2019s Bay Railway Company. Rail traffic from and to the respondent\u2019s plant is handled over the lines of the Algoma Central Company. The locomotives and rolling stock of the respondent are not used for the delivery of materials from or the shipment of goods to the outside world. The respondent\u2019s cars, with the exception of tank cars, are used to carry materials around its yards and to and from one building to another. The tank cars are used mainly to remove sludge from the coke plant to a waste dump.\nA relatively small amount of traffic passes over the respondent\u2019s tracks to the premises of the three tenants previously mentioned.\nThe Letters Patent of the respondent authorized it \u201cto carry on the business of the transportation of passengers, goods, wares, merchandise, timber or coal, steel and iron, upon land and water\u201d.\nThe learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal, on the basis of this evidence presented by the respondent, no evidence being adduced by the appellants, held that the respondent did operate a transportation system, in fact, within the ordinary meaning of that expression, and further went on to hold that this was a transportation system within the meaning of the relevant provisions of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 24.\nThe provisions of that statute on which the respondent relies are s. 37(4) and s. 44(2)(a) and (3).\nSection 37 reads as follows:\n37. (1) The property by subclause v of clause i of section 1 declared to be \u201cland\u201d which is owned by companies or persons supplying water, heat, light and power to municipalities and the inhabitants thereof, and companies and persons operating transportation systems and companies or persons distributing by pipe line natural gas, manufactured gas or liquefied petroleum gas or any mixture of any of them shall, in a municipality divided into wards, be assessed in the ward in which the head office of the company or person is situate, if the head office is situated in the municipality, but if the head office of the company or person is not in the municipality, then the assessment may be in any ward thereof.\n(1a) This section does not apply to a pipe line as defined in section 37a.\n(2) Where the property of any such company or person extends through two or more municipalities, the portion thereof in each municipality shall be separately assessed therein at its value as an integral part of the whole property.\n(3) In assessing such property, whether situate or not situate upon a highway, street, road, lane or other public place, the same shall when and so long as in actual use be assessed at its actual value in accordance with section 33. (4) Notwithstanding anything in this or any other section of this Act, the structures, substructures, superstructures, rails, ties, poles and wires of such a transportation system shall be liable to assessment and taxation in the same manner and to the same extent as those of a steam railway are under the provisions of section 44 and not otherwise.\nSection 44 is the section which deals with the assessment of steam railways. Subsection (1) prescribes the information which a steam railway must transmit annually respecting its property. The relevant portions of subss. (2) and (3) provide as follows:\n44. (2) The assessor shall assess the land and property aforesaid as follows,\n(a) the roadway or right-of-way at the actual value thereof according to the average value of land in the locality; but not including the structures, substructures and superstructures, rails, ties, poles and other property thereon;\n\u2026\n(3) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the structures, substructures, superstructures, rails, ties, poles, wires and other property on railway lands and used exclusively for railway purposes or incidental thereto (except stations, freight sheds, offices, warehouses, elevators, hotels, roundhouses and machine, repair and other shops) shall not be assessed.\nThere is no suggestion that the respondent is a steam railway company within the meaning of s. 44 of the Act and so the question in issue in this appeal is as to whether it operated a \u201ctransportation system\u201d within the meaning of s. 37(4), so as to be entitled to the exemption from assessment of its rails, situated on its own lands, as provided in respect of steam railway companies in s. 44(2)(a) and (3).\nThe words \u201ctransportation system\u201d are not defined in the interpretation section of the Act. They are used in certain sections of the Act in addition to those already cited. They first appear in s. l(i)(v) in the definition of the word \u201cland\u201d.\n1. In this Act,\n\u2026\n(i) \u201cland\u201d, \u201creal property\u201d and \u201creal estate\u201d include,\n\u2026\n(v) all structures and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under or affixed to any highway, lane, or other public communication or water, but not the rolling stock of any transportation system; They appear next in para. 17 of s. 4, the section which recites the exemptions to the general proposition that all real property in Ontario shall be liable to assessment for taxation. The exemption mentioned in para. 17 is as follows:\n17. All machinery and equipment used for manufacturing or farming purposes, including the foundations on which the same rest, but not including machinery and equipment to the extent that it is used, intended or required for lighting, heating or other building purposes or for producing power for sale, or machinery owned, operated or used by a transportation system or by a person having the right, authority or permission to construct, maintain or operate within Ontario in, under, above, on or through any highway, lane or other public communication, public place or public water, any structure or other thing, for the purposes of a bridge or transportation system, or for the purpose of conducting steam, heat, water, gas, oil, electricity or any property, substance or product capable of transportation, transmission or conveyance for the supply of water, light, heat, power or other service.\nSection 6 of the Act deals with business assessments and reference is made to a \u201ctransportation system\u201d in subs. (1)(k) and subs. 1b, both enacted in 1957 (Ont.), c. 2, which read as follows:\n6. (1)(k) Every person carrying on the business of,\n(i) a telegraph or telephone company, or\n(ii) a transportation system, other than one for the transportation or transmission or distribution by pipe line of crude oil or liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons or any product or by-product thereof or natural or manufactured gas or liquefied petroleum gas or any mixture or combination of the foregoing, or\n(iii) the transmission of water or of steam, heat or electricity for\nthe purposes of light, heat or power,\nfor a sum equal to 25 per cent of the assessed value of the land (not being a highway, lane or other public communication or public place or water or private right-of-way), occupied or used by such person, exclusive of the value of any machinery, plant or appliances erected or placed upon, in, over, under or affixed to such land.\n(1b) Where a manufacturer also carries on the business of a transportation system for the transportation or transmission or distribution by pipe line of crude oil or liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons or any product or by-product thereof or natural or manufactured gas or any mixture or combination of the foregoing, he shall not be assessed for business assessment as a manufacturer in respect of such transportation system.\nThere is some lack of precision in the use of the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d in these various sections. In para. 17 of s. 4 and in s. 37(1) there is a suggested distinction between a transportation system and a system for the transmission or distribution of oil or gas. On the other hand, the quoted subsections of s. 6 indicate that there is no such distinction. However, in s. 6(1)(k), perhaps out of abundance of precaution, a pipe line is specifically excluded from being considered as a transportation system in that subclause. Section 6(1b) deals exclusively with the transportation or transmission or distribution of oil or gas by pipe line. It does not appear that in any of the sections in which the words are used by themselves, without qualification, that they are intended to include a pipe line.\nThe words were first introduced into The Assessment Act in 1944 (Ont.), c. 7, and were used in an amendment to s. 44 of the Act, which was the predecessor of s. 37. In subs. (1) they replaced the words \u201ctramways, street railways and electric railways\u201d. In subs. (4) they replaced the words \u201celectric railway\u201d.\nPrior to the amendment, those subsections of s. 44 read as follows:\n44. (1) The property, by paragraph 5 of clause i of section 1, declared to be \u201cland\u201d which is owned by companies or persons supplying water, heat, light and power to municipalities and the inhabitants thereof, and companies and persons operating tramways, street railways and electric railways, and companies or persons transmitting oil or gas by pipe line, shall, in a municipality divided into wards, be assessed in the ward in which the head office of such company or person is situate, if such head office is situated in such municipality, but if the head office of such company or person is not in such municipality, then the assessment may be in any ward thereof.\n(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section or any other section of this Act, the structures, substructures, superstructures, rails, ties, poles and wires of such an electric railway shall be liable to assessment and taxation in the same manner and to the same extent as those of a steam railway are under the provisions of section 50 and not otherwise.\nIn 1946 (Ont.), c. 3, the predecessor of s. 6(1)(k), which had contained the words:\nEvery person carrying on the business of a telegraph or telephone company, of an electric railway, other than an electric railway owned or operated by or for a municipal corporation, tramway, street railway or incline railway\u2026\nwas replaced by a new clause, which commenced:\nEvery person carrying on the business of a telegraph or telephone company, or of a transportation system, other than a transportation system owned or operated by or for a municipal corporation\u2026 In 1947 (Ont.), c. 3, in para. 17 of s. 4, the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d where they first appear in that paragraph, as previously quoted, replaced the words \u201crailway company\u201d and where they next appear, replaced the words \u201ctramway or street railway\u201d.\nIn the same year the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d replaced, in s. 1(i)(v), the words \u201crailway, electric railway, tramway or street railway\u201d.\nAs was pointed out in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the submissions advanced by counsel as to the rules of interpretation to be applied to amending provisions, are summarized in Halsbury, 2nd ed., vol. 31, p. 493, para. 626, as follows:\n626. Mere amending provisions should not be interpreted so as to alter completely the character of the principal law, unless clear language is found indicating such an intention, and where a statute of limited operation is repealed by one which re-enacts its provisions in an amended form, it need not be presumed that its operation was to be extended to classes of persons hitherto not subject to them. Where, however, expressions of larger meaning are used in an amending statute than in the principal Act, it must be taken that they are used intentionally.\nIt is the contention of the appellants that the transportation systems contemplated by The Assessment Act are systems having to do with providing transportation for passengers (and possibly of commodities) as a service to persons other than the operator of the system. This, it is said, is manifested by the wording of the provisions of the Act and by the previous history of the sections in question. The appellants submit that the amendments, which introduced the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d into the Act, should not be interpreted so as to alter completely the character of the law as it existed previously.\nThe respondent submits that the amendment of s. 37 involved the use of an expression of larger meaning and was made with the intention of enlarging the scope of the exemption conferred by that section. This view was accepted in the Courts below, which held that, in the absence of any statutory definition, and because of the obscurity of the meaning of the phrase, resort must be had to recognized canons of construction. In this connection, the statement of Lord Haldane in Lumsden v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[2], was cited:\nThe duty of a court of construction in such cases is not to speculate on what was likely to have been said if those who framed the statute had thought of the point which has arisen; but, recognizing that the words leave the intention obscure, to construe them as they stand, with only such extraneous light as is reflected from within the four corners of the statute itself, read as a whole.\nThey concluded that the words in question here should be given their literal meaning, and that, on that basis, the respondent did operate a transportation system within the meaning of s. 37(4).\nThe brief summary of the amendments, as a result of which the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d appeared in The Assessment Act, shows that this composite term was used, in various sections, in replacement of the words \u201ctramway\u201d, \u201cstreet railway\u201d, \u201celectric railway\u201d, \u201cincline railway\u201d, \u201crailway\u201d and \u201crailway company\u201d. In the section with which we are concerned, s. 37, they replaced the words \u201ctramways, street railways and electric railways\u201d in subs. (1) and \u201celectric railway\u201d in subs. (4). Those words were not apt to describe a transportation system such as that operated by the respondent. They did describe those kinds of transportation systems which would be expected to operate on public highways.\nThe question then is, did the amendment which has resulted in the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d appearing in s. 37 have the effect of extending the scope of subs. (4) so as to make it apply to an entirely different kind of a transportation system?\nWith respect, I do not think that the amendment did have that effect. I have reached the conclusion that \u201cextraneous light\u201d is cast on the meaning of the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d as used in subs. (4) not only by the previous history of that subsection, but by the context in which the words are used in s. 37 as a whole.\nIn subs. (4) the words used are \u201csuch a transportation system\u201d. In order to determine the kind of transportation system referred to in that subsection it is necessary to refer back to the previous subsections. Subsection (1) deals with the place in which a certain kind of land is to be assessed. The subject-matter of such assessment is \u201cthe property by subclause v of clause i of section 1 declared to be \u2018land\u2019\u201d. The kind of property mentioned is, therefore, \u201cstructures and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under or affixed to any highway, lane, or other public communication or water\u201d.\nSubsection (1) of s. 37 therefore deals with fixtures on public highways and communications, and it deals with property of that kind owned by certain classes of companies or persons; namely, those who\n1. Supply water, heat, light and power to municipalities and the inhabitants thereof.\n2. Operate transportation systems.\n3. Distribute by pipe line natural gas, manufactured gas or liquefied petroleum gas or any mixture of any of them.\nClasses 1 and 3 are clearly public utility operations which make use of highways for their pipes, poles, electric wires or electric conduits. In my opinion the kind of transportation system which would be making use of highways for its rails would be of like character; namely, a utility rendering service to the public.\nSubsection (2) of s. 37 contemplates the kind of company which might have its properties extending through two or more municipalities, and its reference to \u201csuch company or person\u201d relates back to the kind mentioned in subs. (1).\nSimilarly, when subs. (4) mentions \u201csuch transportation system\u201d it means one which is operated by the kind of person or company referred to in subs. (1).\nIn my opinion, therefore, the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d, as used in subs. (4) of s. 37, have a limited meaning and refer to a system which is operated to provide transportation as a service to the public, and not one which is operated, almost entirely, for the transportation by a company, on its own premises, of its own goods, as a part of its manufacturing business. In Union of South Africa (Minister of Railways and Harbours) v. Simmer and Jack Proprietary Mines[3], Lord Sumner, at p. 596, said:\nIn the opinion of their Lordships, it is not a legitimate interpretation of mere amending provisions to hold that they completely alter the character of the principal laws, unless clear language is found indicating such an intention.\nThe interpretation which the respondent seeks to place on the amendment made in 1944 does involve a complete alteration of the character of the section, and, for the reasons already stated, I do not find clear language indicating such an intention.\nThe foregoing statement by Lord Sumner is the basis for the first portion of the principle enunciated in Halsbury, previously cited. The last sentence in Halsbury\u2019s statement, that \u201cwhere expressions of larger meaning are used in an amending statute than in the principal Act, it must be taken that they are used intentionally\u201d, is founded on the words of Lord Esher, M.R., in Hurlbatt v. Barnett & Co.[4] In that case the change in wording in the amending statute clearly manifested an intention to extend the jurisdiction of the Court in respect of references to the official referee.\nIn the present case I agree that the words \u201ctransportation system\u201d were used intentionally in s. 37. A composite term was used in subs. (1) to replace \u201ctramways, street railways and electric railways\u201d. The application of subs. (4) had previously been limited to \u201celectric railways\u201d only. The amendment made it clear that the exemption in subs. (4) was not limited to that type of a transportation system. But, for the reasons already outlined, I do not find an intention to broaden the application of the section to the extent that the respondent contends.\nIt has already been noted that the respondent had the corporate power to carry on the business of the transportation of passengers or goods. This, however, does not assist in determining whether the transportation system which the respondent did operate fell within s. 37(4). For the reasons previously given I do not think that it did because of the fact that, complex as that system undoubtedly was, its primary function was the transportation within the respondent\u2019s plant area of the respondent\u2019s own property, as an incident of its manufacturing operations. The respondent did not operate a transportation system for the provision of a service to the public.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be allowed, the judgment at the trial should be set aside and the respondent\u2019s action should be dismissed, with costs to the appellants throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Wishart, Noble & Nori, Sault Ste. Marie.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Howland, Toronto.\n[1] [1960] O.R. 334, 24 D.L.R.

The trial judge dismissed the action and this judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The suppliant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe word \"minerals\" standing alone in the grant should be construed as meaning mineral substances and, as the authorities and references referred to indicated, petroleum and natural gas were prior to and at the time the grants were made and now are regarded as such. Ontario Natural Gas Co. v. Gosfield (1890), 19 O.R. 591 and (affirmed) (1891), 18 O.A.R. 626; Dome Oil Co. v. Alberta Drilling Co. (1916), 52 S.C.R. 561; Creighton v. United Oils Ltd., [1927] 2 W.W.R. 458; Stuart v. Calgary & Edmonton Ry. Co., [1927] 3 W.W.R. 678; Knight Sugar Co. v. Alberta Railway Co., [1938] 1 All E.R. 266; District Registrar v. Canadian Superior Oil of California Ltd., [1954] S.C.R. 321, referred to.\nThe contention that the words \"precious or base (other than coal)\" which followed the word \"minerals\" in the grants limited the meaning to metallic substances was rejected.\nThe contention that the terms of s. 3 of the British Columbia Southern Railway Aid Amendment Act, 1896, indicated that it was the intention of the legislature that only such rights as free miners might acquire under the Mineral Act, 1896 (which rights were restricted to minerals as defined in that Act) should be reserved to the Crown, and accordingly the words of the grant should be so construed, also failed. The rights of free miners at the time of the grants were not limited to searching for minerals as defined by the Mineral Act, 1896. Before the grants were made, by an Act to Extend the Rights of the Crown to Prospect for Minerals on Railway Lands to all Free Miners passed on February 27, 1899 (c. 58), it was declared that every free miner within the meaning of the Mineral Act should be entitled to exercise on his own behalf all the rights of the Crown to prospect for minerals over all lands in British Columbia, whether owned by railway companies or otherwise. This applied to the lands in question granted later that year to the railway company and the definition in the Mineral Act did not apply to the word \"minerals\".\nThe words \"minerals precious or base\" meant all mineral substances other than coal and in their context were free from ambiguity.\nThe amendment asking for rectification, for which claim no facts were pleaded, was made some 59 years after the grants were issued and accepted by the grantee. Prior to the time of the grants the parties had expressly directed their attention to petroleum as well as to coal, and during the period of 59 years the appellant had acted upon the said grants and sold portions of the lands subject to the exceptions contained in them.\nIf, as was suggested, there was a duty to convey the lands to the railway company subject only to the rights of the Crown to precious metals and to those of free miners, the right of action for the reformation of the grants would presumably be against the Crown either on a contract to be implied from the fact that upon the faith of the promised grants the railway was built, or upon the footing that there was a statutory duty to convey the lands subject only to the above exceptions. No such contract was pleaded and the decision in A.-G. for British Columbia v. Esquimalt & Nanaimo Ry. Co. [1950] A.C. 87, would apparently bar such a claim if made. If there were any such right of action it would be vested in the British Columbia Southern Railway Company and, as there was no allegation that any such right had been assigned to the appellant, that company would be a necessary party to the proceedings.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Whittaker J. at the trial dismissing the action. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., J. L. Farris, Q.C., and J. A. McAlpine, for the suppliant, appellant.\nM. M. McFarlane, Q.C., and A. W. Hobbs, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] which dismissed an appeal of the present appellant from the judgment of Whittaker J. at the trial dismissing the action. DesBrisay C.J.B.C. dissented and would have allowed the appeal.\nThe appellant is the successor in title of the British Columbia Southern Railway Company to large tracts of land described as portions of Lots 4588 and 4589 in the District of Kootenay in the Province of British Columbia. These lands together with certain additional areas, were conveyed by deeds dated December 1, 1904, duly registered in the Nelson Land Registry Office at that time. The terms of the conveyances were made subject to the reservations, limitations, provisos, conditions and exceptions expressed in the original grant from the Crown.\nThere were two grants from the Crown to the railway company of the lands in question dated August 18, 1899, the terms of which, save as to the description of the property conveyed, were identical. The operative portions of the grants read:\nKnow Ye that We do by these presents, for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, in consideration of the fulfilment of the provisions of the Railway Aid Act, 1890 and amending Acts, give and grant unto the British Columbia Southern Railway Company, its successors and assigns all that parcel or lot of land (describing it) \u2026. The further term of the grants that has given rise to the present litigation read:\nPROVIDED also that it shall at all times be lawful for US, OUR HEIRS AND SUCCESSORS or for any person or persons acting under OUR or their authority to enter into and upon any part of said lands and to raise and get thereout any minerals, precious or base (other than coal) which may be thereupon or thereunder and to use and enjoy any and every part of the said land and the easements and privileges thereto belonging for the purpose of such raising and getting and every other purpose connected therewith.\nBy the petition of right the appellant asserted that it was entitled to the petroleum and natural gas to be found under such lands, that the Crown had issued permits to the Canadian Gulf Oil Company and the California Standard Company to do exploratory drilling for petroleum and natural gas on such lands, that these permits had been assigned to the British American Oil Company Limited and asked damages for trespass against the Crown and these companies and an injunction restraining them from entering upon the said lands. This aspect of the claim for relief was abandoned at the trial and does not require consideration. The petitioner asked further for a declaration that it was the owner of the petroleum and natural gas in and underlying the said lands, and, by an amendment made at the trial, an order rectifying the reservation in respect to minerals by striking out the words \"any minerals, precious or base (other than coal)\" and substituting therefor the words \"any minerals as defined in the Mineral Act, 1896, cap. 34, Statutes of British Columbia, 1896\".\nThese two claims for relief are to be considered separately. While in dealing with the first of these the question to be determined is the proper interpretation of the words \"minerals, precious or base\" in the grants from the Crown, the circumstances leading up to the making of such grants are matters to be considered.\nThe British Columbia Southern Railway Company was incorporated under the name of The Crow's Nest and Kootenay Lake Railway Company by c. 44 of the Statutes of 1888 and given authority to construct and operate a line of railway in the Kootenay District in the province. The name of this company was changed to the present name by c. 56 of the Statutes of 1891. By the Railway Aid Act, 1890, c. 40, s. 1, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was authorized to grant 20,000 acres of public land for each one mile of railway completed throughout its entire length upon compliance by the company with certain terms which were defined. By s. 14 it was provided that the provisions of the British Columbia Railway Act, passed at the same session, should apply to the enterprise. Section 18, to which as amended much importance is assigned by the appellant, reads:\nNothing in this Act contained shall prejudice the rights of free miners to search for, get and win the precious metals and to use timber for mining purposes, subject to the mineral and land laws of the province and to the provisions of this Act.\nBetween the years 1890 and 1896 various statutes extended the time for the completion of the railway. In 1896 by c. 4 entitled The British Columbia Southern Railway Aid Amendment Act it was enacted that it should be a sufficient compliance with the provisions of the Railway Aid Act, 1890, as amended, to entitle the railway company to the grant authorized that the company should construct and equip the several sections of its line of railway within the times fixed by an Act passed at that session. Section 3 of this Act reads:\nNothing in this Act and no grant to be made hereunder shall be construed to interfere with free miners entering upon and searching for minerals and acquiring claims in accordance with the mining laws of the province.\nThe railway line was completed and the company applied for a grant of the subsidy lands.\nBy a report dated August 17, 1899, made by the Minister of Finance to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, it was recommended that a block of land be laid out and Crown grants be issued, subject inter alia to the proviso above quoted. The Crown grants were made upon the authority of an Order in Council of the same date.\nAs originally drafted, the contention of the petitioner was that upon the true construction of the original grants the rights to the petroleum and natural gas in the lands were conveyed to the railway company. The amendment made at the trial some 59 years after the grants were issued and accepted by the grantee asking for rectification as above mentioned did not specify the basis for the claim as is usual in asking for relief of this nature. No contract between the Crown and the railway company was pleaded though this question was argued at the trial and dealt with in the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nIt was contended by the petitioner at the trial that the words \"minerals, precious or base (other than coal)\" in the grant should be construed as that word was defined in the Mineral Act of 1896. That this was the proper construction was supported, it was said, by the reservation of the rights of free miners under the mining laws of the province, by the Railway Aid Act as amended, rights which it is contended were restricted to searching for minerals of a metallic nature.\nThe Mineral Act of 1896, by s. 2 under a sub-heading \"Interpretation\", reads in part:\nIn the construction of this Act, the following expressions shall have the following meanings respectively, unless inconsistent with the context:\u2014\n\"Mineral\" shall mean all valuable deposits of gold, silver, platinum, iridium, or any of the platinum group of metals, mercury, lead, copper, iron, tin, zinc, nickel, aluminum, antimony, arsenic, barium, bismuth, boron, bromine, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, iodine, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorus, plumbago, potassium, sodium, strontium, sulphur (or any combination of the aforementioned elements with themselves or with any other elements), asbestos, emery, mica, and mineral pigments.\nIn Lord Provost and Magistrates of Glasgow v. Farie[3], where the question was as to whether the word \"minerals\" in the context \"mines of coal, ironstone, slate or other minerals\" in The Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847, included common clay forming the surface or subsoil of the land, Halsbury L.C. said that the question to be decided was a question of fact as to \"what these words meant in the vernacular of the mining world, the commercial world, and land owners\" at the time they were used in the conveyance. This statement of the law was adopted by the Judicial Committee in Borys v. C.P.R. and Imperial Oil Ltd[4]\nThe appellant called three witnesses in an attempt to establish that, applying this test, the word \"minerals\" alone or with the words \"precious or base\" added did not in the vernacular include petroleum or natural gas in 1896 when the definition referred to appeared in the Mineral Act or when the grants were made or, indeed, at the present time.\nMr. R. M. Thompson, a professor in the Department of Geology in the University of British Columbia, was permitted to say that, in his opinion, neither petroleum or natural gass fell within the definition of minerals in the Act of 1896. He said that since these substances were not products of an inorganic nature they \"cannot be thought of as minerals\". The witness said further that the words \"minerals, precious or base (other than coal)\" in the reservation from the Crown did not in his opinion include petroleum or natural gas. To this he added that they would not bear this meaning to a scientist. In general mining parlance, he considered base minerals meant such metals as lead and zinc. Cross-examined, he said that petroleum and natural gas were hydrocarbons but that to a scientist they were not minerals because \"they are not created by a process of inorganic activity\".\nMr. L. G. N. Crouch, a mining engineer and professor of mining at the same university with considerable practical experience in Canada and elsewhere, considered that in 1896 \"the definition of minerals in the Mineral Act of 1896 in common parlance\" would not include petroleum or natural gas nor would they today. He also said that in his opinion the words of the grant \"any minerals, precious or base (other than coal)\" in common mining parlance in 1896 would not include them. His reason for this opinion was that among mining men minerals were thought of as solid materials and that to a mining engineer the words \"precious or base\" were applied only to metals in 1896 and at the present time. Cross-examined, he said that to a mining engineer natural gas and petroleum are not included in the expression \"minerals\" and believed that they had not been so in 1896. He said that he had been assisted in reaching this conclusion by reading reports of the Minister of Mines, journals of the period 1896 to 1900, and examining some of the provincial mining statutes.\nMr. W. H. Matthews, a professor of petroleum geology in the same university and a mining engineer, said that the origin of petroleum and natural gas was \"plant and animal material laid down in ancient seas\" and that \"from a scientific point of view\" they were not minerals. He said he based this opinion on the fact that they were of organic origin and \"the fact that they are of mixed composition not individual species\"; minerals he considered were of inorganic origin and accordingly coal was not a mineral since it was of organic origin and of mixed composition meaning mixtures of materials rather than pure substances. He was asked and permitted to say that petroleum and natural gas did not fall within the definition of minerals in the Act of 1896 nor within the language of the exception from the grant. He said that petroleum is not \"regarded scientifically as a mineral\" and considered that this was also the case in 1896. In common parlance in the mining world in British Columbia he said \"any minerals precious or base other than coal\" would not include petroleum or natural gas. He was of opinion that minerals precious or base referred to metallic minerals which would not include petroleum.\nThese three witnesses were all born after 1899 and so had no personal knowledge as to the accepted meaning of these terms at the time of the enactment of the Mineral Act, 1896, nor at the date of the grants.\nThe Crown did not call any witnesses.\nThe learned trial judge, Whittaker J., was of the opinion that it had been established by the authorities that the word \"mineral\" when used in a legal document or act of Parliament included petroleum and natural gas unless the context or the circumstances indicated a contrary intention. He considered that \"any\" minerals in the words of the grant meant \"all\" minerals. The word \"base\" as applied to minerals he held meant all minerals other than those classed as precious. As to the evidence of the three witnesses, he considered that it was insufficient to prove the meaning of these terms in the vernacular in 1896, according to the test proposed by Lord Halsbury in the Farie case.\nIn the Court of Appeal the late Sidney Smith J.A. said that he was in substantial agreement with the reasons of the learned trial judge.\nDavey J. A. agreed with Whittaker J. that the words of the grant \"any minerals precious or base (other than coal)\" included petroleum and natural gas and adopted his reasons for that conclusion. Referring to the evidence, he said that it was largely argumentative and did not touch the question of how conveyancers, land owners and commercial men would have understood the words. He did not consider the words \"precious or base\", in their context, words of limitation but that they applied to minerals generally, including substances of organic origin as well as metals. With these conclusions, I agree.\nThe learned Chief Justice of British Columbia reviewed the statutes which authorized the grants and was of the opinion that the railway company was entitled as of right under their provisions to a conveyance of the lands, less only precious metals or minerals and coal without the reservation of base minerals contained in the grants. He would in consequence have allowed the appeal.\nThe question as to whether petroleum and natural gas are mineral substances within the meaning of the term in various statutes has been considered in several cases to which the learned trial judge referred. In the more recent cases it would appear that the fact that they are mineral substances has been conceded.\nIn Ontario Natural Gas Company v. Gosfield[5], the question to be decided was whether natural gas was a mineral within the meaning of s. 565 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1887, c. 184, which read, in part, \"the corporation of any township or county wherever minerals are found may sell or lease \u2026the right to take minerals, etc.\" Street J. held that it was. After referring to the meaning assigned to the word \"mineral\" in several dictionaries and among other authorities to the decision in Lord Provost v. Farie, he adopted the statement of Lord Macnaghten at p. 690 of the report of that case which was followed by the learned trial judge in the present matter.\nThe appeal from this judgment was dismissed[6]. Hagarty C.J.O. considered that it was impossible to hold that natural gas was not a mineral and that there was nothing in the section limiting its ordinary meaning. Osler J.A. agreed with Street J. saying that the word was to be given its widest signification. MacLennan J.A. agreed that natural gas was a mineral within the meaning of the statute and said that at the time the Act was passed (1887) gas was a well-known mineral substance. In Dome Oil Co. v. Alberta Drilling Co.[7] the appellant contended that oil was not a mineral within the meaning of s. 63A of The Companies Ordinance of the North-West Territories which authorized the company \"to dig for \u2026minerals \u2026whether belonging to the company or not\". As to this, Anglin J. said, in part (p. 582) \"rock oil is admittedly a mineral within definitions of that word well established and generally accepted. It was something well-known as a mineral when the legislation under consideration was passed\". That was 1901. He continued \"the word 'minerals' in a statute bears its widest signification unless the context or the nature of the case requires it to be given a restricted meaning\". Brodeur J. said, in part (p. 586), \"rock oil in its popular and scientific meaning is a mineral substance. Mineral bodies occur in three physical conditions, solid, liquid and gas, and although the term 'mineral' is more frequently applied to substances containing metals, rock oil and petroleum are embraced in that term\" and referred to Ontario Natural Gas v. Gosfield. The dissenting judgments of Idington and Duff JJ. were upon another issue in the case.\nIn Creighton v. United Oils Ltd.[8], Walsh J. said, in part, \"it is admitted and it is established as a scientific fact that petroleum and natural gas are minerals within the ordinary meaning of that word and were so regarded long before this legislation (the Dominion Lands Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 54) was passed.\"\nIn Stuart v. Calgary & Edmonton Ry. Co.[9], Hyndman J.A. stated that it was well settled that gas and oil are minerals in a judgment concurred in by all of the members of the Appellate Division.\nIn Knight Sugar Co. v. Alberta Railway Co[10], where the reservation in the transfer was of \"all coal and other minerals\" it was admitted that petroleum and natural gas were minerals (p. 269).\nIn the case of District Registrar v. Canadian Superior Oil of California Ltd.[11], it was apparently taken for granted that such substances were minerals within the meaning of s. 21 of the Manitoba Provincial Lands Act, 1887, where the reservation was of \"gold or silver mines or any other mineral\". The only mention of this aspect of the matter was in the judgment of our late brother Estey who said that petroleum and natural gas were admittedly base minerals. The contrary of this was not apparently considered to be fairly arguable.\nThe grants in question were made in the year 1899. It is not alleged in the pleadings and I find nothing in the evidence to indicate that these words at that time bore any other meaning than they did at the time of the trial.\nThe word \"petroleum\" is derived from the Latin\u2014\"petra\", rock, and \"oleum\", oil. Dictionaries in use at the time the grants were made and at the time of the trial may be referred to in determining the commonly accepted meaning of the term. Murray's New English Dictionary, publication of which commenced in 1893, defines \"petroleum\" as a mineral oil occurring in rocks or on the surface of the water in various parts of the globe. The current New Oxford Dictionary defines \"mineral oil\" as a general name for petroleum and the various oils distilled from it. Webster's New International Dictionary describes \"mineral oil\" as any oil of mineral origin such as petroleum. In Soule's Dictionary of Synonyms, petroleum, rock oil, and mineral oil are said to be synonyms.\nThat the word \"minerals\" was considered by the legislature to include petroleum in the year 1892 is shown by s. 2 of the Coal Mines Amendment Act, c. 31, of that year to which the learned trial judge has referred. This Act apparently contained the first reference to petroleum by name in the statutes and authorized the issue of prospecting licences for coal or petroleum. So far as relevant the section reads:\nAny person desirous of prospecting for coal or petroleum, and acquiring a lease of any lands held by the Crown for the benefit of the province, under which coal measures or petroleum are believed to exist, or wishing to procure a licence for the purpose of prospecting for coal or petroleum upon lands under lease from the Crown in which the mines and minerals, and power to work, carry away, and dispose of the same, is excepted or reserved \u2026.\nThe reservation of minerals was thus assumed to reserve petroleum. The word \"minerals\" standing alone in the grant should, in my opinion, be construed as meaning mineral substances and, as these authorities and references indicate, petroleum and natural gas were prior to and at the time the grants were made and now are regarded as such.\nThe witnesses called by the appellant appear to treat the word \"mineral\" as being synonymous with \"metallic\" even without the added words \"precious or base\". This position is, in my opinion, untenable. All metals are minerals but all minerals are not metals. In Barnard-Argue-Roth-Stearns Oil and Gas Co. Ltd. v. Farquharson[12], Lord Atkinson, delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said, in part (p. 869), \"in one sense natural gas is as rock oil is, a mineral, in that it is not an animal or a vegetable product and all substances found on, in, or under the earth must be in one or the other of these categories of animal, vegetable or mineral substances\". If natural gas is not a mineral substance, how is it to be classified? I find no answer to that question in the oral evidence in this case.\nThe appellant contends, however, that the words \"precious or base (other than coal)\" which followed the word \"minerals\" in the grants limit the meaning to metallic substances.\nThese words appeared in the Mineral Acts of 1884 and 1891 in the following context:\nMinerals shall include all minerals precious or base (other than coal) found in veins, lodes or rock in place and whether such minerals are found separately or in combination with each other.\"\nThey were omitted from the definition of the term in the Act of 1896 above quoted for obvious reasons.\nApart from the fact that the words following the word \"coal\" in the above quoted definition do not appear in the grants, the interpretation clauses of each of these statutes are limited in their application to the construction of the Act in which the expressions appear. If it be permissible to refer to similar language in the earlier mining statutes as an aid to interpretation, it may be noted that the term \"all the baser metals and minerals\" first appeared in the mining ordinance of the Colony of British Columbia in 1869. In the Mineral Act of 1884 this expression was replaced by the words \"all minerals precious or base\". Standing alone the expressions, so far as the latter relates to base minerals, seem to be synonymous. That \"all the baser metals and minerals\" included both metallic and non-metallic substances is perfectly clear.\nIt is, however, contended that the terms of s. 3 of the British Columbia Southern Railway Aid Amendment Act, 1896, hereinbefore quoted, indicate that it was the intention of the legislature that only such rights as free miners might acquire under the Mineral Act, 1896 should be reserved to the Crown. Those rights were restricted to minerals as defined in that Act. Accordingly, it is argued that the words of the grant should be so construed.\nIn the interest of accuracy it should be pointed out that the grants were not made under the authority given to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council by the Act of 1896 but by the Railway Aid Act of 1890. Section 3 reads: \"Nothing in this Act and no grant to be made hereunder.\" The Amendment Act of 1896 did not purport to repeal s. 18 of the Railway Aid Act and in strictness it is the terms of that section which are applicable. In view, however, of the course of the argument, I have considered the question on the basis that s. 3 applied, as was done at the trial.\nI am unable to agree that the section, if applicable to these grants, should be so construed. It should be pointed out that it is inaccurate to say that the rights of free miners at the time of the grant were limited to searching for minerals as defined by the Mineral Act, 1896. Before the grants were made, by an Act to Extend the Rights of the Crown to Prospect for Minerals on Railway Lands to all Free Miners passed on February 27, 1899 (c. 58), it was declared that every free miner within the meaning of the Mineral Act should be entitled to exercise on his own behalf all the rights of the Crown to prospect for minerals over all lands in British Columbia, whether owned by railway companies or otherwise. This applied to the lands in question granted later that year to the railway company and the definition in the Mineral Act did not apply to the word \"minerals\". While I consider that the definition in the statute has no application to the words of the grant, if I were of a contrary opinion I would have difficulty in accepting the evidence of the witnesses so far as it was admissible that petroleum and natural gas were not within its terms. While the great majority of the materials mentioned are metallic, the list includes sulphur, phosphorus, boron, bromine and iodine, all of which are described in the New Oxford Dictionary as non-metallic elements. That portion of the definition reading \"or any combination with the aforementioned elements and themselves or with any other elements\" was not discussed in the evidence. To deal with one alone of these last mentioned substances, it is a matter of common knowledge in Western Canada that sulphur in considerable quantities is found in some petroleums and that there is a large industry in Alberta today devoted to extracting sulphur from the natural gas found in various parts of that province. This would appear to bring the substance within the definition. The matter was not explored in the cross-examination, no doubt for the reason that it was rightly considered that the definition had no application to the words of the grant.\nThe fact that the rights of free miners were preserved, assuming s. 3 applied, did not in the opinion of the learned trial judge prevent the Lieutenant-Governor in Council from reserving the rights of the Crown and those claiming under the Crown to minerals, precious or base, if that were considered to be in the public interest. It was his opinion that there was no legal obligation upon the Crown or upon the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to make the grants, the statute merely conferring a discretionary power upon the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. With these conclusions the majority of the members of the Court of Appeal expressed their agreement.\nIt was upon this last mentioned aspect of the case that the learned Chief Justice differed from the trial judge and the other members of the Court. It was his opinion that upon the true construction of the various statutes the railway company had become entitled to a conveyance of the lands subject only to the rights of the Crown to precious metals and to those of free miners. That being so, and the words of the grant being, in his opinion, ambiguous, he considered that they should be so construed as conveying the fee simple with those exceptions only.\nThe opinion that this conclusion might be invoked as an aid in construing the language of the grants proceeds upon the basis that the words \"minerals precious or base\" are ambiguous. With the greatest respect, I disagree. For the reasons I have stated I consider that the words mean all mineral substances other than coal and in their context are free from ambiguity.\nThe conclusion that there was a duty resting upon the Crown or upon the Lieutenant-Governor in Council to convey the lands subject only to these exceptions might in certain circumstances justify a claim by the grantee to reform the grants. That aspect of the claim made by the amendment to the petition of right was not argued before us and is not mentioned in the judgments at the trial or in the Court of Appeal. It was not, however, abandoned.\nThe amendment which asked for the reformation of the grant appeared in para. 18 of the petition, and reads:\nIn the alternative an order rectifying the reservation in respect to minerals contained in the third proviso of the Crown grants of Lots 4588 and 4589 by striking out the words \"any minerals precious or base other than coal\" and substituting therefor the words \"any minerals as defined in the Mineral Act 1896 cap. 34, Statutes of B.C. 1896.\"\nAs I have stated, no facts are pleaded such as mutual mistake as the basis for this claim. The evidence contains no suggestion that the grants issued in 1899 were not accepted without question by the railway company. It is also of significance that, as pointed out by Davey J.A., on April 15, 1891, the president of the railway company wrote to the Premier saying that the company expected to commence work on the line in the near future and that it was anxious to prospect for coal and coal oil by boring on a block of 400,000 acres which the Crown might grant to the company under the Railway Aid Act and requested that a Minute of Council be passed designating the areas to be thereafter granted. Such a Minute was passed. The parties having expressly directed their attention to petroleum as well as to coal, Davey J.A. considered that the exclusion of coal alone in the grants indicated clearly that it was not the intention of the parties that the company should also get the petroleum.\nThere is this further to be added. So far as the record shows, no question was ever raised by the grantee that the title conveyed by the grants was not that to which it was entitled or by its successor in title, the present appellant, until 1958. During this period of 59 years it is admitted that the appellants have acted upon the grants and sold portions of the lands subject to the exceptions contained in them.\nIf there was such a duty resting upon the Crown or the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, as is suggested, the right of action for the reformation of the grants would presumably be against the Crown either on a contract to be implied from the fact that upon the faith of the promised grants the railway was built or upon the footing that there was a statutory duty to convey the lands subject only to these exceptions.\nNo such contract is pleaded and the decision of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Company[13], would apparently bar such a claim if made. Whether the cause of action be one or the other it would vest in the British Columbia Southern Railway Company and that company would be a necessary party to the proceedings since there is no allegation that any such right of action was transferred by that company to the appellant.\nIt is unnecessary in the construction of these grants to consider the question argued before us that in case of ambiguity they should be construed most strictly against the Crown since it is said that there was valuable consideration for the making of the grant. I consider that there is no ambiguity.\nI also refrain from expressing any opinion upon the question as to the application of the various Land Acts of the province upon which the respondent relies since I consider it unnecessary for the disposition of the appeal. I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the suppliant, appellant: Farris, Stultz, Bull & Farris, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Attorney-General of British Columbia: Lawrence, Shaw, McFarlane & Stewart, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent, The California Standard Company: D.

The evidence as to this was contradictory, but he was charged with having driven an automobile while his faculties were impaired by alcohol, contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code, and he pleaded guilty to this charge. He explained the plea on the ground that his brother and a police officer had advised him to do so and that he had not been represented by a lawyer. The action for damages against him was allowed and he brought an action in warranty against the insurer. This action was dismissed by the trial judge, but maintained by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Abbott and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Martland JJ.: The decision of the trial judge regarding the condition of the plaintiff at the time of the accident was a finding of fact and there was evidence on which such a finding could be made. His judgment, therefore, should not have been reversed on appeal. While it may be that impairment of the ability to drive as a result of the consumption of alcohol does not necessarily mean that a driver is incapable of the proper control of his vehicle, none the less an admission of impairment is at least some evidence of such incapacity. There were other additional circumstances which, in the opinion of the trial judge, were sufficient to establish a breach of the condition: there were the quantity of liquor admittedly consumed, the conclusions reached by the police following the accident, and the circumstances of the accident itself.\nPer Abbott and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: By raising the defence of a breach of the policy, the insurer had assumed the burden of proving affirmatively that the condition had been violated. The insurer has failed to discharge this burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that the condition had been violated.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Tellier J. Appeal allowed, Abbott and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nL. P. de Grandpr\u00e9, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nFran\u00e7ois Merrier, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The matter in issue in this appeal is as to the liability of the appellant to the respondent under the provisions of an automobile insurance policy, issued by the appellant, which insured the respondent's 1956 Meteor Coach for the period from March 5, 1956, to March 5, 1957. The respondent was involved in an accident on April 28, 1956, shortly after 3 p.m., when the insured vehicle collided with another vehicle on Highway 11, a few miles south of St. Jerome. As a result of the accident the respondent was sued by and held responsible to one Andre Lanoue for damages in the amount of $9,370.21. The respondent's liability to Lanoue is not in issue. The issue is as to whether the respondent had been in breach of Condition no. 5 of the policy so as to justify the appellant's refusal to pay under the policy.\nCondition no. 5 provides as follows:\n5. L'assureur n'encourra aucune responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la police:\n1) si l'assur\u00e9 se sert de on conduit l'automobile:\na) lorsqu'il est sous Pinfluence de boissons enivrantes ou de drogues au point d'\u00eatre, pour le moment, incapable de manceuvrer convenablement l'automobile; \u2026.\nThe learned trial judge held that the respondent had been in breach of that condition. The Court of Queen's Bench2, by a majority of three to two, reversed the trial judgment.\nThe facts, as found by the learned trial judge, are briefly as follows: The respondent admitted having consumed, prior to the accident, at least two glasses of beer and two glasses of rye whisky of two and one-half to three ounces each. The second of these glasses of whisky had been consumed by the respondent shortly before he commenced to drive his car.\nThe respondent's car collided with the rear end of Lanoue's vehicle, which was proceeding in the same direction, at a speed of 30 to 40 miles an hour, along a straight, paved highway. The weather was clear and the visibility was good. At the place where the collision occurred the highway consisted of three lanes and the centre passing lane was not occupied at the time. The impact was such that Lanoue's vehicle was practically demolished and was thrown into a field. The respondent's stopping distance was some 300 feet.\nFollowing the accident two police constables arrived. The respondent was arrested and charged with having driven an automobile while his faculties were impaired by alcohol, contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code. Subsequently the respondent pleaded guilty to this charge.\nFor the respondent it was contended that the consumption of liquor had been over a period of time overall extending from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and that during that time the respondent had consumed a steak dinner.\nTwo witnesses gave evidence to the effect that after the accident the respondent appeared to them to be normal. It was pointed out that the evidence given by the police constables was not very satisfactory, one of them in particular not having a memory of the details of the occasion and relying entirely upon the report which had been made of the accident.\nThe plea of guilty to the charge, under s. 223 of the Criminal Code, was explained on the ground that the respondent's brother and a police officer had advised him to do so and that he had not been represented by a lawyer.\nIn my view the decision made by the learned trial judge regarding the condition of the respondent at the time of the accident was a finding of fact, made after hearing the evidence of the witnesses, and there was evidence on which he could make such a finding. This being so, I do not think that his judgment should be reversed on appeal. Prudential Trust Company Limited v. Forseth3.\nHe pointed out that the proof of the actual quantity of liquor consumed by the respondent was difficult to make, but he clearly had doubts as to the truth of the story told by the respondent; i.e., as to whether the amounts admitted represented the quantity which had actually been consumed.\nHe preferred the evidence of the police constables to that of the other witnesses regarding the condition of the respondent after the accident.\nHe also felt that the circumstances of the accident itself, involving as they did a manoeuvre by the respondent which was otherwise inexplicable, constituted evidence that the respondent was under the influence of liquor to an extent which rendered him incapable of the proper control of his vehicle.\nThe learned trial judge did place some reliance upon the plea of guilty made by the respondent to the charge, under s. 223 of the Criminal Code. He pointed out that this plea, while not binding the Court in the present case, constituted an admission of certain facts, which required consideration.\nThe relevant portion of s. 223 reads as follows:\n223. Every one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction \u2026 The learned trial judge referred to the similarity between the words describing this offence and the wording of Condition no. 5 of the policy and said that impairment by alcohol of the ability to drive is virtually synonymous with incapability of proper control of the vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\nWhile it may be that impairment of ability to drive as a result of the consumption of alcohol does not necessarily mean, in all cases, that a driver is incapable of the proper control of his vehicle, none the less an admission of impairment of ability is at least some evidence of such incapacity. The circumstances in which the admission was made, in this case, affect only the weight to be attached to it. The learned trial judge did not rely solely upon the admission in reaching his conclusion. There were other additional circumstances which, even apart from the admission, were, in his opinion, sufficient to establish a breach of Condition no. 5. Those may be summarized as follows:\n1. The quantity of liquor admittedly consumed by the respondent, coupled with the doubt, after hearing the evidence of the respondent and his brother, that they had told the whole truth on this subject.\n2. The conclusions reached by the police, after seeing the respondent's condition following the accident, which led to his immediate arrest.\n3. The circumstances of the accident itself.\nIn view of this evidence I do not think that the finding of fact made by the learned trial judge, that the respondent was incapable of the proper management of his vehicle as a result of alcohol, ought properly to have been disturbed on appeal.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed, the trial judgment restored and the appellant should be entitled to its costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Abbott and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRitchie J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec4 allowing an appeal from a judgment of Tellier J. of the Superior Court of the District of Terrebonne whereby he dismissed the respondent's action in warranty arising out of the appellant's refusal to defend an action brought against the respondent for damages sustained by one Andre Lanoue when his Pontiac car was struck in the rear by a Meteor owned and operated by the respondent and insured by the appellant.\nThe appellant denied liability on the ground that the respondent was in breach of Condition no. 5 of the conditions which form a part of the insurance policy in question. This condition reads as follows:\n5. L'assureur n'encourra aucune responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de la police: Quant \u00e0 l'assur\u00e9\u20141. Si l'assur\u00e9 se sert de ou conduit l'automobile\n(a) Lorsqu'il est sous l'influence de boissons enivrantes ou de drogues au point d'\u00eatre, pour le moment, incapable de manoeuvrer convenablement l'automobile;\nThe equivalent of this provision is to be found in the following statutory condition which is in force in the common law provinces of Canada:\nThe insurer shall not drive or operate the automobile whilst under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs to such an extent as to be for the time being incapable of the proper control of the automobile.\nBy raising this defence the appellant assumed the burden of proving that at the time of the accident the respondent was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs \"au point d'\u00eatre, pour le moment, incapable de manoeuvrer convenablement l'automobile\". (The italics are mine.)\nThe evidence given by the respondent and his brother as to the amount of liquor consumed by the respondent did not impress the trial judge who said:\nEvidemment la preuve contraire de la quantit\u00e9 d'alcool r\u00e9ellement consomm\u00e9e \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 rencontrer, mais les t\u00e9moignages des deux fr\u00e8res Arsenault d\u00e9montrent des contradictions, des h\u00e9sitations qui laissent planer certains doutes \u00e0 ce sujet;\nAs the learned trial judge had the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses, his finding in this regard cannot, in my opinion, be safely disturbed, and the evidence of the two witnesses who testified in the respondent's favour as to his sobriety after the accident was far from impressive so that if the respondent had had the burden of proving that he was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor to the point of being incapable of properly operating his automobile he could not be said to have discharged it. It was, however, for the appellant to prove affirmatively that Condition no. 5 had been violated and, apart from the unsatisfactory evidence of drinking given by the Arsenault brothers themselves, the evidence of the respondent's condition at the time of the accident is limited to the circumstances of the accident itself, the fact that the respondent had pleaded guilty to driving while his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol and the evidence of the police officers Tass\u00e9 and Calv\u00e9.\nIn direct examination Tass\u00e9 says of the respondent: \"Il n'\u00e9tait pas dans un \u00e9tat de conduire une automobile.\" It is quite apparent, however, from his cross-examination that he remembered nothing of the incident and was basing his evidence entirely on a report which he had made at the time. The following excerpt from his evidence is significant:\nQ. Comment marchait-il?\nR. Je ne peux pas dire, je ne m'en souviens pas du tout. Je me base sur le rapport, je ne me souviens pas ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le temps.\nQ. Vous n'\u00eates pas en \u00e9tat de vous souvenir ce qui est arriv\u00e9?\nR. Du tout.\nOfficer Calv\u00e9's description of the respondent is: \"\u2026je me suis aper\u00e7u que monsieur, malheureusement, avait les facultes affaiblies par l'alcool\". It is noteworthy that Officer Calv\u00e9 used the phrase \"affaiblies par l'alcool\" to describe the condition of the respondent, thus employing the language of the Criminal Code (s. 223) in respect of which the respondent had pleaded guilty. Section 223 reads as follows:\n223. Quiconque, \u00e0, un moment o\u00f9 sa capacit\u00e9 de conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur est affaiblie par l'effet de l'alcool ou d'une drogue, conduit un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur ou en a la garde ou le contr\u00f4le, que ce v\u00e9hicule soit en mouvement ou non, est coupable d'un acte criminel ou d'une infraction punissable sur declaration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9 \u2026\nIt is particularly significant in this connection to note that the learned trial judge treated the offence described in this section and to which the respondent pleaded guilty as being synonymous with the conduct described in Condition no. 5 of the policy. In this regard he says:\nLe demandeur n'a pas contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9nonciation port\u00e9e contre lui, il a plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 l'accusation. Il a reconnu que le 28 avril 1956, il avait conduit une automobile alors que sa capacit\u00e9 de conduire \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e par l'alcool. Ce sont presque les m\u00eames termes que nous rencontrons dans l'exception pr\u00e9vue par la condition n\u00b0 5 de la police. La capacit\u00e9 de conduire une automobile alors que cett\u00e9 capacit\u00e9 est affectee par 1'alcool est pour ainsi dire synonyme a l'incapacit\u00e9 de conduire convenablement une automobile alors que l'on est sous l'influence de boissons enivrantes.\nThese observations make it apparent that the learned trial judge proceeded on the assumption that the condition of being \"incapable de manoeuvrer convenablement l'automobile\" was the same thing as having the ability to drive a motor vehicle \"affaiblie par l'effet de l'alcool\" and in my view this misconception of the nature and effect of the fifth condition of the policy governed his whole approach to the question before him.\nSection 223 of the Criminal Code is designed for the protection of the public, whereas the fifth condition of the policy is definitive of circumstances which relieve the insurer from liability. The word \"impaired\" or \"affaiblie\" as used in s. 223 must be construed in contradistinction to the provisions of s. 222 of the Criminal Code which provide that:\nEvery one who, while intoxicated or under the influence of a narcotic drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence \u2026.\nThe phrase describing a driver as having \"sa capacit\u00e9 de conduire un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 moteur \u2026 affaiblie par l'effet de l\u2019alcool\" or \"his ability to drive a motor vehicle \u2026 impaired by alcohol\" connotes to me a condition in which the driver is a potential danger to the other users of the highway because he is more likely to drive his motor vehicle improperly than he would be if he had not consumed so much alcool. In my view there is a wide difference between being likely to drive improperly and being incapable of driving properly. Every driver who is under the influence of liquor to the point of being incapable of proper control is certainly impaired, but in my opinion it does not follow that every impaired driver is necessarily incapable of proper control. The danger to the public which is involved in driving an automobile while the ability to drive is impaired is recognized by the language of s. 223 of the Criminal Code, but the terms of Condition no. 5 do not serve to relieve an insurer from liability unless and until it has been proved by a preponderance of evidence that the insured was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to the point of being incapable of the proper control of the automobile. I agree with the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench that the respondent's plea of guilty was an extra-judicial admission which was satisfactorily explained by his evidence to the effect that he had been persuaded to make such a plea by his brother and a police officer and that he had no legal advice, but in any event, as I have indicated, it is my view that the admission that he was \"affaibli\" within the meaning of s. 223 was not an admission that he was \"incapable\" and had, therefore, violated Condition no. 5 of the policy.\nIn conformity with the above, I am of opinion that the evidence of the Arsenault brothers is of no assistance in determining the respondent's condition at the time of the accident, that the evidence of the police officers does not establish that the respondent was incapable of properly operating his automobile, and that even if the respondent's plea of guilty had not been satisfactorily explained it could not amount to anything more than an admission that the respondent was \"affaibli\" at the time of the accident and would, therefore, not serve to relieve the appellant from liability.\nIt is true that the circumstances of the accident itself were consistent with the respondent being under the influence of intoxicating liquor so as to be, for the time being, incapable of properly operating his automobile, but they were equally consistent with negligence for which indemnity is provided in the insurance policy.\nCondition no. 5 of the policy is not designed to relieve the insurer of liability by reason of the manner in which the automobile is operated, but is exclusively concerned with the question of whether or not the insured was driving whilst under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs to a point when he was incapable of properly operating his automobile. It is the condition of the insured and not the nature of the accident which relieves the insurer from liability, and although the nature of the accident may be a circumstance to be taken into consideration in determining the condition of the insured it does not of itself constitute proof that the policy condition has been violated. Like the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench, it is not without much hesitation that I have concluded that the learned trial judge was in error, but the advantage which he had of seeing and hearing the witnesses was, in my opinion, counterbalanced by the fact that he treated Condition no. 5 of the policy as relieving the insurer from liability in cases where the insured's ability to drive is impaired by alcohol instead of limiting its application to cases where it can be proved that the insured was incapable of properly operating his automobile.\nIn my view the appellant has failed to discharge the burden which it assumed by its pleading of proving by a preponderance of evidence that the respondent violated Condition no. 5 of the policy.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Abbott and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron & Monet, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Brais, Campbell, Mercier & Leduc, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

In an action attacking the constitutionality of a 1956 amendment to the Excise Tax Act, (1956 (Can.), c. 37, s. 3), imposing a tax on special editions of non-Canadian periodicals, it was alleged by the plaintiff that the true object or intent of the legislation was to benefit one segment of the Canadian publishing industry at the expense of another segment of the same industry, and that in pith and substance the legislation was in relation to property and civil rights reserved exclusively to provincial jurisdiction. At the trial, the plaintiff attempted to prove these allegations by introducing evidence by reference to the budget speech made by the Minister of Finance in the House of Commons. He submitted twenty-four questions to be asked the Minister and others. The Crown objected to such evidence and the trial judge sustained the objections. The Court of Queen's Bench, in a majority judgment, ruled that the evidence was admissible. The Crown obtained leave from this Court to appeal.\nHeld: The extrinsic evidence sought to be introduced by the plaintiff was inadmissible.\nDictum of Locke J. in Texada Mines v. Attorney General of British Columbia, [1960] S.C.R. 713 at 720, referring to certain statements purporting to have been made by the Premier of British Columbia and the Minister of Mines that had the evidence been tendered it would have been rejected as inadmissible declared to be a correct statement of the law.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing interlocutory decisions of Scott C.J. Appeal allowed.\nFran\u00e7ois Mercier, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. L. O'Brien, Q.C., E. E. Saunders and C. K. Irving, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014By leave of this Court the Attorney General of Canada appeals from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec2, maintaining an appeal from twenty-four interlocutory judgments rendered during the trial of this action by the Honourable W. B. Scott, at that time Associate Chief Justice of the Superior Court. The plaintiff-respondent, Reader's Digest Association (Canada) Ltd., S\u00e9lection du Reader's Digest (Canada) Lt\u00e9e, having its head office and principal place of business in Montreal, asks for a declaration that Part II of the Excise Tax Act, comprising ss. 8, 9, 10 and 11, as enacted by s. 3 of c. 37 of the Statutes of Canada, 1956, and the Regulations made pursuant thereto, are ultra vires. For the purposes of this appeal it is sufficient to state that in substance the respondent alleges that the impugned legislation and regulations have the intent of benefiting one part of the publishing industry at the expense of another and that the legislation and regulations in pith and substance are in relation to property and civil rights in the Province of Quebec and that therefore they are outside of the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada.\nIn para. 15 of its declaration the respondent sets out what is alleged to be a speech made in the House of Commons by the then Minister of Finance, the Honourable Walter E. Harris. At the hearing the respondent attempted to adduce evidence by Mr. Harris, the Honourable Donald Fleming (the present Minister of Finance), Mr. David Sim (Deputy Minister of National Revenue), Mr. L\u00e9on Raymond (Clerk of the House of Commons) and Mr. Alan Donnelly (a Press Gallery correspondent). The objections to this evidence by the appellant were allowed by the presiding judge. The relevant questions and the rulings made thereon are as follows:\n1. Mr. Harris\n\"Mr. Harris, I don't suppose there is anything privileged in the fact that the Minister of Finance, when he makes his budget report and presents his budget report, is speaking for the Government?\"\nJudgment:\u2014\n\"Objection maintained.\"\n2. Mr. Harris\n\"Mr. Harris, as Minister of Finance, when you were Minister of Finance, in 1956, did you authorize the distribution to the Press, to Radio, and to Television, in advance of your budget address, the text of the address, to be given to the public?\"\nJudgment:\u2014\n\"Objection maintained.\"\nand later:\u2014\n\"The objection to this question is maintained.\"\n3. Mr. Harris\n\"Mr. Harris, did you, as Minister of Finance, make a statement as to the true purpose and intent of the legislation herein?\"\nJudgment (To the witness):\u2014\n\"Don't answer that question. I ruled that question is illegal.\"\n4. Mr. Harris\n\"Mr. Harris, did you give to representatives of the press, television and radio a statement of the government's purpose in promoting this legislation before Parliament?\" Judgment:\u2014\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n5.

Mr. Harris\n\"Mr. Harris, when you spoke as Minister of Finance, is it necessary in advance to have your budget report and address approved by Cabinet?\"\nJudgment:\u2014\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n7. Mr. Harris\n\"Mr. Harris, when presenting this legislation, the impugned legislation to Parliament, did you speak on behalf of the then government?\"\nJudgment:\u2014\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n8. Mr. Harris\n\"Mr. Harris, did you find that after you had proposed this legislation to Parliament that your statement as to the purpose of the legislation was given wide publicity throughout the Dominion of Canada?\"\nJudgment:\u2014\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n9. Mr. Sim\n\"Mr. Sim, it was part of your duties as head of the Department of National Revenue to look to the administration of Part Two of the Excise Tax Act as enacted in 1956?\"\nJudgment:\u2014\n\"Do not answer that.\"\nQuestioned by the Court:\u2014\n\"Q. Are your duties laid down by an Act of Parliament as Deputy Minister? A. Yes, sir.\nQ. By Statute? A. Yes, sir.\"\n\"By Me O'Brien:\u2014\nWith respect, My Lord, I think that in the absence of an objection from my friends that the question should be allowed.\nBy the Court:\u2014\nThe Court has some discretion.\nBy Me OBrien:\u2014\nI do not think so, My Lord, with respect.\nBy the Court:\u2014\nYou can take an exception. By Me OBrien:\u2014\nI so do, My Lord.\nBy the Court:\u2015\nI think that is the best evidence.\nBy Me OBrien:\u2015\nI think the best evidence would probably be an Order in Council.\nBy the Court:\u2015\nHe is the Deputy Minister of National Revenue. I maintain my ruling as to that.\"\n10. Mr. Donnelly\n\"Will you tell the Court what was done by the government in releasing to the press the statement of the Minister of Finance concerning his budget address and, more particularly, concerning the resolution he was introducing in respect of the legislation here impugned?\"\nJudgment:\u2015\n\"Objection maintained.\"\n11.

Mr. Donnelly\n\"Will you state, Mr. Donnelly, whether yon have read in newspapers in Canada a reproduction of the statement given by the Minister of Finance to the Press, television and radio outside of the limits of the House of Commons?\"\nJudgment:\u2015\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n14. Mr. Donnelly\n\"Mr. Donnelly, when despatches that are sent by Canadian Press are published in newspapers, do they usually have some indication in the first line of the despatch as to the source of the news?\"\nJudgment:\u2015\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n15. Mr. Donnelly\n\"I show you a copy, Mr. Donnelly, of the Montreal Gazette dated March 21st, 1956. It is the text of the Minister's statement given to the press.\" Judgment:\u2015\n\"I am not going to allow that to be put in. That is disallowed. I am not going to allow it. I am not going to allow that newspaper to be put in, the Montreal Gazette of the 21st of March, 1956.\"\n16. Mr. Donnelly\n\"Just to save the time of the Court I would call attention to the fact that I wish to ask this witness if the Globe and Mail of Toronto for March 21st, 1956, the Winnipeg Free Press for March 21st, 1956, 'La Presse' of Montreal for March 21st, 1956, the Halifax Chronicle Herald for March 21st, 1956, and the Vancouver Sun for March 21st, 1956, did not all contain despatches sent by Canadian Press in which there was a statement of the avowed purpose and intent of the government to promote the impugned legislation in this case, before Parliament.\"\nJudgment:\u2014\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n17. Mr. Donnelly\n\"To how many papers did you forward your despatches of the budget address?\"\nJudgment:\u2014\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n18.

Mr. Raymond\n\"Mr. Raymond, there is an official report of the statements made in the House of Commons published each day, is there not?\"\nJudgment (after discussion):\u2014\n\"Anyway there is no relevancy whatever to this and it does not need to be answered.\"\n20. Mr. Raymond\n\"Mr. Raymond, will you produce for the Court the record of Hansard for March 20, 1956 and August 7th ?c.\"\nJudgment:\u2015\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n21. Mr. Fleming\n\"Now, Mr. Fleming, in connection with the annual financial report which the Minister of Finance makes to Parliament which is commonly called the Budget Address, would you state to the Court whether in advance of the presentation of that address to the House of Commons it is approved by Cabinet?\"\nJudgment:\u2015\n\"(Objection) maintained. That could have no possible bearing on this case.\"\n22. Mr. Fleming\n\"Now, Mr. Fleming, I understand that there is a procedure under which the secrecy of the budget address is maintained but in order to\u2015let me say\u2015make it more facile for the communication industries, the press, radio and television, the body of the representatives of those industries are segregated in a certain room and outside of the House of Commons. The content of the Budget Address is given to them but they are not allowed to disclose it until after it is delivered in Parliament? Is that correct?\"\nJudgment:\u2015\n\"It has no bearing on the case, Mtre O'Brien. The question is disallowed.\"\n23. Mr. Fleming\n\"Mr. Fleming, I am not going to ask you about any part you have played in the House of Commons in respect of this legislation but you were fully aware of the fact that it was being introduced and of the publicity given to it throughout Canada.\"\nJudgment:\u2015\n\"(Objection) maintained.\"\n24. Mr. Fleming\n\"Mr. Fleming, who speaks on behalf of the government of Canada in respect of financial matters, the question of taxation, the public debt, etc.?\"\nJudgment:\u2015\n\"Objection maintained.\"\nIt is conceded by counsel on behalf of the respondent that the majority, if not all, of the questions set out above would not ordinarily be proper but it is argued that the well known rule in that respect does not apply when the constitutional validity of a statute is in question in Canada. In Home Oil Distributors Ltd. v. Attorney General of British Columbia3, I, with the concurrence of Rinfret J., as he then was, took into consideration a report of a commission under the circumstances there existing, but only for the purpose of showing what was present to the mind of Parliament. The same course had been adopted by the Privy Council in Attorney General for British Columbia v. Attorney General for Canada4 and Ladore v. Bennett5. In the 1937 A.C. case the Committee said at p. 376:\nIt probably would not be contended that the statement of the Minister in the order of reference that the section was enacted to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission bound the Province or must necessarily be treated as conclusive by the Board. But when the suggestion is made that the legislation was not in truth criminal legislation, but was in substance merely an encroachment on the Provincial field, the existence of the Report appears to be a material circumstance.\nHere the argument is that the legislation is not what it appears to be. In the 1939 A.C. case the Report of a commission was objected to in the Courts in Canada but before the Judicial Committee the objection was withdrawn and by consent the Report was placed before Their Lordships. As to this Report it was said at p. 477:\nTheir Lordships do not cite this report as evidence of the facts there found, but as indicating the materials which the Government of the Province had before them before promoting in the Legislature the statute now impugned.\nWe are not concerned in this appeal with the Report of a commission and it is therefore unnecessary to pass upon the point. The dictum of Locke J., speaking for all the Members of this Court, in Texada Mines v. Attorney General of British Columbia6, referring to certain statements purporting to have been made by the Premier of British Columbia and the Minister of Mines, that had the evidence been tendered it would have been rejected as inadmissible, should now be declared to be a correct statement of the law. This conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the matter. The appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) set aside and the rulings of the Superior Court restored and the record returned to that Court. The respondent must pay the appellant his costs in this Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2015This is an appeal, brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench7 allowing an appeal from a number of interlocutory decisions of Scott C.J. and returning the record to the Superior Court.\nBy section 3 of chapter 37 of the Statutes of Canada, 1956, 4\u20135 Elizabeth II, Parliament amended the Excise Tax Act by adding thereto Part II.\nBy the terms of this Part there was levied a tax of 20% on the value of advertising material contained in periodicals printed in or outside Canada for publication in Canada, if the periodical\n(1) contained editorial material (which is defined as any printed material other than advertising) at least 25% of which was the same or substantially the same as editorial material contained in one or more copies of a particular non-Canadian periodical, whether in the same or in some other language; and\n(2) contained any advertising material that was not contained in such non-Canadian periodical.\nThe effect of this Statute was to levy on the respondent a tax of 20% on the value of advertising material in its two publications which were printed and published in Canada, namely, \"The Reader's Digest\" and \"S\u00e9lection du Reader's Digest\". The tax, under the terms of the Statute, was to become applicable on January 1, 1957.\nThe respondent alleges that duly authorized representatives of the Government of Canada called upon respondent to make payment of a tax of $35,225.32, in respect of advertising contained in respondent's two said magazines, which were printed, issued and delivered to the public in Canada in the month of January 1957. The respondent commenced an action in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, on April 17, 1957, asking \"that it be adjudged that Part II of the Excise Tax Act, Sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 as enacted by Section 3 of Chapter 37 of the Statutes of Canada, 1956, and the Regulations made pursuant thereto, are outside the competence and ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, and unconstitutional, and null and void and non-existent; that plaintiff's said two magazines \"The Reader's Digest\" and \"S\u00e9lection du Reader's Digest\" are not periodicals as defined by Part II of the Excise Tax Act; and that plaintiff is not liable for payment of the said sum of $35,225.32 nor required to take out a licence and post a bond for the payment of taxes under Part II of the Excise Tax Act.\"\nThe grounds on which the claim for this relief is asserted, so far as they are relevant to this appeal, are set out in the declaration as follows, (i) that Part II of the Excise Tax Act \"was avowedly enacted for the sole purpose of benefiting one segment of the publishing industry at the expense of another segment thereof\", (ii) that Part II and the regulations made thereunder are ultra vires \"as being legislation dealing with classes of subjects in relation to which the Parliament of Canada has no jurisdiction,\" and (iii) that in pith and substance Part II and the regulations made thereunder are \"related to the property and civil rights of the plaintiff\".\nThe appellant in his plea denied each of the paragraphs in the declaration in which the grounds summarized above were alleged and in paragraph 12 pleaded:\nThat Part II of the Excise Tax Act sections 8, 9, 10, 11 as enacted by section 3 of chapter 37 of the Statutes of Canada 1956 and the regulations made pursuant thereto by the Minister of National Revenue published on November 14th, 1956 in The Canada Gazette, vol. 90, Part II, page 441, were enacted and made within the competence, the jurisdiction and the legislative powers of the Parliament of Canada;\nThe issue so raised is the only one relevant to the question of admissibility of evidence with which we are concerned on this appeal.\nThe main ground on which the respondent attacks the constitutional validity of Part II of the Excise Tax Act is stated in its factum as follows:\nThe principal basis of Respondent's action is that the impugned statute, while in form a taxing statute, was not intended for the raising of money, but that the true object or intent of the statute was to benefit one segment of the publishing industry in Canada at the expense of another. Respondent takes the position that if the true object and intent of the statute were achieved its success would be measured inversely by the revenue which it yields.\nWe are not concerned, on this appeal, with the soundness of this contention or with the merits of the action. The only question before us is as to the admissibility of certain evidence tendered at the trial on behalf of the respondent and rejected by the learned trial judge.\nIt is not necessary to set out in detail the items of evidence tendered and rejected at the trial for the questions raised are accurately summarized in the respondent's factum as follows:\nThe only real questions in issue in the present appeal are:\u2015\n(1) whether Respondent could introduce evidence of the pronouncement made on behalf of the Government by the Minister of Finance concerning the intent of the legislation in order to show the material that was before Parliament when the legislation was being promoted; and\n(2) whether Respondent could prove that the legislation so introduced and promoted was given first, second and third readings on the same day without amendment, and was enacted by the Senate in the form in which it was introduced without amendment.\nCounsel for the respondent concedes that if no question were raised as to the constitutional validity of the statute the evidence in question would be inadmissible in aid of the interpretation of any ambiguous provision thereof. That this is so was laid down as long ago as 1769 when in Millar v. Taylor8, Wilies J. said:\nThe sense and meaning of an Act of Parliament must be collected from what it says when passed into a law; and not from the history of changes it underwent in the house where it took its rise. That history is not known to the other house or to the sovereign.\nThe general rule in this regard, where the question is one of interpretation, is accurately stated in Halsbury, 2nd ed., vol. 31, p. 490, as follows:\n621. Light may be thrown on the scope of a statute by looking at what Parliament was doing contemporaneously, and at the history of the statute; but even when words in a statute are so ambiguous that they may be construed in more than one sense, regard may not be had to the Bill by which it was introduced nor to the fate of amendments dealt with in committee of either House, nor to what has been said in Parliament or elsewhere, nor to the recommendations of a Royal Commission which shortly preceded the statute under consideration. Accepting the above as a correct statement of the law where the question is one of the interpretation of an admittedly valid statue, Mr. O'Brien argues that the rule is otherwise when the question is whether a legislature, possessing not an absolute jurisdiction but a law-making authority of a limited or qualified character, has exceeded its powers and under the guise of legislating in relation to a subject-matter committed to it has in reality legislated in relation to a subject-matter assigned exclusively to another body.\nBoth counsel informed us that they had been unable to find any reported case in which the question presented in this appeal has been decided although there is a dictum in a recent decision of this Court, to be mentioned later, which deals with the matter.\nIn support of the admissibility of the evidence in question Mr. O'Brien puts forward the following argument:\u2015 To aid in interpreting a statute the report of a Royal Commission which shortly preceded the passing of the statute is inadmissible. It was so held by the House of Lords in Assam Railways and Trading Co. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue9. Lord Wright, with whom all the other law lords agreed on this point, said at p. 458:\nIt is clear that the language of a Minister of the Crown in proposing in Parliament a measure which eventually becomes law is inadmissible and the report of Commissioners is even more removed from value as evidence of intention, because it does not follow that their recommendations were accepted.\nThis language indicates that the statement of a Minister of the Crown in introducing a bill in Parliament would be more readily admitted than the report of a commission; but in determining questions arising under the British North America Act as to whether Parliament or a provincial legislature by the use of a colourable device has invaded the legislative field reserved to the other the Judicial Committee and this Court have from time to time admitted in evidence and made use of the reports of commissions as appears from the judgments in Ladore v. Bennett10; Attorney-General for B.C. v. Attorney-General for Canada11; Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada12 and Home Oil Distributors Ltd. v. Attorney-General of B.C.13; therefore a fortiori in determining such questions the statement of a Minister of the Crown in introducing a bill in Parliament is admissible in evidence.\nThe above brief summary scarcely does justice to Mr. O'Brien's logical and persuasive argument but it indicates its substance. In considering this argument it is necessary to examine the four cases last mentioned above.\nIn Ladore v. Bennett, supra, a Royal Commission had made a report in April 1935 disclosing the existence of a serious financial position in the City of Windsor and three adjoining municipalities. With the materials in that report before them the Government of the Province of Ontario promoted in the legislature an Act to amalgamate the four municipalities and containing, inter alia, provisions for refunding the debts of those municipalities. The Act was attacked, in an action, as being ultra vires of the legislature on the ground that it invaded the field of the Dominion as to (i) Bankruptcy and Insolvency and (ii) Interest and on the further ground that it affected private rights outside the province. In the courts in Canada the report when tendered in evidence was objected to and the objection was upheld, but before the Judicial Committee the objection was withdrawn and by consent of both parties the report was placed before their Lordships. Lord Atkin, who delivered the judgment of the Board, after setting out in some detail the serious financial position disclosed by the report said, at p. 477:\nTheir Lordships do not cite this report as evidence of the facts there found, but as indicating the materials which the Government of the Province had before them before promoting in the Legislature the statute now impugned.\nThe manner in which the report had been dealt with in the courts below appears in the reasons of Henderson J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal14:\nThis Commission in due course made a report which was tendered in evidence and received by the learned trial judge (Hogg J.) subject to objection. Subsequently he sustained the objection and ruled that the report is not evidence, with which conclusion I agree. Attorney-General for B.C. v. Attorney-General for Canada, supra, was an appeal from a judgment of this Court on a reference by the Governor-General in Council raising the question whether s. 498A of the Criminal Code, introduced by s. 9 of 25 and 26 Geo. V, c. 56, was ultra vires of Parliament. It appears from the report in this Court15, that the order of reference contained the following statement:\nThe Minister observes that the said section 498A was enacted for the purpose of giving effect to certain recommendations contained in the Report of the Royal Commission on Price Spreads but that doubts exist or are entertained as to whether the Parliament of Canada had legislative jurisdiction to enact this section in whole or in part.\nThe reasons delivered in this Court make no reference to this Report of the Royal Commission. The only mention made of it in the judgment of the Judicial Committee is in the following passage at p. 376:\nIn the present case there seems to be no reason for supposing that the Dominion are using the criminal law as a pretence or pretext, or that the legislature is in pith and substance only interfering with civil rights in the Province. Counsel for New Brunswick called the attention of the Board to the Report of the Royal Commission on Price Spreads, which is referred to in the order of reference. It probably would not be contended that the statement of the Minister in the order of reference that the section was enacted to give effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission bound the Provinces or must necessarily be treated as conclusive by the Board. But when the suggestion is made that the legislation was not in truth criminal legislation, but was in substance merely an encroachment on the Provincial field, the existence of the report appears to be a material circumstance.\nProprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada, supra, was an appeal from a judgment of this Court on a reference by the Governor-in-Council. The only mention of any report in the judgment of the Judicial Committee is of a report by a select committee of the House of Commons made in 1888 which preceded the enactment in 1889 of 52 Victoria, c. 41, an Act for the prevention and suppression of combinations formed in restraint of trade. This is referred to (at p. 318) as part of \"the history of the Act and the section of the Code so far as it has been laid before their Lordships.\" The report was printed as part of the factum of the Attorney-General for Canada in this Court. It was not referred to in any of the reasons delivered in this Court and there is no discussion as to whether it would have been admissible had objection been taken to its introduction in evidence.\nIt will be observed that none of these three cases decides that, in an action inter partes raising the question of the validity of a statute, a report of a Royal Commission is admissible in evidence if objected to. In civil cases the rules of evidence may be relaxed by consent of parties and this was done in Ladore v. Bennett. There is nothing in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in that case to suggest that in the view of the Board the decision of the Court of Appeal affirming the rejection of the report by Hogg J. was wrong in law. It is scarcely necessary to say that the statement that the rules of evidence may, in civil cases, be relaxed by the consent of parties does not mean that the parties can empower the Court to found its decision on matters which are not, as a matter of law, germane to the issue which it is called upon to decide; it means rather that proof of matters which are germane may be made in such manner as the parties agree and not necessarily in strict compliance with the technical rules as to admissibility.\nIn Home Oil Distributors Ltd. v. Attorney-General of B.C., supra, an action was brought for a declaration that the Coal and Petroleum Products Control Board Act, 1937 (B.C.), c. 8, was ultra vires of the legislature and for other relief. Manson J., at the trial, held that certain sections of the Act were ultra vires and granted an injunction. The Court of Appeal unanimously reversed his decision on the merits and their decision was upheld by this Court. The plaintiff tendered in evidence a report made by a commission on the petroleum industry. Its admission was objected to but Manson J. over-ruled the objection. On appeal this ruling was upheld by a majority of the Court of Appeal, Martin C.J.B.C. and Sloan J.A.; McQuarrie J.A. dissenting was of opinion that the report was inadmissible. The report consisted of three volumes only the first two of which were in existence when the impugned Act was passed.\nOn an interlocutory appeal Martin C.J.B.C. dealt with the point as follows16:\nIt is submitted by appellants' counsel that this report cannot be admitted to supply facts to support an attempt to show what was in the mind of the Legislature in passing a statute valid ex facie, and the objection is one of primary importance because it is conceded by respondents' counsel that, if the report cannot be resorted to, then there are no facts before us to support an attack upon the validity of the Act. But it is submitted by respondents' counsel that the report should be admitted as being that of a commission finding facts not yet contradicted going to show that the real purpose and effect of the Act is an attempt to regulate the international oil industry and to foster our native coal industry at the expense of that of foreign petroleum. Many cases were cited, pro and con, which have received careful consideration with the result that we think the report should be admitted in evidence in so far only as it finds facts which are relevant to the ascertainment of the said alleged purpose and the effect of the enactment.\nSloan J.A. agreed while McQuarrie J.A. dissented.\nIn giving judgment on the main appeal Sloan J.A., with whom Martin C.J.B.C. agreed, said17:\nIn leaving this appeal I would make short reference to the admissibility in evidence of the report of the Commissioner on the Petroleum Industry. It comprises three volumes two of which we held on an interlocutory appeal in this case to be admissible in evidence \"in so far only as it (the report) finds facts which are relevant to the ascertainment of the ?c purpose and the effect of the enactment:\" (1938) 53 B.C., 355 at 360. I see no reason to depart from the conclusion therein reached and include Vol. III within that ruling.\"\nMcQuarrie J.A., as mentioned, dissented as to this ruling.\nIf the matter rested here, I would have no hesitation in preferring the conclusion of McQuarrie J.A. on this point to that of the majority in the Court of Appeal, but it is necessary to consider whether a contrary view was expressed in the judgment of this Court. The appeal to this Court was heard by six members. They were unanimous in holding that the appeal was governed by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Shannon's case18, and should be dismissed. Duff C.J., Crocket J. and Hudson J. made no mention of the report of their reasons. Kerwin J. (as he then was), with whom Rinfret J. (as he then was) agreed, after holding that the Shannon case was decisive of the appeal, ended his reasons as follows, at pp. 447 and 448:\nIn coming to this conclusion I have taken the report of a commissioner appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council as being a recital of what was present to the mind of the legislature, in enacting the principal Act, as to what was the existing law, the evil to be abated and the suggested remedy (Heydon's Case, (1584) 2 Coke's Rep. 18.). There can, I think, be no objection in principle to the use of the report for that pur- pose, and Lord Halsbury's dictum in Eastern Photographic Machine Company v. Comptroller General of Patents (1898) A.C. 571, at 575, is to the same effect. It was argued by counsel for the appellants that the statements in the report were to be taken as facts admitted or proved, but that this cannot be done is quite clear from the authorities, the most recent of which is Assam Railways and Traders Company v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1935) A.C. 445.\nI have not considered the provisions of the amending Act which are objected to, and make no comment as to those provisions.\nDavis J. deals at some length with the question of the admissibility and possible effect of the report. He refers to the Assam case, supra, and the dictum of Lord Halsbury in the Eastman Photographic case19, states that the furthest the Courts have gone recently is in Ladore v. Bennett, supra, points out that in that case the report was put before their Lordships by consent and continues, at p. 453:\nA rule somewhat wider than the general rule may well be necessary in considering the constitutionality of legislation under a federal system where legislative authority is divided between the central and the local legislative bodies. But even if that be so, the legislation here in question is expressly confined and limited to the sale of the products of the particular industry in, and for use in, the province and must, upon the well settled authorities, be held to be valid legislation.\nOn a careful reading of all that he said on the subject it would appear to me that Davis J. expressed no final opinion on the admissibility of the report.\nI have reached the conclusion that there is no decision which requires us to hold that a report of a Royal Commission made prior to the passing of a statute and relating to the subject-matter with which the statute deals, but not referred to in the statute, is admissible in evidence in an action seeking to impugn the validity of that statute. In my opinion the general rule is that if objected to it should be excluded.\nIf I am right in this conclusion the basis of Mr. O'Brien's argument, which I endeavoured to summarize above, disappears, and it becomes unnecessary to consider whether if it were held that in a case such as the present a report of a royal commission would be legally admissible, although objected to, it would follow that the statement alleged in the pleadings to have been made by the Minister who introduced the bill was also admissible. It may, however, be well to recall the statement of Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathern20:\n\u2026 a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it.\nIn my opinion the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court was right in rejecting the evidence which is the subject-matter of this appeal. It was conceded and is clear on the authorities that the statement of the Minister in introducing the bill would be inadmissible in aid of the interpretation of the statute as finally passed into a law. I can discern no difference in principle to afford a sufficient reason for holding it to be admissible where, the words of the statute being plain, it is sought to show that Parliament was encroaching upon a field committed exclusively to the provincial legislature.\nThe nature of the task which confronts the Court when such a claim is put forward has been dealt with in many judgments of the Judicial Committee and of this Court. Nowhere, I think, is it more accurately and succinctly stated than by Duff C.J. in Reference re Alberta Statutes21. After stating that the question to be determined in relation to the Act respecting the Taxation of Banks was whether it was an enactment in exercise of the provincial power to raise a revenue for provincial purposes by direct taxation or was legislation which in its true character related to the Incorporation of Banks and Banking, he said, at p. 127:\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee in Union Colliery of B.C. Ltd. v. Bryden (1899) A.C. 580, is sufficient authority for the proposition that the answer to this question is to be found by ascertaining the effect of the legislation in the known circumstances to which it is to be applied.\nThis statement was adopted by my brother Locke in giving the unanimous judgment of this Court in Texada Mines Ltd. v. Attorney-General of B.C.22.\nIn the case at bar it will be open to the parties to lead evidence to show the circumstances to which the impugned sections are to be applied but it must be evidence in a form that is legally admissible and the statement of the Minister, alleged in the plaintiff's declaration to have been made, is not in my opinion legally admissible.\nAs was said by Viscount Sumner in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada23:\nThe matter (i.e. the question of the validity of the statute) depends upon the effect of the legislation not upon its purpose.\nSomething was said in argument as to the necessity of ascertaining the true intention of Parliament in enacting the impugned sections. But Parliament is an entity which from its nature cannot be said to have any motive or intention other than that which is given expression in its formal acts. While he was speaking of an incorporated company, the words of Lord Sumner in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Fisher's Executors24, appear to me to apply with even greater force to Parliament, consisting as it does of the Sovereign, the Senate and the House of Commons. At p. 411 Lord Sumner said:\nIn any case desires and intentions are things of which a company is incapable. These are the mental operations of its shareholders and officers. The only intention that the company has is such as is expressed in or necessarily follows from its proceedings. It is hardly a paradox to say that the form of a company's resolutions and instruments is their substance.\nWhile I have reached the conclusion that the evidence in question in this appeal is inadmissible as a matter of law under the authorities and on principle and not from a consideration of the inconvenience that would result from a contrary view, it may be pointed out that if it were held that the Minister's statement should be admitted there would appear to be no ground on which anything said in either House between the introduction of the bill and its final passing into a law could be excluded.\nI am fortified in the conclusion at which I have arrived by the dictum of my brother Locke in the Texada case, supra, at p. 720:\nAt the trial of this action Sullivan J. considered the earlier legislation in arriving at the conclusion that the statute itself was invalid as being an attempt, under the guise of imposing a direct tax upon an interest in land, to regulate or restrain the export of ore and concentrates from the province. While that learned judge, in the course of his judgment, referred to certain statements purporting to have been made by the Premier of the Province and the Minister of Mines to the effect that the legislation was designed to discourage the export of iron ore so that eventually an integrated steel industry could be established in the province, he made it clear that he came to his conclusion without reference to this. That such statement had been made was not proven at the trial and had the evidence been tendered it would, no doubt, have been rejected as inadmissible.\nI realize that the words I have italicized were not necessary to the decision of that appeal but they were concurred in by every member of the full Court. In my opinion they correctly state the law.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, restore the rulings of the Superior Court on the objections to evidence and direct that the record be returned to the Superior Court.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nFauteux J.:\u2015For the reasons given by the Chief Justice, I agree that the Appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) set aside, the rulings of the Superior Court restored and the record returned to that Court; the whole with costs against the respondent, in this Court and in the Court of Queen's Bench.\nIt may be pertinent to add the following comment. The Judges of the majority, in the Court of Appeal, relied particularly on the decision of this Court in Henry Birks and Sons Ltd. and others v. City of Montreal and A.G. of Quebec25. On their interpretation of the reasons given in that case, this Court would have considered, as evidence admissible for the purpose of establishing the true object and nature of the municipal by-law giving rise to the litigation, two letters addressed to the members of the Municipal Council prior to the adoption of the by-law.\nWith deference, the validity of the statute, under the authority of which the by-law was adopted, to wit: An Act to amend the Early Closing Act, 1949, 13 Geo. VI, c. 61, was the sole subject-matter of the debate and of the judgment in this Court. Indeed, having reached the view that the Act under consideration was ultra vires of the Legislature, this Court did not and did not have to concern itself with the by-law, or any matters related to its adoption. The evidence relevant to the issue and considered in the Birks case did not include these letters nor was it evidence of a character similar to that which is objected to in the present case.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2015The circumstances giving rise to this appeal have been fully outlined in reasons for judgment to be delivered by other members of the Court and it would be superfluous for me to repeat them. I agree that this appeal should be allowed, but wish to add the following observations concerning the argument of counsel for the respondent which has been referred to by my brother Cartwright.\nIn support of his contention that the statements by Ministers of the Crown sought to be introduced in this case, which would not ordinarily be admissible, should be admitted on the ground that the statute here in question is being attacked as a colourable attempt to encroach on a forbidden field of legislation, counsel for the respondent cited certain observations made by Lord Wright in Assam Railways and Trading Company v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue26, as authority for the following statement contained in his factum:\nThe Report of a Commission is of less evidentiary value than the statement of a Minister of the Crown in proposing in Parliament a measure which eventually becomes law.\nBased upon this premise, it was contended that because the Reports of Royal Commissions have on occasion been considered by this Court and the Privy Council in cases in which the constitutional validity of a statute was in question, it should, therefore, follow that statements of Ministers made in the course of proposing the legislation are to be admitted in such cases.\nIt is to be noted that the opening words of the passage from Lord Wright's decision on which the respondent's counsel relies so heavily are:\nIt is clear that the language of a Minister of the Crown in proposing in Parliament a measure which eventually becomes law is inadmissible \u2026. (The italics are mine.) This is an unqualified statement, and when Lord Wright goes on to say, \"the Report of Commissioners is even more removed from value as evidence of intention ?c.\" (the italics are mine), he seems to me to be limiting his observations to direct evidence of intention. In my view this interpretation of the passage in question is borne out by the language employed later in the same paragraph which indicates that Lord Wright was not prepared to question Lord Halsbury's admission of such a report in Eastman Photographic Materials Company v. Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs, and Trade-Marks27, which he explained as follows:\n\u2026 Lord Halsbury refers to the Report not directly to ascertain the intention of the words used in the Act, but because, as he says, \"no more accurate source of information as to what was the evil or defect which the Act of Parliament now under construction was intended to remedy could be imagined than the report of that commission.\" Lord Halsbury, it is clear, was treating the Report as extraneous matter to show what were the surrounding circumstances with reference to which the words were used ?c. (The italics are mine.)\nWhile I do not find it necessary in this case to pass upon the admissibility of the Report of a Royal Commission, it does seem to me to be important to note that when such reports have been referred to by this Court and the Privy Council in cases involving the constitutional validity of a statute, they have been referred to otherwise than as direct evidence of intention, and, accordingly, a consideration of these cases in conjunction with Lord Wright's statement to the effect that a Report of Commissioners is less valuable as direct evidence of intention than statements made by Ministers in proposing legislation, cannot afford any basis for the conclusion that the rule excluding such statements by Ministers should be relaxed in the present case.\nI would dispose of this appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Cartwright.\nAppeal allowed.\nAttorney for the defendant, appellant: Fran\u00e7ois Mercier, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: O'Brien, Home, Hall & Nolan, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

The trial judge held the City liable, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was no doubt that the sidewalks were slippery on that day. This was normal in this country, where sudden changes in the weather often occur On that day it had rained and the temperature was slightly above the freezing point. The plaintiff had to prove negligence on the part of the City, and the question was whether at the relevant time the City had taken the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the citizens. The mere fact that a person falls on the sidewalk does not necessarily give rise to a claim for damages. The standard of care required of municipalities is not one of perfection. Municipalities are not an insurer of pedestrians and could not reasonably be required to foresee the uncertainty of the elements. So long as the municipalities proved that they had taken reasonable care within a reasonable time, such as a prudent man would take under similar circumstances, the municipalities could not be held liable. Garberi v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montreal, [1961] S.C.R. 408, applied. In this case the municipality was not negligent.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Brossard J. Appeal dismissed.\nMaurice Bourassa, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nMaurice Fauteux, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le 26 janvier 1954, la demanderesse-appelante, avec une de ses compagnes, retournait chez-elle apr\u00e8s sa journ\u00e9e de travail. Vers 5:45 heures p.m., \u00e0 l'angle des rues Gertrude et Strathmore, dans les limites de la cit\u00e9 de Verdun, elle fit une chute sur le trottoir et s'est inflig\u00e9 des blessures que l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instances a estim\u00e9es \u00e0 $2,582.30. Il a conclu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Cit\u00e9. La Cour du banc de la reine2 a unanimement renvers\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision et a rejet\u00e9 l'action.\nIl n'y a pas de doute que ce jour-l\u00e0, les trottoirs \u00e9taient \u00e9videmment glissants. C'est ce qui arrive normalement dans notre pays, o\u00f9 il nous faut subir les intemp\u00e9ries climat\u00e9riques et les changements rapides des conditions atmosph\u00e9riques. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'il pleuvait, et la temp\u00e9rature a vari\u00e9 de 33\u00b0F. \u00e0 37\u00b0F. et s'est tenue toujours en haut du point de cong\u00e9lation.\nIl est clair qu'aucune pr\u00e9somption de faute ne repose sur la municipalit\u00e9 lorsqu'un pi\u00e9ton est victime d'un accident r\u00e9sultant d'une chute sur un trottoir. Le r\u00e9clamant doit all\u00e9guer et prouver la faute de la Cit\u00e9, et celle-ci ne peut r\u00e9sulter que d'une n\u00e9gligence. La question qui se pose toujours dans les causes de ce genre est de savoir si la municipalit\u00e9 a pris, dans le temps voulu, les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour prot\u00e9ger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des citoyens. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit souvent, et c'est aujourd'hui la jurisprudence dans la province, le fait de faire une chute sur un trottoir ne donne pas n\u00e9cessairement ouverture \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation pour les dommages subis. Ce que l'on exige des municipalit\u00e9s, ce n'est pas un standard de perfection. Elles ne sont nullement les assureurs des pi\u00e9tons, et on ne peut pas raisonnablement leur demander de pr\u00e9voir l'incertitude des \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Comme cette Cour a eu l'occasion de le dire dans Garberi v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al3, la vigilance simultan\u00e9e de tous les moments, dans tous les endroits de leur territoire, serait imposer aux municipalit\u00e9s une obligation d\u00e9raisonnable. Il peut arriver, et il arrive malheureusement des accidents, o\u00f9 s'exerce tr\u00e8s bien la surveillance municipale qui r\u00e9sultent d'aucune n\u00e9gligence et pour lesquels il n'y a pas de compensation sanctionn\u00e9e par la loi civile. Et cette Cour a ajout\u00e9, dans le m\u00eame arr\u00eat, que lorsque la municipalit\u00e9 fera preuve de soin et de diligence raisonnables, lorsqu'elle prend les pr\u00e9cautions que prendraient des personnes prudentes dans des circonstances identiques, elle ne peut \u00eatre recherch\u00e9e devant-les tribunaux civils.\nJe suis d'opinion que dans le cas qui nous occupe, aucune n\u00e9gligence ne peut \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Des \u00e9quipes d'hommes \u00e9taient employ\u00e9es \u00e0 sabler les rues dans tous les endroits de la municipalit\u00e9, et s'il est arriv\u00e9 que sous la force de la pluie le sable a \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9. la d\u00e9fenderesse ne peut en \u00eatre tenue responsable. De plus, l'appelante savait que la rue \u00e9tait glissante, et s'y est aventur\u00e9e quand m\u00eame, avec des chaussures dont les semelles de cuir n'offraient aucune s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et augmentaient au contraire les risques d'accident qui existaient d\u00e9j\u00e0.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: M.

The wife, without telling her husband what she was doing, conveyed \"all her interest in and to\" this property to her daughter by a former marriage. From the time of its execution until after his wife's death, three years later, the plaintiff was unaware of the existence of the deed which remained unregistered until the day following the death of the wife, when the latter's daughter made application for its registration. The Registrar of Titles, before registering this three-year old deed, omitted to make inquiry as to whether the grantor was dead or alive. The husband brought an action for recovery from the assurance fund under s. 223(1) of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 171. The trial judge ruled in favour of the plaintiff but the Court of Appeal held that his action should be dismissed. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe opening words of s. 35(1) of the Act \"except as against the person making the same\" expressly make operative an unregistered instrument against the party making the same. Davidson v. Davidson, [1946] S.C.R. 115, applied; Wright v. Gibbons (1948-1949), 78 C.L.R. 313, distinguished. It was, therefore, apparent that the deed in question operated as an alienation of the wife's interest, and the very fact of her interest being transferred to a stranger of itself destroyed the unity of title without which a joint tenancy cannot exist at common law. The effect of the deed was to change the character of the husband's interest from that a joint tenancy to that of a tenancy in common and thus to extinguish his right to claim title by survivorship.\nHaving regard to the state of the register and to the fact that the unregistered deed was operative to sever the joint tenancy at common law, the Registrar was under no obligation to inquire as to whether the grantor was dead or alive at the time of application for the registration of the deed. There being no suggestion of any other omission, mistake or misfeasance on the part of the Registrar, the plaintiff's claim necessarily failed. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Manson J. for the plaintiff in an action to recover from the assurance fund under the Land Registry Act. Appeal dismissed.\nD. M. Norby, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nM. M. McFarlane, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2],, reversing and setting aside the judgment of the trial judge by which the appellant had been awarded damages against the Attorney-General of British Columbia under the provisions of s. 223(1) of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 171, which read as follows:\n223. (1) \u2026any person sustaining loss or damages caused solely as a result of any omission, mistake, or misfeasance of the Registrar, or any of his officers or clerks, in the execution of their respective duties under this Act, may bring and maintain an action in the Supreme Court against the Attorney-General as nominal defendant for the purpose of recovering the amount of the loss or damages and costs from the Assurance Fund.\nOn March 23, 1956, at which time the appellant and his wife were the registered owners of 3384 Southeast Drive in Vancouver as joint tenants, Mrs. Stonehouse, without telling her husband what she was doing, conveyed \"all her interest in and to\" this property to Mrs. Shirley Munk, her daughter by a former marriage. From the time of its execution until after his wife's death on March 1, 1959, the appellant was unaware of the existence of this deed which remained unregistered until March 2, 1959, when Mrs. Munk made application for its registration at the office of the Registrar of Titles at Vancouver.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant that by reason of the provisions of s. 35(1) of the Land Registry Act the unregistered deed from Mrs. Stonehouse to her daughter had no effect on the appellant's interest as a joint tenant and that when this three-year old deed was presented for registration the Registrar should have been alerted to the possibility of the grantor having died since its execution and the whole title having thus become vested in the appellant as the surviving joint tenant. It is the failure of the Registrar to make inquiry before he registered this deed as to whether the grantor was dead or alive that is now claimed to constitute \"an omission or mistake\" which was the sole cause of the appellant sustaining damage and which accordingly entitled him to bring and maintain the present action against the Attorney-General in accordance with the provisions of s. 223(1).\nWhen, as in this case, application is made for registration of a transfer of land, the title to which is registered, the Registrar is placed under the duty described in s. 156 of the Land Registry Act as follows:\n156. \u2026the Registrar, upon being satisfied that the conveyance or transfer produced has transferred to and vested in the applicant a good safe-holding and marketable title, shall, upon production of the former certificate or duplicate certificate of title, register the title claimed by the applicant in the register.\nWhen Mrs. Munk applied for registration there was in force and uncancelled a certificate of indefeasible title which certified that the appellant and his wife were absolutely entitled to the property in question as \"joint tenants\" subject only to an outstanding judgment which Mrs. Stonehouse had registered against her husband's one-half interest and by virtue of the provisions of s. 38(1) such a certificate is\n\u2026conclusive evidence \u2026as against Her Majesty and all persons whomsoever, that the person named in the certificate is seised of an estate in fee-simple in the land therein described \u2026.\nSheppard J.A. has said of this section in the course of his decision in the Court of Appeal that,\nAs the certificate is conclusive of the owner being seised as against all persons, \u2026it would be conclusive against the Registrar.\nCounsel for the appellant, however, contends that this section must be read in conjunction with s. 156, and that once it is accepted that the unregistered deed did not sever the joint tenancy, it follows that the Registrar could not be satisfied that a three-year old deed from one joint tenant had \"transferred to and vested in the applicant a good safe-holding and marketable title\" to an undivided one-half interest in the property until he had also satisfied himself, by inquiry if necessary, that the grantor of that deed was still alive. I do not, however, find it necessary to decide this question because I have formed the opinion that the joint tenancy in question was severed at the time of the execution and delivery of the deed to Mrs. Munk. As has been indicated, the contention advanced on behalf of the appellant in this latter regard is based on the provisions of s. 35(1) of the Land Registry Act, the relevant portions of which read as follows:\n35. Except as against the person making the same, no instrument \u2026 executed and taking effect after the thirtieth day of June, 1905, purporting to transfer, charge, deal with, or affect land or any estate or interest therein, shall become operative to pass any estate or interest, either at law or in equity, in the land \u2026 until the instrument is registered in compliance with the provisions of this Act; \u2026. (The italics are mine.)\nIn finding that the joint tenancy had not been severed by the execution of the unregistered deed and that the jus accrescendi operated in favour of the appellant immediately on his wife's death so as to vest the whole title in him to the exclusion of Mrs. Munk, the learned trial judge relied, in great measure, as did the appellant's counsel before this Court, on the case of Wright v. Gibbons[3]. This is a decision of the High Court of Australia which held that under the Real Property Act of Tasmania the registration of a document evidencing mutual transfers of their interests inter se between two out of three registered joint tenants had the effect of severing the joint tenancy. This case is cited as authority for the proposition that a registered estate as joint tenants can only be severed by some dealing which results in an alteration of the register book, but the decision is of necessity based on the provisions of the Real Property Act of Tasmania of which Riche J. says at 78 C.L.R. 326: \"The scheme of transfer and registration is the only method by which any alienation or disposition of a share or interest in land may be made.\" This observation clearly indicates that the statute under consideration in that case did not include the exception which is made a part of the British Columbia scheme of transfer and registration by the opening words of s. 35(1) and in the absence of some evidence that those words were considered by the High Court of Australia, the case of Wright v. Gibbons, supra, cannot be considered as an authority bearing in any way directly on the present case. In Davidson v. Davidson[4], Estey J. had occasion to consider the opening words of s. 35(1), and speaking on behalf of this Court at p. 119 he said:\nThese words, \"except as against the person making the same\", expressly make operative an unregistered instrument against the party making the same. Therefore, the transfer executed by the respondent was operative to transfer to the Minto Trading and Development Company Limited whatever estate, either at law or in equity, he was in possession of.\nIt is, therefore, apparent that the deed here in question operated as an alienation of the interest of Mrs. Stonehouse, and the very fact of her interest being transferred to a stranger of itself destroyed the unity of title without which a joint tenancy cannot exist at common law.\nThe effect at common law of a conveyance by one joint tenant to a stranger in title is accurately stated in Cheshire's Modern Real Property, 8th ed., at p. 308, in the following terms:\n\u2026it has long been the law that one joint tenant can alienate his share to a stranger. The effect of such alienation is to convert the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common, since the alienee and the remaining tenant or tenants hold by virtue of different titles and not under that one common title which is essential to the existence of a joint tenancy.\nThe following passage from the decision of Vice-Chancellor Sir Page Wood in Williams v. Hensman[5], is to the same effect. He there says:\nA joint-tenancy may be severed in three ways: in the first place, an act of any one of the persons interested operating upon his own share may create a severance as to that share. The right of each joint-tenant is a right by survivorship only in the event of no severance having taken place of the share which is claimed under the jus accrescendi.\nThere is nothing in the Land Registry Act which changes the effect of the common law in this regard as between the two joint tenants in the present case, and it follows that because the unregistered deed was operative against the share of Mrs. Stonehouse it had the effect of severing the joint tenancy. As Davey J.A. has said in the course of his decision in the Court of Appeal: \"It is the binding effect upon himself of an owner's dealings with his own property that effects a severance of the joint tenancy.\" Under the provisions of s. 35 an unregistered deed could not be operative \"to pass any estate or interest either at law or in equity\" other than that of the grantor, but the effect of Mrs. Munk's deed was not \"to pass\" any such estate or interest of Mr. Stonehouse but rather to change its character from that of a joint tenancy to that of a tenancy in common and thus to extinguish his right to claim title by survivorship which is an incident of the former but not of the latter type of interest. The right of survivorship under a joint tenancy is that, on the death of one joint tenant, his interest in the land passes to the other joint tenant or tenants (Megarry and Wade, The Law of Real Property, 2nd ed., p. 390). But, on the execution and delivery of the transfer by Mrs. Stonehouse, she divested herself of her entire interest in the land in question. At the time of her death, therefore, there was no interest in the land remaining in her which could pass to her husband by right of survivorship.\nThe \"omission or mistake\" within the meaning of s. 223 attributed to the Registrar by the learned trial judge was that he \"omitted to make inquiry as to whether the deed was delivered in the lifetime of the grantor and as to whether she was dead or alive\". The learned trial judge's finding that there was no delivery of the deed during the lifetime of the grantor was properly set aside by the Court of Appeal and was not relied on by the appellant's counsel in this Court, and in my opinion, having regard to the state of the register and to the fact that the unregistered deed was operative to sever the joint tenancy at common law the Registrar was under no obligation to inquire as to whether Mrs. Stonehouse was dead or alive at the time of the application for the registration of Mrs. Munk's deed. As there is no suggestion of any other omission, mistake or misfeasance on the part of the Registrar, the appellant's claim must fail.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Jestley, Morrison, Eckardt, Ainsworth & Henson, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Lawrence, Shaw, McFarlane & Stewart, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960-61), 33 W.W.R. 625, 26 D.L.R.

Respondent.\n1961: November 17; 1961: December 15.\nPresent: Kerwin CJ. and Taschereau, Locke, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income\u2014Taxpayer in business of renting apartments\u2014Replacement of refrigerators, stoves and blinds in apartments\u2014Whether expenditure a deductible expense or capital outlay\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, s. 12(1)(a) and (b).\nThe taxpayer, a real estate holding company, owned and operated a high-class apartment building containing 210 suites. As part of a program for the gradual replacement of worn-out and defective equipment, the taxpayer spent some $11,000 in 1955 for the replacement of refrigerators, stoves and Venetian blinds. This expenditure was claimed as a deduction from income under s. 12(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act. The Minister contended that it was made for the replacement of capital within the meaning of s. 12(1)(b) of the Act. It was conceded that the expenditure was incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income. The question was whether it was an income expense incurred to earn the income and allowable as a deduction from gross income, or a capital outlay to be amortized or written off over a period of years under the capital cost allowance regulations made under s. 11(1)(b). Both the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court allowed the deduction. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The taxpayer was not entitled to the deduction.\nAmong the tests which may be used in order to determine whether an expenditure is an income expense or a capital outlay, it has been held that an expenditure made once and for all with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade is of a capital nature. Expenditures to replace assets which have become worn out or obsolete are something quite different from those ordinary annual expenditures for repairs which fall naturally into the category of income disbursements. Applying that test, the expenditures in question were clearly capital outlays within the provisions of s. 12(1)(b) of the Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Founder J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal allowed.\nP. Ollivier, for the appellant.\nP. F. Vineberg, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Abbott J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Minister of National Revenue from a judgment of the Exchequer Court2 confirming a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board which had allowed respondent's appeal against its income tax assessment for 1955.\nThe facts are not in dispute. The respondent owns and operates a large apartment house property in Montreal which it acquired in 1948. The buildings had been constructed in 1924. Each year during the period 1950 to 1955, respondent incurred expenses for the replacement of stoves, refrigerators and window blinds which had become worn out, obsolete or unsatisfactory to its tenants.\nExpenditures under this head in the year 1955 amounted to $11,675.95. In its Income Tax Return for 1955, respondent treated this amount as an operating expense and as such deductible from its gross income for that year. That deduction was disallowed by the Minister on the ground that it was a capital outlay within the meaning of s. 12(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1948.\nSection 12(1)(a) and (b) reads:\n12. (1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(a) an outlay or expense except to the extent that it was made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of the taxpayer.\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part.\nIt is conceded by appellant that the expenditures in question were incurred by respondent for the purpose of gaining or producing income. The sole matter in issue here is whether such expenditures were an income expense incurred to earn the income of the year 1955 and allowable as a deduction from gross income in that year under s. 12 (1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, or a capital outlay to be amortized or written off over a period of years under the capital cost allowance regulations made under s. 11(1)(b) of the said Act.\nThe general principles to be applied in determining whether a given expenditure is of a capital nature are fairly well established: Montreal Light Heat and Power Consolidated v. Minister of National Revenue3; British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited v. Minister of National Revenue4. Among the tests which may be used in order to determine whether an expenditure is an income expense or a capital outlay, it has been held that an expenditure made once and for all with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade is of a capital nature.\nExpenditures to replace capital assets which have become worn out or obsolete are something quite different from those ordinary annual expenditures for repairs which fall naturally into the category of income disbursements. Applying the test to which I have referred to the facts of the present case, the expenditures totalling $11,675.95, made by respondent in the year 1955 for replacing refrigerators, stoves and blinds in its apartment building were, in my opinion, clearly capital outlays within the provisions of s. 12(1)(b) of the Act.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgments of the Exchequer Court and the Income Tax Appeal Board set aside and the assessment restored. It was agreed at the hearing that in this event there would be no costs to the appellant in this Court. The appellant is entitled to his costs in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. A.

Contrary to regulations, the defendant failed to stop before crossing a highway and a collision occurred, as a result of which the plaintiff suffered personal injuries. The trial judge held that the defendant had been, negligent; it was also held that he had not been guilty of wilful and wanton misconduct. The question at issue in the appeal was whether, in view of the provisions of s. 157 of The Vehicles Act, 1957 (Sask.), c. 93, the defendant could be held liable to the plaintiff in the absence of wilful and wanton misconduct on his part. The trial judge and the majority of the Court of; Appeal having held that he could, the defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe restriction on liability in relation to passengers created by subs. (2) of s. 157 of The Vehicles Act, 1957, and also by subs. (2) of s. 41a of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act applied in respect of \"any person being carried in \u2026 such motor vehicle\". In the light of those words, neither subsection could be construed as preserving to an owner-passenger the same rights as against the driver of a vehicle, in case of the latter's negligence, which would have existed at common law. Here the defendant could only incur liability for the personal injuries to the plaintiff if he had been found guilty of wilful and wanton misconduct in the driving of the automobile.\nThis was not a proper case in which to hold that the Legislature, in reenacting the predecessor of s. 157, had in mind the principle which had been laid down in Koos v. McVey, [1937] O.R. 369, to the effect that the words \"any person being carried\" etc. in s. 41a (2) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act meant any person other than the owner or driver of the motor vehicle. The Koos case must be regarded as overruled. Studer v. Cowper, [1951] S.C.R. 450; Canadian Acceptance Corporation Ltd. v. Fisher, [1958] S.C.R. 546, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, affirming a judgment of Hall, C.J.Q.B. Appeal allowed. A. W. Embury, for the defendant, appellant.\nD. G. McLeod, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This action arose as a result of an automobile collision which occurred about 4 p.m. on July 19, 1959. The appellant was the driver of an automobile, owned by the respondent, in which the latter was, at the time, riding as a passenger. The appellant was proceeding in an easterly direction on a road known as the Golf Club Road, which intersects with Saskatchewan Highway No.1, which runs in a northeast to southwest direction. Vehicles travelling along the Golf Club Road are required to stop before crossing Highway No. 1. A collision occurred with a vehicle, travelling in a southeasterly direction, along Highway No. 1, and the respondent suffered injuries.\nThe learned trial judge found that the appellant had not stopped before crossing Highway No. 1 and held that he had been negligent. It was also held that the appellant had not been guilty of wilful and wanton misconduct.\nThere is no issue raised in this appeal regarding the finding of negligence. With respect to the second finding, McNiven J.A., who delivered the majority judgment of himself and Culliton J.A., said:\nIn the record there is evidence to support the conclusion reached by the learned trial judge and nothing to indicate that he had either misdirected himself or taken any irrelevant matter into consideration.\nProcter J.A., who delivered a dissenting judgment, agreed with the finding of the learned trial judge with respect to this point.\nAfter considering the evidence in the case, I would not be prepared to disturb this finding.\nThe main issue in the appeal is one of law, the question being whether, in view of the provisions of s. 157 of The Vehicles Act, 1957 (Sask.), c. 93, the appellant can be held liable to the respondent, in the absence of wilful and wanton misconduct on his part. The learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal2 have held that he could. Section 157 provides as follows:\n157. (1) Subject to subsection (2), when any loss, damage or injury is caused to any person by a motor vehicle, the person driving it at the time is liable for the loss, damage or injury, if it was caused by his negligence or improper conduct, and the owner thereof is also liable to the same extent as the driver unless at the time of the incident causing the loss, damage or injury the motor vehicle had been stolen from the owner or otherwise wrongfully taken out of his possession or out of the possession of any person entrusted by him with the care thereof.\n(2) The owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle ordinarily used for carrying passengers for hire or gain, is not liable for loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or the death of any person being carried in or upon or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from such motor vehicle, unless there has been wilful and wanton misconduct on the part of the driver of the vehicle and unless such wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury.\nIn holding that the appellant was not entitled to the protection afforded by subs. (2) of this section, the Courts below have followed the reasoning of Macdonnell J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Koos v. McVey3. The relevant sections of the Ontario statute there under consideration were subss. (1) and (2) of s. 41a of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 251, as amended by 1930 (Ont.), c. 48 and 1935 (Ont.), c. 26: The section, as amended, read as follows:\n(1) The owner of a motor vehicle shall be liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason Of negligence in the operation of such motor vehicle on a highway unless such motor vehicle was without the owner's consent in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, and the driver of a motor vehicle not being, the owner shall be liable to the same extent as such owner.\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for compensation, shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to, or the death of any person being carried in or upon, or entering, or getting on to, or alighting from such motor vehicle.\nIt was decided in that case that the words \"any person being carried\" etc. meant any person other than the owner or driver of the motor vehicle. Macdonnell J.A., at p. 372, said:\nThe subject matter of secs. 41 and 41a is the liability of owners or drivers for violations of the Act and for loss-resulting from negligence. But liability to whom? Liability as between themselves, or liability towards others? The answer seems clear from an examination of the sections. First, certain liabilities are imposed upon an owner; then the driver is made liable to the same extent; on the other hand, in certain circumstances, both owner and driver are declared not to be liable. So far as is possible, owner and driver are fixed with identical responsibility. This would not be so if the intention were to deal with their rights and liabilities as between each other. The conclusion is irresistible that what is dealt with is the rights and liabilities of owner and driver, regarded as one, towards other persons. In short, the words \"any person being carried in, or upon\" etc., mean any person other than the owner or driver.\nThe provisions of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, which were under consideration in that case, are not identical with those of The Vehicles Act, 1957, under consideration here. In particular, subs. (2) of s. 41a of the Ontario Act eliminated the liability of the owner or driver of a motor vehicle (other than one engaged in the business of carrying passengers for compensation) to passengers in the vehicle. Section 157(2) of the Saskatchewan Act restricted the liability to that class of persons to cases in which the driver of the motor vehicle had been guilty of wilful and wanton misconduct. However, the reasoning in Koos v. McVey, if sound, would, I think, apply to the Saskatchewan statute as well as to the Ontario Act, but, with respect, I do not agree with it.\nThe purpose of s. 41a(1) of the Ontario Act and s. 157(1) of the Saskatchewan Act (each of which was enacted earlier in point of time than the provisions which later became subs. (2) of each of those sections) was to extend the vicarious liability of the owner of a motor vehicle beyond what it had been at common law. In each case the owner was to be responsible for the negligence of any driver of his motor vehicle, unless such driver was wrongfully in possession of it.\nAfter the vicarious liability of the owner had been expanded by subs. (1), subs. (2) of s. 41a of the Ontario Act was enacted to eliminate any liability which had previously existed toward passengers being carried in a motor vehicle, either on the part of the owner or the driver, save in those cases in which the vehicle was engaged in carrying passengers for hire. Similarly, subs. (2) of s. 157 of the Saskatchewan Act was later enacted to restrict the liability which might arise with respect to a passenger to cases in which the driver had been guilty of wilful and wanton misconduct. I do not understand the purpose of either s. 41a of the Ontario Act or s. 157 of the Saskatchewan Act as being to create an identity of responsibility between the owner and the driver, which would be applicable to all other persons, and not to deal with their responsibility as between themselves. The restriction on liability in relation to passengers created by subs. (2) of each of these sections is applicable in respect of \"any person being carried in \u2026 such motor vehicle\". In the light of those words, I cannot construe either subsection as preserving to an owner-passenger the same rights as against the driver of the vehicle, in case of the latter's negligence, which would have existed at common law.\nIt was contended by the respondent that, as the predecessor of s. 157 of the Saskatchewan Vehicles Act had been re-enacted from time to time subsequent to the judgment in Koos v. McVey, the Saskatchewan Legislature should be understood thereby to be adopting the legal interpretation which had been placed on the similar section of the Ontario Act by the Court of Appeal of that Province in that case. The respondent acknowledged that the common law presumption to that effect was removed by subs. (4) of s. 24 of The Interpretation Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 1, which reads as follows:\n(4) The Legislature shall not, by re-enacting an Act or enactment, or by revising, consolidating or amending the same, be deemed to have adopted the construction which has by judicial decision or otherwise been placed upon the language used in such Act or enactment or upon similar language.\nIt may be observed that The Interpretation Act of Ontario has for many years contained a similar provision, which is now s. 19 of c. 191 of the R.S.O. 1960.\nThe respondent relied, however, on the statement as to the effect of this provision made in this Court by Kerwin J., as he then was, in Studer v. Cowper4, approved by the judgment of this Court in Canadian Acceptance Corporation Limited v. Fisher5. That statement is as follows:\nIn view of these decisions, it must now be taken that subsection 4 of s. 24 of the Saskatchewan Interpretation Act, 1943, c. 2, which is the same as the ones referred to in the two cases mentioned, merely removes the presumption that existed at common law and, in a proper case, it will be held that a legislature did have in mind the construction that had been placed upon a certain enactment when re-enacting it.\nIn my opinion, this is not a proper case in which to hold that the Legislature, in re-enacting the predecessor of s. 157, had in mind the principle which had been laid down in Koos v. McVey.\nWith the greatest respect for the learned Justices of Appeal who took part in that decision, I am of opinion that it must be regarded as overruled.\nIn my opinion, the appellant could only incur liability for the personal injuries to the respondent, in the circumstances of the present case, if he had been found to have been guilty of wilful and wanton misconduct in the driving of the vehicle.\nThere is included in the respondent's claim the sum of $200 in respect of damage to his automobile, which amount was admitted by the appellant. It is clear that s. 157 does not protect the appellant in respect of this kind of claim and that his negligence makes him liable for it.\nIn my view, the appeal should be allowed and the action of the respondent should be dismissed, save as to the sum of $200. The appellant should be entitled to the costs of this appeal and his costs in the Courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Noonan, Embury, Heald & Molisky, Regina.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Pedersen, Norman, McLeod & Pearce, Regina.\n1 (1961), 35 W.W.R. 97, 29 D.L.R.

Best Motor Accessories Company Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1961: October 30, 31; 1961: December 15.\nPRESENT: Kerwin CJ. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEWFOUNDLAND (on appeal).\nNegligence\u2014Plaintiff's premises destroyed by fire\u2014Standard procedure and employer's instructions not followed by operator of gasoline delivery truck\u2014Vapour from spilled gasoline ignited by heating-stove\u2014No contributory negligence on part of plaintiff\u2014Co-defendant's negligence subsequent to and severable from act or omission of plaintiff\u2014The Contribtuory Negligence Act, R.S.V. 1952, c. 159.\nCourts\u2014Authority of Superior Court to determine own jurisdiction and hear appeal\u2014The Judicature Act, R.S.V. 1952, c. 114.\nThe defendant company, a supplier of gasoline, through its servant and agent O, the co-defendant, delivered gasoline to the premises of the plaintiff by means of a hose from the company's delivery truck inserted in the fill pipe of the plaintiff's storage tank. Contrary to standard procedure arid his employer's instructions, O failed to remain at the nozzle of the hose while the gasoline was being discharged from the truck and as a consequence a quantity of gasoline was sprayed on the floor of the plaintiff's shop. Vapour from the gasoline was immediately ignited due to the close proximity of a heating-stove which was in operation at the time, and in the resulting fire the premises and a large quantity of stock-in-trade and equipment were destroyed or greatly damaged. In an action for damages it was ordered that the plaintiff recover against the defendants 20 per cent of its damages to be assessed and 20 per cent of its costs and that the defendants recover from the plaintiff 80 per cent of their costs. The trial judgment was affirmed by the, Supreme Court (On Appeal). In that Court the Chief Justice disqualified himself as, before his appointment to the Bench, he had been engaged professionally in another matter which concerned the same circumstances as the present case. One of the two remaining judges adhered to the views he had already expressed in his capacity as the trial judge, while the other would have dismissed the plaintiff's claim, allowed the defendants' appeal and dismissed the action. The defendants appealed and the plaintiff cross-appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nThe Supreme Court of Newfoundland (On Appeal) had authority to determine its own jurisdiction and hear the appeal. Walker v. R., [1939] S.C.R. 214; Re Padstow (1882), 20 Ch. D. 137, referred to. O had been negligent; his actions were fool-hardy and were the direct cause of the occurrence. It was not negligent, on the part of the plaintiff, to maintain the premises in the condition in which they were at the time of the fire. Even if the premises were in a dangerous condition, the defendants knew and must be taken to have accepted the situation. To constitute contributory negligence it does not suffice that there be some fault on the part of a plaintiff without which the damage would not have been suffered; the negligence charged must be proximate in the sense of an effective cause of the damages. McLaughlin v. Long, [1927] S.C.R. 303; Bechthold and Others v. Osbaldeston and Others, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 177, followed; Ellerman Lines, Ltd. v. H. & G. Grayson, Ltd., [1920] A.C. 466, referred to.\nThe negligence of O was clearly subsequent to and severable from the act or omission of the plaintiff even if such act or omission could be considered a fault, and therefore, under the provisions of s. 6 of the Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.N. 1952, c. 159, the question as to whether, notwithstanding the fault of one party, the other could have avoided the consequences thereof could not be taken into consideration.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (On Appeal) of Newfoundland[1], affirming a judgment of Sir Brian Dunfield J. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.\nW. G. Burke Robertson, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nJ. H. Amys, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by Great Eastern Oil and Import Company Limited and Angus Oakley, the defendants in an action in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, and a cross-appeal by the plaintiff, Frederick E. Best Motor Accessories Company Limited, against the judgment of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland (on Appeal), affirming the judgment at the trial whereby it was ordered that the plaintiff recover against the defendants twenty per cent of its damages to be assessed and twenty per cent of its costs and that the defendants recover from the plaintiff eighty per cent of their costs.\nNo point as to the jurisdiction of this Court was raised by either party but, because of a question put from the Bench, it should be noted that by s. 6 of The Judicature Act, R.S.N. 1952, c. 114, the Supreme Court of Newfoundland is composed of a Chief Justice and two other Judges. By s. 3 of c. 33 of the Statutes of 1957, this s. 6 was repealed and it was enacted that the Supreme Court should consist of a Chief Justice and three other Judges. However, it was provided by s. 13 that s. 3 was to come into force on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and no such proclamation has been issued. So far as relevant s. 9 of The Judicature Act, R.S.N. 1952, c. 114, provides that the Supreme Court may be held by one judge who may hear and determine all causes and matters except (inter alia) appeals. Sections 27 and 30 read as follows:\n27. Every judgment finding or order of a Judge in Court or chambers may be reviewed, varied or set aside by the Court constituted by any two or by the three Judges, subject, in cases in which two only sitting shall differ in opinion, to re-hearing and determination before the three Judges.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n30. Where two Judges sit together in the first place and join in any judgment or order, the decision shall be final and absolute, unless by their leave; but if they differ in opinion application may be made to the three Judges to review, vary or set aside such judgment or order.\nIn this action the trial judge was Sir Brian Dunfield. The appeal was heard by the Chief Justice, Winter J. and the trial judge. When reasons were delivered the Chief Justice filed a statement disqualifying himself as, before his appointment to the Bench, he had been consulted professionally in connection with other proceedings by a third party against the parties to this litigation arising out of the events complained of in this action. The trial judge adhered to the views he had already expressed while Winter J. would have dismissed the plaintiff's claim, allowed the defendants' appeal and dismissed the action. The former order affirmed the judgment at the trial and dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal.\nThe Supreme Court of Newfoundland (on Appeal) is a Superior Court. In Walker v. The King[2], Chief Justice Sir Lyman Duff stated at 216:\nIt is clear that, the learned trial judge having intended to pronounce, and having considered he was pronouncing a valid judgment of acquittal, what he did cannot be treated as a nullity. Presiding in a court of general jurisdiction, having authority to pronounce on its own jurisdiction, and his judgment being one which under appropriate conditions could competently be given, it was in its nature susceptible of being the subject of appeal (re Padstow (1882) 20 Ch. Div. 137); and the Court of Appeal rightly dealt with it upon the footing that it constituted a judgment or verdict of acquittal.\nIn the Padstow case the following appears in the judgment of Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, at p. 142:\nThe first point to be considered is whether, assuming that the association was an unlawful one, and that the Court had no jurisdiction to make the order, an appeal is the proper mode of getting rid of that order. I think that it is. I think that an order made by a Court of competent jurisdiction which has authority to decide as to its own competency must be taken to be a decision by the Court that it has jurisdiction to make the order, and consequently you may appeal from it on the ground that such decision is erroneous.\nLord Justice Brett at p. 145 put it thus:\nIn this case an order has been made to wind up an association or company as such. That order was the order of a superior Court, which superior Court has jurisdiction in a certain given state of facts to make a winding-up order, and if there has been a mistake made it is a mistake as to the facts of the particular case and not the assumption of a jurisdiction which the Court had not. I am inclined, therefore, to say that this order could never so long as it existed be treated either by the Court that made it or by any other Court as a nullity, and that the only way of getting rid of it was by appeal.\nLord Justice Lindley commenced his judgment by stating: \"I am of the same opinion\". In the present case the Supreme Court of Newfoundland (on Appeal) had authority to determine its own jurisdiction and hear the appeal.\nOn March 4, 1959, the defendant company, a supplier of gasoline, was, through its servant and agent, the co-defendant Oakley, delivering gasoline to the premises of the plaintiff by means of a hose from the company's delivery truck inserted in the fill pipe of the plaintiff's storage tank. A fire occurred as a result of which the plaintiff's premises, and a large quantity of its stock-in-trade and equipment, were destroyed or greatly damaged, for which the plaintiff asked damages in the following amounts:\nDamage to buildings $ 29,420.38\nEquipment damaged or destroyed 4,304.90\nStock-in-trade damaged or destroyed 41,987.57\nThe plaintiff claimed that the fire and resulting damage occurred by reason of the negligence of Oakley in failing to follow the standard procedure and his employer's instructions to stay close to the delivery nozzle while the gasoline was being discharged from the truck. The defendants denied negligence and alleged that if there had been any such negligence it was not the cause of the damage complained of but that the damage was caused by the negligence of the plaintiff, its servants or agents, in that it had a knowledge that gasoline did, from time to time, spill over the floor of the premises when being pumped into the gasoline storage tank; but, notwithstanding such knowledge, the plaintiff allowed a fire to be maintained at all material times in a stove in close proximity to the fill pipe of its gasoline storage tank through which gasoline deliveries were made and that that fire was the direct cause of the damage complained of in that it ignited vapour from gasoline which had escaped from the fill pipe and had been allowed to flow over the floor of the said premises because of the defective manner in which the fill pipe was installed and maintained in the said building.\nThe evidence shows that the defendant company had been supplying gasoline to the plaintiff for a great number of years during many of which the premises were in the same condition as on the day of the fire and both defendants knew of this condition. The trial judge found that Oakley had been negligent and with that I agree. Oakley's actions were foolhardy and were the direct cause of the occurrence. Contrary to what was shown to be the usual practice and contrary to the instructions from his employer, he failed to remain at the nozzle and as a result a quantity of gasoline was sprayed on the floor of the premises which immediately caught fire from a a stove which had been installed and which was being used to heat them. In answer to a question by counsel for the defendants, at p. 179 of the Case, Oakley admitted that ordinarily he would hold the nozzle in the fill pipe himself, and at p. 184, in answer to another question by counsel for the defendants, he admitted that, if he had remained at his proper place when he was filling the plaintiff's tank, he could have reached in to turn off the nozzle, although he said \"it was a cumbersome spot\" and that on one occasion he had strained his wrist in so doing. On the same page he admitted that his instructions were to stay by the nozzle or in a position where he could turn off the nozzle. He further stated that he had asked Delaney, an employee of the plaintiff, to keep an eye on the nozzle and that he had seen Delaney hold it, but, at p. 208, Delaney denied both statements and gave a circumstantial account of his movements at the relevant time. While noting this discrepancy the trial judge made no finding, but consideration of the evidence satisfies me that Delaney was telling the truth.\nThe trial judge considered that it was negligent for the plaintiff to maintain the premises in the condition in which they were at the time of the fire but with respect I am unable to agree. There is no doubt that several years prior to the occurrence with which we are concerned gasoline had been spilled but the plaintiff thereupon altered his premises. While the building had been built out over the underground storage tank and while the intake pipe was in the wall of the building, the area of the pipe inside the building was enclosed by an asbestos lined box to propel gasoline vapours outside the building through the opened outside door of the box.\nEven if the premises were in: a dangerous condition, the defendants knew and must be taken to have accepted the situation. Oakley by his negligence permitted the hose and nozzle to remain unattended and as a result of the movement of the nozzle gasoline was sprayed on the floor of the premises causing the damage. It was held by this Court in McLaughlin v. Long[3], in considering the Contributory Negligence Act of New Brunswick, that to constitute contributory negligence it does not suffice that there be some fault on the part of a plaintiff without which the damage would not have been suffered and that the negligence charged must be proximate in the sense of an effective cause of the damages. From time to time there have been discussions in the Courts and otherwise as to proximate cause, causa causans and the last clear chance. In Ellerman Lines, Limited v. H.&G. Grayson, Limited[4], affirmed by the House of Lords[5], the headnote in the latter report sets forth the circumstances and the decision of the House:\nA firm of ship repairers were riveting cleats to the weather deck of a steamer which under the authority of the Admiralty, they were fitting with apparatus for protection against mines. The rivets were heated in a furnace on the weather deck, and lowered in a bucket through an open hatchway to the \u2018tween decks, where a riveter drove them into holes bored into the under side of the weather deck to receive them. The steamer was discharging from a hold below the \u2018tween decks, and a \u2018tween deck hatch-way was open directly below the open hatchway on the weather deck, so that a cargo of jute in the lower hold lay exposed. A boy carrying a red-hot rivet in a pair of tongs to the bucket close by the weather deck hatchway slipped on the deck, and the rivet shot over the coamings and through both the open hatchways on to the cargo of jute and set it on fire.\nIn an action by the owners of the steamer against the ship repairers for damage to the ship and cargo:\nHeld, that the damage was caused by the negligence of the ship repairers in doing the work as they did while the jute was exposed, and that the shipowners were not guilty of any negligence.\nAt p. 475 Lord Birkenhead put it that he should have been content to state his own conclusion in the language used by Atkin L.J. and he assented particularly to the illustra-tion which Atkin L.J. gave in the latter part of his judgment in which he pointed out that the appellants, under circumstances in which they received remuneration, brought upon the respondent's ship that which was in fact dangerous. In the Court of Appeal Lord Justice Atkin had stated at pp. 535 and 536:\nIf a workman is sent to my house containing inflammable material to work with fire, am I to remove the source of danger, or is he to take precautions which will avoid danger? If a man comes to my premises containing an oil tank is he to abstain from smoking in its vicinity or am I to remove the oil tank? And if he chooses to smoke there am I precluded from recovering because I did not remove the oil tank but allowed him to continue at his peril? The doctrine of contributory negligence cannot, I think, be based upon a breach of duty to the negligent defendant. It is difficult to suppose that a person owes a duty to anyone to preserve his own property.\nThe law applicable in this case is that set forth in the judgment of this Court in Bechthold and Others v. Osbaldeston and Others[6] at p. 178:\nThe position in this appeal on the question of liability is that put by Lord Shaw in Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. v. Pacific Steam Navigation Co. [1924] A.C. 406 at 419:\nAnd I take the principle to be that, although there might be\u2014which for the purpose of this point I am reckoning there was\u2014fault in being in a position which makes an accident possible yet, if the position is recognized by the other prior to operations which result in an accident occurring, the author of that accident is the party who, recognizing the position of the other, fails negligently to avoid an accident which with reasonable conduct on his part, could have been avoided. Unless that principle be applied it would be always open to a person negligently and recklessly approaching, and failing to avoid a known danger, to plead that the reckless encounter of danger was contributed to by the fact that there was a danger to be encountered. In addition to providing for cases where two parties are negligent, The Newfoundland Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.N. 1952, c. 159, provides:\n6. Where the trial is before a judge without a jury the judge shall not take into consideration any question as to whether, notwithstanding the fault of one party, the other could have avoided the consequences thereof unless he is satisfied by the evidence that the act or omission of the latter was clearly subsequent to and severable from the act or omission of the former so as not to be substantially contemporaneous therewith.\nHere I am satisfied that the negligence of Oakley was clearly subsequent to and severable from the act or omission of the plaintiff even if such act or omission could be considered a fault.\nI would dismiss the appeal, allow the cross-appeal, set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland (on Appeal) and the judgment at the trial and direct that judgment be entered in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants for the full amount of its damages to be assessed. The plaintiff is entitled to its costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Curtis, Dawe & Fagan, St. John's.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: P.

The respondent company purchased a quantity of steel pipe from an English manufacturer for delivery in Vancouver. Each shipload was paid for by the respondent and the bill of lading relating thereto was delivered to the respondent, or its agents, while such shipment was at sea en route to Vancouver. Terminal or harbour charges were paid by the respondent, in the course of taking delivery of each shipment. The Commissioner, Social Services Tax, assessed a tax of 5 per centum on these charges on the basis that the money paid therefor was part of the delivered price of the steel. The respondent appealed the assessments and, when subsequently the assessments were affirmed by the Minister of Finance, the respondent appealed to a Judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The appeal was successful and the assessments were set aside. This decision was affirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeal. The Crown then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe words \"the same tax\" in subs. (3) of s. 3 of the Social Services Tax Act, R.S.B.C 1948, c. 333, as amended, do not mean \"the same amount of tax\" as would have had to be paid in respect of a notional retail purchase of the steel pipe in British Columbia. They mean that, in the circumstances outlined in subs. (3), the tax which applies on retail purchases in the Province also applies on the consumption or use of property brought into the Province. That tax is a tax of 5 per centum of its purchase price. The goods, which in view of the nature of the contract for the purchase of the steel pipe became the property of the respondent while they were on the high seas, became subject to tax as soon as they entered the Province.\nThe terminal charges were not a part of the purchase price, either within the general meaning of that term or within the definition contained in the Act. They were charges paid, not by the vendor, but by the purchaser, after property in the goods had passed to it, after the goods had been brought into the Province and after the tax attached and became payable.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Ruttan J. Appeal dismissed.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ. G. Alley, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This case has been argued on an agreed set of facts, which are as follows:\nThe respondent purchased 96,000 tons of three-inch steel pipe from South Durham Steel & Iron Co. Ltd., Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, England, for delivery to the respondent in Vancouver. The agreement to purchase is contained in a letter from the respondent to the vendor dated October 12, 1955, as amended by a letter from the respondent to the vendor dated May 21, 1956. By endorsement dated May 24, 1956, the purchase terms were accepted by the vendor.\nThe contract price of the said steel pipe is described in the said letter of May 21, 1956, as:\nThe contract price delivered C.I.F. Vancouver, B.C., but not including any dues, Import Duty, Sales Tax, Landing or other charges, but including ocean insurance as outlined herein, is $160.14 U.S. dollars per ton of 2,000 Ibs., for 90,000 tons.\nThe contract price delivered C.I.F. Vancouver, B.C., but not including any dues, Import Duty, Sales Tax, Landing or other charges, but including ocean insurance as outlined herein, is $161.75 U.S. dollars per ton of 2,000 Ibs., for 6,000 tons.\nEach shipload of pipe was paid for by the respondent and the bill of lading relating thereto was delivered to the respondent, or its agents, while such shipment was at sea en route to Vancouver.\nBetween March 4, 1956, and December 31, 1956, 27 separate shipments of steel pipe (hereinafter referred to as \"Group A\") were delivered by the vendor to the purchaser, by deep sea ships, at Vancouver, B.C. Nineteen additional shipments of steel pipe (hereinafter referred to as \"Group B\") were delivered, by deep sea ships, by the seller to the buyer in Vancouver, between January 4, 1957, and July 25, 1957. The said shipments were delivered at the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's dock, or at the National Harbours Board dock, in Vancouver.\nIn respect to each of the shipments of Groups A and B, the following procedure was carried out by the dock owner:\n(1) The dock owner, upon receipt of the ship's manifest, prepared an expense bill. This bill was then sent to the respondent and contained a statement of all harbour or terminal charges.\n(2) Prior to the delivery of the first shipment, the respondent had posted security with the dock owner and was, therefore, entitled to and did have a credit account.\n(3) The dock owner charged or debited the respondent, in its weekly ledger account, for the terminal or harbour charges.\n(4) The dock owner sent an advice note to the respondent, advising of the arrival of each shipment. (5) The respondent presented the bill of lading (after payment) to the dock owner and took delivery of the steel shipment. The steel was unloaded from the ship to railway cars at the dockside.\n\"Terminal or harbour charges\" is the expression used by dock owners in reference to an overseas delivery in the Port of Vancouver and consists of:\n(a) Cargo Rates\u20149 cents per ton payable to National Harbours Board for harbour maintenance.\n(b) Wharfage \u201460 cents per ton payable to dock owner for use of the dock.\n(c) Handling \u2014 $1.80 per ton payable for stevedoring wages for unloading of the ship.\nIn respect to the shipments in Group A, terminal charges were debited by the dock owner to the respondent's account and were paid by the respondent and amounted, in all, to $84,090.34.\nIn respect to the shipments in Group B, terminal charges were debited by the dock owner to the respondent's account and were paid by the respondent and amounted to $57,492.49.\nThe Commissioner, Social Services Tax, assessed a tax of five per centum on the terminal charges of $84,090.34 for the Group A shipments, on the basis that this amount of money was part of the delivered price of the steel. The tax amounts to $4,204.52, to which there is added interest at six per centum from February 20, 1957. Similarly, a tax of $2,874.61 was assessed against the Group B shipments, plus interest at six per centum to May 20, 1958.\nThe respondent appealed the assessments and, when subsequently the assessments were affirmed by the Minister of Finance, the respondent then appealed, pursuant to s. 15 of the Social Services Tax Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 333, as amended, to a Judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nThe appeal was successful and the assessments were set aside. This decision was affirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeal[2]. The provision of the Social Services Tax Act, under which the tax was sought to be imposed, is contained in s. 3, the relevant subsections of which provide as follows:\n3. (1) Every purchaser shall pay to Her Majesty in right of the Province at the time of making the purchase a tax at the rate of five per centum of the purchase price of the property purchased.\n***\n(3) Every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in the Province who brings into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tangible personal property acquired by him for value for his own consumption or use, or for the consumption or use of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as the agent for, a principal who desires to acquire such property for the consumption or use by such principal or other persons at his expense, shall immediately report the matter in writing to the Commissioner and supply to him the invoice and all other pertinent information as required by him in respect of the consumption or use of such property, and furthermore, at the same time, shall pay to Her Majesty in right of the Province the same tax in respect of the consumption or use of such property as would have been payable if the property had been purchased at a retail sale in the Province.\nThe words \"purchaser\", \"retail sale\" and \"purchase price\" are defined in s. 2 of the Act as follows:\n\"purchaser\" means any person who acquires tangible personal property at a sale in the Province for his own consumption or use, or for the consumption or use by other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as the agent for, a principal who desires to acquire such property for consumption or use by such principle or other persons at his expense;\n\"retail sale\" means a sale to a purchaser for purposes of consumption or use and not for resale;\n\"sale price\" or \"purchase price\" means a price in money, and also the value of services rendered, the actual value of the thing exchanged, and other considerations accepted by the seller or person from whom the property passes as price or on account of the price of the thing covered by the contract, sale, or exchange, and includes the charges for installation of the thing sold, for interest, for finance, for service, for customs, for excise, and for transportation, whether or not such are shown separately on the invoice or in the vendors' books;\nThe appellant's contention is that the concluding words of subs. (3) of s. 3, i.e., \"the same tax in respect of the consumption or use of such property as would have been payable if the property had been purchased at a retail sale in the Province\", mean that the respondent is required to pay, not a tax of five per centum of the actual purchase price of the property purchased, but five per centum of what would have been the retail price of the property purchased, assuming that the steel pipe had been purchased at a retail sale in British Columbia. The argument is that the words \"the same tax\" do not mean the same kind of tax on purchase price as is payable under subs. (1) in respect of property purchased in British Columbia, but the same amount of tax as would have been paid had the property actually been purchased at a retail sale in British Columbia.\nI do not construe the words \"the same tax\" in subs. (3) as meaning \"the same amount of tax\" as would have had to be paid in respect of a notional retail purchase of the steel pipe in British Columbia. I construe them as meaning that, in the circumstances outlined in subs. (3), the tax which applies on retail purchases in the Province also applies on the consumption or use of property brought into the Province. That tax is a tax of five per centum of its purchase price. This is my interpretation of the concluding words of this subsection and it is reinforced by the portion of the subsection which precedes them.\nA person who brings into British Columbia, or receives delivery of property in that Province, is required immediately to report the matter to the Commissioner. He must also supply the Commissioner with the invoice and all pertinent information required by the Commissioner in respect of the consumption or use of the property. The invoice will give to the Commissioner the purchase price of the property. The pertinent information, which relates only to consumption and use, will enable him to decide whether or not the tax applies. The recipient is further required, at the same time, to pay the tax imposed by the subsection. This means, therefore, that if tax is payable it attaches immediately upon the property being brought into British Columbia, or on receipt of it in that Province.\nIn view of the nature of the contract for the purchase of the steel pipe in question, those goods became the property of the respondent while they were on the high seas. Accordingly, they became subject to tax as soon as they entered the Province.\nThe terminal charges paid by the respondent were not a part of the purchase price, either within the general meaning of that term or within the definition contained in the Act. Matters such as installation charges, interest, finance charges, customs, excise or transportation, referred to in that definition, all relate to expenditures made by the vendor, whether or not they are separately shown on the invoice or in the vendor's books. The terminal charges in question here were charges paid, not by the vendor, but by the purchaser, after property in the goods had passed to it, after the goods had been brought into the Province and after the tax attached and became payable.\nI do not find in subs. (3) or in s. 25, to which we were referred by counsel for the appellant, any obligation or authority upon or in the taxpayer or the Commissioner to estimate the retail price of the steel pipe on a notional sale of it in British Columbia. I think subs. (3), by requiring payment of the tax as soon as the goods entered British Columbia, contemplated that such tax would be determined on the purchase price as disclosed in the invoice, which the recipient was required to deliver to the Commissioner.\nIn my opinion, the assessments under appeal were not authorized by the statute and, accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Paine, Edmonds, Mercer & Williams, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davis, Hossie, Campbell, Brazier & McLorg, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961), 35 W.W.R. 70, 28 D.L.R.

The Court of Appeal for British Columbia in 1933 dismissed an appeal from a judgment which had upheld the validity of a codicil of a testator's will. The codicil disinherited the testator's son H unless he complied with certain conditions, which he did not so do. In an action by H, his first wife and their two infant daughters, a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, on June 26, 1945, held that the relevant portion of the codicil was invalid, void and of no effect, and that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 1933 and the judgment which it affirmed should be set aside. Following the death of H in 1958, the plaintiff trust company, as sole surviving executor of the testator, commenced proceedings by originating summons for the determination of certain questions. The judge who gave judgment in those proceedings proceeded on the assumption that the judgment of June 26, 1945, was operative. The children of H by his first wife appealed to the Court of Appeal, asking that the judgment appealed from be varied. They sought a declaration that they alone (to the exclusion of H's second wife and his child by that wife) were entitled to share in that part of the testator's estate bequeathed to the widow and the children of H after his death. The Court of Appeal held that in pronouncing the judgment of June 26, 1945, the judge had acted without jurisdiction, that his judgment was a nullity and that the acts done by the trustees in pursuance thereof were without validity. The judgment appealed from and the originating summons upon which it was based were set aside, and a trial was directed to determine what ought to have been done by the trustees of the testator's will if the judgment of June 26, 1945, had never been pronounced. Pursuant to leave granted by this Court appeals were brought from this judgment (i) by the surviving executor and trustee of the testator and (ii) by H's second wife and his child by that wife.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe judgment below was founded upon the erroneous view that because the judgment which had upheld the validity of the codicil had been affirmed by the Court of Appeal, a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was without jurisdiction to entertain an action to set it aside. That this is not the law was shewn by the authorities. Falcke v. The Scottish Imperial Insurance Co. (1887), 57 L.T. 39; Flower v. Lloyd (1887), 6 Ch. D. 297; Jonesco v. Beard [1930] A.C. 298; Boswell v. Coaks (1894), 6 R. 167, referred to.\nIt has long been settled in England that the proper method of impeaching a judgment of the High Court on the ground of fraud or of seeking to set it aside on the ground of subsequently discovered evidence is by action, whether or not the judgment which is attacked has been affirmed or otherwise dealt with by the Court of Appeal or other appellate tribunal. The law and practice on this point in British Columbia and in England are the same.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside a judgment of Maclean J. and containing other provisions.

Haldane, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014These appeals are from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] setting aside a judgment of Maclean J. and containing other provisions. In order to make clear the questions which arise it is necessary to set out the relevant facts in some detail.\nThe late Stephen Jones Sr., hereinafter referred to as \"the testator\", died on October 2, 1933. His domicile was in British Columbia. He left a will dated December 18, 1928, a first codicil dated December 18, 1928, and a second codicil dated June 5, 1933. He was survived by his widow, Eliza Margaret Jones, and by five children whose names and dates of birth are: Stephen Jones, Junior, December 11, 1910; Howard Jones, May 1, 1912; Frances Elizabeth Buckle, November 1, 1913; Mildred Victoria Gillespie, December 22, 1916; and Margaret Thompson Briggs (formerly Miller), April 23, 1918. The widow and all of the children except Howard Jones are still living. Howard Jones died on March 18, 1958.\nThe following grandchildren of the testator are now living: Stephen Randal Jones, son of Stephen Jones Junior; Elsie Margaret Langmaid and Carol Anne Jones, children of Howard Jones by his first marriage; Howard Stephen Jones, son of Howard Jones by his second marriage; Frances Gail Buckle and Harry Buckle III, children of Frances Elizabeth Buckle; and Marlene Anne Miller, daughter of Margaret Thompson Briggs.\nThe terms of the testator's will with which we are concerned gave an annuity to his widow for her life, made certain provisions for the maintenance and support of his children, directed $100,000 to be paid to each son on his attaining 35 years of age, directed that on each of his daughters attaining 35 years of age the sum of $100,000 should be set aside for her, the daughter to receive the income during her lifetime with a power of appointment as to the corpus.\nParagraph 12 of the will read:\n(12) When my youngest child shall have attained the full age of thirty-five (35) years and each child or the issue of any child having died before that age has received in the case of sons the said capital sum of One hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars and in the case of daughters the said capital sum of One hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars for each one having been ear-marked and set aside as by this my Will provided then and thereafter to pay the annual income of the balance of the said trust fund then left in the hands of my Trustee equally amongst my children and in the event of the death of any child of mine leaving issue then such issue shall take and share and share alike the portion of income which the parent of such issue would have taken if living and at the expiration of the period of twenty (20) years from the death of my last surviving child that now lives then as to as well the capital as the income of the said trust fund UPON TRUST for all of my grandchildren then living in equal shares that is to say share and share alike.\nParagraph 14 of the will provided, inter alia, that the payments of income to the widow should be free of income tax.\nThe first codicil read, in part, as follows:\nIn the event of any son of mine marrying and departing this life leaving him surviving a widow and child or children I WILL AND DIRECT that such widow take an equal share per capita with her child or children in all moneys coming to her child or children under and by virtue of the provisions of my said Last Will and Testament and in the event of there being left a widow and no issue then I WILL AND DIRECT that such widow be paid by my said Trustee an annuity of two thousand four hundred dollars payable and to be paid by my said Trustee in equal monthly payments computed from the first day of the calendar month next following my decease until and up to the day of her death or remarriage with full power to my said Trustee to take and apply so much of the incomes and profits of the said Trust Fund under my said last Will and Testament as may be necessary for the purposes of this annuity.\nThe income from the residue of the estate after providing the $100,000 for each of the testator's children has proved sufficient to pay the income directed to be paid to the widow (plus an additional allowance awarded to her by order of D. A. McDonald J. made on September 28, 1934, under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act) and to leave a surplus of income each year to be divided among the testator's children.\nThe second codicil appointed additional executors and continued:\nAs regards and with reference to my second son Howard Jones who has contracted an ill-advised marriage and has become entangled in disputes and troubles with his wife I revoke all gifts and provisions made to or for him in my said last Will and Testament and in lieu thereof I give devise and bequeath as follows that is to say: All moneys in and by my said Last Will and Testament bequeathed to or provided for or directed to be paid to or for the benefit of my said son Howard Jones shall fall back into and be accumulated with and form part of \"the said Trust Fund\" directed by my said last Will and Testament to be created and accumulated and I will and direct that except as hereinafter in this Codicil provided the Executors and Trustees of my said last Will and Testament shall deal with and distribute all my estate and also the said Trust Fund as though my said son Howard Jones had never been born subject however to the two following provisions namely first that my said trustees and Executors shall pay to the said Howard Jones the sum of seventy dollars per month so long as he shall live computed from the first day of the month next following my decease and second that if in the event of the said Howard Jones on the day of his attaining the full age of thirty-five years being free of disputes and troubles with his present wife and being under no liability to contribute and pay either directly or contingently to her any money received by him from my estate then the said Howard Jones shall be reinstated so as to receive as on and from that day as a new gift and without any right to claim back for intervening time all and singular such money, share of my said estate and provisions for his benefit as on attaining the said age he would have been entitled to under my said last Will and Testament if this Codicil had not been made.\nHoward Jones married Virginia Jean Jones (now Virginia Jean Wallace) on March 6, 1933.\nShortly after the testator's death (the exact date does not appear in the material before us) proceedings were commenced by originating summons in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to determine whether Howard Jones was entitled to receive the gifts and bequests provided for him under the testator's will unaffected by the provisions of the second codicil quoted above. The question raised was whether the codicil was void as being against public policy. The matter came before Murphy J. and on May 28, 1934, that learned judge gave judgment upholding the validity of the codicil. Howard Jones appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and his appeal was dismissed, McPhillips and McQuarrie JJ.A. dissenting. The reasons of the Court of Appeal are reported sub nom. In Re Estate of Stephen Jones, Deceased. The Royal Trust Company et al. v. Jones et al. (No. 2)[3]\nAt a date not stated in the material an action was commenced in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in which Howard Jones, his wife Virginia Jean Jones and his two infant daughters were plaintiffs and the executors of the testator and all the other persons then living entitled to share in the estate were defendants. The pleadings in that action are not before us but it appears from the judgment of Manson J., before whom it was tried, and from his reasons that the plaintiffs asked that the judgment of Murphy J., affirmed by the Court of Appeal as set out above, be set aside upon the grounds: (i) that all the interested parties were not before the Court; (ii) that the plaintiff Howard Jones had, under duress, failed to produce certain material evidence before Murphy J.; and (iii) that other material evidence had just recently come to the knowledge of Howard Jones which had not been produced before Murphy J.\nOn June 26, 1945, Manson J. gave judgment.\nIn paragraph 1 of his formal judgment, that portion of the second codicil to the testator's will quoted above is declared to be invalid, void and of no effect.\nParagraph 2 reads as follows:\n2.That the Judgments of the Honourable Mr. Justice Murphy and of the Court of Appeal in the pleadings herein mentioned and dated the 28th day of May, 1933, and the 9th day of October, 1933, respectively, be and the same are hereby set aside.\nParagraph 3 commences with the words:\n3.That the Defendants The Royal Trust Company and Samuel McClure, as the Executors and Trustees of the will of the said Stephen Jones, deceased, shall and may from and after the date hereof administer and distribute the estate of the said Stephen Jones, deceased, as if the said codicil bearing date the 5th day of June, 1933, being the second codicil to his will bearing the date the 18th day of December, 1928, had never included the words and terms quoted in paragraph No. 1 hereof, but subject to the following conditions, namely:\nThere follow a number of provisions, consented to by Howard Jones, dealing with the manner in which the accounts between him and the executors were to be adjusted.\nNo appeal was taken from the judgment of Manson J. and the executors have ever since administered the estate and made payments of capital and income in reliance on that judgment.\nOn September 25, 1945, Howard Jones left his wife, Virginia Jean Jones in British Columbia and went to California, U.S.A. Later Virginia Jean Jones went to Reno, Nevada, and commenced an action for divorce on October 15, 1945. Howard Jones entered a general appearance in that action and both parties were present in Nevada at the time of the hearing. A decree of divorce was granted by the Nevada court on December 7, 1945. Thereafter Virginia Jean Jones returned to British Columbia, and on February 23, 1946, was married there to Hugh Holdsworth Wallace. Howard Jones married Virginia Lorraine Hurst in Nevada on December 7, 1945, and then returned with her to California. As already stated, there was born of this marriage one child, Howard Stephen Jones.\nFollowing the death of Howard Jones, on March 18, 1958, the executors were in doubt as to the validity of the divorce granted in Nevada and as to what persons were entitled to the share of the testator's estate to which Howard Jones had been entitled in his lifetime.\nOn May 29, 1958, the Royal Trust Company, which was then the sole surviving executor of the testator, commenced proceedings by originating summons for the determination of the following questions:\n1. From what source shall the Trustee make the monthly payments of $500 to the widow of the said Testator required by Clause 4 of the Will and the monthly payments of $200 to said widow required by the order of the Honourable Mr. Justice McDonald dated the 28th day of September, 1934?\n2. From what source should the Trustee pay the income tax of said widow as directed by said Will and said order?\n3. If any part of said monthly payments or income tax should be paid out of capital, in what order should capital and income be resorted to?\n4. Is the widow of said Testator entitled to have all her income taxes paid out of the estate of said Testator regardless of the source of income, or only so far as her income comes from the estate of said Testator?\n5. To what extent can and should the Trustee exercise the power given by the following language in Clause 3 of the Will of said Testator, viz: UPON TRUST out of the incomes and profits of the said trust fund, with right and full power to my Trustee to have resort to principal in the event of any deficiency in incomes and profits?\n6. Was the Nevada divorce dated 7th December 1945 between the Defendant Virginia Jean Wallace and said Howard Jones a valid divorce?\n7. Did said Howard Jones die \"leaving him surviving a widow\" within the meaning of the said Testator's second codicil?\n8. If so, who was such widow?\n9. Is the defendant Virginia Jean Wallace estopped from claiming to be such widow by having obtained the said Nevada divorce or by having later purported to re-marry?\n10. Was said Howard Jones' purported marriage to the defendant Virginia Lorraine Jones a valid marriage?\n11. What children did said Howard Jones leave \"him surviving\" within the meaning of said first codicil and what issue within the meaning of Clause 12 in said testator's will?\n12. How should the Trustee divide the income of the Testator's estate that Howard Jones would have taken if living between the lawful widow and the children of Howard Jones?\n13. If neither the defendant Virginia Jean Wallace nor the defendant Virginia Lorraine Jones can claim as the lawful widow of said Howard Jones, who is entitled to the portion of the income of the estate of said Testator that Howard Jones would take if living? 14. If the said Howard Jones left a lawful widow, will she take any interest, and if so what interest, in the capital of the estate of said Testator?\n15. If such widow takes an interest in such capital will this be contingent on (a) her surviving the last surviving child of said Testator by twenty years, (b) her having children who survive the last surviving child of said Testator by twenty years?\nA preliminary inquiry as to the domicile of Howard Jones, directed by order of McInnis J., came on for hearing before Macfarlane J. and on October 26, 1959, that learned judge made an order declaring that Howard Jones was domiciled in the State of California both:\n(1) at the date when the defendant Virginia Jean Wallace obtained against said Howard Jones a divorce decree or alleged divorce decree dated the 7th day of December, 1945 in the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for the County of Washoe; and\n(2) at the date when the defendant Virginia Jean Wallace presented her petition on which said decree was granted.\nThis order further provided that the matter should be brought on again before the presiding judge in Chambers and that evidence of the relevant law of California might be given by affidavit subject to any order in that regard which the presiding judge might make.\nThe matter later came on for hearing before Maclean J. and on June 17, 1960, that learned judge gave judgment making the following answers to the questions quoted above:\nQuestion 1.\nAnswer: All the monthly payments should be made in priority to payments of any other income under said will out of the income from the estate of the said Testator coming to the hands of the plaintiff, so far as the same suffices, other than income of the special trust funds set aside for the three daughters of Testator, with resort to residuary capital in any case of insufficiency of said general income.\nQuestion 2.\nAnswer: From the same sources as the widow's monthly payments of income, as directed in the last Answer.\nQuestion 3.\nAnswer: Payments should be made to the widow of said Testator out of income so far as this extends, with resort to capital from time to time so far as income proves deficient.\nQuestion 4.\nAnswer: In paying the income taxes of said widow the plaintiff shall follow the provisions of para. 6 (c) and (d) of the agreement dated the 15th day of December, 1945, forming Exhibit \"A\" to said affidavit of William Booth McFadden, which provisions the Court finds to be in accordance with the will of the said Testator. Question 5.\nAnswer: At the present state of administration the power extends only to the monthly payments referred to in the Answer to Question 1.\nQuestion 6.\nAnswer: No answer needed.\nQuestion 7.\nAnswer: Yes.\nQuestion 8.\nAnswer: The defendant Virginia Lorraine Jones.\nQuestion 9.\nAnswer: Yes, she is estopped.\nQuestion 10.\nAnswer: The validity of this marriage depends on the validity of the said divorce of Howard Jones; the validity of the said divorce and marriage for the purposes of this summons is governed by the law of California, and the marriage must be considered valid because by that law no party interested in contesting the said divorce has any locus standi to contest it.\nQuestion 11.\nAnswer: The children and issue in each case are the defendants Elsie Margaret Langmaid, Carol Anne Jones and Howard Stephen Jones.\nQuestion 12.\nAnswer: The trustee should pay the said income (one-fifth of all income of the residuary estate after monthly payments of income to the widow of the said Testator) as follows:\nOne-third of said one-fifth to the defendant Elsie Margaret Langmaid;\nOne-third of said one-fifth to the defendant Carol Anne Jones;\nOne-sixth of said one-fifth to the defendant Howard Stephen Jones (through his guardian during his infancy);\nOne-sixth of said one-fifth to the defendant Virginia Lorraine Jones.\nQuestion 13.\nAnswer: No answer needed.\nQuestion 14.\nAnswer: If the defendant Virginia Lorraine Jones survives the expiration of the period of 20 years from the death of said Testator's last surviving child, and the defendant Howard Stephen Jones survives the same period, then said Virginia Lorraine Jones will share equally with said Howard Stephen Jones the portion of said Testator's capital that said Howard Stephen Jones would have taken in his sole right if she had not survived said period.\nQuestion 15.\nAnswer: Virginia Lorraine Jones' taking capital will depend on both her and Howard Stephen Jones surviving the last surviving child of said Testator by 20 years.\nFrom this judgment Elsie Margaret Langmaid and Carol Anne Jones appealed to the Court of Appeal asking that the judgment be varied. While their notice of appeal did not specify the terms of the judgment for which they asked, it is clear from the grounds set forth in the notice that the answers to the first five questions were not attacked and that what the appellants sought was a declaration that they alone (to the exclusion of Virginia Lorraine Jones and Howard Stephen Jones) were entitled to share in that part of the testator's estate bequeathed to the widow and children of Howard Jones after his death. This was the only question raised for the decision of the Court of Appeal. No appeal was taken by any other party.\nThe material filed before Maclean J. included an affidavit exhibiting a copy of the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated October 9, 1934, and a copy of the judgment of Manson J. dated June 26, 1945. It was, of course, necessary that the last mentioned judgment should be before Maclean J. and presumably it was thought desirable to include the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the material so as to complete the history of the matter.\nThe argument of the appeal commenced on February 22, 1961, continued on February 23 and concluded on February 24. The appeal case filed in this Court includes a transcript of what was said in argument on the final day of the hearing in the Court of Appeal. From this it appears that it was only at the conclusion of the argument on February 23 that counsel for the Royal Trust Company called the attention of the Court to a passage in his factum which, as quoted in the reasons of the Court of Appeal, read as follows:\nThe plaintiff (that is the Trustee) has the embarrassing role of bringing before the court what prima facie appears to be a conflict between a judgment of this court dated the 9th of October, 1933 (A.B. pp. 66-68) and a judgment of Manson J. dated the 26th June, 1945. The judgment of this Court upheld the validity of the testator's second codicil, which disinherited Howard Jones unless he complied with certain conditions, which he did not. This Court's reasons are reported at (1934) 49 B.C.R. 207. The judgment of Manson J. held the codicil void and of no effect, as being contrary to public policy.\nBringing this conflict forward is not at all in the plaintiff's interest, since the plaintiff has acted upon the judgment of Manson J. But the plaintiff feels that it cannot avoid doing so, since it is asking for the advice and direction of the courts, and must disclose the material facts. As has already been said, without Manson J.'s judgment none of the persons claiming as wife or children of Howard Jones can have any claim at all under the Will, since the second codicil said that unless its conditions were complied with, the estate should be distributed as though Howard Jones had never been born:\nMaclean J., without discussing the point at all, proceeded on the assumption that Manson J.'s judgment was operative. The judgments of this Court and of Manson J. alone are before the Court; the record of the case before Manson J. is of some size and the plaintiff did not feel justified in going to the expense of having copies made unless and until the Court required them.\nAs has been said, the plaintiff has no interest in disturbing or any wish to disturb the judgment of Manson J. Its interest is all the other way.\nWith respect, this passage appears to me to have been unfortunately worded; the suggestion that there was a conflict between the judgments mentioned presupposed that both were in force whereas the earlier one had been set aside by the later.\nIn giving the reasons of the Court of Appeal O'Halloran J.A. made it clear that, on the assumption that the part of the second codicil quoted above purporting to disinherit Howard Jones was invalid, the Court would have dismissed the appeal. The learned Justice of Appeal then referred to the passage in the factum of counsel for the Royal Trust Company quoted above and went on to hold that in pronouncing the judgment of June 26, 1945, Manson J. had acted without jurisdiction, that his judgment was a nullity and that the acts done by the trustees in pursuance thereof were without validity.\nBy the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal it was declared ordered and adjudged:\n(a) That the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclean now under appeal, and the originating summons upon which it was based, be and the same are hereby set aside.\n(b) That the said judgment of Mr. Justice Manson in so far as it purports to set aside and overrule the judgment of the Court of Appeal as reported in 1934-49 B.C.R. 207, is on its face without jurisdiction and should be quashed as a nullity and is hereby set aside and quashed accordingly.\n(c) That a trial be directed to determine upon all admissible evidence \u2026.\nThere follow a number of paragraphs providing in effect that at the trial so directed it shall be determined what ought to have been done by the trustees of the testator's will if the judgment of Manson J. had never been pronounced.\nPursuant to leave granted by this Court, appeals were brought from this judgment (i) by the Royal Trust Company as surviving executor and trustee of the testator and (ii) by Virginia Lorraine Jones and Howard Stephen Jones. In both of these appeals it was asked that the judgment of the Court of Appeal be set aside in toto, that the judgment of Maclean J. be restored and that the costs of all parties in this Court and in the Court of Appeal should be paid out of the Estate. On the argument before us, counsel for the respondents other than Stephen Jones Jr. (who was not represented by counsel) supported the submission of counsel for the appellants except on the question of the order which should be made as to costs.\nI have reached the conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal must be set aside. It is founded upon the view, which, in my respectful opinion, is erroneous, that because the judgment of Murphy J. had been affirmed by the Court of Appeal, a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was without jurisdiction to entertain an action to set it aside. Counsel for the appellants referred us to a wealth of authority to shew that this is not the law. It will be sufficient to refer to a few of the cases which were cited.\nIn Falcke v. The Scottish Imperial Insurance Company[4], a judgment of Bacon V.C. had been reversed by the Court of Appeal in 1886 (vide 34 Ch. D. 234) and judgment had been entered rejecting the claim of one Emanuel and directing the whole of the proceeds of an insurance policy to be paid to Mrs. Falcke. On December 22, 1886, Emanuel appealed to the House of Lords. On February 14, 1887, the parties came to a compromise and the appeal was withdrawn. In April 1887 Emanuel obtained a letter dated the\u2014day of May, 1878, which he contended was newly discovered evidence which would have been decisive in his favour if it had been available in the earlier proceedings. Emanuel applied for leave to commence an action in the nature of a bill of review grounded upon new matter discovered after the making of the said orders. The application came before Kay J., as he then was, on August 3, 1887, and that learned Judge raised the question whether an action could be brought to review a judgment of the Court of Appeal; he thereupon directed that the matter should stand over until the following Monday so that he might be furnished with authority. After the matter had been fully argued Kay J. gave judgment holding that the old jurisdiction to entertain an action in the nature of a bill of review was unaffected by the Judicature Acts; he said in part at page 40:\nIn this case leave to bring an action in the nature of a bill of review is sought because since the decision of the Court of Appeal material evidence is alleged to have been found; but such leave is not given unless, first, the evidence is material; secondly, that it has been discovered since the decision; and, thirdly, could not with reasonable diligence have been discovered before. I am stating from memory what I believe to be the settled practice of the Court of Chancery in such a matter. I had doubts whether, as the decision was made since the Judicature Acts, the application should not have been made to the Court of Appeal. No authority could be found, and on consideration I came to the conclusion that it was not the practice to make the application to the Court of Appeal. The decision of the Court of Appeal is enrolled as a decision of the High Court, and the application to institute an action in the nature of a bill of review is part of the original jurisdiction of the High Court. The Court of Appeal has no original jurisdiction of that kind. The proper court to apply to is the High Court; the right application is to the High Court to exercise its original jurisdiction; there is no reason why the application should be to the Appeal Court.\nKay J. then dealt with the merits of the application and dismissed it.\nFlower v. Lloyd[5], was a decision of the Court of Appeal the effect of which is accurately summarized in the headnote which reads as follows:\nThe Plaintiffs commenced an action to restrain the Defendants from infringing their patent, and obtained a judgment which was reversed by the Court of Appeal, who dismissed the action on the ground that the Defendants' process was no infringement of the Plaintiffs' patent. After the order on appeal was passed and entered, the Plaintiffs applied to have the appeal reheard with fresh evidence, on the ground that when an expert sent down by the Court, and whose evidence was in fact the only material evidence before the Court as to the nature of the Defendants' process, examined the Defendants' works, the Defendants had fraudulently concealed from him parts of the process, so that he had no opportunity of discovering the points in which it resembled that of the Plaintiffs:\nHeld, that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to rehear the appeal, and that the remedy of the Plaintiffs was by original action analogous to a suit under the old practice to set aside a decree as obtained by fraud.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal in Flower v. Lloyd was approved in the unanimous judgment of the House of Lords, delivered by Lord Buckmaster, in Jonesco v. Beard[6] particularly at pages 300 and 301.\nIn Mitford's Chancery Pleading, 5th ed., 1847, among the bills in the nature of original bills are listed \"Bills impeaching decrees upon the ground of fraud\" and \"Bills to avoid decrees on the ground of matter subsequent\" (page 97), and at page 105 the learned author says:\nA bill of review upon new matter discovered has been permitted even after an affirmance of the decree in Parliament. Boswell v. Coaks[7] is a decision of the House of Lords. In 1883, Fry J. gave judgment dismissing with costs an action in which it was sought to set aside a sale. In the following year the Court of Appeal reversed this decision. In 1886 the House of Lords allowed an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restored that of Fry J. These judgments are reported at 23 Ch. D. 302; 27 Ch. D. 424; and 11 App. Cas. 232. Some years later an action was brought to have it declared that the judgment given by the House of Lords, restoring that of Fry J., was obtained by the fraudulent suppression of evidence. A motion to dismiss this action on the ground that it was frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of the Court was granted by North J. whose decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and by the House of Lords. The unanimous judgment of the House of Lords was delivered by the Earl of Selborne. There is nothing in his speech to suggest that the bringing of an action in the High Court to impeach the earlier judgments was not the proper practice, indeed he assumes that it was the right way in which to proceed. He points out that the old practice of the Court of Chancery which required a preliminary application to the Court for leave to take proceedings in the nature of a bill of review is no longer in use and that the safeguard against an action to set aside a judgment being proceeded with on insufficient grounds is now found in the power of the Court to stay such an action. Earl Selborne then went fully into the merits and held that the action was properly dismissed on the ground that the matter which was alleged to have been newly discovered was not material.\nAn examination of the authorities leads me to the conclusion that it has long been settled in England that the proper method of impeaching a judgment of the High Court on the ground of fraud or of seeking to set it aside on the ground of subsequently discovered evidence is by action, whether or not the judgment which is attacked has been affirmed or otherwise dealt with by the Court of Appeal or other appellate tribunal. Section 9 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 56, which was in force at the time when Manson J. dealt with the matter (and which is now section 9 of the R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 374) reads as follows:\n9. The Court is and shall continue to be a Court of original jurisdiction, and shall have complete cognizance of all pleas whatsoever, and shall have jurisdiction in all cases, civil as well as criminal, arising within the Province.\nThere appears to be nothing in the statutes constituting and continuing the courts in British Columbia or in the Rules of Court of that Province to suggest that there is any difference between the law and practice on this point in British Columbia and in England; in my opinion they are the same.\nIt follows that Manson J. had jurisdiction to entertain the action which was brought before him and his judgment in that action, not having been appealed from or otherwise impeached, is a valid judgment of the Court binding upon all those who were parties to it.\nThe conclusion that Manson J. had jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment of June 26, 1945, renders it unnecessary to examine the other grounds upon which counsel argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be set aside.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of Maclean J. In the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case I would direct that the costs of all parties in this Court and in the Court of Appeal should be paid out of the capital of the Estate, those of the surviving trustee as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal allowed, judgment at trial restored.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Crease and Co., Victoria.\nSolicitor for the defendants, respondents: W.

The plaintiff, in her capacity as administratrix of the deceased's estate, issued an originating summons to determine the right of the widow to share in the estate of her late husband. The trial judge held that the defendant wife, when she set the fire, \"did not appreciate the nature and quality of her act or know that it was wrong\" and accordingly was entitled to inherit. In directing that the judgment of the trial judge and the proceedings before him, including the originating summons itself, should be \"wholly set aside\", the majority of the Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to review the finding as to the defendant's insanity, but disposed of the matter on the ground that the trial Court was without jurisdiction to determine by way of originating summons, or other civil proceeding, whether or not a person had committed a crime. The defendant appealed to this Court, asking that the trial judgment be restored, and the plaintiff cross-appealed, contending that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied so as to direct that judgment be entered for her, and that the questions proposed by the originating summons should be answered so as to exclude the defendant from sharing in her husband's estate.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Locke, Martland and Judson JJ.: The judge before whom the application for directions came and the judge who heard the case were both apparently of the opinion that the questions to be determined could properly be disposed of by way of originating summons as prescribed by M.R. 765 (B.C.). This conclusion was correct. The Court had jurisdiction to determine the questions in a civil action commenced by an ordinary writ of summons, and there was no sound ground upon which to interfere with the discretion exercised by the two judges. In Re Turcan (1888), 58 L.J. Ch. 101; Eggli v. Stewart (1952), 5 W.W.R. (N.S.) 164, referred to. The question was one of procedure and not of jurisdiction and, if there were non-compliance with any of the rules or rules of practice, the matter could be dealt with under M.R. 1037.\nIf it were not permissible in civil actions to make findings of fact which if proven in criminal proceedings would be held criminal, the due administration of justice would be gravely impeded. Civil Courts constantly have to make such findings for the purpose of determining civil rights. Per Taschereau, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: An originating summons was a permissible, though not desirable, method of initiating these proceedings. The parties concerned consented to the case being tried in this way, and the trial judge who, in the exercise of his discretion, heard and determined the matter was clothed with jurisdiction so to do.\nThe rule of public policy precluding a person from benefiting from his or her own crime, which is an integral part of our law, applies also to cases where the distribution of the estate of an intestate is concerned. In re Pitts, Cox v. Kilsby, [1931] 1 Ch. 546; Whitelaw v. Wilson (1934), 62 C.C.C. 172; Re Estate of Maud Mason, [1917] 1 W.W.R. 329, referred to. The right to determine the question of whether or not the conduct of an individual amounts to a crime for the purpose of invoking this rule is a necessary concomitant of the jurisdiction which civil courts have long exercised in such cases.\nPer Curiam: As to the cross-appeal, the plaintiff's arguments that the defendant failed to discharge the onus of proof necessary to rebut the presumption of sanity, and that the trial judge misdirected himself in the manner in which he applied the test of insanity contained in s. 16(2) of the Criminal Code were rejected. The trial judge's finding that the defendant was insane at the relevant time was a finding of fact based on a careful assessment of the relative value of the testimony of expert witnesses and should not be reversed on appeal. Prudential Trust Co. Ltd. v. Forseth, [1960] S.C.R. 210, referred to.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Wilson J. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nW. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nDavid A. Freeman, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The judgment of O'Halloran J.A. in this matter proceeds upon two grounds: the first being that a person's sanity or criminality should not be adjudicated upon in a hearing in a matter instituted by an originating summons; the second, that \"a provincially constituted court is without jurisdiction to determine in civil proceedings whether or not a person has committed a crime.\"\nBird J. A. in his oral judgment said nothing as to the first point but said that, if there was to be a finding that the appellant was guilty of a crime it should be made \"in a properly constituted criminal proceeding and not in a civil proceeding such as this.\" Davey J.A. who dissented, considered as to the first point that the manner in which the issues had been raised and tried was a matter of discretion and said that he would not interfere with the exercise of that discretion in the circumstances of this case.\nThe manner in which the issue came to be tried by Wilson J. is not referred to in the judgments of the Court of Appeal[2] and, since the objection is really that the procedure followed in raising and determining the issue as to whether the appellant was entitled to share in the estate of her deceased husband, it is of importance that this should be described.\nThe originating summons was issued on November 1, 1957, at the instance of the respondent, in her capacity as administratrix of the estate of John Alfred Nordstrom, for the determination of three questions and, by it, the appellant was directed to cause an appearance to be entered.\nThe proceedings thus initiated constituted an action as that term is defined in s. 2 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 374. The summons was issued by the plaintiff in the proceedings relying upon Marginal Rule 765 of the Supreme Court, which permits an executor or administrator to apply by originating notice returnable in chambers for the determination, inter alia, of:\n(a) any question affecting the rights or interests of the person claiming to be creditor, devisee, legatee, next of kin or heir-at-law or cestui que trust.\nMrs. Nordstrom, at the time of the issue of the summons, was an inmate of the Provincial Hospital for the insane and the Official Committee for British Columbia entered an unconditional appearance on her behalf.\nThe plaintiff then applied for directions under the provisions of Order 30 as to the manner in which the questions should be determined and such application came before Brown J. on August 17, 1958. By an order bearing that date that learned judge directed that the case be set down for hearing on the trial list without further pleadings, leave was given to the parties to call evidence at the hearing and to cross-examine on any affidavits which might be filed. It is clear that this order was made with the consent and approval of the committee acting on behalf of the defendant. In this manner the case came on for hearing before Wilson J. Counsel for the parties informed that learned judge that the date of the death and the manner in which it had been caused were admitted and that it had been agreed that the transcript of the evidence taken at the inquest, which had been held to enquire into the death of Nordstrom, should be admitted as part of the evidence at the trial and that the matter to be determined was whether at the time the defendant had set fire to the house she was insane, within the meaning of s. 16 of the Criminal Code. The defendant by her committee conceded that the onus was on her to establish such insanity, if it existed.\nAs stated in the reasons delivered, it was further admitted that if the defendant was guilty of either the crime of murder or arson she could not inherit and that the estate should be dealt with as if there had been an intestacy, but that if she was insane in the sense mentioned at the relevant time she was entitled to inherit.\nBoth parties called evidence and the trial was conducted in the same manner as if the action had been commenced by an ordinary summons, save that there were no pleadings. The question of the propriety of deciding the issues in this way was clearly not raised either on the application for directions or before the learned trial judge, the parties consenting to the matter being heard and disposed of by Wilson J. The propriety of proceeding in this manner was not questioned by either party in the Court of Appeal and was raised for the first time in the oral judgments given in that court. The practical aspect of the matter is that there was a trial at which both parties had full opportunity to be heard and the procedure adopted resulted in a considerable saving of expense to the litigants, since no pleadings were delivered or examinations for discovery held.\nMarginal Rule 765 of the Supreme Court of British Columbia reproduces Order 55, Rule 3 of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. The same rule is Rule 600 of the Supreme Court of Ontario. In its present form it appeared as Marginal Rule 765 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1906 and has been in force since that time.\nRead literally, the portion of the rule that I have quoted above appears to authorize an application by originating summons in a case of this kind, since the question affects the rights of a person claiming to be an heir-at-law of the deceased person. There are, however, decisions in England such as Re Powers[3], where it was said that the English Rule in similar terms does not authorize a summons at the instance of alleged creditors of an estate for its administration when there was a dispute as to the debt. Where, however, a summons had been issued under Order 55, Rule 3, to decide questions between executors and adverse claimants and those named as defendants had entered appearances without objection and the matter being decided adversely to them appealed to the Court of Appeal objecting that the procedure was not authorized, Cotton L.J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said that the objection could not be given effect to in these circumstances in the Court of Appeal (In Re Turcan[4]). That learned judge, whose opinion was concurred in by Bowen and Fry L. JJ., said in part:\nOrder LV is not an order conferring jurisdiction, but merely regulating the mode in which questions are to be brought before the Court. If a person who is served with an originating summons in a matter not falling within a, b, c, d, e, f, and g in the 3rd rule of Order LV objected to the jurisdiction, and did not appear, the Court would not go on; but when the party has appeared and has taken the decision of the Court, it would be wrong to let him take the objection when the matter comes before the Court of Appeal.\nIn Eggli v. Stewart[5], where an originating summons had been issued to determine the validity of an alleged creditor's claim against the estate of a deceased person, Bird J.A., with whom O'Halloran J.A. agreed, said in part (p. 169):\nIn my view the Rule is broad enough to permit determination thereunder of the validity of a debt, even where there is a dispute on fact; but it lies in the discretion of the presiding judge to decide whether the question can conveniently and economically be disposed of by the summary procedure prescribed by the Rule, or can be determined more satisfactorily in an action commenced by writ of summons.\nIn the present matter, Brown J. and Wilson J. were apparently of the opinion that the questions could properly be disposed of in this manner, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree. Considering as I do that the Court had jurisdiction to determine the questions in a civil action commenced by an ordinary writ of summons, I am unable to perceive any sound ground upon which to interfere with the discretion exercised by these two learned judges. The question is one of procedure and not of jurisdiction and, if there were non-compliance with any of the rules or rules of practice, the matter might be dealt with under Marginal Rule 1037.\nAs to the second question, if it were not permissible in civil actions to make findings of fact which if proven in criminal proceedings would be held criminal, the due administration of justice would be gravely impeded. If this was the law, this Court would not have considered the issue as to whether the assured was a suicide in London Life Insurance Co. v. Trustees of Lang Shirt Co. Ltd. et al.[6], since, as found by Mignault J., where there is a successful attempt at suicide a crime is committed. Civil courts constantly have to make such findings, as in actions upon fire insurance policies where the defence may be that the assured has made false statements in a proof of loss, thus committing the offence of attempting to obtain money by false pretences. It is also unfortunately the fact that trial judges at times must find that witnesses have knowingly, with intent to mislead, sworn to what is false in the course of a trial, conduct punishable in criminal proceeding as perjury. The right to make findings such as these for the purpose of determining civil rights have, so far as I am aware, not been previously questioned.\nIf the court was without jurisdiction to determine the first question in a civil action, then since it is clear that both parties consented to submit their rights to be determined by Wilson J. it would be necessary to consider whether the proceedings were in the nature of an arbitration from which there would be no appeal (Overn v. Strand[7]; Wong Soon v. Gareb[8]). However, in the view I take of the matter this question does not arise.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial.\nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment to be delivered by my brother Ritchie regarding the cross-appeal, with which I agree and with the proposed order as to costs. The judgment of Taschereau, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014These proceedings were initiated by way of an originating summons issued by the respondent in her capacity as administratrix of the estate of John Alfred Nordstrom pursuant to the provisions of Marginal Rule 765 of the 1943 Rules of the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the determination of the following questions:\n1. Is the above-named Defendant, Kathleen M. Nordstrom, widow of the late John Alfred Nordstrom, entitled to the distributive share of the estate of the said John Alfred Nordstrom, deceased, as provided for in the Administration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, Chapter 6, as amended by S.B.C. 1955, in view of the circumstances that the said John Alfred Nordstrom came to his death as a result of a fire caused by the act of the said Defendant?\n2. If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative, to whom should the share of the said Defendant be paid in view of her confinement as a patient in the Provincial Mental Hospital, Essondale, B.C.?\n3. If the answer to Question 1 is in the negative, to whom should the share which would otherwise have been payable to the Defendant be paid?\nThe appellant, being a patient in the Provincial Mental Hospital, was represented by counsel acting on instructions from the Official Committee appointed under the Lunacy Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 194, whose position before the Court was governed inter alia by the provisions of Marginal Rule 143 of the said Rules which contains the following provision:\nIn all causes or matters to which any \u2026person of unsound mind \u2026is a party, any consent as to the mode of taking evidence or as to any other procedure shall, if given with the consent of the Court or a Judge by the \u2026committee, or other person acting on behalf of the person under disability, have the same force and effect as if such party were under no disability and had given such consent: \u2026.\nAt the opening of the proceedings and with the apparent consent of the trial judge, it was admitted by counsel for the Official Committee that Mr. Nordstrom died on May 30, 1956, by reason of asphyxiation suffered in a fire which had been set by the appellant, and it was further agreed by counsel for both parties that the transcript of the proceedings at the coroner's inquest on the body of John Alfred Nordstrom, except for the findings of the coroner's jury, should be treated as evidence in these proceedings. The only evidence as to the origin of the fire was contained in an account given by Dr. J. M. Coles of a statement made by the appellant on the morning after the event in which she said that she was feeling unwell on the evening in question and that she had got out of bed on two occasions to get herself some food and soft drink, and that when her husband told her that she had eaten enough and to come to bed she tried to call the doctor but her husband knocked the telephone out of her hand. Dr. Coles' report of her statement then continues:\n\u2026she said, \"I then lay down and waited until I heard him snoring good and loud,\" and when I asked her what she did next she stated that she got up and went out to the kitchen and set the curtains on fire. She was then asked \"How did you set the curtains on fire\", and she replied that she had taken some matches and lit the curtains.\nOn being further questioned at the trial, Dr. Coles stated:\nThen, as I recall it, she stated that she had taken the oil can and used it\u2014the oil thereof\u2014to soak the curtains, so that they would fire up.\nEven if counsel had made no admission, it seems to me that this uncontradicted statement, taken together with the medical evidence that Mr. Nordstrom's death was caused by asphyxiation and the police evidence that his badly burned body was found in the bedroom after the fire would have afforded ample justification for the finding of the learned trial judge \"that the widow set fire to the house and this act caused Nordstrom's death.\"\nThe real issue before the trial judge was whether or not, when she set this fire, the appellant was insane to such an extent as to relieve her of the taint of criminality which both counsel agreed would otherwise have precluded her from sharing in her husband's estate under the rule of public policy exemplified in such cases as Lundy v. Lundy[9], The London Life Insurance Company v. Trustees of Lang Shirt Company Limited et al.[10], In the Estate of Crippen[11]and Cleaver v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association[12].\nThe learned trial judge analyzed the evidence with great care, including the previous record of happy relations between the Nordstroms, the deranged and contradictory behaviour of the appellant after the fire and her long history of mental disease, epilepsy and diabetes, and having then weighed the opinions of four doctors, he concluded, based in large measure on the evidence of the Assistant Clinical Director of the Provincial Mental Hospital, that the appellant, when she set fire to the house, \"did not then appreciate the nature and quality of her act or know that it was wrong.\"\nIn conformity with this finding as to the appellant's mental condition, the trial judge ordered that the first question raised by the originating summons be answered in the affirmative and that the appellant's share of her husband's estate should be paid to the Official Committee.\nIn directing that the judgment of the trial judge and the proceedings before him, including the originating summons itself, should be \"wholly set aside\", the majority of the Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to review the finding as to the appellant's insanity, but rather disposed of the matter on a ground which had been raised by neither party, namely, that the trial court was without jurisdiction to determine by way of originating summons or other civil proceeding whether or not a person had committed a crime.\nFrom this judgment the appellant now appeals, asking that the decision of the trial judge be restored and the respondent, by way of cross-appeal, contends that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied so as to direct that judgment be entered for her, and that the questions propounded by the originating summons should be answered so as to exclude the appellant from sharing in her husband's estate.\nIn the course of rendering his decision in the Court of Appeal, O'Halloran J.A. said in part:\nWhat I am saying from now on, I am speaking only for myself. In my judgment a person's sanity or insanity or criminality should not be adjudicated upon in a hearing by way of Originating Summons. It is my judgment also that in view of the divisional heads in Secs. 91 and 92 of the British North America Act that a provincially constituted Court is without jurisdiction to determine in civil proceedings whether or not a person has committed a crime.\nBird J.A. expressed his concurrence in this view in the following brief paragraph:\nI would allow the appeal substantially on the ground that the Order made below has for its foundation a finding that the appellant was guilty of a crime. It is my view that if there is to be any such finding it should be made in a properly constituted criminal proceeding and not in a civil proceeding such as this. I do not think that the procedure provided by Rule 765 of the said Rules of Court was primarily designed for the purpose of having seriously contested questions of fact determined by originating summons, but the terms of that Rule provide that the administrator of a deceased person may take out as of course an originating summons for the determination of \"any question arising in the administration of the estate or trust\" and of \"any question affecting the rights of a person claiming to be \u2026next of kin or heir-at-law \u2026.\" and it cannot be said that the trial judge was without jurisdiction to determine such a contested question of fact when so raised. In the present case it is plain that the parties concerned consented to the case being presented in this way, and as the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, heard and determined the matter, I agree with the dissenting opinion of Davey J.A. in the Court of Appeal and \"would not be prepared to interfere with the use of an originating summons under the circumstances of this case.\"\nThe rule of public policy which precludes a person from benefiting from his or her own crime is an integral part of our system of law, and although some doubts have been raised as to whether this rule overrides the statute law as to the distribution of the estate of an intestate (see In re Houghton, Houghton v. Houghton[13]), the better view appears to me to be that it applies to such cases (see In re Pitts, Cox v. Kilsby[14], Whitelaw v. Wilson[15], and Re Estate of Maud Mason[16]). As Fry L.J. in Cleaver v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association, supra, at p. 156 said:\nIt appears to me that no system of jurisprudence can with reason include amongst the rights which it enforces rights directly resulting to the person asserting them from the crime of that person.\nAs has been indicated the civil courts of this country have repeatedly determined the question of whether or not the conduct of an individual amounts to a crime for the purpose of invoking this rule. Such a determination does not constitute a conviction or acquittal of the individual concerned nor is it in any way binding on a criminal court which may later be concerned with the same circumstances, but the right to determine such an issue is a necessary concomitant of the jurisdiction which civil courts have long exercised in such cases.\nIt is true that if such an issue is raised in a civil court at a time when proceedings are pending for the determination of the same question in a criminal court, application may be made in the civil court for a stay of proceedings until the criminal prosecution has been concluded, but no such application was made in the present case, and in any event the view has been authoritatively expressed that such a discretion should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances (see Canada Starch Company v. St. Lawrence Starch Company[17], and MacKenzie v. Palmer[18]).\nIn view of the above, I am of opinion that an originating summons was a permissible, though not desirable, method of initiating these proceedings and that the learned trial judge was clothed with jurisdiction to determine the issue of whether or not the appellant was sane when she lit the fire that caused her husband's death, and I would, accordingly, allow this appeal.\nThe cross-appeal is directed to attacking the learned trial judge's finding as to the insanity of the appellant and is based on the contention that the appellant failed to discharge the onus of proof necessary to rebut the presumption of sanity, and that the learned trial judge misdirected himself in the manner in which he applied the following test of insanity contained in s. 16(2) of the Canadian Criminal Code:\n16. (2) For the purposes of this section a person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.\nIt is contended on behalf of the respondent (cross-appellant) based on what was said in the cases of Rex v. Codere[19], and Rex v. Windle[20], that the words \"nature and quality\" as employed in this section must be construed as referable to the physical character of the act and not as being intended to distinguish between its physical and moral aspects, and that the words \"knowing that an act or omission was wrong\" must be treated as meaning \"wrong in law\" as opposed to meaning \"morally wrong\".\nIt does not seem to me to be necessary in the present case to express any opinion concerning the adequacy of the tests of insanity adopted in the Codere and Windle cases, supra. Although the trial judge considered these cases in the course of his decision, it is to be remembered that he had medical evidence before him to the effect that the appellant, when she lit the fire, was in such a state of unawareness as to be unable to appreciate that what she was doing was wrong in any sense, and, as the learned trial judge found this evidence to be consistent with all the circumstances, he had no occasion to concern himself with distinctions between the moral, physical or legal aspects of the appellant's understanding.\nIn my view, the success of this cross-appeal must depend on it being shown that the learned trial judge was clearly wrong in his assessment and interpretation of the evidence and that the appellant failed to discharge the burden of proving insanity.\nThe onus of proof lying upon the appellant was that of showing that\n\u2026balancing the probabilities upon the whole case, there was such a preponderance of evidence as would warrant \u2026reasonable men in concluding that it had been established that the accused when \"she\" committed the act was mentally incapable of knowing its nature and quality, or if \"she\" did know it, did not know that \"she\" was doing what was wrong\u2026.\n(See Clark v. The King[21], per Anglin J. (as he then was)).\nCounsel for the respondent (cross-appellant) stressed the evidence of the medical experts who expressed a different view of the appellant's condition from that expressed by Dr. Halliday, the Assistant Clinical Director of the Provincial Mental Hospital, and on this ground it is contended that the appellant has not and cannot meet this onus.\nIn this regard the learned trial judge said:\nI think I must conclude that Dr. Gould and Dr. Coles, with the proper caution one expects of experts, probably think that Mrs. Nordstrom was not insane within the meaning of the M'Naghten rules, that Dr. Fister thinks she may or may not have been insane within the meaning of those rules, and that Dr. Halliday has a clear opinion that she was insane. Consideration of the circumstances of the case as revealed by the witnesses impels me to the conclusion that Dr. Halliday's opinion is most consistent with those circumstances and ought to be accepted.\nThe language of Lord Alness, speaking for the Privy Council in Caldeira v. Gray[22], appears to me to be pertinent in the circumstances. He there said at p. 542:\nThe learned trial judge accepted the view of the medical men adduced as witnesses for the respondent, and rejected the view of the medical men adduced as witnesses for the appellant. Their Lordships see no reason to doubt that, in assessing the relative value of the testimony of expert witnesses, as compared with witnesses of fact, their demeanour, their type, their personality, and the impression made by them upon the trial judge\u2014e.g., whether, \u2026they confined themselves to giving evidence, or acted as advocates\u2014may powerfully and properly influence the mind of the judge who sees and hears them in deciding between them. These advantages, which were available to the trial judge, are manifestly denied to their Lordships sitting as a Court of Appeal.\nAs the trial judge's finding that the appellant was insane at the relevant time is a finding of fact based on a careful assessment of the relative value of the testimony of expert witnesses, I do not think it should be reversed on appeal (see Prudential Trust Company Limited v. Forseth[23]).\nIn the result, I would allow this appeal, dismiss the cross-appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAt the outset of the proceedings, counsel for the respondent made the following statement:\nThe administratrix, although nominally acting as administratrix,\u2014she is, of course, opposing any interest of her stepmother\u2014was the daughter of the deceased, but not the daughter of the Defendant, Mrs. Nordstrom, \u2026.\nIn view of this situation, I would direct that the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal to this Court and of the appeal to the Court of Appeal should be paid by the respondent personally, although I would not disturb the disposition of costs of the trial made by the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed, cross-appeal dismissed and judgment at trial restored.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Douglas, Symes & Brissenden, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Freeman, Freeman, Silvers & Koffman, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961), 34 W.W.R. 556, 27 D.L.R.

The four defendants were held jointly and severally liable but the judgment did not assess their respective liability. The present appellants paid the judgment in full, obtained a subrogation from the pedestrian and then, by means of a seizure by garnishment, the insurer being the tiers-saisi, claimed from their co-defendants 50 per cent, of what they had paid. The co-defendants did not put in a defence, but the insurer pleaded that the status of subrogated creditor did not give the joint creditors the right to execution by the simple method of seizure by garnishment, and subsidiarily, that the degree of liability could not be considered as being equal. The trial judge dismissed the seizure and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment obtained by the victim did not decide the respective fault of the co-defendants, it merely decided the liability as between the victim and the co-defendants and not as between the co-defendants. The victim had sued them jointly and severally and had no interest in the extent each would be held liable. Where the liability arises from a quasi-delict, the Courts in the province of Quebec do not fix the relative liability of the co-defendants in the action instituted by the victim. As between the co-defendants, the joint obligation found by the trial judge must be divided. The payment and the subrogation did not modify this conclusion as to the absence of res judicata upon the issue. Joint tortfeasers were not deemed to be equally liable as between themselves and their respective faults must be established, even though all were liable to the victim for the whole amount of the judgment. Assuming, however, that it must be presumed that the liability must be divided equally, such presumption could be rebutted, but only in an action where the question could be adjudicated. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Montpetit J. Appeal dismissed.\nN. A. Tansey, Q.C., and A. Monet, for the appellants.\nW. A. Grant, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Le 28 janvier 1948, une automobile de la Consolidated Moulton Trimmings Limited, conduite par son employ\u00e9, Louis Blumberg, vint en collision, \u00e0 l'intersection des rues Notre-Dame et Atwater, en la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, avec un taxi, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Marcel Gigu\u00e8re et conduit par son emplo9y\u00e9, Fran\u00e7ois St-Cyr. Le taxi fut projet\u00e9 sur un poteau de la: zone de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Ce poteau tomba sur le pied d'un pi\u00e9ton, Paul-Emile Desjardins, alors engag\u00e9 dans l'intersection. Desjardins en fut gri\u00e8vement bless\u00e9.\nAction en dommages fut intent\u00e9e de la part de la victime contre les propri\u00e9taires et conducteurs de ces voitures. Gigu\u00e8re et St-Cyr produisirent une d\u00e9fense conjointe, et Consolidated Moulton Trimmings Limited et Blumberg, une d\u00e9fense s\u00e9par\u00e9e. Aucun d\u00e9fendeur n'imputa faute \u00e0 la victime. Propri\u00e9taire et conducteur de chaque voiture se rejet\u00e8rent mutuellement le bl\u00e2me.\nPar d\u00e9cision du 9 mars 1951, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure jugea les quatre d\u00e9fendeurs responsables et les condamna conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la victime, la somme de $7,941.26, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens. Etrang\u00e8re \u00e0 ce litige, la question de la proportion de responsabilit\u00e9 de chacun des d\u00e9fendeurs ne fut pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e. Aucun appel ne fut interjet\u00e9 de ce jugement qui emporta chose jug\u00e9e entre les parties sur les questions pertinentes \u00e0 l'instance.\nPar la suite, et apr\u00e8s avoir vainement cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 s'entendre avec leurs cod\u00e9fendeurs pour d\u00e9cider de la part contributive de chacun au paiement de la dette \u00e9tablie par jugement, les pr\u00e9sents appelants, Blumberg et Consolidated Moulton Trimmings Limited, y satisfirent int\u00e9gralement en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eats et frais et obtinrent, au m\u00eame temps, de la victime une subrogation dans les droits lui r\u00e9sultant de ce jugement.\nLes subrog\u00e9s firent alors \u00e9mettre un bref de saisie-arr\u00eat contre Gigu\u00e8re et St-Cyr et contre l'assureur de ces derniers, la pr\u00e9sente intim\u00e9e, Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company. Par ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9, ils ont recherch\u00e9 le remboursement de 50 pour cent du montant pay\u00e9 par eux en satisfaction totale du jugement.\nSur cette instance d'ex\u00e9cution de jugement, Gigu\u00e8re et St-Cyr ne produisirent aucune d\u00e9fense. L'assureur, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, plaida que les subrog\u00e9s ne pouvaient, par ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9, validement exercer les droits leur r\u00e9sultant du paiement de la dette et de la subrogation, et subsidiairement que la proportion de responsabilit\u00e9 des assur\u00e9s ne pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant de 50 pour cent. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure, \u00e9tant d'avis que la premi\u00e8re soumission de l'assureur \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e et d\u00e9cisive du litige, annula la saisie.\nPort\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut maintenu par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine2. Les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 furent d'opinion qu'en raison de l'inexistence de solidarit\u00e9 entre coauteurs de quasi-d\u00e9lit, de la possibilit\u00e9 d'une mesure in\u00e9gale dans la proportion de leur faute et, partant, de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la part contributive de chacun, en somme, de l'absence de chose jug\u00e9e sur la question, le cr\u00e9ancier subrog\u00e9 n'avait aucun jugement d\u00e9finitif lui permettant de recourir \u00e0 la saisie-arr\u00eat. De l\u00e0 le pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour.\nLa question qui se pr\u00e9sente est plus qu'une simple question de proc\u00e9dure. Il appara\u00eet bien, en effet, que le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par les appelants \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une saisie avant jugement en satisfaction d'une cr\u00e9ance non judiciairement et d\u00e9finitivement liquid\u00e9e mais par eux arbitrairement fix\u00e9e \u00e0 50 pour cent de la somme qu'ils ont pay\u00e9e avec subrogation.\nLes appelants, ainsi qu'il appert au fiat et au bref de saisie, invoquent ce jugement du 9 mars 1951 et leur qualit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9anciers subrog\u00e9s.\nLe jugement du 9 mars 1951 a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 un litige mu entre, d'une part, la victime du quasi-d\u00e9lit et, d'autre part, les cod\u00e9fendeurs poursuivis, et non un litige entre les cod\u00e9fendeurs condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement qui aurait eu pour objet la d\u00e9termination de la gravit\u00e9 de la faute de chacun pour \u00e9tablir, entre eux, leur part contributive. La d\u00e9termination de la proportion de responsabilit\u00e9 de chacun des d\u00e9fendeurs n'est d'aucune pertinence dans cette action o\u00f9 Desjardins a recherch\u00e9 contre eux une condamnation conjointe et solidaire. C'est l\u00e0 un d\u00e9bat auquel ce dernier est \u00e9tranger et \u00e0 la poursuite duquel il n'avait pas d'ailleurs l'int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour former une demande en justice, l'art. 1106 C.C. d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant d\u00e9j\u00e0 la solidarit\u00e9 d'une obligation r\u00e9sultant d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit. Comme l'a signal\u00e9 notre coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Taschereau, dans City of Montreal real v. The King3, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui existe dans ces provinces de droit commun o\u00f9 un texte l'autorise, le Juge, adjugeant sur la r\u00e9clamation d'une victime contre les coauteurs d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit, ne d\u00e9termine pas la proportion de responsabilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9fendeurs. En somme, le jugement du 9 mars 1951 a affirm\u00e9 l'obligation solidaire des cod\u00e9fendeurs \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la victime le montant des dommages lui r\u00e9sultant du quasi-d\u00e9lit. Rien de plus. Entre cod\u00e9fendeurs, cette obligation se divise de plein droit et, entre eux, ils n'en sont tenus que chacun pour sa part. (Article 1117 C.C). Il reste que cette part, qui s'appr\u00e9cie suivant la gravit\u00e9 respective des fautes causales de chacun, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9, et ne pouvait, dans cette instance entre la victime et les d\u00e9fendeurs par elle poursuivis, \u00eatre judiciairement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e.\nLe paiement et la subrogation n'ont pas modifi\u00e9 cette conclusion sur l'absence de chose jug\u00e9e sur la question. En donnant \u00e0 la victime int\u00e9gralement satisfaction au jugement du 9 mars 1951, les appelants ont acquitt\u00e9 une dette au paiement int\u00e9gral de laquelle ils \u00e9taient personnellement tenus \u00e0 son endroit. Cod\u00e9biteurs de cette dette solidaire, par eux pay\u00e9e en entier, ils ne peuvent r\u00e9p\u00e9ter contre les saisis que les parts et portions de chacun d'eux, encore m\u00eame qu'en payant, ils furent sp\u00e9cialement subrog\u00e9s aux droits de la victime. (Article 1118 C.C.)\nAu soutien de leur pr\u00e9tention qu'il y a eu chose jug\u00e9e, les appelants argumentent comme suit:\u2014La solidarit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par l'art. 1106 C.C. relativement \u00e0 l'obligation r\u00e9sultant d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit est, tout comme la solidarit\u00e9 conventionnelle, une solidarit\u00e9 parfaite et non, comme l'affirme Migneault, une solidarit\u00e9 imparfaite. Dans le cas de solidarit\u00e9 parfaite, la dette se divise de plein droit entre cod\u00e9biteurs par parts viriles, c'est-\u00e0-dire par parts \u00e9gales, \u00e0 moins que la Cour n'assigne diff\u00e9rents degr\u00e9s de responsabilit\u00e9. C'est que la loi pr\u00e9sume entre ces cod\u00e9biteurs l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des parts de responsabilit\u00e9. Le jugement du 9 mars 1951 n'ayant pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9somption par l'assignation de parts diff\u00e9rentes, emporte chose jug\u00e9e sur la question et, partant, la saisie a \u00e9t\u00e9 validement pratiqu\u00e9e en ex\u00e9cution de ce jugement.\nLa jurisprudence a toujours reconnu que, lorsque plusieurs personnes ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un quasi-d\u00e9lit, bien que toutes soient responsables pour le tout envers la victime, entre elles la responsabilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e selon l'\u00e9tendue et la gravit\u00e9 de leur faute respective. Dans le cas de solidarit\u00e9 conventionnelle, effet sera donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intention de ceux qui se sont oblig\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement envers le cr\u00e9ancier, en ce qui concerne le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 entre eux. Cette intention pourra \u00eatre exprim\u00e9e ou \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e en raison des termes ou de la nature de la convention ou des rapports existant entre les cod\u00e9biteurs. Mais dans le cas de l'obligation \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le dommage caus\u00e9 accidentellement par plusieurs personnes, il n'est pas concevable que ces personnes, n'ayant pas eu l'intention de causer de dommage, aient eu celle d'\u00e9tablir des proportions entre elles pour le r\u00e9parer. Assumant, cependant, qu'il faille, en ce cas, pr\u00e9sumer qu'entre elles la proportion de responsabilit\u00e9 et la part contributive \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration doivent se diviser par parts \u00e9gales, le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'une pr\u00e9somption qui peut \u00eatre repouss\u00e9e et ce dans une instance o\u00f9 la question se pr\u00e9sente et peut \u00eatre judiciairement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Tel n'est pas, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le caract\u00e8re de l'instance donnant lieu au jugement du 9 mars 1951 lequel, comme en a jug\u00e9 la Cour du banc de la reine, ne saurait constituer, sur la question, un jugement d\u00e9finitif en faveur des appelants leur permettant de recourir \u00e0 la saisie-arr\u00eat.\nJe renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the appellants: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron & Monet, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the respondent: Howard, Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que.

Although the' defendant did not reside or have any place of business in Quebec, the action was taken in that Province on the ground that the defendant had assets there. The trial judge dismissed the declinatory exception to the jurisdiction, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court where the defendant moved to quash on the ground that the judgment appealed from was not a \"final judgment\" within the terms of ss. 2(b) and 36 of the Supreme Court Act.\nHeld: The motion to quash should be dismissed.\nThe judgment allowing a declinatory exception and dismissing the action having finally disposed of the plaintiff's action, was a final judgment within the terms of the Supreme Court Act.

Levitsky, contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014Appellant's claim against respondent arises out of certain agreements alleged to have been entered into between the parties, in Italy and in the United States. Neither party resides in or has any place of business in the Province of Quebec. In its action, however, appellant alleged that the Superior Court has jurisdiction under art. 94, sub-para. 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure by reason of the fact that respondent has assets in the province. Respondent made a declinatory exception to the action on the ground that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction, and that exception was dismissed by the learned trial judge. His judgment was unanimously reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench2 and appellant's action dismissed with costs. From that judgment appellant has appealed to this Court.\nRespondent has moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment maintaining the declinatory exception and dismissing appellant's action is not a final judgment within the terms of ss. 36 and 2(b) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, the relevant portions of which read:\n36. Subject to sections 40 and 44, an appeal to the Supreme Court lies from a final judgment or a judgment granting a motion for a nonsuit or directing a new trial of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, pronounced in\n(a) a judicial proceeding where the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal exceeds ten thousand dollars, or\n(b).............................\n2. In this Act,\n(a)..............................\n(b) \"final judgment\" means any judgment, rule, order or decision that determines in whole or in part any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial proceeding.\nThe judgment a quo has finally disposed of appellant's action. No doubt any rights which appellant may have, might be asserted in another action in a foreign jurisdiction, but that does not affect the character of the judgment under appeal.\nWe are all of opinion that the judgment allowing a declinatory exception and dismissing the action is a final judgment within the terms of the Supreme Court Act.\nThat was the view taken by this Court in Ripstein v. Trower3, where the judgment maintaining a declinatory exception in the lower Courts, was successfully appealed to this Court. A motion to quash was rejected and the action was subsequently proceeded with on the merits. The judgment on the motion to quash is not reported, but it was subsequently referred to with approval in Fiset v. Morin4. The motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: N. A.

By an elaborate fabrication, including the fabrication of minutes of meetings that never took place, the forgery of a cheque in the name of the company by the appellants and the sale of shares without the knowledge of the optionee, the company was fraudulently deprived of $960,000 from its bank account. All documents purporting to be signed by the company were signed by two of the appellants representing themselves as president and treasurer and the corporate seal was used where necessary. The convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeal, and the appellants obtained leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The convictions should be quashed.\nThe real case for the Crown was that the appellants stole the cheque, but the verdict of the jury indicated that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the cheque was an integral and necessary part of an elaborate scheme of fraud to which the appellants were parties and that none of the appellants could have thought that the company had given its consent.\nIt was implicit in the findings of the jury that the cheque was a false document, known to be false by the parties to this scheme and made with the intent that it was to be used or acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of the company.

The fact that the name of the company was fraudulently inscribed on the cheque, and that loss might result to the company, did not vest in the company any proprietary rights or special property or interest therein. It would be creating a new and strange mode of acquisition of property to hold that if A\u2019s signature is forged by B on a document, A for that sole reason could as owner recover that document from B. Possession of the cheque was not at any material time that of the company. It was the possession of those who created it to defraud the company. Therefore the cheque could not have been stolen.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the appellants convictions on a charge of theft of a cheque. Appeals allowed.\nG.A. Martin, Q.C., for the appellant Smith.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellant Schonbrun.\nG. McLean, for the appellant Stuart.\nS.R. Ranch, in person.\nPeter White, Q.C., and R. Shibley, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014Pursuant to leave granted by this Court, under s. 597(1) (b) Cr.C., the appellants appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal from their conviction on the first of several counts contained in the indictment preferred against them. The Crown had elected to proceed on this count. As amended at the close of the case for the prosecution, by the insertion of the words here italicized, this count reads as follows:\nthat Ben Smith, D. Charles Stuart, Stanley I. Schonbrun, Sol R. Rauch and Harold D. Rauch during the year 1957, at the City of Toronto in the County of York and elsewhere, did steal money and securities or other property or a valuable security to the value of $960,000 more or less, the property of Brilund Mines Limited, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nThe case for the Crown is not that these accused stole money or securities which were the property of Brilund Mines Limited. In essence, the case is that these appellants, by an elaborate fabrication, obtained for their own use and benefit the sum of $960,000 from the company\u2019s bank account. Stuart obtained a blank cheque at the counter of the Bay Street Branch of the Imperial Bank in Toronto and filled in the body of the cheque, payable to his order, for $960,000. Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch signed the cheque representing themselves on its face as president and treasurer of the company. On May 1, 1957, this cheque was deposited to the credit of Stuart\u2019s bank account at the above-mentioned branch of the Imperial Bank. The real case for the Crown is that the appellants stole this cheque.\nThese dealings are recited at length in the address of the learned trial judge to the jury and in the reasons for judgment delivered by Laidlaw J.A., for the Court of Appeal. As full a recital, however, is unnecessary for the understanding of the questions of law to be considered on this appeal. A simple and, I think, a true outline of the case for the prosecution will sufficiently emerge from the following summary of the interdependent and interlocked transactions carried out by the appellants and their ultimate result, all of which happened within the four days from April 29 to May 2, 1957.\nPrior to April 29, out of the 2,800,000 shares of the company issued and outstanding in the hands of some 1,800 shareholders, the appellant Ben Smith, with his brother Harry, owned or controlled 600,000 shares, of which 300,000 were in escrow. The market price of the company\u2019s shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange had been steadily declining for some time and was about 47 cents per share. At that price the total value of 600,000 shares was below $300,000. The company had a credit balance of $577,000 in its account at the King and York Streets Branch of the Imperial Bank in Toronto and a readily marketable block of shares in New Chamberlain Petroleum Company Limited and Spooner Oils Limited. The company had granted to Chapco Investments Corporation irrevocable and still exercisable options to purchase these shares. The exercise of the options would bring in $455,000 and thus increase the company\u2019s credit balance to over one million dollars.\nThe appellant Stuart, a resident of North Bay, Ontario, had for some years dealt in mining claims and was at that time the owner of 21 unpatented mining claims acquired by him within the year at a cost of $5,800 which, on the submission of the Crown, represented the maximum value of these claims.\nKnowing that Ben Smith had considered selling his interest in the company, Stuart sought and obtained the confirmation that the \u201cBrilund deal\u201d was still available. With the assistance of two \u201cfinders\u201d, he then invited to Toronto the two appellants Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch and the brother of the latter, Harold Rauch, who were all three associated in a company called Capital Funding Corporation, with offices in New York State. Upon their arrival in Toronto on April 30, these three were introduced to Smith and within 48 hours the following interlocked and interdependent transactions were arranged and completed:\n(i) A sale by Smith of the 600,000 share \u201ccontrol block\u201d in the company to Stuart or his associates or both for a price of $900,000, which was three times their indicated value on the stock exchange. For the payment of this price, Stuart, who had a credit balance of $16 in his account at the Bay Street Branch of the Imperial Bank in Toronto, drew a cheque on that account for $900,000 payable to the order of Ben Smith. He and Sol R. Rauch arranged with Udell, the Manager of that Branch, to certify this cheque but not to deliver it until he had in his possession a cheque for $960,000 expected by Stuart as a result of the transaction mentioned in the next paragraph (ii) and a cheque for $1,010,000 which the company was to draw in its favour on the completion of the transaction set out in paragraph (iii) in order to transfer its bank account from the King and York Streets Branch to the Bay Street Branch.\n(ii) A sale by Stuart to the company of his 21 unpatented mining claims, having a maximum value of $5,800 for the price of $960,000. In payment for these claims, the cheque which is the subject-matter of the amended count of the indictment was issued. Dated May 1, 1957, it was drawn on the new account of the company at the Bay Street Branch of the Bank in the amount of $960,000, made payable to the order of Stuart and signed for the company by Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch, purporting to act as president and treasurer.\n(iii) A sale by the company to Ben Smith of the Chamberlain and Spooner shares for $460,856. Carried out without the knowledge of the Chapco Investments Corporation, which had options on these shares, this sale was made on the condition that, in the event of the exercise of the options, Smith would surrender the shares to the optionee and be repaid by the company the amount paid by him for their acquisition. This cheque for $460,356, issued by Smith in favour of the company, was given by him to Findlay, his bank manager, with instructions that it was to be used only if the sale of the 600,000 shares was completed. Subsequently deposited to the King and York Streets Branch account of the company, this cheque increased the credit balance of the company\u2019s account to $1,010,000 before that account was transferred to the Bay Street Branch.\nThese transactions were all interlocked and mutually dependent. Stuart\u2019s cheque for $900,000 could only be paid if the company\u2019s cheque to his order for $960,000 was deposited to his credit. The company\u2019s cheque to Stuart for $960,000 could only be paid if the credit balance of $577,000 in the company\u2019s bank account was sufficiently increased. This increase could only be achieved by the deposit to the company\u2019s account of the cheque for $460,356 issued by Smith in favour of the company in payment of the Chamberlain and Spooner shares; and Smith\u2019s cheque could not be used until the sale by him of his 600,000 shares was completed.\nAll documents purporting to be signed by the company were signed by Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch representing themselves as its president and treasurer. The corporate seal of the company was used wherever it was found necessary. However, on the submission of the Crown, the minutes of the meetings purporting to have been held on May 1, 1957 and recording the election of Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch as directors and as president and treasurer of the company, the banking or other resolutions purporting to authorize them to sign for the company in the capacity aforesaid, and all documents wherein the veracity of these facts was represented, were false documents fabricated by the appellants for the attainment of their dishonest purpose.\nThe ultimate result of all these transactions, as related in respondent\u2019s factum, was that Ben Smith received $900,000 from Stuart for the sale of 600,000 shares of the company, half of which were in escrow; Stuart received 200,000 shares of the company, half of which were in escrow and retained about $4,000 cash in his bank account; Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch or Capital Funding Corporation received 400,000 shares of the company of which 200,000 were in escrow, together with $6,000 in United States funds; and each of the two \u201cfinders\u201d received $25,000. All the moneys thus distributed were derived from the $960,000 obtained from the company in exchange for the 21 unpatented mining claims of Stuart, valued at $5,800.\nSuch, in the main, are the facts relied on by the prosecution,\u2014and which, for the purpose of this appeal, are assumed to have been found by the jury\u2014as justifying in law the verdict of guilty returned against the appellants on the charge of having stolen the cheque for $960,000, the property of the company.\nTwo of the questions raised at the trial and on appeal were whether this cheque was the property of the company or whether the company had any special property or interest in it notwithstanding that its signatories had no authority to issue or deliver the same. With respect to these questions, the learned trial judge gave the following instructions to the jury:\nNow, I have explained the difference between the former indictment and the present indictment, and I have explained that you cannot convict any accused for stealing money or securities. All that is open to you now is to convict or acquit with respect to stealing other property or a valuable security, the property of Brilund.\nThe charge, \u201ca valuable security to the value of $960,000 more or less, the property of Brilund\u2026\u201d would certainly include the cheque for $960,000, Exhibit 49. If you have any doubt about that, it seems to me to be concluded by another provision of the Criminal Code which reads in this way, in part:\n\u201cIn this Act\u2026\u201d\nThat is, in the Criminal Code,\n\u201ca valuable security includes an\norder for the payment of money.\u201d Now, the second point is this: did Brilund have any special property or interest in that cheque? If you find that Schonbrun and Sol Rauch signed that particular cheque purporting to act for Brilund, even without the authority of Brilund, then I tell you that Brilund did have a special property or interest in it before it was delivered to Stuart for negotiation. If you decide they signed it in furtherance of a dishonest purpose, they were not acting as officers for Brilund but in their own personal interests; but even so, Brilund would have a special interest in that cheque, if for no other purpose, to try to get it back before it was cashed. In any event, between the time the cheque was signed and when it was handed over to Udell or Stuart it was in the possession of Brilund, and that possession would be a special interest within the Code.\u201d\nOn appeal and with reference to the same matter, Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Court, said:\nIt was contended first that the signatures Stanley I. Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch on the cheque for $960,000 in favour of D. Charles Stuart were forgeries and that their acts in signing the cheque did not constitute a corporate act of the company; in other words there was no issue or delivery of the cheque in question by the company as a corporate body; that the paper bearing the forged signatures Stanley I. Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch was not a \u201cvaluable security\u201d within the meaning of that word as defined in sec. 2(42) of the Criminal Code as follows:\n\u201ca\u2026order\u2026for the payment of money.\u201d I do not accept that argument. In my opinion, Schonbrun and Rauch signed the cheque as officers of the company with ostensible authority and thereafter the cheque became a valuable security and the property of the company. Even if it be assumed that Schonbrun and Rauch had no authority in law or in fact to sign the cheque, nevertheless, in my opinion and in the opinion of the learned trial Judge, the company had a special property or interest in it and which could be the subject of theft.\nThe questions of law upon which leave to appeal to this Court was granted are:\n1. Did the trial judge err in holding that Brilund Mines Limited did not consent to the issue and delivery of the cheque for $960,000, or, alternatively, did he err in holding that the cheque was nevertheless the property of Brilund Mines Limited?\n2. Did the trial judge err in holding that there was no contract between Brilund Mines Limited and Stuart for the transfer of the twenty-one mining claims?\n3. Did the trial judge err in holding that Brilund Mines Limited had a special property or interest in the cheque, notwithstanding that the signatories to the cheque had no authority to issue and deliver the same?\n4. Did the trial judge err in instructing the jury that the interest of the corporation in seeing the cheque was not cashed constituted a special property or interest in the cheque?\nI find it necessary to deal only with the two questions whether the learned trial judge erred in holding, and instructing the jury, that the cheque for $960,000 was the property of the company or that the company had a special property or interest therein. With the greatest deference to the learned judges of the two Courts below, my opinion is that there was error in both these instructions to the jury. On the directions given to the jury as to each of the essential elements of the offence of theft and as to the various circumstances in which a person may be held to be a party to a criminal offence, the verdict of the jury against the four appellants indicates that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the cheque was an integral and necessary part of an elaborate scheme of fraud to which all appellants were parties and that none of the appellants could have thought that the company gave a corporate consent to the purchase of these mining claims for $960,000 or to the signing and delivery of the cheque purporting in appearance to be given in payment thereof. These findings, involving each of the appellants as particeps criminis in this fraudulent and indivisible scheme, constitute the background against which must be considered the two questions of law to be determined.\nOn the definition of theft given in s. 269 Cr.C., a thing cannot be said to have been stolen unless it appears that the thing was taken or converted\n\u2026with intent to deprive\u2026the owner of it or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it.\nThe special property or interest, like the property itself, must be in the very thing alleged to have been stolen. The interest a person may have in protecting himself against loss or damage resulting from the use of a document forged by and in the possession of another is neither property nor \u201cspecial property or interest\u201d in the forged document. It is also clear from the section that the property or the \u201cspecial property or interest\u201d must exist at the time at which the theft, either by taking or conversion, is committed.\nIt is implicit in the findings of the jury that this cheque purporting to have been made by the company was a false document (s. 268-e Cr.C.), known to be false by the parties to this fraudulent scheme and made with the intent that it was to be used or acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of the company. On these findings this cheque was a forgery (s. 309 Cr.C.). The company did not have any ownership or special property or interest in the blank cheque picked up by Stuart at the public counter of the bank; nor could it have any immediately prior to the instant at which, after signing it, Schonbrun and Sol R. Rauch delivered it to Stuart. The company acquired no property and no \u201cspecial property or interest\u201d in this cheque while it was under the control of any of the parties to this fabrication nor upon its delivery by Stuart to Udell. The fact that the name of the company was fraudulently inscribed on this cheque in the circumstances and for the purposes aforesaid, and that loss might result to the company, does not vest in the company any proprietary rights or special property or interest therein. It would be creating a new and strange mode of acquisition of property to hold that if A\u2019s signature is forged by B on a document, A, for that sole reason, could, as owner, recover that document from B. Had the appellants elected to destroy the cheque before handing it over to Udell or had Udell destroyed it upon its receipt, nothing whatever could be held to have been lost to the company or stolen from it. Possession of this cheque was not at any material time that of the company. It was the possession of those who created it to defraud the company. Possession of this cheque was never entrusted to them by the company. And if it was not entrusted to them by the company, they could not, while having it under their control, steal it by conversion any more than by taking.\nIn The King v. Phipoe[2], it was decided that to obtain from a person his note of hand, by threats, is not a felonious stealing of the note, for the reason that the note was never of value to or in the peaceable possession of such person.\nBeing of the view that the two questions of law extracted from the points on which leave to appeal was given and set out above must be answered in the affirmative and that there was no taking or conversion of this cheque by the appellants, I would allow the appeals, quash the convictions and direct a verdict of acquittal to be entered on count (1) of the indictment and the record to be returned to the Clerk of Assize of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Toronto.\nAppeals allowed, convictions quashed.\n[1] (1961), 131 C.C.C. 14.\n[2] (1796), 2 Leach 673, 168 E.R. 438.\n"}

Its declared object was to assist in providing funds for the payment of pensions to employees and ex-employees of the Woodward's Stores Ltd. and to pay over its surplus funds from time to time to the trustee of a pension fund for those employees and ex-employees. For this purpose, it was authorized to acquire shares of the Woodward Stores Ltd. and to sell them to the employees. It purchased at par large blocks of shares in the various Woodward Stores and re-sold them at par to employees. It paid interest at the rate of 3 per cent. on the unpaid balance of its subscriptions for shares, but charged interest at 4 per cent. to those employees who did not pay in full upon their purchases of shares. This difference in the rate of interest which it paid and which it charged contributed to the building up of a substantial surplus, which in 1953 amounted to some $31,000.\nThe appellant objected to paying income tax on that amount on the ground that it was exempt as a non-profit organization under s. 62(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act, maintaining that it was a society organized and operated exclusively for a purpose \"except profit\". The appellant also argued that the net interest it received should not be treated as income in its hands since it was impressed with an obligation that it be devoted to payment to the pension trust for distribution as pensions. It further argued that it was merely a trustee of its surplus fund in favour of the pension trust. An appeal to the Exchequer Court was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appellant society was not entitled to an exemption under s. 62(1)(i) of the Act, since it did not meet the requirements of that section. The appellant had entirely failed to establish that it was organized and operated exclusively for a purpose other than profit and the findings of the Exchequer Court that it was both organized and operated for a profitable purpose were unassailable.\nThe income received by the appellant was its own income, not subject to the legal claim of any other person. After receipt it was applied by the appellant in accordance with its stated objects. Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v. Lucas (1882-3), 8 App. Cas. 891, followed. The incorporating instrument and by-laws of the appellant did not constitute a declaration of trust but were merely a statement of objects and purposes. There was no income of a trust during the taxation year payable to a beneficiary or other person beneficially entitled.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thorson P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming the Minister's decision, Appeal dismissed.\nH. H. Stikeman, Q.C., and D. N. Thorsteinsson, for the appellant.\nF. J. Cross and P. M. Troop, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Judson J.:\u2014The appellant was incorporated in 1945 as a society under the Societies Act of British Columbia. Its declared object on incorporation was to assist in providing funds for the payment of pensions to employees and ex-employees of Woodward Stores Limited and to pay over its surplus funds from time to time to the trustees of a pension fund for those employees and ex-employees. For the purpose of achieving its object, it was authorized to acquire, by purchase, gift or otherwise, shares of Woodward Stores Limited and to sell these shares and take options for their repurchase.\nThe by-laws of the society provided that the directors might borrow money on behalf of the society to pay for the shares purchased and that on dissolution of the society all its assets should be conveyed to the trustees of the pension fund for the purposes of their trust.\nUntil October 1951 the funds for the pensions were provided by the Woodward Store companies, of which there were a number. Until 1945 the administration of these pension payments was through the various companies with: a pension committee comprised of company executives. After 1945 the administration was through the Woodward Pension Plan Trust. The Woodward Pension Plan Trust was set up at the same time as the appellant society.\nBefore the incorporation of the appellant and the constitution of the pension trust, the various Woodward stores had operated a share sale plan to their employees. After 1945 this plan was taken over by the appellant society. It was incorporated, in part at least, for this purpose. It carried out its objects in this way. It purchased at par large blocks of shares in the various Woodward stores and then resold them at par to employees. The appellant paid interest at the rate of 3 per cent. on the unpaid balance of subscriptions but it charged interest at 4 per cent. to the employees on their unpaid balances. This difference in the rate of interest which it paid and which it charged contributed to the building up of a substantial surplus. Other contributing factors were dividends received from the shares on hand and capital gains made on the reorganization of some of the companies whose shares it held. In the period from October 1, 1951, to January 31, 1952, the appellant paid over to the pension trust a total of $13,089.30 and in the 12 months period ending January 31, 1953, it paid over to the same trust the sum of $42,273.23.\nThe dealings in shares of the appellant are set out in some detail in the judgment under appeal but to show the scale of these dealings it is enough to state that in the eight fiscal periods from the date of incorporation to January 31, 1953, it sold 599,272 shares to employees and repurchased 263,593. In the 1953 taxation year, 66,931 shares were sold and 31,630 were repurchased. No shares were ever sold without taking an option to repurchase at par on death or the cessation of employment.\nIn the 1953 taxation year, the year in question in this appeal, the appellant received in interest $31,525.58 and from dividends, $35,954.17, making a total of $67,479.75. From this income the Minister, in his notice of reassessment, allowed the following deductions:\n(a) $22.30 for sundry expenses;\n(b) $35,954.17, being an amount equivalent to the dividends that the appellant had received from taxable corporations in Canada.\nHe did not allow as a deduction in computing income the amount of $42,273.23 which the appellant had paid to the pension trust and which the appellant described in its statement as pensions paid.\nThe appellant objected to the notice of reassessment but it was confirmed by the Minister. The appellant then appealed to the Exchequer Court2. Its appeal failed and it now appeals to this Court. The first ground of error submitted is that the appellant was exempt from income tax in its taxation year 1953 under the provisions of s. 62(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148. This section reads:\n62(1) No tax is payable under this part upon the taxable income of a person for a period when that person was\n(i) a club, society or association organized and operated exclusively for social welfare, civic improvement, pleasure or recreation or for any other purpose except profit, no part of the income of which was payable to, or was otherwise available for the personal benefit of, any proprietor, member or shareholder thereof.\nThe sole question under this section is whether the appellant was a society \"organized and operated \u2026 for any other purpose except profit\". The judgment of the Exchequer Court under appeal holds that the appellant had failed to bring itself within that subsection. The learned President found that the purpose for the organization of the appellant was a very limited one, namely, to earn money for the purpose of providing funds for the payment of pensions by the pension trust and that this was achieved by profitable dealings in the shares of the various Woodward stores.\nIt is true that the appellant is not an ordinary commercial company but a society incorporated under the Societies Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 265, that no part of the appellant's property is payable to or otherwise available for the personal benefit of any proprietor, member or shareholder, and that the appellant was organized for the stated object and purpose of assisting in the provision of funds for pensions to be paid to employees and ex-employees of the stores. Nevertheless, this last-named purpose could not be achieved without the share sale plan which was designed to make a profit to enable the payments to be made to the pension trustees. In the taxation year in question the appellant earned in interest alone the sum of $31,525.58, a sum which went a long way towards the payments which were made to the pension trustees. The appellant has entirely failed to establish that it was organized and operated exclusively for a purpose other than profit and the findings of the learned President that it was both organized and operated for a profitable purpose are unassailable. This ground of appeal therefore fails.\nThe next ground of appeal is that the net interest received by the appellant in the taxation year was not income in its hands because it was not received beneficially since it was impressed with an obligation that it be devoted to payment to the pension trust for distribution as pensions. I have some difficulty in understanding the nature of the obligation, short of a trust, which the appellant sought to establish. The argument was based on K. B. S. Robertson Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue3; Phyllis Bouck v. Minister of National Revenue4; and Minister of National Revenue v. St. Catharine's Flying Training School Limited5. These cases do not support the appellant's submission. The first case involved receipts which could only be retained for the use of the taxpayer if subsequent events permitted their retention. Until these events happened, the receipts were not income. In the other two cases, the monies which it was sought to tax were received in trust for payment to others. There is nothing analogous in any of these cases to the terms on which the appellant received its income. The income received by the appellant was its own income, not subject to the legal claim of any other person. After receipt it was applied by the appellant in accordance with its stated objects. The learned President rightly held that the case was within the principle of Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v. Lucas6.\nThe third ground of appeal can scarcely be distinguished from the second ground. The second ground speaks of a receipt impressed with an obligation to pay it to the pension trustees. In the third ground it is urged that the appellant was a trustee of its surplus funds in favour of the pension trust and is entitled by s. 63(4) and (7) to deduct what otherwise would be its taxable income for 1953, the amount in fact paid in that taxation year to the pension trust as beneficiary. This argument is not mentioned in the reasons of the learned President and we were told that it was not submitted to him. In my opinion, it fails along with the other two arguments. One cannot construct such a trust of the surplus funds out of the instrument incorporating the society and its by-laws. There was, in the first place, no trust of the shares in which the appellant dealt by purchase and sale and by holding. If the incorporating instrument and the by-laws remain unchanged, the surplus funds are to be paid over in a certain way from time to time and the assets on a dissolution of the society are to be distributed in the same way. But this does not establish a trust. There is no obligation to make any payments which would enable the pension trust to assert a claim that the appellant's income was the income of the pension trust. The income might accumulate indefinitely. In fact, no payments were made to the pension trust during the period 1945 to 1951 when the appellant was building up a surplus. The society might never be dissolved, the objects might be changed, and the by-laws changed.\nMy conclusion is that the incorporating instrument and by-laws do not constitute a declaration of trust but are merely a statement of objects and purposes. There was no income of a trust during the taxation year in question payable to a beneficiary or other person beneficially entitled and the appeal fails on this ground also.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stikeman & Elliott, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

Appeals\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Criminal law\u2014Appeal by Attorney General limited to pure question of law\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 598.\nThe accused was charged with the offence of robbery under s. 288(b) of the Criminal Code and was convicted as charged. The Court of Queen's Bench reached the conclusion that he was not guilty of robbery, and, exercising its power under s. 592(3) of the Code, found him guilty of unlawful possession under s. 296 in the view that this was an included or lesser offence to that of robbery. The indictment had contained a count for robbery only. The accused and the Attorney General were both granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The accused's appeal should be allowed and the conviction under s. 296 set aside; the appeal of the Attorney General should be quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nThe authorities do not hold that receiving stolen goods is included in the offence of robbery or theft, but merely that recent possession of stolen goods, if unexplained to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact, may be evidence of robbery or theft. A count in an indictment is divisible and where the commission of the offence charged includes the commission of another offence, the accused may be convicted of the offence so included if proven. Thus, a man charged with robbery may be found guilty of theft, but a person charged with robbery may not be found guilty of receiving stolen goods, as was done in this case, where the indictment contains a count for robbery alone. Receiving stolen goods is a less serious offence, but is not included in a charge of robbery. R. v. Louie Yee (1929), 1 W.W.R. 882, applied.\nAs to the appeal of the Attorney General since the appeal was based on a mixed question of law and fact and not on a pure question of law, this Court was without jurisdiction to entertain it.\nAPPEALS by the accused and the Attorney General from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, substituting a conviction of unlawful possession for that of robbery. Appeal of accused allowed; appeal of Attorney-General quashed.\nR. Daoust, Q.C., for the accused.\nBruno J. Pateras, for the Attorney-General.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014The appellant Fergusson was charged as follows under s. 288 (b) of the Criminal Code:\nWilliam Fergusson, en la cit\u00e9 d'Outremont, district de Montr\u00e9al, le ou vers le 28 juillet 1959, a ill\u00e9galement vol\u00e9 Gustave St-Germain de billets de banque, des effets de commerce et 120 coffrets de s\u00fbret\u00e9, le tout d'une valeur d'environ $50,000.00, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Banque Provinciale du Canada, et en m\u00eame temps ou imm\u00e9diatement avant ou apr\u00e8s ledit William Fergusson de s'\u00eatre port\u00e9 \u00e0 des actes de violence contre ledit Gustave St-Germain, commettant par l\u00e0 un vol qualifi\u00e9, un acte criminel, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 288 (b) du Code Criminel. Section 288 (b) of the Criminal Code reads as follows:\n288. Every one commits a robbery who\n(b) steals from any person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person,\nThe case was heard in Montreal before His Honour Judge M. A. Blain of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace, who found the accused guilty, and sentenced him to be detained in the St. Vincent de Paul Penitentiary for a period of eight years.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench2 reached the conclusion that Fergusson was not guilty of robbery, but found him guilty under s. 296 of the Criminal Code, which is to the effect that every one commits an offence who has anything in his possession knowing that it was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The Court decided that receiving is an included or a lesser offence to that of robbery, and that under s. 592, para. 3, of the Criminal Code, it could substitute the verdict that in its opinion should have been found and affirm the sentence passed by the trial judge or impose a sentence that is warranted in law.\nIt is the contention of the appellant Fergusson that the offence of which the Court of Queen's Bench found him guilty is not an offence included in the offence of robbery, and that the Court had no power to substitute a verdict of that kind for the one that was set aside by the Court itself. It is therefore submitted that the appellant should be acquitted.\nIn the Court of Queen's Bench Mr. Justice Casey relied on Duplessis v. The King3, to support the view that an offence must be regarded as being included in another, if the elements of the latter include those of the former. For the same proposition, Mr. Justice Choquette cited Baker v. Regem4; Rex v. Loughlin5; Rex v. Seymour6; Rex v. Siggins7. In Duplessis v. Regem, the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec ruled that obtaining money under false pretence is of the same nature as theft, and that it is an included offence, the only difference being the means adopted for committing the offence.\nIn Baker v. Regem, it was held that possession by the accused shortly after a burglary of goods, stolen at the time of the burglary, if unexplained, is sufficient to warrant a conviction of burglary or theft.\nIn Rex v. Loughlin, the Court of Criminal Appeal of England held that where it is proved that premises have been broken into and property stolen therefrom, and that very soon after the breaking the prisoner has been found in possession of that property, it was open to the jury to find the prisoner guilty of breaking and entering, and the jury should be so directed. The Court of Criminal Appeal in The King v. Seymour applied the Loughlin case.\nIn Rex v. Siggins, the Ontario Court of Appeal reached the conclusion that the offence of theft, where the person charged is the actual thief, necessarily involves the taking of possession by him of the articles stolen, and the person found in possession of goods which he himself has stolen, has also committed the offence of having in his possession goods knowing them to have been stolen. The Crown of course is entitled to lay both charges against him. If the jury convict of theft, they should not convict on the charge of unlawful possession. If, however, they acquit on the charge of theft, they may then consider and, if they see fit to do so, convict on the other charge. It must be kept in mind that in Siggins the accused was charged on two counts, one of theft and the other of unlawful possession.\nThese judgments do not hold that receiving stolen goods is included in the offence of robbery or theft, but merely that recent possession of stolen goods, if unexplained, to the satisfaction of the tribunal of fact, may be evidence of robbery or theft. In Seymour it was held that there should be two counts where the evidence is as consistent with larceny as with receiving, and that the jury should be directed that it is for them to decide whether the prisoner was the thief or whether he received a property from the thief, and should be reminded that a man cannot receive property from himself. In the present case, there was only one count in the indictment, and the charge was for robbery in violation of s. 288(b) of the Criminal Code. A count in an indictment is divisible and where the commission of the offence charged includes the commission of another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the accused may be convicted of an offence so included that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not proved, or of an attempt to commit an offence so included. (Criminal Code 569). Thus, a man charged with robbery may be found guilty of theft, but a person charged with robbery may not be found guilty of receiving stolen goods, as was held by the Court of Queen's Bench in the present instance. Receiving stolen goods is a less serious offence, but is not included in a charge of robbery.\nThe count must therefore include but not necessarily mention the commission of another offence, but the latter must be a lesser offence than the offence charged. The expression \"lesser offence\" is a \"part of an offence\" which is charged, and it must necessarily include some elements of the \"major offence\", but be lacking in some of the essentials, without which the major offence would be incomplete. Rex v. Louie Yee8.\nFergusson's appeal should therefore be allowed and the conviction against him set aside.\nAs to the appeal of the Attorney General who submits that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored and that the accused should be found guilty of robbery as charged, this Court has no jurisdiction to make such an order. On June 26, 1961, Fergusson was granted leave to appeal by this Court, and on the same date, the application of the Attorney General was also granted. In the latter case, Mr. Justice Fauteux was \"dubitante\" as to our jurisdiction but, nevertheless, leave was granted. Upon consideration and a review of the whole case, the appeal of the Attorney General must be quashed.\nThis Court has jurisdiction to entertain appeals by the Attorney General in criminal matters under s. 598 of the Code. But, it is only where a judgment of a Court of Appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under para. (a) of s. 583, or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to para. (a) of s. 584. Paragraph (a) of s. 598 states that it must necessarily be on a pure question of law, and here, I am of the opinion that the appeal of the Attorney General of Quebec is not based on a pure question of law, but on a mixed question of law and fact. The Court of Queen's Bench was not satisfied with the findings of the learned trial judge, particularly that the proof of identification and some other facts, while creating an atmosphere of suspicion, did not meet the test to which all circumstantial evidence must be put. Both Courts had to weigh the evidence. The trial judge found that there was direct and circumstantial evidence against the accused, sufficient to find him guilty of the offence as charged. The Court of Queen's Bench found that there was not.\nIn view of the decision of this Court in The King v. Wilmot9, it may be contended that this Court has no jurisdiction on the further ground that the accused having been found guilty by the Court of Queen's Bench of receiving stolen goods, was not acquitted within the meaning of s. 598 of the Criminal Code. He was of course acquitted of robbery, but found guilty of a different offence. However, in view of my conclusion that we are not faced with a pure question of law, it becomes immaterial to discuss this point any further.\nFergusson's appeal is therefore allowed, and the order of the Court of Queen's Bench and the conviction are set aside. The appeal of the Attorney General is quashed for want of jurisdiction.\nAppeal of accused allowed;\nAppeal of Attorney-General quashed.\nAttorney for the Attorney-General: J.

The trial judge held that the bribes had been offered, but dismissed the charges on the ground that there was no evidence that W had been appointed as an official in accordance with s. 104 of the Code. The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and found the accused guilty, as charged.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe finding of fact by the trial judge that the bribes had been offered having been unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal and being entirely consistent with the probabilities of the case, could not be disturbed.\nThe uncontradicted evidence of W that he was both the Chief Building Inspector and a municipal official, coupled with the description of his official activities contained in his own evidence and in that of the appellant, and which were appropriate to those of a person holding office within the dictionary sense of that term and under The City Act, R.S.C. 1955, c. 42, constituted prima facie evidence that he was a person who held office under the City of Calgary and was a municipal official within the meaning of s. 104 of the Code. It has been held on more than one occasion that evidence of a person acting in an official capacity raises a rebuttal presumption of his due appointment to that office. In this case there was not only evidence of W having performed the duties, but there was also direct evidence from W himself that he held the appointment and it was plain that the appellant recognized that he represented the city in an official capacity. There was evidence that the alleged bribes related to an official act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, reversing a judgment of Cairns J. and finding the accused guilty of having offered bribes. Appeal dismissed.\nJoseph Sedgwick, Q.C., and Robert H. Barron, Q.C., for the appellant. H. J. Wilson, Q.C., and R. P. Adolphe, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 allowing the appeal of the Crown from the judgment of Cairns J. whereby the present appellant had been acquitted of the following two charges:\n1. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary, on the 9th day of November, A.D. 1959, did offer to Lawrence Walker, Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary, a Municipal Official, the sum of $500 as consideration for the said official to fail to perform an official act, contrary to Section 104 of the Criminal Code.\n2. That he, at Calgary, in the Judicial District of Calgary, on the 22nd day of August, A.D. 1960, did offer to Lawrence Walker, Chief Building Inspector for the City of Calgary, a Municipal Official, the sum of $300 as consideration for the said official to fail to perform an official act, contrary to Section 104 of the Criminal Code.\nMr. Walker, who testified that during the years 1959-60 he held the position of Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary and was a municipal official, recounted two separate occasions upon which the appellant offered him money. The first incident took place on November 9, 1959, after Walker, in his capacity as Chief Building Inspector, had condemned a building owned by the appellant and one J. Singer; Walker states that at this time the appellant said to him:\nAllow this building to remain in occupancy for another year, and forget about the condemning order, and if you will so do I will give you $500.\nand that he then took some money out of his pocket and put it on the table between them. The second incident which took place on August 22, 1960, concerned an order issued by one of the building inspectors in Walker's department, notifying a \"builder-owner\" by the name of Korytko that a building on his property was being over-developed in contravention of a city by-law; in this regard Walker's best recollection of the relevant portion of his conversation with the appellant is that \"he asked me if I would overlook this over-development, and if I would overlook it he would give me $300.\" The appellant denied having made these offers, but the learned trial judge, having heard all of the evidence, expressed himself as follows:\nI have no doubt whatsoever on the facts of this case that the defendant offered the bribes alleged in the charges. It has been proved to me to a moral certainty and beyond reasonable doubt. There is no question about that at all. On that I accept the evidence of Mr. Walker, and I don't think I need to go any further; it follows that if I accept his evidence I do not accept other evidence.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant that because the learned trial judge acquitted him on the ground that there was no evidence that Mr. Walker had been appointed as an official in accordance with s. 104 of the Criminal Code, it, must, therefore, follow that the above-quoted finding was obiter and should be disregarded as having been intended to be \"a mere gratuitous rebuke to the appellant\". This finding is also attacked on the ground that no reasons are given for it and one of the grounds stated in the notice of appeal to this Court is that the Appellate Division erred in law in not holding that the trial judge had misdirected himself in determining the credibility of witnesses without considering whether or not the evidence of the witnesses whom he believed was in accordance with the probabilities of the case.\nIn my view the excerpt above-quoted from the decision of the learned trial judge constitutes a clear finding of fact for which it was unnecessary to give any other reason than his acceptance of the evidence of Walker. (See Lemay v. The King3). As this finding has been unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal and as it is, in my view, entirely consistent with the probabilities of the case, I do not think it can be disturbed.\nIn acquitting the appellant, the learned trial judge said:\nHowever, I feel the Crown has failed to prove that in the acts which Mr. Walker did, he was acting as an official in accordance with the terms of Section 104. An official is one, as Mr. McGillivray points out, who is appointed either by by-law or resolution of a city. There is no evidence before me that Mr. Walker has been so appointed, and unless he does these acts as \u00e0 person holding office under a municipal government, and the office is proven in the manner in which he is appointed, I think the charge must fail.\nIn setting aside the acquittals which were based on this finding, Macdonald J.A., speaking on behalf of the Appellate Division, held it to be \"abundantly proved that Walker was Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary\" and that as such he \"held an office under a municipal government, namely, the City of Calgary\". It followed from these conclusions that the Appellate Division found him to be \"a municipal official\" within the meaning of s. 104 of the Criminal Code, the relevant portions of which read as follows:\n104. (1) Every one who\n(a) gives, offers or agrees to give or offer to a municipal official, or\n(b) being a municipal official, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept from any person, a loan, reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for the official\n* * *\n(f) to perform or fail to perform an official act, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\n* * *\n104. (3) In this section \"municipal official\" means a member of a municipal council or a person who holds an office under a municipal government.\nIn conformity with the finding of the learned trial judge, it was urged on behalf of the appellant that there was no evidence that Walker was \"a municipal official\" within the meaning of this section or that either of the alleged offers of money related to \"an official act\". In support of this contention, it was said that the only evidence quoted by the Appellate Division as a basis for its finding that Walker was a municipal official was his affirmative answer to the question: \"Mr. Walker, during the year 1959 and during the year 1960 and up to the present moment, were you a municipal official?\" and that the finding cannot stand because this was an improper and leading question, the answer to which involved the very question of law which the trial court had to decide. I do not agree that this question and answer formed the basis for the finding of the Appellate Division, but in any event it is significant to note that no evidence was called to contradict this answer and that the first question and answer on Walker's cross-examination by appellant's counsel were:\nQ. Mr. Walker, you have been the Chief Building Inspector for a matter of some four years?\nA. That is correct.\nThis latter statement which is uncontradicted, when taken together with the extensive evidence illustrative of the manner in which Walker carried out his duties in the inspection of buildings, appears to me to fully justify the finding of the Court of Appeal that it is \"abundantly proved that Walker was the Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary\". That this evidence is of itself sufficient to support such a finding is shown by reference to R. v. Gordon4, Berryman v. Wise5 and other cases cited in Roscoe's Criminal Evidence, 16th ed., p. 11.\nCertainly Walker's own evidence that he had been Chief Building Inspector for some four years disposes of the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant to the effect that the fact of Walker having signed certain letters as \"Building Inspector\" simpliciter raised some doubts as to whether he held the office of Chief Building Inspector.\nIt is, however, stated in the appellant's factum and was strenuously argued on this appeal that the real issue in the present case\n\u2026 is not whether Walker was the Chief Building Inspector, but rather whether the Chief Building Inspector is a \"municipal official\" within the strict narrow meaning of that term as defined in sec. 104(3).\nThis resolves itself into the question of whether the Chief Building Inspector of the City of Calgary has been shown to be \"a person who holds office under a municipal government\" and this in turn depends in great degree on the meaning to be given to the word \"office\" as used in s. 104(3). Section 99(d) of the Criminal Code provides that in Part III of the Code the word \"office\" includes:\n(i) an office or appointment under the government;\n(ii) a civil or military commission; and\n(iii) a position or employment in a public department.\nI am satisfied, however, that this section does not apply to an \"office\" under a municipal government, and that Macdonald J.A. was entirely justified in referring to the definitions of \"office\" contained in the New Century and Shorter Oxford English Dictionaries. The evidence in the present case is that the duties of the Chief Building Inspector included the inspection of buildings for the purpose of enforcing the by-laws of the city, and that as Chief Building Inspector Walker had authority to supersede decisions made by building inspectors in the Building Inspection Division. A position which involved such authority, responsibility and public trust can, in my view, properly be described as an \"office\" within the meaning of s. 104(3) of the Criminal Code.\nThe City Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 42, which appellant's counsel describes as \"the Charter of the City of Calgary\" is advanced as containing a number of sections which are of considerable help in determining whether or not a \"Chief Building Inspector\" is an \"official\" of the City of Calgary. Section 2(q) of that Act reads as follows:\n\"official\" includes a city commissioner, city manager, city clerk, city treasurer, assessor, city solicitor, auditor, comptroller, city engineer and any other official appointed by the council to any office pursuant to the provisions of Part III, Division B; (The italics are mine.)\nIt is provided in Part III, Division B (s. 55(1)) that \"such other officials as are deemed necessary for carrying into effect of the provisions of the\" City Act are to be appointed by resolution of the City Council and s. 81(1) requires that before entering upon the duties of his office such an official shall make and subscribe the official oath, solemn affirmation or declaration prescribed by the Oaths of Office Act. Although The City Act does not expressly mention the office of Chief Building Inspector, the provisions of ss. 385 to 389 deal with \"Control of Buildings\" and s. 388(e) provides that the\n\u2026 Council may pass by-laws\n* * *\n(e) appointing street and building inspectors and defining their duties.\nAs the evidence makes it clear that there was a Chief Building Inspector and as there was no evidence that he was not properly appointed, it is to be assumed that the City Council of the City of Calgary deemed it necessary to appoint and did appoint such an official for carrying into effect the provisions of The City Act.\nThe substance of the appellant's argument in this regard is that there was no evidence that Walker had been appointed by resolution or by-law of the City Council. In my view, Walker's uncontradicted evidence that he was both the Chief Building Inspector and a \"municipal official\", coupled with the description of his official activities contained in his own evidence and in that of the appellant, constitutes prima facie evidence that he was a person who held office under the City of Calgary and was a \"municipal official\" within the meaning of s. 104(3). It has been held on more than one occasion that evidence of a person acting in an official capacity raises a rebuttable presumption of his due appointment to that office. (See Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 15, p. 347, para. 628; Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed., p. 120; R. v. Smith6; R. v. Goodman7; R. v. Roberts8 and Doe v. Brawn9). In this case there is not only evidence of Walker having personally inspected buildings in the City of Calgary and of his having been the superior officer in control of other building inspectors, but there is also direct evidence from the official himself that he held the appointment, and it is plain that the appellant recognized that he represented the City of Calgary in an \"official capacity\". In the course of his direct examination, the appellant, referring to Walker's having condemned another building, said that he did whatever Walker asked him to do, and he was then asked:\nQ. Why did you do what he asked you?\nA. Why? I couldn't help it.\nQ. Not because he is a nice fellow?\nA. No.\nQ. Just because you couldn't help it?\nA. I couldn't help it, it is the City, you couldn't knock the City.\nAs to the contention that there was no evidence that either of the alleged bribes related to an official act, it seems to me to be sufficient to say that Walker's evidence, as to his refusal of the money offered in November 1959, is that he told the appellant,\n\u2026 that in my office as Building Inspector I had, it was my duty to do what I believed was the proper thing to do in relation to the building by-law regarding buildings.\nand that when the appellant asked him in August 1960 to overlook the \"over-development\" by the builder-owner Korytko he was, in effect, asking him to countermand an order made by a building inspector who was under his authority which order was enforceable by the laying of a charge under By-law 4682 of the City of Calgary. In my opinion, if he had complied with either of these requests, Walker would have failed to perform an official act. The last error alleged in the decision of the Appellate Division was that the findings by that Court that Walker was \"a municipal official\" and that the bribes related to \"an official act\" were findings of fact which that Court had no jurisdiction to make on an appeal by the Crown. There was no conflict of evidence as to the fact that Walker was the Chief Building Inspector and the alleged findings of fact, in my opinion, constitute a decision of the Appellate Division that under the true construction of the language used in s. 104(3) of the Criminal Code the holder of such a position is a \"municipal official\" and the acts performed in his capacity as such are \"official acts\" within the meaning of those phrases as used in that section. This was a decision which the Appellate Division had jurisdiction to make in this case.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray, Robertson, Prowse, Brennan & Fraser, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Edward P.

The plaintiff had not seen the goods which it was purchasing and it was clearly a sale by description. After much delay on the part of the plaintiff the defendant shipped the \u201crelaying rail\u201d to the plaintiff, but the latter rejected the entire shipment on the ground that the goods were not in accordance with the contract. Of the contents of the first of the cars in which the rails were shipped, 80 per cent consisted of \u201crelaying rail\u201d and 20 per cent of material which did not qualify as \u201crelaying rail\u201d. In the second and third cars the corresponding percentages were 75 per cent and 25 per cent. The rejected goods were later resold by the defendant. The plaintiff claimed the return of its deposit and damages; the defendant disputed the claim in its entirety and counter-claimed for the sum of $569.45.\nThe trial judge allowed the defendant the contract price of $50 a ton on the 80 per cent in the first car and the 75 per cent in the second and third cars, together with 80 per cent and 75 per cent of the freight and demurrage charges of the respective cars; furthermore the defendant was allowed the market price of $37.50 per ton for the balance of the contents of the three cars, together with its loss on the sale of 12 tons of spikes not shipped, and for incidental charges, amounting in all to $11,535.16. Against this he allowed the plaintiff its $6,000 deposit and the proceeds of the resale, amounting to $8,190, leaving a balance in favour of the plaintiff of $4,654.84, for which sum judgment was given. The counter-claim was dismissed. The plaintiff at the trial had abandoned its claim for damages and sought only the return of its deposit. The trial judgment was affirmed by a judgment of the Court of Appeal. From that decision the plaintiff appealed by special permission of this Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Locke, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ.: The case fell within the terms of s. 29(3) of The Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 345. The seller delivered to the buyer the relaying rail he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description (i.e. \u201cscrap\u201d). The buyer in rejecting the whole shipment had the right so to do. In view of the finding that between 20 and 25 per cent of the total shipment consisted of scrap it was impossible to apply the rule de minimis non curat lex. Rapalli v. K.L. Take, Ltd., [1958] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 469, referred to.\nAitken, Campbell & Co. Ltd. v. Boullen & Gatenby, [1908] S.C. 490; Easterbrook and Others v. Gibb & Co.

Ronaasen & Son, [1933] A.C. 470, followed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Judson J., dissenting: The term \u201crelaying rail\u201d is not a term of precise classification\u2014the nearest one can get to it is that it is rail that can be relaid on any track. All of the rails shipped to the plaintiff had in fact been laid in track and were there when sold. The balance of the goods which had been damaged during the process of lifting and removal were goods of the same description but inferior in quality. It was apparent from the evidence that with a little cropping and drilling at a very minor cost the goods contained in the cars could all have been classified as relaying rails. Aitken, Campbell & Co. Ltd. v. Boulden and Gatenby, supra, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Schroeder J. Appeal allowed, Kerwin C.J. and Judson J. dissenting.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and A.M. Austin, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Judson J. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal by Runnymede Iron & Steel Limited, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 affirming the judgment at the trial of Schroeder J. The genesis of the dispute between the parties is an agreement of October 1951. While there may be reasons for the fact that it was nearly ten years later when the matter came before this Court, it should be made clear that the delay does not rest with the tribunals. The writ was issued October 21, 1952. The trial took place in June 1953, and judgment was delivered June 19, 1953. The appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal in December 1953, and judgment delivered by that Court on February 11, 1954. It does not appear from the case or factums when notice of appeal to this Court was given, but, because of certain documents appearing in the Court\u2019s files, the parties were required to appear before me to explain if the appeal had been settled, or the reason for the delay in bringing it on for argument. On the return of the motion, and after hearing the agents for the solicitors, special permission was given to set down the appeal for hearing at the April Term, 1961.\nIn its statement of claim the plaintiff-appellant claimed the return of a deposit of $6,000 paid on account of the purchase price of certain steel rails, agreed to be sold by the respondent to the appellant by the agreement of October 1951, and $6,375 for loss of profits on 255 tons at $25 per ton. The defendant disputed the claim in its entirety and counter-claimed for the sum of $569.45.\nThe trial judge allowed the respondent the contract price of $50 a ton on 80 per cent of the rails shipped by it in the first railway car and 75 per cent of the rails shipped in the second and third cars, together with 80 per cent and 75 per cent of the freight and demurrage charges of the respective cars; furthermore, the respondent was allowed the market price of $37.50 per ton for the rest of the shipments, together with its loss on the sale of twelve tons of spikes not shipped to Toronto, and for incidental telephone, telegraph and bank charges, amounting in all to $11,535.16. Against this he allowed the appellant its $6,000 deposit and the proceeds of the sale of the entire contents of the three cars to a company controlled by one Merrilees, amounting to $8,190, leaving a balance in favour of the appellant of $2,654.84, for which sum judgment was given the appellant, together with one-half of its costs of the action. The counterclaim was dismissed with costs. At the trial the appellant had abandoned its claim for damages for loss of profits and the respondent did not contend that the appellant should pay for a fourth car and the trial judge therefore did not deal with these matters. It was this judgment which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellant claims that the contract was for the sale of goods by description within the meaning of subs. (3) of s. 29 of The Ontario Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 345:\n29. (3) Where the seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in the contract, the buyer may accept the goods which are in accordance with the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole. The appellant also claims that the respondent delivered some goods of a different description. I agree with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that these submissions are not entitled to prevail.\nEarly in 1951 the respondent had purchased for salvage purposes the plant of Grenville Crushed Rock Company at Hawk Lake, Ontario. This plant included a railway siding and the subject-matter of the contract between the parties was the material included in this railway siding. The contract is contained in a letter, dated October 18, 1951, from the respondent to the appellant of which the following are the pertinent parts:\nHave received your cheque as a deposit on the rail and am changing the specifications as follows to reconcile your purchase with our last telephone conversation. The rail will be as follows:\n1100 lineal ft., more or less, of 60 lbs.\nper yd. used-rail\nrelaying rail \u201cJ.T.\u201d\n8200 lineal ft., more or less, of 80 lbs.\nper yd. used-rail\n5700 lineal ft., more or less, of 85 lbs.\nper yd. used-rail\nwith a maximum of twelve switches although I think we only have eight and with six 85 lb. wise and five 80 lb. wise. The average length of this rail to be around 30 ft. This order to include all Spacing Bars and all Splice Bars, Nuts and Bolts, and up to ten tons of Spikes which are to include all the new Spikes on the job whatever the weight is. The price for this used rail is to be $50.00 per ton on car Hawk Lake, Ontario. Seventy-five per cent of this order is to be available for shipment before January 1st 1952, the balance by the end of April 1952 or sooner.\nWe may have fifty or hundred ton more rail or fifty ton less rail but the intent is that we will hold for you all of the used rail on the job for your disposition and that we are selling you all this used rail and that we have no authority to dispose of any rail other than to you on the job at Hawk Lake.\nIn July 1952, after a long delay which was attributable to the appellant\u2019s unwillingness to give shipping instructions, the respondent shipped two cars f.o.b. Hawk Lake to the appellant at Toronto, which it rejected. A third car was already en route but since the respondent considered that the appellant\u2019s rejection of the first two cars was unjustified, it did not release the third car except on acceptance of a sight draft. A fourth car was also shipped and the appellant refused to accept this. All four cars were eventually purchased by Mr. Merrilees\u2019 company, which is the biggest dealer in rails in Canada, at $50 per ton for the first three cars and $37.50 per ton for the fourth. The trial judge\u2019s finding of fact is based upon an acceptance of the evidence of Mr. Merrilees and is contained in the following extract:\nI accept this classification of the contents of the first three cars as containing 80%, 75% and 75% of siding quality relaying rails. The balance consisted of \u201cpotential relaying rails\u201d which could be converted into relaying rails, as already indicated, but, according to the evidence of Mr. Merrilees, rails having only reclamation possibilities do not comply with the quality called for by the contract, whereas the former rails do measure up to the necessary standard.\nThe Court of Appeal held:\nThere is no doubt that the appellant received all the relay rails available from the Hawk Lake siding, and that is what the respondent had undertaken to supply. There was nothing in the agreement as to an inventory and although the appellant on various occasions asked for an inventory it was known at the time that the agreement was entered into that the quantity and quality of the relay rails were uncertain.\nIt is important to bear in mind that the subject-matter of this contract was rails in position on a siding and in use at the time of the contract. The contract contemplated the lifting and movement of these rails. The term \u201crelaying rail\u201d is not a term of precise classification and the nearest that one can get to it is that it is rail that can be relaid on any track. Obviously this rail, which was siding rail, could not be moved into a higher category.\nAll of the rails shipped to the appellant had in fact been laid in track and were there when sold. During the process of lifting and removal, some of it suffered minor damage. In the circumstances of this case, therefore, the trial judge was clearly right in his finding that the balance of the rails which had been damaged did not constitute goods of a different description and I cannot read the reasons in the Court of Appeal as indicating anything to the contrary or any inconsistency between their reasons and those of the trial judge. The balance of the goods were goods of the same description but inferior in quality. It is apparent from the evidence that with a little cropping and drilling at a very minor cost the goods contained in the cars in question could all have been classified as relaying rails.\nMost of the decisions referred to on the argument and in the Courts below are really of very little assistance. In considering the cases in Scotland it must be borne in mind that the Scottish law differs from the English in view of subs. (2) of s. 11 and s. 62 of the Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893, but the first few sentences of the judgment of Lord Low in Aitken, Campbell & Co. Ltd. v. Boullen and Gatenby[2] may be taken to be a correct statement applicable to the present case so far as concerns the point to be determined:\nI am of opinion that this is not a case to which sec. 30(3) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, applies. That enactment deals with the case of a seller delivering to a buyer \u201cthe goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in the contract.\u201d I think that the word \u201cdescription\u201d is there plainly used to denote the kind of goods contracted for, and that the right of partial rejection conferred upon the buyer applies only to cases where goods of the kind contracted for are mixed with goods of a different kind, and not to cases where all the goods are of the kind contracted for, but part of them is not of such good quality as the seller was bound to supply.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The facts out of which this litigation arises are stated in the reasons of the Chief Justice and are set out in great detail in the reasons delivered in the courts below. In none of the reasons delivered does there appear to me to be any difference of opinion as to what actually occurred. I propose to summarize briefly the facts upon which the rights of the parties depend.\nThe contract between the parties was in writing and was for the sale by the respondent to the appellant of all the \u201crelaying rail\u201d in the siding of Grenville Crushed Rock Company at Hawk Lake, at the price of $50 per ton on car at Hawk Lake. The appellant had not seen the goods which it was purchasing and it was clearly a sale by description.\nWhen, after great delay, the appellant finally gave shipping instructions the respondent shipped all this \u201crelaying rail\u201d to the appellant at Toronto in four railway cars all of which were rejected by the appellant on the ground that the goods shipped were not in accordance with the contract. By reason of an arrangement between the parties we are concerned with only three of these cars. Of the contents of one of these cars 80 per cent consisted of \u201crelaying rail\u201d and 20 per cent of material which did not qualify as \u201crelaying rail\u201d. In the other two cars the corresponding percentages were 75 per cent and 25 per cent. The evidence of the witness Merrilees who purchased the rejected goods from the respondent was accepted by the learned trial judge. This witness was explicit in his statement that used rail which can be re-laid in any track, even of the lowest category, falls within the description \u201crelaying rail\u201d but that used rail on which it is necessary that any work be done before it can be re-laid does not comply with that description. The learned trial judge said in part:\nI attach the utmost significance to the testimony of Mr. Merrilees, supported as it is by his subsequent experience in disposing of the rails. His evidence, standing alone, is, to my mind, more worthy of credit and entitled to greater weight than the evidence of all the plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses combined. I accept this classification of the contents of the first three cars as containing 80%, 75% and 75% of siding quality relaying rails. The balance consisted of \u201cpotential relaying rails\u201d which could be converted into relaying rails, as already indicated, but, according to the evidence of Mr. Merrilees, rails having only reclamation possibilities do not comply with the quality called for by the contract, whereas the former rails do measure up to the necessary standard.\nThe learned trial judge held that the appellant was bound to pay for the 80 per cent in car number 1 and for the 75 per cent in cars numbers 2 and 3 at the contract price of $50 per ton and to pay for the balance of the contents of the three cars at the price of $37.50 per ton. He also held that the appellant was chargeable with only 80 per cent of the cost of transportation of the first car and 75 per cent of the cost of transportation of the other two cars. The words used by the learned trial judge in this regard are as follows:\nCounsel for the defendant concedes that his clients are bound by the evidence of Andrew Merrilees, even if they think that the percentages of goods not complying with the contract as stated by him are somewhat high. He admits the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover its deposit of $6,000, subject to deductions, for the price of the material shipped to Toronto and the freight charges and certain other smaller items hereinafter mentioned, after crediting to the plaintiff the sum of $8,190 realized on the sale of the same to Andrew Merrilees Limited. In computing these deductions the defendant has charged $50 a ton in respect of the rails which were in conformity with the description contained in the contract, and $37.50 per ton in respect of the rails which were not. This I consider reasonable and proper. They also seek to charge against the plaintiff the full cost of the freight charges incurred by them on Runnymede\u2019s instructions. I think that it would be unfair to permit the defendant to charge more than 80% of the cost of transportation on the first car and 75% of the cost of transportation of the other two cars for the reason that it was wasteful and uneconomical to send to Toronto by freight rails which could only qualify is scrap material. Having failed to satisfy the requirements of the contract in that respect, the defendants ought to bear that portion of the freight charges attributable to the non-conforming part of the shipment. It should be pointed out that the learned trial judge found that the cost of transportation of the goods from Hawk Lake to Toronto was approximately $30 a ton so that on the disposition of the case made by him the total cost at Toronto to the appellant of goods conforming to the contract would be $80 per ton and that of the percentages which did not conform to the contract would be $37.50 per ton; or, to express the matter differently, the cost to the buyer of the goods not conforming to the contract was fixed by the learned trial judge at $7.50 per ton f.o.b. Hawk Lake.\nThe reasoning which led the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal to decide that on these findings of fact the appellant did not have the right to reject the whole shipment is summarized in the following passage in the reasons of the Court of Appeal delivered by Gibson J.A.:\nThe contract was by no means definite as to the quantity of relay rails to be sold, but it was clearly understood that the appellant was to receive all the relay rails available on the Hawk Lake siding. All the rails which the respondent considered to be of relay quality were shipped to Toronto and of these, after hearing expert evidence from both parties, the learned trial judge found as a fact that 80 per cent of the first carload and 75 per cent of the second and third carloads were relay rails.\nBecause some of the rails for one reason or another failed to come up to the standard required for relay rails and were therefore classified as scrap they do not become \u201cgoods of a different description\u201d. They are goods of the same description but inferior in quality: Aitken, Campbell & Company, Limited v. Boullen & Gatenby (1908) S.C. 490; Easterbrook et al. v. Gibb and Co. (1887), 3 T.L.R. 401.\nTherefore, s. 29(3) of The Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 345, has no application and the buyer is not entitled to reject the whole shipment because some only of the goods are inferior in quality.\nWith respect the second paragraph of this passage appears to me to be contrary to the evidence expressly accepted by the learned trial judge and inconsistent with the findings of fact made by both the courts below.\nThe goods sold were described in the contract as \u201crelaying rail\u201d not as used rail with a representation or warranty that they would be of the quality of \u201crelaying rail\u201d or of any particular quality. The appellant purchased \u201crelaying rail\u201d; he did not purchase \u201cpotential relaying rail\u201d or scrap that might be transformed into \u201crelaying rail\u201d.\nIt appears to me to be a contradiction in terms to say that some of the rails shipped \u201cfailed to come up to the standard required for relay rails and were therefore classified as scrap\u201d and at the same time to say that they do not thereby become \u201cgoods of a different description\u201d. This amounts to saying that the description \u201cscrap\u201d is the same as the description \u201crelaying rail\u201d.\nIn my opinion, the case falls within the terms of s. 29(3) of The Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 345:\n(3) Where the seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in the contract, the buyer may accept the goods which are in accordance with the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole.\nThe seller delivered to the buyer the relaying rail he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description (i.e. \u201cscrap\u201d). It is common ground that the buyer rejected the whole shipment. In my opinion he had the right to do this. In view of the finding that between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the total shipment consisted of scrap it is impossible to apply the rule de minimis non curat lex. The principle applicable to the facts found in the case at bar is succinctly stated by Jenkins L.J., with whom the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, in Rapalli v. K.L. Take, Ltd.[3]:\nThe purchaser is entitled to have delivered to him goods complying with the contractual description, and, failing that, he is entitled to reject unless the rule of de minimis in its strict sense applies. Clearly, in my view, 6 to 7 per cent, is a proportion which cannot be disregarded as de minimis.\nIn addition to the two cases referred to in the passage from the reasons of Gibson J.A., quoted above, the learned trial judge referred to the case of Alkins Brothers v. G.A. Grier and Sons Limited[4], and it is necessary to examine these three decisions.\nIn Aitken, Campbell and Company Limited v. Boullen and Gatenby[5], the contract was for the sale of 133 pieces of maroon twills by sample. It was found that 64 of the pieces delivered while answering the description \u201cmaroon twills\u201d were of a quality inferior to that of the sample. It was held that the purchasers could not retain the pieces which were in accordance with the contract and reject the 64 pieces which were not; but the judgments make it plain that the purchasers had the right to reject the whole shipment. It is sufficient to quote the following passage from the judgment of Lord Low at page 496:\nSuppose that when the defenders refused to take back the 64 pieces, the pursuers had at once also returned the remaining 69 pieces, and intimated that they repudiated the contract and rejected the whole goods, I cannot imagine any ground upon which it could have been held that they were not entitled to follow that course.\nIn applying this case it must, of course, be remembered that s. 11 of the Sale of Goods Act of the United Kingdom which otherwise corresponds to section 12 of the Ontario Act contained subsection (2) reading as follows:\n(2) In Scotland, failure by the seller to perform any material part of a contract of sale is a breach of contract, which entitles the buyer either within a reasonable time after delivery to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated, or to retain the goods and treat the failure to perform such material part as a breach which may give rise to a claim for compensation or damages.\nHowever, so far as it is applicable this decision would appear to support the position of the appellant in the case at bar rather than that of the respondent.\nIn Easterbrook and Others v. Gibb and Co.[6], the contract was for the sale of 1,500 Bauer\u2019s patent pipe-vices. The goods delivered were Bauer\u2019s patent pipe-vices but a number of them were found to be defective. The grounds of the decision appear in the following passage in the reasons of the Master of the Rolls at page 401:\nThe contract here was not a contract for successive deliveries, though, as a fact, successive deliveries were made, and must be considered as one contract for one whole lot. Accordingly the purchaser could only reject if that which was offered as the whole lot was so different from the whole lot ordered as to make the lot offered not in accordance with the description in the contract. Mr. Justice Grantham did not think that the goods delivered so far differed as a lot from the description in the contract as not to correspond with the lot ordered and so as to entitle the defendants to reject. The referee found 206 defective out of 1,417 examined, and though this number was rather high, yet, considering that the defects were trivial and could be put right in a very short time and at a very small cost, his Lordship could not differ from the learned Judge at the trial.\nThere is nothing in the report to suggest that the buyers were allowed any reduction from the full contract price and the decision appears to turn on a finding of fact that the goods delivered were in accordance with the contract, the defects which were present in some of them being regarded as so trifling as to fall within the de minimis principle. I do not regard this judgment as establishing any general principle which assists the respondent in the case at bar.\nIn Alkins Brothers v. G.A. Grier and Sons, Ltd.[7], the contract was for the purchase of the whole product of the seller\u2019s mill during the sawing season of 1920, \u201cdead culls out\u201d, the wood to be sawn in accordance with instructions given by the buyers. The whole product of the mill was delivered but included some \u201cdead culls\u201d and some of the lumber was not sawn in conformity with the instructions. The referee to whom a reference had been directed \u201cto ascertain and state what sum, if any, is due from the defendant company to the plaintiffs\u201d reported that the defendant had accepted the goods after inspection, or after full opportunity to inspect, and had thereby lost its right to reject; he allowed substantial deductions from the contract price in respect of the \u201cdead culls\u201d and \u201cmiscuts\u201d. This view was affirmed by Rose J. and by the Court of Appeal. The question whether the defendants could have rejected the whole had they not lost the right to do so by acceptance is left open. This case is distinguishable on the facts from the case at bar in which there is no suggestion that the appellant accepted the goods delivered by the respondent\nIn my view, the case at bar is governed by the principles stated by the House of Lords in Arcos, Ltd. v. E.A. Ronaasen and Son[8], The agreement in that case was for the sale of a quantity of staves required by the buyers as the sellers knew for making cement barrels; the contract specified that the staves were to be of one-half an inch in thickness. 75.3 per cent of the staves delivered were more than one-half an inch but not more than nine-sixteenths of an inch in thickness and 18.3 per cent were more than nine-sixteenths of an inch but not more than five-eights of an inch in thickness. It was found as a fact by the umpire that all the staves delivered were fit for the purpose of making cement barrels and \u201cwere commercially within and merchantable under the contract\u201d. It was held by Wright J. whose judgment was affirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords that the buyers were entitled to reject all the staves. At page 474, Lord Buckmaster, with whom Lord Blanesburgh and Lord Macmillan agreed said:\nThe fact that the goods were merchantable under the contract is no test proper to be applied in determining whether the goods satisfied the contract description, and I think the phrase \u201ccommercially\u201d itself shows that while the goods did not in fact answer the description, they could, as a matter of commerce, be so dealt with. But the rights of the buyers under the contract are not so limited. If the article they have purchased is not in fact the article that has been delivered, they are entitled to reject it, even though it is the commercial equivalent of that which they have bought.\nAt page 479, Lord Atkin said:\nIt was contended that in all commercial contracts the question was whether there was a \u201csubstantial\u201d compliance with the contract: there always must be some margin: and it is for the tribunal of fact to determine whether the margin is exceeded or not. I cannot agree. If the written contract specifies conditions of weight, measurement and the like, those conditions must be complied with. A ton does not mean about a ton, or a yard about a yard. Still less when you descend to minute measurements does \u00bd inch mean about \u00bd inch. If the seller wants a margin he must and in my experience does stipulate for it. Of course by recognized trade usage particular figures may be given a different meaning, as in a baker\u2019s dozen; or there may be even incorporated a definite margin more or less: but there is no evidence or finding of such a usage in the present case.\nNo doubt there may be microscopic deviations which business men and therefore lawyers will ignore.\nIt appears to me that on the findings of fact made in the courts below in the case at bar the variation between the contract description and the goods delivered was wider than in the Arcos case.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal succeeds. The appellant at the trial abandoned its claim for damages and sought only the return of the deposit of $6,000. The learned trial judge dismissed the respondent\u2019s counter-claim without costs and no appeal was taken from that dismissal.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and that of the learned trial judge, except in so far as it dismissed the counter-claim without costs, and direct that judgment be entered in favour of the appellant for $6,000 with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs, KERWIN.

The price was to be paid in the form of shares in the company. The defendant was to retain title to all shares until all were paid for. The plaintiff was to be given full control of the business and be employed at a weekly salary plus a monthly bonus. The plaintiff paid an initial 110,000 and an additional $500. When the defendant subsequently procured the dismissal of the plaintiff, the latter sued to have the agreement set aside and his money refunded. The action was dismissed by the trial judge, but was maintained by the Court of Queen's Bench. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The plaintiff was entitled to have the agreement set aside and his money refunded.\nThe contract of employment could not be severed from the agreement for the sale of the shares. The plaintiff had a vital interest in working for the company in order to protect the payments already made and those to be made. The defendant could not keep for himself the payments which had been made and at the same time dismiss the plaintiff from his employment. Dupr\u00e9 Quarries Ltd. v.

Ahem, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le 15 septembre 1952, le d\u00e9fendeur-appelant Brault s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 vendre au demandeur-intim\u00e9 son entreprise commerciale, connue sous le nom de Brault et Fils Enr., et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu'une compagnie \u00e0 fonds social devait \u00eatre form\u00e9e. D'apr\u00e8s cette convention, la consid\u00e9ration de la vente \u00e9tait une somme \u00e9gale \u00e0 la valeur nette de l'entreprise suivant inventaire en date du 30 septembre 1952.\nLa clause 3 de la convention stipule que l'appelant Brault s'engage \u00e0 former cette compagnie par actions sous le nom de Brault et Fils Inc., avec un capital de $39,900 divis\u00e9 en 399 actions ordinaires ayant une valeur nominale de $100 chacune. L'appelant Brault s'est \u00e9galement engag\u00e9 \u00e0 souscrire un nombre d'actions \u00e9gal \u00e0 la valeur nette de l'entreprise, et ces actions devaient \u00eatre \u00e9mises en consid\u00e9ration du transport de son commerce.\nL'article 4 de la convention dit que Poitras, le demandeur, s'engage \u00e0 acheter de Brault toutes les actions de ladite corporation, \u00e0 \u00eatre acquises par ledit Brault \u00e0 leur valeur nominale sur paiement de la somme de $10,000, repr\u00e9sentant 100 actions, et la balance devant \u00eatre pay\u00e9e graduellement \u00e0 raison d'un versement minimum de $1,000 par ann\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du 1er octobre 1953. Il a en outre \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entente que les actions achet\u00e9es par le demandeur Poitras du d\u00e9fendeur Brault n'auraient pas droit de vote tant que ledit Brault n'aurait pas re\u00e7u la pleine consid\u00e9ration pour le nombre d'actions qu'il d\u00e9tenait originairement. En outre, Poitras s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 assurer sa vie au moyen d'une police de $10,000, et de la maintenir en vigueur tant qu'il n'aurait pas compl\u00e8tement effectu\u00e9 les paiements auxquels il \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9. Le demandeur Poitras devait recevoir un salaire de $65 par semaine, payable hebdomadairement, plus un bonus \u00e9gal \u00e0 30 pour cent des profits nets mensuels.\nEn ex\u00e9cution de cette convention, Poitras a pay\u00e9 au d\u00e9fendeur la somme de $10,000 le 20 novembre 1952, la somme de $100 le 15 novembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, et un montant additionnel de $400 le 11 novembre 1953, et la compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e pour donner suite \u00e0 la convention intervenue. Brault fut nomm\u00e9 pr\u00e9sident, et le demandeur Poitras secr\u00e9taire.\nLe demandeur a travaill\u00e9 pour la compagnie Brault et Fils Inc. au salaire stipul\u00e9, le d\u00e9fendeur a retir\u00e9 pour sa part la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la convention. Il est arriv\u00e9 cependant que le 20 novembre 1952 Brault, agissant comme pr\u00e9sident, a donn\u00e9 au demandeur le contr\u00f4le de l'entreprise suivant une lettre qu'il lui a adress\u00e9e le m\u00eame jour. Mais, les relations entre le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur ne furent \u00e9videmment pas harmonieuses car, \u00e0 une assembl\u00e9e des directeurs de Brault et Fils Inc. tenue le 18 novembre 1953, l'intim\u00e9 Poitras fut remerci\u00e9 de ses services comme employ\u00e9, l'appelant s'empara des cl\u00e9s des portes du magasin et demanda au demandeur de ne plus revenir au magasin.\nC'est la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 que l'appelant a viol\u00e9 les conditions de la convention et qu'il a droit de demander que ladite convention, o\u00f9 il s'est engag\u00e9 d'acheter, soit annul\u00e9e et que le d\u00e9fendeur soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui remettre la somme de $10,500 que le demandeur lui a pay\u00e9e en acompte sur le prix de vente. Le demandeur-intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement offert de remettre au d\u00e9fendeur le certificat d'actions qu'il avait re\u00e7ues, \u00e9gales au montant qu'il avait vers\u00e9. Dans son action, le demandeur conclut que les offres faites par lui soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9es valables, que la convention du 15 septembre 1952 soit annul\u00e9e, et que le d\u00e9fendeur soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la somme de $10,500 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats. L'honorable Juge Sylvestre a rejet\u00e9 l'action du demandeur avec d\u00e9pens, mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement renvers\u00e9 par la Cour du banc de la reine2 qui a accord\u00e9 les conclusions de l'action.\nJe suis d'opinion que la Cour du banc de la reine a bien jug\u00e9, et qu'il n'y a pas lieu d'intervenir pour modifier les conclusions de ce jugement.\nDans l'examen de cette cause, il est essentiel de ne pas oublier que la convention intervenue entre les deux parties pr\u00e9sente un aspect assez complexe. Il s'agit en effet d'un acte de vente, o\u00f9 l'appelant vend son commerce \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, et o\u00f9 ce dernier, moyennant salaire, devient employ\u00e9 de la compagnie qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9e. Le contrat de vente, et le contrat de louage de services, sont subordonn\u00e9s l'un \u00e0 l'autre, et il me semble impossible de faire subsister une partie de ce contrat et prononcer l'annulation de l'autre. Autrement, il faudrait arriver \u00e0 l'extraordinaire r\u00e9sultat que l'appelant pourrait dire qu'il garde les $10,500 qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s et que l'intim\u00e9 serait d\u00e9mis de ses fonctions, quand l'exercice de ces m\u00eames fonctions \u00e9tait une condition essentielle de la convention du 15 septembre 1952.\nL'erreur fondamentale dans la pr\u00e9sente cause est d'appliquer la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour rendue dans une cause de Dupr\u00e9 Quarries Ltd. v. Dupr\u00e93. Dans cet arr\u00eat, qui suivait une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure de cette m\u00eame Cour dans B\u00e9langer v. B\u00e9langer4, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le contrat de vente par Dupr\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie limit\u00e9e, et le contrat de louage de services de Dupr\u00e9, \u00e9taient divisibles, et que l'on pouvait mettre un terme au contrat de louage sans affecter la validit\u00e9 de la vente.\nMais ici, la situation est enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente. Le contrat de vente et le contrat d'engagement sont indivisibles. L'intim\u00e9 a en effet un int\u00e9r\u00eat fondamental \u00e0 travailler pour la compagnie afin de prot\u00e9ger les versements qu'il a faits d\u00e9j\u00e0 et qu'il s'est oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 faire dans l'avenir.\nIl est fort possible, comme le signale M. le Juge Montgomery de la Cour du banc de la reine, que des recours aient \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverts \u00e0 l'appelant, si l'intim\u00e9 ne remplissait pas ses fonctions tel qu'il aurait d\u00fb le faire, mais il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de suivre cette ligne de conduite. Je suis convaincu que l'appelant ne peut pas diviser les clauses de la convention, qu'il ne peut garder pour lui les versements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s, et en m\u00eame temps remercier l'intim\u00e9 de ses services.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Thinel & Filfe, St. Jerome.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Hyde & Ahem, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que.

Courts\u2014Practice\u2014Motion to adduce new evidence\u2014 Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 67.\nThe defendant B borrowed a sum of money from the deceased creditor of which the plaintiff was the legatee. The defendant had agreed to reimburse that sum by paying 10 cents for every dozen canned food tins sold by the business of which he was, when he signed the promissory note, the sole owner. Payments were to be made every week. Subsequently, the defendant took two partners. The partnership made regular payments for some time and then the new partners stopped the payments and denied liability. The plaintiff sued the three partners jointly and severally for the balance of the payments on the ground that their denial of liability had made them loose the benefit of the term. The defendant B did not contest the action. The other two defendants argued that they were not liable and that the action was premature. The trial judge found these two defendants jointly and severally liable with the defendant B. The Court of Appeal dismissed the action on the ground that it was premature. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nWhen a deed filed in support of a claim, as in this case, shows on its face that the amount claimed is not due, the defendant does not have to plead specifically that the action is premature. This is not a fact, but a right in future which does not yet exist. Furthermore, there is no incompatibility between a denial of legal liability and the defence that the action is premature.\nAs found by the Court of Appeal, this action was premature. This was an obligation with a term and there was nothing to indicate that the defendants had lost the benefit of the term.\nThe motion to adduce as new evidence before this Court two deeds of sale signed while the case was before the Court of Queen's Bench, could not be entertained.

En vertu de cet acte, Breton a reconnu devoir cette somme de $15,045 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un billet promissoire portant int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 6 pour cent par ann\u00e9e, et escompt\u00e9 au bureau de la Banque Canadienne de Commerce en la Cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke.\nLe d\u00e9biteur s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 rembourser cette somme \u00e0 raison de $0.10 par douzaine de bo\u00eetes de poulet sur la production totale de la semaine de \u00abA LA CANADIENNE ENREGISTR\u00c9E\u00bb jusqu'\u00e0 l'extinction totale du billet ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9. Tous les paiements devaient \u00eatre faits au bureau de la Banque Canadienne de Commerce, d\u00e9tentrice du billet, et les versements devaient commencer \u00e0 \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du 21 novembre 1952, et les autres \u00e0 chaque semaine jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement de ce billet.\nLe d\u00e9biteur G\u00e9rard Breton a fait un certain nombre de paiements, et le 5 f\u00e9vrier 1953, il a form\u00e9 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avec les intim\u00e9s Narcisse Dumais et Roland P\u00e9loquin et, dans l'acte, il est stipul\u00e9 que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a exist\u00e9 depuis le 1er juillet 1952. De plus, \u00e0 la m\u00eame date, savoir le 5 f\u00e9vrier 1953, les trois associ\u00e9s ont sign\u00e9 une d\u00e9claration de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au bureau du Protonotaire de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du district de St-Fran\u00e7ois, et dans cette d\u00e9claration l'on constate que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 existe depuis cette date du 1er juillet 1952.\nLa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 continua les paiements selon les termes du contrat intervenu entre Georges Ad\u00e9lard Deslongchamps et G\u00e9rard Breton, \u00e0 partir du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1953 jusqu'au 16 mars 1957. Dans l'intervalle, le 8 mai 1956, Georges Ad\u00e9lard Deslongchamps est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et a laiss\u00e9 une partie de ses biens, dont la cr\u00e9ance ci-dessus, \u00e0 Georges B. Deslongchamps, l'appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nLorsque la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 cessa ses paiements le 16 mars 1957, le pr\u00e9sent appelant r\u00e9clama de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 la balance due, soit la somme de $14,683.50, mais comme les paiements furent refus\u00e9s, il intenta une action contre les trois associ\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement. G\u00e9rard Breton ne produisit aucune d\u00e9fense, et a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 par d\u00e9faut, mais les intim\u00e9s Dumais et P\u00e9loquin persist\u00e8rent dans leur refus de payer et contest\u00e8rent l'action du demandeur. L'honorable Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a maintenu l'action contre les deux associ\u00e9s, mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement renvers\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel2 et quant \u00e0 eux, l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens. C'est la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s que l'obligation contract\u00e9e par Breton l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 avant que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont ils ont subs\u00e9quemment fait partie ne f\u00fbt form\u00e9e, et qu'ils ne sont pas responsables de cette dette ant\u00e9rieure cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l'auteur de l'appelant. De plus, devant le juge au proc\u00e8s ils ont pr\u00e9tendu que l'action \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e, vu qu'au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e, les montants r\u00e9clam\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas dus.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s a rejet\u00e9 le premier moyen, a trouv\u00e9 les deux intim\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement responsables de la dette de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et a rejet\u00e9 le second pour le motif qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9. Sans examiner la question de responsabilit\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s, la Cour du banc de la reine a maintenu l'appel et a rejet\u00e9 l'action parce que les montants r\u00e9clam\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas encore exigibles.\nJe dois dire en premier lieu que je suis clairement d'opinion que quand un acte produit au soutien d'une r\u00e9clamation, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00e0 sa face que le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 n'est pas \u00e9chu, le d\u00e9fendeur poursuivi qui conteste l'action n'a pas besoin de plaider qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment. Il ne s'agit pas l\u00e0 d'un fait, mais bien d'un droit en puissance qui n'existe pas encore. Sans plaidoyer en fait, mais sur simple inscription en droit, l'action dans un cas comme celui-l\u00e0 peut \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. De plus, contrairement \u00e0 ce que l'on a soutenu, je ne crois pas qu'il existe aucune incompatibilit\u00e9 entre les deux d\u00e9fenses des intim\u00e9s. S\u00fbrement que des pr\u00e9tendus d\u00e9biteurs peuvent r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une action qu'ils ne sont pas l\u00e9galement responsables du paiement d'une r\u00e9clamation, et soutenir sub-sidiairement que s'ils le sont, l'action est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e parce que la cr\u00e9ance contre eux n'est pas exigible. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui s'est produit dans la cause qui nous est soumise.\nComme la Cour du banc de la reine l'a pens\u00e9, je crois que cette action est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. Les intim\u00e9s en effet ne devaient verser hebdomadairement que la somme de $0.10 par douzaine de bo\u00eetes de poulet sur leur production totale, jusqu'\u00e0 l'extinction de la cr\u00e9ance. Il s'agit bien l\u00e0 d'une obligation \u00e0 terme, et quand l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e le 16 avril 1957, la balance qui restait due \u00e9tait apparemment de $14,683.50. Rien n'indique au dossier que les intim\u00e9s aient perdu le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du terme, ce qui aurait eu pour effet de rendre la cr\u00e9ance exigible. L'appelant ne peut r\u00e9clamer plus que le montant stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 la convention. Devant cette Cour, lors de l'audition, les procureurs de l'appelant ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une motion afin qu'ils soient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 verser au dossier deux actes de vente en date du 27 janvier 1960 et du 25 mars de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'on veut \u00e9tablir des faits survenus plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l'institution de l'action. Je ne crois pas que ces exhibits subs\u00e9quents \u00e0 la contestation, et sign\u00e9s alors que la cause \u00e9tait pendante devant la Cour du banc de la reine, peuvent \u00eatre l\u00e9galement admis. Ils ne peuvent modifier la nature des droits des parties tels qu'ils existaient au moment o\u00f9 l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e.\nJe crois donc que la motion pour produire des documents additionnels doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens, et que le pr\u00e9sent appel doit \u00eatre \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours. Le pr\u00e9sent jugement ne peut \u00e9videmment priver l'appelant d'exercer tout autre recours dont il peut \u00eatre l\u00e9galement investi.\nAppeal and motion to adduce new evidence dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: Arcadius Denis, Sherbrooke.\nAttorneys for the defendants, respondents: Blanchette, Peloquin & Savoie, Sherbrooke.\n1 [1960] Que.

Deforme, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le 18 novembre 1952, l'intim\u00e9e a institu\u00e9 contre l'appelant une action devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure du district de Montr\u00e9al, dans laquelle elle r\u00e9clame la somme de $25,054.96 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats et d\u00e9pens. L'appelant, en vertu d'une entente intervenue entre les parties, avait le droit exclusif de vendre dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, moyennant commission, des Certificats de la Champion Savings Corporation Limited, et comme cons\u00e9quence de cette entente, il aurait eu droit de recevoir en commission la somme de $161,893.81. Il est arriv\u00e9, d'apr\u00e8s les termes de la d\u00e9claration au dossier, que l'intim\u00e9e aurait pay\u00e9 $186,948.77, soit un exc\u00e9dent de $25,054.96, que celle-ci r\u00e9clame dans son action.\nL'appelant-d\u00e9fendeur a produit un plaidoyer au cours du mois de d\u00e9cembre 1952, et le 30 d\u00e9cembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite au m\u00e9rite, mais le 9 juin 1954 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 ray\u00e9e du r\u00f4le de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure par ordre de M. le Juge Edouard Tellier. Le 24 ao\u00fbt 1960, le d\u00e9fendeur a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une motion pour p\u00e9remption, all\u00e9guant que la derni\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure utile avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le 9 juin 1954, et que l'action en cons\u00e9quence devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens, sauf recours s'il y avait lieu. (C.P. 279 et suivants)\nM. le Juge Tellier a rejet\u00e9 la motion pour p\u00e9remption avec d\u00e9pens, pour des raisons qu'il est actuellement inutile de discuter. L'appelant s'est pourvu en appel devant la Cour du banc de la reine2, mais l'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une motion pr\u00e9tendant qu'il s'agissait de l'appel d'un jugement interlocutoire et que, suivant les dispositions de l'art. 1211 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, il fallait de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que l'appelant obt\u00eent la permission de l'un des juges de la Cour du banc de la reine pour que son appel puisse \u00eatre l\u00e9galement entendu. Cette motion a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e et l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, avec la dissidence de M. le Juge Bernard Bissonnette. Le 17 f\u00e9vrier 1961, cette Cour a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant la permission de loger son appel devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada.\nMM. les Juges Rinfret et Owen de la Cour du banc de la reine ont suivi la d\u00e9cision de leur Cour, rendue dans la cause de L'Association Patronale v. Dependable Slipper Co.3, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\n1. Il ne peut y avoir en toute instance principale qu'un jugement final et des interlocutoires.\n2. Le jugement final est proprement celui qui termine un proc\u00e8s et met fin \u00e0 l'instance sur le fond; le jugement interlocutoire est celui qui est prononc\u00e9 durant le proc\u00e8s, savoir entre l'institution de l'action on de la demande initiale principale et le jugement qui y met fin, et comprend toute d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 un incident; le jugement final est, sous r\u00e9serve de l'art. 43 C.P., appelable de piano; quant aux jugements interlocutoires, ils sont appelables ou non selon qu'ils sont d\u00e9finitifs ou provisoires (46 et 1211 C.P.).\nAnt\u00e9rieurement, la Cour du banc de la reine avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie d'une question semblable \u00e0 celle qui nous est actuellement soumise. En effet, dans la cause de Kugel v. Malouin4, il s'agissait d'une demande de p\u00e9remption d'instance qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. L'appelant avait obtenu la permission de se pourvoir en appel, mais MM. les Juges St-Germain et McKinnon ont exprim\u00e9 l'opinion suivante:\nLors de l'audition de cette cause, le savant avocat du demandeur a pr\u00e9tendu que le jugement dont est appel, n'\u00e9tait pas un jugement appelable aux termes de l'art. 46 C.P. et que, par cons\u00e9quent, permission d'appeler dudit jugement n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\nOr, avec toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je suis d'avis qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire pour le d\u00e9fendeur de demander la permission d'appeler de ce jugement, et qu'il pouvait appeler dudit jugement de piano.\nCette opinion est n\u00e9cessairement fond\u00e9e sur le principe que j'approuve, qu'une motion pour p\u00e9remption est une instance dans une instance. Un interlocutoire est une mesure d'instruction au cours d'un proc\u00e8s et a pour objet de pr\u00e9parer la d\u00e9cision finale du tribunal sur la controverse qui a donn\u00e9 naissance au litige. Mais il arrive souvent, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, qu'un jugement soit d\u00e9finitif, car il ne tend pas \u00e0 mettre l'instance en \u00e9tat de recevoir une solution sur le fond du proc\u00e8s. Certains jugements rev\u00eatent un caract\u00e8re de finalit\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 qu'ils soient prononc\u00e9s durant le proc\u00e8s, c'est-\u00e0-dire entre l'institution de l'action ou de la demande initiale principale et le jugement qui y met fin, mais ils ne d\u00e9terminent pas un incident relatif \u00e0 la demande principale. Comme le disait M. le Juge Bissonnette dans Kugel v. Malouin, supra, la demande en p\u00e9remption provoque un incident qui doit \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement vid\u00e9 avant qu'il ne soit proc\u00e9d\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement sur l'instance principale. Il ne s'agit pas, en effet, de d\u00e9terminer les droits des plaideurs sur le litige principal, mais de constater judiciairement la d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit de continuer l'instance.\nLe meilleur exemple est un jugement accordant ou refusant une motion pour p\u00e9remption. Si la demande est accord\u00e9e, l'action est rejet\u00e9e, parce que la proc\u00e9dure pendante est frapp\u00e9e de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance. Si elle est refus\u00e9e, il r\u00e9sulte que le jugement nie \u00e0 celui qui propose la motion, le droit qu'il peut avoir de rechercher l'extinction de l'instance. Dans l'un ou l'autre cas, la Cour ne statue pas sur le droit d'action. Je crois que c'est un droit fondamental que poss\u00e8de un plaideur, lorsque les conditions se rencontrent, de faire prononcer l'an\u00e9antissement de tous les actes de proc\u00e9dure accomplis dans un proc\u00e8s. Le jugement qui le refuse est final, et rien ne peut y rem\u00e9dier, sauf appel.\nUne d\u00e9cision de cette Cour rendue dans la cause de Wabasso Cotton Co. v. La Commission des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res de Qu\u00e9bec et al.5 nous aidera \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le pr\u00e9sent litige. Il s'agissait en l'esp\u00e8ce d'un jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure annulant, au cours de l'instance, une injonction interlocutoire. La Cour du banc de la reine a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas lieu \u00e0 appel de plano, parce qu'il s'agissait d'un jugement interlocutoire. Cette Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la Cour du banc de la reine avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisie de l'appel par inscription en appel, et lui a retourn\u00e9 le dossier pour consid\u00e9ration de toute question pouvant \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e sur un appel log\u00e9 de piano. Dans cette cause, M. le Juge en chef Rinfret s'est exprim\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nIl est \u00e9vident que le jugement qui a annul\u00e9 cette injonction est un jugement final. Le r\u00e9sultat en est que, nonobstant l'action intent\u00e9e par les appelants, rien n'emp\u00eache le Syndicat d'agir en vertu de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et de poursuivre les appelants pour les raisons qu'ils ont invoqu\u00e9es lors de leur demande \u00e0 la Commission. Le jugement sur l'action en annulation de cette d\u00e9cision ne pourra avoir pour effet que, s'il est favorable aux appelants, d'y joindre une ordonnance d'injonction permanente, mais l'injonction au cours de l'action est disparue pour toujours.\nS'inspirant de nombreuses autorit\u00e9s qu'il cite dans ses notes, M. le Juge Fauteux, avec qui j'ai concouru, en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il s'agissait d'un jugement final. A la page 479, il dit:\nL'injonction interlocutoire est une mesure dont l'effet et l'objet visent exclusivement au maintien du statu quo pendente lite. C'est donc, en soi, un rem\u00e8de manifestement ind\u00e9pendant et distinct de tous ceux dont l'obtention est\u2014et peut \u00eatre\u2014recherch\u00e9e par l'action et conditionn\u00e9e par son succ\u00e8s. Sans doute, et en fonction de la p\u00e9riode de temps pour laquelle il est \u00e9tabli, ce rem\u00e8de est, pour cette raison, de nature provisoire; mais la nature du rem\u00e8de ne fait pas la nature du jugement qui en dispose. Les deux ne peuvent \u00eatre confondus.\nEt concluant sur la question soumise, il ajoute \u00e0 la page 480:\nCons\u00e9quemment et sauf appel du jugement qui, en l'esp\u00e8ce, a annul\u00e9 l'injonction interlocutoire, ce jugement dispose avec finalit\u00e9 dans la cause, et de ce rem\u00e8de, et du droit d'y recourir.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis d'avis que dans le cas qui nous est soumis, il s'agit bien d'un jugement final et non pas seulement de la d\u00e9termination d'un incident dans le litige principal. La Cour du banc de la reine avait donc juridiction pour entendre le pr\u00e9sent appel de plano. Je lui retournerais en cons\u00e9quence le dossier pour qu'elle se prononce sur le jugement de M. le Juge Tellier qui avait rejet\u00e9 la motion pour p\u00e9remption.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens devant la Cour du banc de la reine et devant cette Cour.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorney for the defendant, appellant: Frank F.

Some of the notes aggregating $1,567,149.20 were paid off in 1951 at a saving of $81,774.44; the balance aggregating 89,225,326.87 were paid off in 1952 at a saving of $431,072.68. The latter amount, described as \"foreign exchange profit on notes payable\", was added by the Minister to the appellant's declared income for 1952. The appellant ontended that the profit should be computed on an \"accrual\" basis, as in order to give a true picture of the company's position, it was necessary, from an accounting point of view, to revalue the amount of Canadian dollars necessary at each balance-sheet date to pay off the outstanding notes. On this basis it submitted that the total amount of $512,847.12 should be apportioned over three years as follows: $64,675.17 for 1950; $259,820.23 for 1951 and $188,351.72 for 1952. The Exchequer Court having ruled in favour of the Minister, the appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Locke J.: For the years 1950 and 1951 the Minister had permitted the appellant to estimate its-costs of production by treating the cost of its purchases, in respect of which the price was payable in American exchange, at the rate then current. In the result, however, except to the extent that some of the notes were paid prior to December 31, 1951, these liabilities were discharged at a time when American exchange was at a discount and, accordingly, the manufacturing profits of the company for 1950 and 1951 were understated for very considerable amounts in each year. The claim of the Crown in this matter really amounted to an attempt to recover qua profit on exchange substantially the amounts by which the appellant's costs were overstated and its income accordingly understated for these years by adding such amounts to its income for the year 1952. This could not be done.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: It was proper for the appellant to compute its profits, in relation to the notes, in the manner which it adopted. There would be no \"profit\" at all in respect of the notes in the year 1952, save for the fact that their value had to be estimated, under the \"accrual\" method of accounting, in 1950 in order to determine the appellant's profit for that year. Being a matter of estimate, the valuation of the liability should continue to be revised in each year thereafter until the year of actual payment. If the \"profit\" for 1952 was to be the difference between an estimate and the amount of actual payment, such profit in that year should be determined on the basis of the estimate at the beginning of that financial year.\nThe decided authorities did not preclude the appellant from adopting the \"accrual\" method\u2014a method which, in relation to trade liabilities payable in U.S. funds other than the notes, the Minister had never challenged, but in which, according to the uncontradicted evidence, the Minister had acquiesced, and which he had required.

Inland Revenue Commissioners, [1947] 1 All E.R. 650, distinguished.\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: In 1952 the appellant was able to purchase or otherwise acquire for $9,032,382.61 Canadian, the $9,225,326.87 U.S. required to discharge the liability of $9,461,455.29 Canadian, which it had claimed and been allowed as a deduction from gross income in arriving at its trading profits in the two previous years. It thus realized in that year a gain of $431,072.68 Canadian which on the principle laid down in Eli Lilly & Co. (Canada) Ltd. v. The Minister of National Revenue, supra, and Tip Top Tailors Ltd. v. The Minister of National Revenue, supra, must be taken into the computation of profit and loss for tax purposes. This exchange gain must be taken into account in 1952, the year in which it became a reality.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an appeal from an assessment under the Income Tax Act, 1948 (Can.), c. 52 and the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148. Appeal allowed, Abbott J. dissenting.\nL. Phillips, Q.C., P. F. Vineberg, Q.C., and A. D. McAlpine, for the appellant.\nD. S. Maxwell and G. W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nLocke J.:\u2014That the difference between the amount in Canadian dollars required to satisfy the liability for the notes, as estimated in the company's accounts on December 31, 1951, and that expended for that purpose in 1952 was income within the meaning of the Income Tax Act is, in my opinion, settled by the decision of this Court in Eli Lilly v. The Minister of National Revenue2. That decision does not, however, touch the question as to whether the difference between the amount required to discharge these obligations at the time the notes were given arid the amount which it would have been necessary to pay for that purpose on December 31, 1951, was also income.\nI have read with care the evidence of the chartered accountants in this matter. It does not require expert evidence to demonstrate that, for the purpose of preparing a proper balance sheet and profit and loss statement for any manufacturing company, it is necessary to estimate throughout the year its costs of materials, raw or finished, purchased from other sources and used in manufacturing its products. A company such as the appellant is required annually to submit to its shareholders a statement as to its affairs at the end of its financial year. In a case such as the present, where the notes were payable in American exchange and the rate was fluctuating, it was necessary for the company to estimate its costs in accordance with the fluctuation of the rate from time to time during the year and to estimate the amount of the company's liability upon the notes at the rate current at the end of the fiscal year.\nIt is contended on behalf of the Minister that the fact that in the years 1950 and 1951 the amount necessary to discharge the notes given during these years was less at the end of the calendar year than that required to discharge them at the time they were given did not result in a taxable profit during those years. I agree with this contention and the contrary is not decided in Lilly's case. While the tax returns of the company for the years 1950 and 1951 showed these amounts as profit and treated them as capital gains and while the Crown contended as to the year 1950 that such so-called gains were part of the company's income, these circumstances do not affect the right of the Crown to take the stand that there was no such profit in these years.\nHowever, accepting this as being correct, the position of the Crown is not assisted. Except to the extent that some of the notes were paid prior to December 31, 1951, the position was that though, of necessity, the liability in Canadian dollars for the purchases was estimated, neither profit nor gain was realized by reason of the variation of the exchange rate. The Minister permitted the appellant to estimate its costs of production by treating the cost of its purchases, in respect of which the price was payable in American exchange, at the rate then current. In the result, however, these liabilities, with the exceptions noted, were discharged at a time when American exchange was at a discount and, accordingly, the manufacturing profits of the company for the years 1950 and 1951 were understated for very considerable amounts in each year.\nIn respect of this the Minister might, in my opinion, have made reassessments in respect of the years 1950 and 1951, when it was discovered that these amounts which might be described as exchange costs had not in fact been expended. There is no suggestion of any impropriety on the part of the taxpayer in this case but if, in the result, its costs were found to have been overstated in its returns for the years 1950 and 1951, the Minister might have made such a reassessment under the provisions of s. 42(4) of the Income Tax Act. The claim of the Crown in the present matter really amounts to an attempt to recover qua profit on exchange substantially the amounts by which the appellant's costs were overstated and its income accordingly understated for these years by adding such amounts to its income for the year 1952. This may not be done, in my opinion.\nI have had the advantage of reading and I agree with the opinion of my brother Martland to be delivered in this case and with the disposition to be made of it which is proposed.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The facts involved in this appeal, which are not in dispute, have been fully and completely stated in the judgment of the Exchequer Court3 and are here restated.\nBy a re-assessment dated August 6, 1957, the respondent added to the declared income of the appellant for its taxation year ending December 31, 1952, the sum of $431,072.68, described as \"foreign exchange profit on notes payable\". In its original notice of appeal, to the Exchequer Court, the appellant took the position that, to the extent that any such profits were made in that year, they were profits on capital rather than on revenue account and, therefore, not taxable. By amendments to the notice of appeal the appellant admitted that to the extent that it made \"foreign exchange profits on notes payable\" in 1952, such profits are of a revenue nature and are to be taken into consideration in computing its taxable income. The only dispute has to do: with the quantum of such profits in 1952.\nThe appellant is a corporation, having its head office at Toronto, most of its shares being owned by the General Electric Company of Schenectady, New York. It is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling electrical machinery and supplies of all sorts and purchases substantial quantities of needed supplies from General Electric, as well as from other suppliers in the United States. In 1950, the appellant had borrowed very substantial amounts from its Canadian bankers in the form of overdrafts. In August of that year, General Electric offered to make U.S. funds available to the appellant at a rate substantially lower than that paid to the appellant's Canadian bankers. The initial arrangement was that General Electric would defer payment of accounts for goods purchased from it by the appellant, carrying them on open account and at an interest rate of 2 per cent. Within a few weeks, however, General Electric required that any such indebtedness should be evidenced by promissory notes of the appellant payable to General Electric and all in U.S. currency.\nThese arrangements were duly carried out (the appellant, however, as before, continuing to pay cash for a portion of its purchases from General Electric) and some 25 notes were issued between August 20, 1950, and May 20, 1952. All of these notes were in respect of goods or services supplied by General Electric to the appellant except for one dated May 9, 1952, for $500,000 in U.S. funds supplied by General Electric to the appellant and used by the latter for the purchase of goods in the United States. Thirteen of these notes, issued in 1950, were payable on or before December 31, 1951. Five notes were issued in 1951, of which three were payable on or before June 30, 1952, and two were payable on or before December 31, 1952. Seven notes were issued in 1952, payable on or before June 30, 1953. All of the notes issued in 1950, which had not been paid in 1951, were replaced by a new note dated December 31, 1951, payable on or before June 30, 1953. During the currency of these notes the premium on U.S. funds over the Canadian dollar was sharply reduced, and, in 1952, the Canadian dollar was at a premium over such U.S. funds. The appellant was able to pay off all the notes at a saving, on a comparison between the cost of payment, in Canadian dollars, as between the dates of issuance and the dates of actual payment, of $512,847.12. Five of the notes issued in 1950, and aggregating $1,567,149.20, were paid off in 1951 at a saving of $81,774.44; the remaining notes, issued in 1950, 1951 and 1952 and aggregating $9,225,326.87, were paid off in 1952 at a saving of $431,072.68. It is the latter amount, which was added to the appellant's declared income, which is now in dispute.\nIt is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the total amount of $512,847.12 should be apportioned over three years as follows:\n1950 ........................................................................$ 64,675.17\n1951 ........................................................................ 259,820.23\n1952 ........................................................................ 188,351.72\nIn order to understand this contention, it is necessary to state what the appellant did in relation to its liability on the notes in question. At the time that each note was given, there was set up in the appellant's books not only the liability for the face value of the note, but a further item under \"foreign exchange\" of an amount in Canadian funds which, together with the face amount of the indebtedness, would be necessary to pay the note in U.S. funds. That, of course, was based on the premium from time to time of the U.S. dollar over the Canadian dollar. It is not disputed that such entries were correct, the total of the two amounts truly representing the appellant's then liability for the goods purchased. As shown by the schedule attached to the notice of appeal, the amounts so set up for \"foreign exchange\" in 1950 totalled $300,573.15. The exchange rate in that year had varied from a high of 10\u00bd per cent to a low of just less than 4 per cent. On December 31, 1950, the exchange rate was 6 per cent and the appellant on that date (which was the end of its fiscal year) revalued the amount of the \"foreign exchange\" premium which it would have had to provide if it had paid the existing notes in full at that date, namely, at the then rate of exchange of 6 per cent\u2014a total of $235,897.98. The difference of $64,675.17 between the total amounts it had originally set up to meet the exchange premium ($300,573.15) and that fixed for the year end ($235,897.98) was considered to be \"profit\" for that year, although no payments were made on the notes in that year. In its income tax return for the year 1950, this \"profit\" of $64,675.17 was disclosed, but as it was claimed by the appellant to be a gain on account of capital, it was not taken into income. The Minister added it to the declared income, but an appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board was allowed. From that decision the Minister lodged an appeal which was later abandoned.\nThe second schedule to the notice of appeal sets forth the computation of the appellant in respect of the \"profit\" in question for 1951. The item of $235,897.98 set up by revaluation on December 31, 1950, as the amount necessary to pay the exchange on the outstanding notes on that date was carried forward to the beginning of 1951 and to it was added the amount of foreign exchange premium necessary to pay all the new notes issued in 1951 at the rate of exchange prevailing when each note was given, the total of both sums aggregating; $404,793.26. From that aggregate, there was deducted (a) the actual exchange premiums paid on the notes which were redeemed in that year, and (b) the total of the revalued amounts of exchange necessary to pay the outstanding notes at December 31, 1951, at the then current rate of 1\u00bc per cent\u2014a total of $144,973.03. The difference of $259,820.23 was considered to be \"profit\" for the taxation year 1951. In its return for that year, the appellant showed that amount as exchange profit on notes, but claimed it to be a gain on capital account.\nSchedule 3 to the notice of appeal relates to the year 1952 in which further notes were issued, and these, together with all outstanding notes, were paid in full before December 31, 1952. The Canadian dollar throughout the year was at a premium. Accordingly, from the \"credit\" in exchange on the new notes issued in that year totalling $68,789.34, there was deducted the \"debit\" established by revaluation of the notes unpaid on December 31, 1951, namely, $62,196.80, leaving a balance of $6,592.54. That amount was deducted from $194,944.26, the amount of the actual benefits accruing to the appellant upon payment of its several notes in 1952, due to the premium on the Canadian dollar. It is contended that the difference of $188,351.72 is \"profit\" for 1952 relating to \"exchange on the notes\". In its income tax return for that year, the appellant attached Schedule 28 thereto with the same particulars as in Schedule 3 of the notice of appeal. In computing its taxable income, however, the full amount of $188,351.72 was deducted from net income, the appellant then being of the opinion that such \"profit\" was not on revenue account. It is now conceded, however, that whatever profit was made in 1952, upon payment of the notes, was a profit on revenue account.\nIt is admitted that the appellant, had it so desired, could at all relevant times have paid the notes (which admittedly were curernt liabilities) in full by having recourse to the line of credit which it had with its Canadian bankers.\nThe expert accountants, who gave evidence for the appellant, were all in agreement that the \"accrual\" system was the only suitable one for the appellant company and that, from an accounting point of view, it was proper and necessary, in order to give a true picture of the company's position, to revalue the amount of Canadian dollars necessary at each balance-sheet date to pay off the outstanding notes.\nThe Court below decided in favour of the respondent. Its decision may be briefly summarized in the following quotation from the reasons for judgment:\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the issue is one of amount only, the appellant's main contention being that the profit on exchange in 1952 was $188,351.72 and not $431,072.68, the amount added by the Minister.\nIn my view, the broad issue to be determined here is this\u2014\"When did this profit arise?\" That question, as I have suggested, is one of law, to be answered by a consideration of the Act and the relevant decisions of the Courts. By s. 3 of the 1948 Income Tax Act, \"The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year \u2026 is his income from all sources \u2026 (and) includes income for the year from all \u2026 businesses.\" Then, by s. 4, \"Income for a taxation year from a business \u2026 is the profit therefrom for the year.\"\nThe problem will, I think, be made clearer if a specific example is considered. Certain of the notes issued to General Electric in 1950 were wholly unpaid until 1952. Notwithstanding this fact, the appellant on December 31, 1950, and on December 31, 1951, in relation to these notes revalued downwards on its books the amount of Canadian dollars necessary on those dates to pay the premium then in effect on U.S. exchange. In 1951, nothing else was done in connection with these liabilities. The question, therefore, is whether in these circumstances a trader who in one year has incurred a debt in foreign currency and has left it wholly unpaid throughout the following year, is taxable under The Income Tax Act by reason of the single fact that its liability in terms of Canadian currency has decreased during that subsequent year as the result of the change downwards in exchange rates.\nAfter most careful consideration of the arguments of counsel and of the authorities cited in support of their submissions, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal on this point is not well founded and must be dismissed. I do so for the reason that the profits in question, in my opinion, were neither made nor ascertained by the mere revaluation downwards on December 31, 1950 and December 31, 1951 on the books of the company, of the amount of the premium in Canadian dollars necessary to pay the outstanding notes, but that such profits were made only upon actual payment of the several notes.\nFrom that judgment the appellant has appealed. Its position in the present appeal was stated by its counsel as follows:\nThe only difference between the parties and the subject of the present litigation is whether a \"calculated profit\" of $431,072.68 on a combination of the \"cash\" and \"accrual\" methods of computing income is attributable to 1952 as income of the appellant for that year, which is the only one of the three years now under assessment and appeal, or whether the appellant's attribution of \"income\" to 1950, 1951 and 1952 on the \"accrual\" method of computing income as reflected in the appellant's financial statements and income tax returns is correct.\nThe appellant's accrual treatment of all its current obligations in U.S. currency (including the accounts payable in question represented by notes) was accepted throughout as reported but the current liabilities evidenced by notes were singled out for different treatment only in the re-assessment made in 1957 for the appellant's 1952 taxation year. The appellant had treated all foreign currency payables and receivables, and foreign currency bank accounts in the same way and took into its profit and loss statement any income or loss resulting from a change in the rate of exchange from that which was originally recorded.\nUnder the belief, acknowledged later to be mistaken, that the issue of the notes changed the character of the liability, the appellant for the 1952 year excluded the \"gain\" on the notes. The mistaken belief has been subsequently corrected and the appellant concedes that the issue of the notes did not in any way change the liability from an ordinary trade account payable for goods purchased the same as other trade accounts payable, so that the exclusion of the \"gain\" from income for income tax purposes is no longer justified. It is the appellant's submission that the gain should be treated in exactly the same way as the gain on the other foreign currency payables, receivables, and bank accounts.\nThe respondent contends that a taxable profit is not realized and does not arise by the mere revaluation in a trader's account of the cost in Canadian dollars, at any given time, of paying off an indebtedness payable in a foreign currency. A profit arising in this way would be an unrealized profit. In the present case the profit was only realized on actual payment of the notes and that profit consisted of the difference in the amount of Canadian dollars which would have been required to pay the notes at the time of their issuance and the amount actually required when the notes were paid. No notes were paid off in 1950. Some were paid in 1951 and the balance were paid in 1952 and accordingly the respondent contends that the profit on exchange should be apportioned to the years in which the notes were actually paid, as follows:\n1951 .......................................................................$ 81,774.44\n1952 ....................................................................... 431,072.68\nThe relevant sections of the Income Tax Act are ss. 3 and 4, which provide as follows:\n3. The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of this Part is his income for the year from all sources inside or outside Canada and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes income for the year from all\n(a) businesses,\n(b) property, and\n(c) offices and employments.\n4. Subject to the other provisions of this Part, income for a taxation year from a business or property is the profit therefrom for the year.\nThe problem to be determined is as to what was the appellant's profit from its business in the year 1952. The judgment-appealed from has held that, in computing its profit for that year, the appellant must take into account the \"profit\" resulting from the fact that in that year it was able to discharge notes, payable in U.S. funds, for a lesser number of Canadian dollars than would have been required to pay them at the time of their issuance, on the ground that the \"profit\" was realized by such payment. The appellant was not, in law, for income tax purposes, entitled to compute its \"profits\", in respect of the notes, in the years 1950 to 1952 inclusive in the way in which, under its system of accounting, it had actually done.\nIn considering the validity of this conclusion, reference may first be made to some general principles which have been stated regarding the meaning of the word \"profit\" and the method of its determination.\nViscount Maugham, in Lowry (Inspector of Taxes) v. Consolidated African Selection Trust, Limited4, said:\nIt is well settled that profits and gains must be ascertained on ordinary commercial principles, and this fact must not be forgotten.\nIn this Court, in Dominion Taxicab Association v. The Minister of National Revenue5, Cartwright J. said:\nThe expression \"profit\" is not defined in the Act. It has not a technical meaning and whether or not the sum in question constitutes profit must be determined on ordinary commercial principles unless the provisions of the Income Tax Act require a departure from such principles. I do not understand the judgment appealed from to hold, nor did the respondent contend, that the method adopted by the appellant in computing its profits in the year 1952 was in contravention of any of the provisions of the Income Tax Act itself. What was held was that, on the basis of the decided cases, the appellant had realized a taxable \"profit\" of $431,072.68 in that year.\nThis raises the question as to what was the nature of the \"profit\" which the appellant has thus realized. Clearly, it consists of the difference in amount as between an actual expenditure of Canadian dollars and an estimated valuation of the cost of payment in those funds. The sole issue is as to whether, in computing taxable income for the year 1952, that valuation must necessarily be the one which was first made, when the note was issued, or whether the revised valuation, as of the beginning of the year 1952, is the one which should be used.\nTaking as an example a note issued by the appellant to its parent company in 1950 and paid in 1952, the legal position is that a debt, payable in U.S. dollars, incurred in 1950, was paid off in 1952 in U.S. dollars. Thus far there can be no question of a \"profit\" in 1952. Had the appellant operated on a \"cash\" system of accounting there would merely have been an expenditure taken into account in that year. The \"profit\" which the respondent says the appellant realized in 1952 can only be said to arise because of the fact that the appellant, under its \"accrual\" method of accounting, included the note as a liability in computing its profit for the year 1950. In setting up that liability in 1950 the appellant had to estimate the value of the note in terms of Canadian dollars. An estimate was made at the time the note was issued, but further estimates were made at the end of each month and also at the end of the financial year, December 31, 1950. The estimate for that date was made on the basis of the rate of exchange existing at that time. In my view, as it was a matter of estimation, that was the best date in 1950 on which to value the liability for the purpose of computing profit for that year. It seems to me that there is no special significance attaching to the rate of exchange existing on the date on which the note was issued, because there was no likelihood that the note would be paid on that date. In 1951, at the commencement of the year; the appellant's estimate of the liability as of the end of 1950 was carried forward. At the end of each subsequent month it was revised in accordance with the then existing exchange rate and again an estimate was made at the year end. During that year there had been a decline in the premium payable on the U.S. dollar, so that by the year end the cost to the company of paying off the U.S. obligation had declined. The liability which had been taken into account in computing profit for the year 1950 was now less than it had been in that year. In order properly to show the appellant's position in the year 1951 it was necessary for it to make this revision of estimate and thereby it disclosed a \"profit\", which was really a reduction of the liability, as previously taken into account in 1950. The appellant's position, under the \"accrual\" method of accounting, had improved. It was only because of the application of that method, in the first place, that the liability had been taken into account in terms of Canadian dollars in 1950.\nIn my opinion it was proper for the appellant to do this. Its profit or loss during the 1951 accounting period had to be ascertained by a comparison of its position at the beginning and. at the end of that period, based upon estimates of value and the accrual of debits and credits. Furthermore it should be noted that all of the 1950 notes, not paid in 1951, were due and payable by December 31, 1951. So far as the notes issued in 1951 are concerned, for the reasons already stated, I feel that the proper date on which to estimate their value in that year was at the end of the financial year on December 31, 1951.\nIn 1952 the notes were paid off and our problem is as to the \"profit\" which accrued in that year. In my view, the \"profit\" from its business, in 1952, in relation to the notes, should be the amount by which, in terms of Canadian dollars, the cost of payment was reduced in that year. This represented the difference between the estimate of the cost of payment as of the beginning of the year 1952 and the actual cost of payment in that year.\nTo summarize my view it is that there would be no \"profit\" at all in respect of the notes in the year 1952, save for the fact that their value had to be estimated, under the \"accrual\" method of accounting, in 1950 in order to determine mine the appellant's profit for that year. Being a matter of estimate, the valuation of the liability should continue to be revised in each year thereafter until the year of actual payment. If the \"profit\" for 1952 is to be the difference between an estimate and the amount of actual payment, such profit in that year should be determined on the basis: of the estimate at the beginning of that financial year.\nIt is now necessary to consider whether this conclusion is contrary to the principles established by the decided cases. There does not appear to be any decision which actually deals with this point, but reliance was placed, in the Court below, on the views expressed in a number of decisions.\nSome reliance was placed upon the decisions of this Court in Eli Lilly & Co. (Canada) Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue6, and Tip Top Tailors Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue7. However, in both those cases, as the judgment below points out, the question before the Court was as to whether certain profits resulting to the taxpayer from fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate constituted capital gains or taxable income. The point in issue now was never considered and, because of that fact, I do not think that either case is of any real assistance in determining, the issue in the present appeal. Similarly, I do not think that cases such as Davies v. The Shell Company of China, Ltd.8, which involved like issues, can aid materially in the present case.\nReference was made to J. P. Hall & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue9. In that case, the company had contracted, in March 1914, to supply electric motors with control gear between July 1, 1914, and September 30, 1915, payment to be made one month after delivery. In April 1914 it placed sub-contracts for the control gear, but, owing to the war, deliveries of control gear by the company to its purchaser were delayed and were, in fact, made between August 1914, and July 1916. Initially, the company, in its accounts, had credited the sale price of the control gear as and when it was delivered. Subsequently, however, it contended that, for the purposes of excess profits duty, the profit from the purchase and sale of control gear should be treated as arising in the accounting period in which the contracts were made. It was held, contrary to the company's contention, that the receipts in question were receipts of the accounting period in which the deliveries of control gear were actually made.\nIn that case the accounts in question were not yet receivable in the year in which the taxpayer sought to take them into income. As Lord Sterndale said, at p. 155, in answer to the contention that the profit on the transaction was ascertained and made on the completion of the contract: \"It seems to me the simple answer is it was neither ascertained nor made at that time.\"\nIn that case the debts which the taxpayer sought to take into account were not yet receivable. The issue was different from that which arises here, where the liability is, admittedly, a current liability, taken into account at an estimated figure, and where the question is as to the propriety of subsequent revisions of that estimate in determining profits.\nThe Court below found an analogy between the present case and two cases in which the taxpayer had sought to take into account future anticipated losses as actual losses in a taxation year.\nIn Whimster & Co. v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue10, a shipping company sought to include, as a loss in a particular year, an allowance in respect of losses which it anticipated in future years, by reason of a depression in the shipping business which had already set in. It was held in that case that this was not a proper deduction in the period in question, because the loss had not actually been incurred in that period.\nIn The Minister of National Revenue v. Consolidated Glass Limited11, in this Court, the issue was as to whether a reduction in the value of shares owned by the company, which it still retained, could be taken into account in computing its undistributed income in accordance with s. 73A(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, 1948, the company having elected to be assessed and to pay tax under s. 95A of that Act as enacted in 1950. This Court decided that it could not be taken into account. With respect, in my opinion, these cases are distinguishable from the present case because the situation here is not one which involves a question of anticipated future profits or losses. In the year 1951, when the appellant revised the estimate of the cost of repaying its notes, it was not doing so with a view to making an allowance in respect of anticipated profits or losses of this kind in the future. It was revising its estimate of the amount of a liability which it had actually incurred and taken into account in 1950. That liability had, in fact, reduced by the end of the year 1951, with the result that, so far as that year's operations were concerned, its profit for the year had increased by that amount.\nThe respondent cited in argument, among other authorities, Whitworth Park Coal Co. Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners12, and Gardner, Mountain & D'Ambrumenil, Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners13.\nThe first of these dealt with the question of the years in which certain income payments, payable to the company, should be assessed. The payments arose by virtue of the statutory provisions relating to the transfer of assets from the company to the National Coal Board under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946. The issue was as to whether they were assessable in the years in which they were actually paid, or whether they should be assessed in those years in respect of which the payments became due. The House of Lords held that they were assessable in the years in which the payments were actually made, but it is clear that the important element in that case was that the company had to be treated as a non-trader.\nViscount Simonds, at p. 713, says:\nThe word \"income\" appears to me to be the crucial word, and it is not easy to say what it means. The word is not defined in the Act, and I do not think that it can be defined. There are two different currents of authority. It appears to me to be quite settled that, in computing a trader's income, account must be taken of trading debts which have not yet been received by the trader. The price of goods sold or services rendered is included in the year's profit and loss account although that price has not yet been paid. One reason may be that the price has already been earned and that it would give a false picture to put the cost of producing the goods or rendering the services into his accounts as an outgoing but to put nothing against that until the price has been paid. Good accounting practice may require some exceptions, I do not know, but the general principle has long been recognised. And if in the end the price is not paid it can be written off in a subsequent year as a bad debt.\nBut the position of an ordinary individual who has no trade or profession is quite different. He does not make up a profit and loss account. Sums paid to him are his income, perhaps subject to some deductions, and it would be a great hardship to require him to pay tax on sums owing to him but of which he cannot yet obtain payment.\nHe later goes on to say:\nI certainly think that it would be wrong to hold now for the first time that a non-trader to whom money is owing but who has not yet received it must bring it into his income tax return and pay tax on it And for this purpose I think that the company must be treated as a non-trader, because the Butterley case ((1956) 2 All E.R. 197) makes it clear that these payments are not trading receipts.\nIn Gardner, Mountain & D'Ambrumenil, Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners the House of Lords reaffirmed the doctrine of the relation back of trading receipts. The appellants were a firm of underwriting agents who, under their contract of service, were entitled to commission in respect of policies underwritten by them in any year, although the amount thereof could not be quantified or paid to them until two years after the close of the relevant year. It was held that the commission was earned in the year in which the policies were underwritten and must appear in the company's accounts as a trading receipt for such year; the assessment based on the original accounts for that year had accordingly to be re-opened so as to bring in the finally ascertained sum.\nThe present case involves liabilities on notes which were properly taken into account in the years in which they were made. Neither the amount of the liabilities in this case, nor the amount of the receipts in that case, could, at the time they arose, be finally determined. But there has been no suggestion by the respondent in the present case that the final determination of liability should be taken into account in the years in which the notes were issued. Had that been done in 1950 and 1951, the appellant's income in those years would have been increased, but its income in 1952 would have been even less than the appellant itself has admitted.\nWith respect, I do not reach the conclusion that the decided authorities precluded the appellant from computing its \"profits\", in relation to the notes, in the manner which it adopted\u2014a method which, in relation to trade liabilities payable in U.S. funds other, than the notes, the respondent has never challenged, but in which, according to the uncontradicted evidence, the respondent had acquiesced, and which he had required.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the respondent's assessment for the year 1952 should be adjusted to eliminate the respondent's inclusion in income of the amount of $431,072.68 and to include in income the amount of $188,351.72. The appellant should have the costs of this appeal and its costs in the Exchequer Court.\nAbbott J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts\u2014which are not in dispute\u2014are fully stated in the reasons of the learned trial judge and in those to be delivered by my brother Martland. I am in agreement with the reasons and conclusions of the learned trial judge and there is little I can usefully add to them.\nDuring the period between August 25, 1950, and May 20, 1952, appellant issued to its parent company, notes as evidence of indebtedness, in the amount of 10,792,476.07 United States dollars. All these liabilities were incurred for stock in trade or services. During the taxation year 1951 appellant made payments on account of its U.S. dollar indebtedness amounting to $1,567,149.20 U.S., leaving a balance owing of $9,225,326.87 U.S. Since appellant maintains its accounts in Canadian dollars, a Canadian dollar equivalent of that amount, namely $9,461,455.29, had been taken into the trading accounts of appellant as a trading liability in the respective years in which the liabilities were incurred, and claimed and allowed a trading expense in determining taxable income for those years.\nIn 1952 appellant was able to purchase or otherwise acquire for $9,032,382.61 Canadian, the $9,225,326.87 U.S. required to discharge the liability of $9,461,455.29 Canadian, which it had claimed and been allowed as a deduction from gross income in arriving at its trading profits in the two previous years. It thus realized in that year a gain of $431,072.68 Canadian which on the principle laid down by this Court in the Eli Lilly & Company case and the Tip Top Tailors case must be taken into the computation of profit and loss for tax purposes. Put in another way, appellant had received goods and services worth $9,461,455.29 Canadian, which, by deferring payment until the exchange rate had moved substantially in its favour, it was able to acquire for $9,032,382.61 Canadian with a resulting profit of $431,072.68. I agree with the learned trial judge that this exchange gain must be taken into account in 1962, the year in which it became a reality.\nThe $9,461,455.21 Canadian, claimed as an expense in the respective years in which the U.S. dollar liabilities were incurred, could not be claimed as an expense in any other year, and the fallacy inherent in appellant's submission is clearly pointed out by the learned trial judge in the following terms:\nLet it be assumed that goods were purchased in the United States at a time when U.S. funds were at a premium of only 3 per cent, that notes similar to those above-mentioned were given in payment and that such notes were still outstanding at the end of the following year, by which date the premium on U.S. funds had risen to 10 per cent. In my view, the taxpayer in such circumstances could not then successfully claim a deduction of an additional 7 per cent as a further cost of goods purchased for the reason that such an expense had not actually been incurred and was a mere estimate of anticipated losses.\nParticularly in the absence of a fixed exchange rate, a liability incurred by a Canadian debtor in terms of a foreign currency must always contain a contingent element and what the appellant did, in reality, in revaluing its ILS. dollar liability at the end of each fiscal period, was merely (1) to state from time to time in its balance sheet, a revised estimate of the Canadian dollar equivalent of what it owed to its parent company in U.S. dollars and (2) to write down the amount of that indebtedness as originally entered in its books and treat the resulting \"gain\" as a capital profit, apportioned over three years. The fact that appellant used the accrual system of accounting in calculating its trading profits for each year had no relevance to this purely bookkeeping operation. No doubt the entries made by appellant in its books were proper from an accounting standpoint in order to present from time to time, as accurate a balance sheet as possible, but in my opinion they had no bearing upon the appellant's liability for income tax.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Abbott J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Borden, Elliot, Kelley & Palmer, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

Seven charges were that the petitioner counselled seven named individuals to commit perjury in their examination before the Registrar of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission held pursuant to s. 13 of The Securities Act, 1954 (Sask.), and thereby became a party to the said perjury by reason of s. 22(1) of the Criminal Code. The other charges were that he counselled and procured one L to make a false declaration on oath before an authorized person and thereby became a party to an offence under s. 114 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff applied to the Supreme Court of Canada for a writ of habeas corpus on two grounds: (1) that there was no offence at law shown in the first seven charges because the examination of the individuals before the Registrar was not a judicial proceeding within the meaning of s. 112 of the Criminal Code; and (2) that L was not a person permitted, authorized or required by law to make the said declaration within the meaning of s. 114 of the Criminal Code, and that there existed no authorization at law for the taking or receiving of these solemn declarations.\nHeld: The application was dismissed.\nUnder s. 13 of The Securities Act, 1954, the Registrar had by law authority to examine under oath. He also had the power to administer the oath if not under that section then under s. 41 of The Saskatchewan Evidence Act. Consequently, counts one to seven disclosed offences known to the law and for which the accused was properly committed for trial.\nThe jurisdiction of this Court in a writ of habeas corpus was limited to a consideration of the warrant of committal and other germane order, and if they were regular on their face, that was the end of the matter. The Court in such a writ has no more power to look at the solemn declarations alleged to have been made than it has to look at the evidence given on a preliminary hearing. No distinction can be drawn between a warrant of committal before and one after conviction.\nAPPLICATION before Judson J. in chambers for a writ of habeas corpus. Application dismissed.\nA. W. Embury, Q.C., and P. H. Gordon, Q.C., for the petitioner.\nN. L. Mathews, Q.C., and J. P. Nelligan, contra. The following judgment was delivered\nJudson J. (orally):\u2014This is an application for habeas corpus. Before I can deal intelligibly with the issues raised on the application, I think I should set out in chronological order the steps that have been taken in this prosecution before the application was launched.\nThe accused came before the magistrate on a summons containing eleven charges on which the magistrate conducted a preliminary hearing lasting seven days. He committed the accused for trial on all charges except number nine, in which he made an amendment to reduce it to \"counselling, procuring or inciting the commission of an offence\" which was not committed, under s. 407(a) of the Criminal Code.\nI should say at this point that the magistrate on that date, that is, the 30th November 1960, signed no warrant of committal. He admitted the accused to bail immediately on his own recognizance.\nOn January 23, 1961, an indictment containing eleven counts was preferred against the accused in the Court of Queen's Bench presided over by Mr. Justice Disbery. Without analyzing the counts in the indictment in detail, it is accurate, I think, to say that they are substantially in the same form as the charges contained in the summons before the magistrate, as amended.\nI can make this rough classification at this point, that the first seven counts in the indictment have to do with counselling seven named individuals to commit perjury before the Registrar under The Securities Act of Saskatchewan and an allegation that that offence of perjury was afterwards committed. The charge, therefore, on the first seven counts was that of perjury.\nCount number eight charged an attempt to obstruct and defeat the course of justice by attempting to induce the seven named individuals in the first seven counts to give false evidence in a judicial proceeding, namely, an examination before the Registrar under The Securities Act.\nCounts nine, ten and eleven have to do with procuring or inciting two named individuals to make a solemn declaration.\nI will deal with all these counts in more detail later. Counsel for the accused moved to quash all counts in the indictment. The application was dismissed by the trial judge, with the exception of count number eight on which the accused had elected a non-jury trial and on which the Crown had no right of election before a judge and jury. Count number eight, therefore, requires no further consideration here.\nThe remaining counts were then severed and the accused was arraigned on counts nine, ten and eleven. He pleaded not guilty.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence there was a motion for a directed verdict, which was rejected by the trial judge. The jury found the accused not guilty on count eleven and disagreed on counts nine and ten.\nThe trial judge then adjourned the trial on counts nine and ten and the remaining seven counts, counts one to seven, to the next sittings of the Court to be held in May 1961; and continued the bail.\nThe next step was a motion by the accused before the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the committal for trial on counts one to seven and counts nine and ten and to quash the indictments corresponding to those counts. Judgment was given dismissing this application on August 16, 1961, and on September 15, 1961, the accused launched this application for habeas corpus.\nOn September 15, 1961, the accused was still at liberty on bail, but on Monday, September 18, he appeared before Judge Hogarth and, according to the order made by Judge Hogarth on that day, surrendered himself into the custody of the judge for the purpose of satisfying the conditions of the recognizance; and applied to be relieved of his obligations under the terms of the recognizance and no longer acknowledged himself to be bound by its terms.\nThe order recites that the accused was so relieved of his obligations and then commands W. H. Williams, Sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Regina, to take the accused into custody and convey him to Regina Gaol.\nOn the same day, an order was made by a Judge of this Court directing the issue of a Writ of Habeas Corpus to W. H. Williams, the Sheriff, and to the Keeper of the Regina Gaol, to have the body of the accused before the judge making the order on September 25, 1961. At that time the accused was admitted to bail. The writ was served but no formal return to the writ has been made.\nI have before me, first of all, the recognizance entered into by the accused on November 30, 1960; a copy of the order of Judge Hogarth; and a certified copy of a warrant of committal dated November 30, 1960.I have already mentioned that this warrant was not signed on that day because the accused was immediately admitted to bail.\nThere is evidence before me that this warrant was not signed until September 21, or possibly September 22. In any event, I am not in any doubt how the accused came to be in custody and I assume that if any formal return had been made it would recite the facts that I have recited.\nThe application for habeas corpus is made on two grounds\u2014the first ground having reference to the first seven counts and the second ground having reference to counts nine and ten. The first seven counts have been referred to throughout these proceedings as the \"registrar charges\" and counts nine and then have been referred to as \"Leier charges\".\nI will set out now count number one, the first of the registrar charges. The others are in exactly the same terms but with a different name. I am quoting not from the indictment but from the summons.\nThe first charge is that the accused, during the month of January 1958, at the City of Regina, did counsel another person, to wit, one Edward Joseph Leier to commit the offence of perjury, which offence was afterwards committed by the said Edward Joseph Leier at the examination before the Registrar of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission held pursuant to s. 13 of The Securities Act, 1954, on the 23rd day of January, A.D. 1958, by swearing falsely to the following effect:\n(a) that he did not make certain representations to prospective purchasers of shares in Columbia Metals Exploration Co. Ltd., including statements regarding the listing of the shares, the resultant increase in the price of the shares, the financial position of the said Company, and its association with other companies, including the Ford Motor Company, and (b) that the information contained in the said representations was not given to him by Walter Luboff, and\n(c) that he could not remember certain facts which he did actually remember,\nwhile knowing the same to be false and with intent to mislead the said Registrar contrary to the Criminal Code, and did thereby become a party to the said perjury by virtue of 22(1) of the Criminal Code.\nWhen the Registrar charges became the first seven counts in the indictment the application to quash was based on the same argument that has been addressed to me on this motion for habeas corpus. Its outlines are set out in the Notice of the application.\nThe argument is that there is no offence at law shown in these counts, because the examination before the Registrar of the Saskatchewan Securities Commission which he is said to have held under s. 13 of The Securities Act, 1954, is not a judicial proceeding within s. 112 of the Criminal Code. Section 112 of the Criminal Code reads:\nEvery one commits perjury who, being a witness in a judicial proceeding, with intent to mislead gives false evidence, knowing that the evidence is false.\n\"Judicial proceeding\" is defined in s. 99 of the Code. I think the only subsection that I am concerned with is para. (iv) of subs. (c), which reads:\n(c) \"judicial proceeding\" means a proceeding\n* * *\n(iv) before an arbitrator or umpire, or a person or body of persons authorized by law to make an inquiry and take evidence therein under oath,\n* * *\nI next set out s. 13 of The Saskatchewan Securities Act, which reads:\n13. The registrar may and shall when so directed by the commission require any further information or material to be submitted by any applicant or any registered person or company within a specified time and may require verification by affidavit or otherwise of any information or material then or previously submitted or may require the applicant or the registered person or any partner, officer, director or employee of the registered person or company to submit to examination under oath. Counsel for the applicant submits that this section does not authorize the registrar to make an inquiry or examination. His argument is that if it did so authorize the registrar the concluding words of the section would be, not \"to submit to examination under oath\" but \"to submit to examination under oath before him\".\nThat is reducing the argument to its simplest elements. The answer that is made by the Crown to it is that the plain meaning of the section is that the registrar has this power to require the named person, in this case, to submit to examination under oath and that the section cannot mean anything else but submit to examination under oath before him.\nTwo other parts of the Act are referred to in support of that argument. The first is s. 2(5) (f), which defines \"fraud\", in part, as\nthe making of a material false statement in any application, information, material or evidence submitted or given to the commission or the registrar under the provisions of this Act or the regulations, or in any prospectus or return filed with the commission;\nThe subsection that I have just read, it is argued, contemplates the giving of information, material or evidence to the registrar.\nSection 65(1) (c) is also relevant. It provides:\n65. (1) Every person, including any officer, director, official or employee of a company, who is knowingly responsible for\n* * *\n(c) the making of any material false statement in any application, information, statement, material or evidence submitted or given under this Act or the regulations to the commission, its representative, the registrar or any person appointed to make an investigation or audit under this Act;\nI have no doubt, after listening to the two arguments and the reading of the sections that I have already mentioned, that the registrar has the power under s. 13 to take evidence and to take evidence under oath.\nThat was Mr. Justice Disbery's opinion when he dismissed the motion to quash, and it is also my opinion.\nI think it is the plain meaning of s. 13 that the registrar may require this particular person to give this information under oath, to submit to examination under oath and before the registrar. To what other possible place or person could he send the man for examination? If the person to conduct the examination is the registrar, I think it is implicit in the terms of the section too that the registrar can administer the oath. In any event, there is s. 41 of The Saskatchewan Evidence Act which I had better set out in full:\n41. Every court, judge, police magistrate, justice of the peace, arbitrator or other person now or hereafter having by law or by consent of parties authority to hear, receive and examine evidence may administer an oath to any witness who is legally called before such court, judge, police magistrate, justice of the peace, arbitrator or other person respectively.\nIn my opinion the registrar, under s. 13, has by law authority to examine under oath. I think he has, by s. 13, also the power to administer the oath, but if he has not got that power by s. 13 of The Securities Act, I think he has it by s. 41 of the Evidence Act.\nI am therefore holding that counts one to seven do disclose offences known to the law and that the accused was properly committed for trial on those charges and that to that extent the motion to quash the committal on those charges fails.\nI turn now to counts nine and ten, referred to as the Leier charges. I set out count nine in full:\n9. And further, that you during the month of August A.D. 1958 at the said City of Regina unlawfully did counsel or procure one Edward Joseph Leier who, not being a witness in a judicial proceeding but being permitted or authorized by law to make a statement by solemn declaration, to make in such statement before a person who is authorized by law to permit it to be made before her, assertions with respect to matters of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge knowing the said assertions to be false, and thereby to be a party to an offence against the Criminal Code section 114, which offence was afterwards committed by the said Edward Joseph Leier by solemn declaration declared at the said City of Regina on the 14th day of August A.D. 1958, and you did thereby become a party to the said offence against section 114 of the Criminal Code by virtue of section 22(1) of the Criminal Code.\nCount number ten is in the same terms, with this exception, that the solemn declaration referred to was simply dated \"in the month of August 1958\". Section 114 of the Criminal Code reads:\n114. Every one who, not being a witness in a judicial proceeding but being permitted, authorized or required by law to make a statement by affidavit, by solemn declaration or orally under oath, makes in such a statement, before a person who is authorized by law to permit it to be made before him, an assertion with respect to a matter of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge, knowing that the assertion is false, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years. The attack on these two counts is made on these grounds\u2014 that Leier was not a person permitted, authorized or required by law to make the solemn declarations referred to in counts nine and ten and that there exists no authorization at law for the taking or receiving of these solemn declarations.\nThe argument is that the phrase \"permitted, authorized or required by law\" to make a statement, means permitted, authorized or required by some substantive law; that the Crown must point to some statute which permits, authorizes or requires Leier to make these solemn declarations, and that there is no such statutory authorization.\nThe Crown's submission in answer to that is that Leier is permitted by s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act to make this declaration if Part I of the Canada Evidence Act is applicable and, if it is not so applicable, he is permitted under provincial law to make the declaration; and that the purpose of the declaration may very well determine which law is applicable and the determination of the purpose is a matter of evidence for the jury.\nAll that I have before me is the declaration itself. The declaration does refer to a statement of claim in an action brought by a plaintiff, whose name I cannot read, against Columbia Metals Exploration Co. Ltd., Western Bond and Share Corporation Limited, William Luboff, John J. Abbott, Edward Leier and Laurence Tetrault.\nThis brings me to the question of what use may be made of this material on a motion for habeas corpus before a judge of this Court.\nThe Crown's submission is that I am limited to looking at the warrant of committal and that I cannot look at these declarations and the statement of claim any more than I can look at the evidence\u2014seven or eight volumes of it\u2014 given on the preliminary hearing.\nThe basis for that submission is to be found in a number of cases decided in this Court going back to In re Trepanier1. This and the other cases to which I propose to refer in a moment have to do with motions for habeas corpus after a conviction. The present application is brought in a case where there has been no conviction but only a committal for trial and a bill of indictment preferred. It is suggested that that makes a difference and I will deal with that later.\nIn Re Trepanier an application was made to a judge of this Court on behalf of a person arrested on a warrant issued on a conviction, for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. The application was dismissed. Chief Justice Ritchie said, at p. 113:\nThe jurisdiction of the magistrate being unquestionable over the subject-matter of complaint and the person of the prisoner, and there being no ground for alleging that the magistrate acted irregularly or beyond his jurisdiction, and the conviction and warrant being admitted to be regular, the only objection being that the magistrate erred on the facts and that the evidence did not justify the conclusion as to the guilt of the prisoner arrived at by the magistrate, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that we cannot go behind the conviction and inquire into the merits of the case by the use of the writ of habeas corpus.\nIt was also pointed out that there is no jurisdiction in this Court to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of habeas corpus. The certiorari provisions in the Supreme Court Act have to do with appellate jurisdiction and not with jurisdiction in matters of habeas corpus which is concurrent with that of jurisdiction of the judges of the Superior Courts of the provinces.\nThe next case I refer to is Ex parte Macdonald2. That was also an application for habeas corpus after there had been a conviction. At p. 687, the judgment reads:\nI believe therefore that the jurisdiction of a judge of the Supreme Court in matters of habeas corpus in any criminal case, is limited to an inquiry into the cause of commitment, that is, as disclosed by the warrant of commitment, under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nFinally on that point, in the case of In re Goldhar3, the principle to be found in the previous cases reported in the court is reaffirmed in the plainest terms. For example, Chief Justice Kerwin, at p. 435, says:\nThe Calendar is a certificate regular on its face that the appellant was convicted by a court of competent criminal jurisdiction and therefore it is impossible to go behind it on an application for habeas corpus; Re Trepanier (1885) 12 S.C.R. 111; Re Sproule (1886) 12 S.C.R. 140; In re Henderson (1930) S.C.R. 45, 1 D.L.R. 420. 52 C.C.C. 95. And to the same effect in the judgment of Mr. Justice Fauteux, at p. 439:\nThe question, which counsel for the appellant admittedly sought to be determined by way of habeas corpus proceedings, is stated in the reasons for judgment of other members of the Court. In my view, it is one which would require the consideration of the evidence at trial and which, in this particular case, extends beyond the scope of matters to be inquired under a similar process. To hold otherwise would be tantamount to convert the writ of habeas corpus into a writ of error or an appeal and to confer, upon every one having authority to issue the writ of habeas corpus, an appellate jurisdiction over the orders and judgments of even the highest Courts. It is well settled that the functions of such a writ do not extend beyond an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the Court by which process the subject is held in custody and into the validity of the process upon its face.\nIn my opinion the jurisdiction of this Court is similarly limited in an inquiry into a committal for trial. In the absence of power to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of habeas corpus, a judge of this Court has no power to look at the evidence at the preliminary hearing or to receive affidavit evidence relating to it.\nMy jurisdiction is limited to a consideration of the warrant of committal and the other material that I have referred to\u2014the recognizances and the order of Judge Hogarth. I cannot look at evidence, whether a transcript of the evidence at the preliminary hearing or evidence sought to be introduced by way of affidavit identifying a portion of such evidence.\nI am founding my reasons on this branch of the case entirely on that principle and I am expressing no opinion on the point on which I heard full argument\u2014whether there does exist, by virtue of provincial legislation, permission to take a declaration of this kind.\nIt was suggested that that power is to be found in 1835 legislation enacted in the United Kingdom and that that legislation is still in force in some way in the Province of Saskatchewan. The applicant, on the other hand, says that that legislation cannot have been in force after the year 1907 when The Saskatchewan Evidence Act was enacted. If that is so, any statutory declaration made in Saskatchewan before the 1959 amendment to the Evidence Act is invalid unless it comes within Part I of the Canada Evidence Act. I am expressing no opinion on that point, but founding my judgment on the lack of jurisdiction in this Court to do more than examine the warrant of committal, and to find that, if it is regular on its face, that is the end of the matter. I am drawing no distinction between a warrant of committal after conviction. I see no distinction in principle between the two.\nThe application will therefore be dismissed.\nThe judgment will issue on the 10th October, 1961, to afford the applicant an opportunity to apply to the full Court on that date for bail and, in the meantime, I continue the bail.\nApplication dismissed.\n1 (1885), 12 S.C.R. 111.\n2 (1896), 27 S.C.R. 683.\n3 [1960] S.C.R. 431, 33 CR. 71, 126 C.C.C. 337, 25 D.L.R.

The offer was accepted together with a deposit of $10,000, the full purchase price being $300,000. A few days before the date of closing, an officer of the defendant company asked permission to withdraw the offer of purchase and offered to forfeit the deposit, The plaintiff company refused to do so. When the purchaser failed to complete the contract, the vendor placed the property on the market once more and instituted an action for damages for breach of contract, The purchaser's defence was that the title offered by the vendor was not a clear title. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal found that the defence had no merit. The purchaser appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe purchaser company did not validly justify its refusal to complete the purchase and must therefore compensate the vendor. The technicality of the objections to the title coupled with the purchaser's conduct showed clearly that the refusal to sign the deed of sale was based solely on its desire not to proceed with the purchase. The purchaser never allowed the vendor to remove the objections to title and showed complete lack of good faith.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Ralston J.

D.SHALDICH SECRETARY\nSur acceptation de l'offre, Me Rohrlick, qui partageait alors son bureau d'avocat avec le notaire Isaac Kert, donna instructions \u00e0 ce dernier de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'examen des titres de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de l'acte de vente. A ces fins, le notaire entra en communication avec J. T. L. Shum qui, pour le compte de Stikeman and Co., avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de la vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e. Par une lettre en date du 16 juin, Shum, \u00e0 ce autoris\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, instruisait le notaire Kert de commander copie de tous documents n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de l'acte et le priait d'y proc\u00e9der diligemment pour assurer que le texte en soit soumis \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e avant le premier ao\u00fbt, jour fix\u00e9 pour son ex\u00e9cution. Plus d'un mois plus tard, le notaire fit rapport de ses travaux j \u00e0 Me Rohrllck et le jour suivant, 26 juillet, il pr\u00e9para et soumit le projet d'acte de vente aux avocats de l'intim\u00e9e.\nLe m\u00eame jour, d'autre part, soit le 26 juillet, E. J. Leranbaum, tr\u00e9sorier de la compagnie appelante se rendait \u00e0 St. Catharines, Ontario, pour obtenir de l'intim\u00e9e la permission de retirer l'offre de l'appelante. Au cours de l'entrevue qu'il eut \u00e0 cette fin avec C. F. Woodward, vice-pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie intim\u00e9e, et E. Staub, l'un des directeurs d'icelle, il invoqua, comme unique motif de sa demande, le fait que l'appelante avait modifi\u00e9 ses plans et que, partant, elle n'avait plus besoin de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9; il offrit d'abandonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e la somme de $10,000 jointe \u00e0 l'offre d'achat. Cette proposition fut refus\u00e9e sur-le-champ.\nLe jour suivant, les avocats de l'intim\u00e9e retournaient au notaire le projet d'acte de vente avec une r\u00e9solution en approuvant le texte et en autorisant la signature.\nUn ou deux jours apr\u00e8s, soit le 28 ou 29 juillet, Me Rohrlick demanda d'ajourner au 4 ao\u00fbt l'ex\u00e9cution de l'acte de vente. Mais advenant le 4 ao\u00fbt, il informa l'intim\u00e9e que sa. cliente refusait de le signer.\nDevant ce refus, l'intim\u00e9e remit sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en vente et poursuivit l'appelante en dommages pour rupture de contrat.\nEn d\u00e9fense l'appelante soumit, en substance, que le titre-de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 offert par l'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas un titre clair. Elle pr\u00e9tendit, principalement, que des servitudes en faveur de Bell Telephone Company of Canada et de Shawinigan Water and Power Company et deux hypoth\u00e8ques\u2014l'une en faveur de Royal Trust Company et l'autre en faveur de Montreal Trust Company\u2014grevaient l'immeuble. Soumettant que l'intim\u00e9e avait ainsi fait d\u00e9faut de satisfaire, dans le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'offre d'achat, \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me condition, des conditions de vente y mentionn\u00e9es, elle conclut qu'elle \u00e9tait relev\u00e9e de l'obligation r\u00e9sultant du contrat form\u00e9 par l'acceptation de son offre. En Cour d'appel comme en Cour sup\u00e9rieure on jugea cette d\u00e9fense mal fond\u00e9e.\nOn consid\u00e9ra, en Cour d'appel comme en Cour sup\u00e9rieure, que le titre offert par l'appelante rencontrait substantiellement les conditions mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'offre d'achat. En Cour d'appel, particuli\u00e8rement, on jugea que les objections faites par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient en l'esp\u00e8ce non fond\u00e9es, frivoles, techniques, sans importance mat\u00e9rielle ou facilement rem\u00e9diables. On consid\u00e9ra en outre que l'intim\u00e9e aurait s\u00fbrement\u2014tel que d'ailleurs la lettre \u00e9crite le 16 juin par Shum au notaire Kert en manifestait virtuellement le d\u00e9sir\u2014effectu\u00e9 toutes corrections exigibles si simplement l'appelante en avait fait la demande ou avait au moins signal\u00e9 ces griefs en temps utile; que de la date de l'acceptation de l'offre au jour fix\u00e9 pour l'ex\u00e9cution de l'acte de vente, pour la prise de possession et pour le paiement de la balance du prix, l'appelante n'avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e aucune indication quelconque de ces griefs; et que les objections, faites subs\u00e9quemment, au titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou au certificat de recherches, \u00e9taient le fruit d'une arri\u00e8re-pens\u00e9e, n\u00e9e du d\u00e9sir de se d\u00e9gager de l'offre d'achat, d\u00e9sir auquel l'intim\u00e9e avait refus\u00e9 de donner suite nonobstant l'offre de l'appelante de lui abandonner la somme de $10,000.\nLa v\u00e9ritable question \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer est celle du principe de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'appelante. Sur le quantum des dommages, aucune raison n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise pour justifier cette Cour de modifier le montant arr\u00eat\u00e9, par convention entre les parties, pour corriger les erreurs cl\u00e9ricales qu'elles avaient constat\u00e9es au jugement rendu en premi\u00e8re instance.\nComme les juges de la Cour d'appel et celui de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, je suis d'avis que l'appelante n'a pas validement justifi\u00e9 son refus d'ex\u00e9cuter l'acte de vente et qu'elle doit compenser l'intim\u00e9e pour les dommages lui r\u00e9sultant de cette inex\u00e9cution.\nL'opinion ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9e, qu'on s'est form\u00e9e en Cour du banc de la reine, sur le caract\u00e8re des griefs de l'appelante et sur la port\u00e9e qui devait leur \u00eatre donn\u00e9e dans la question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est, \u00e0 mon avis, bien fond\u00e9e. Dans les raisons de jugement \u00e9mises, en particulier, par M. le Juge Owen, avec le concours de la majorit\u00e9 de ses coll\u00e8gues, celui-ci dispose de fa\u00e7on enti\u00e8rement satisfaisante des pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelante. C'est ainsi, par exemple, que relativement aux hypoth\u00e8ques invoqu\u00e9es par celle-ci, il note avec justesse que l'hypoth\u00e8que en faveur de Royal Trust Company \u00e9tait \u00e9teinte par confusion et que le titre le constatant \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9; que l'hypoth\u00e8que en faveur de Montreal Trust Company n'affectait pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue, mais simplement la ligne de transmission de la Shawinigan Water and Power Company. Je ne vois rien d'utile \u00e0 ajouter aux raisons du savant juge auxquelles il est suffisant de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer.\nLe caract\u00e8re de ces griefs; le singulier silence de l'appelante, son d\u00e9faut de les signaler en temps opportun pour obtenir les corrections dont la demande pouvait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e; le fait que son notaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 virtuellement invit\u00e9 par la lettre de Shum \u00e0 faire le n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer l'ex\u00e9cution de la convention; sa proposition de retirer l'offre et d'abandonner les $10,000 l'accompagnant; bref, toutes les circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce manifestent que le refus de l'appelante de signer l'acte de vente \u00e9tait nullement fond\u00e9 sur le motif qu'elle a plaid\u00e9 mais, en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et comme l'a laiss\u00e9 entendre le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et l'ont clairement affirm\u00e9 les juges de la Cour d'appel, \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 uniquement par le d\u00e9sir de se lib\u00e9rer des obligations r\u00e9sultant de l'acceptation de son offre d'achat.\nLa bonne foi est de l'essence des conventions. Elle doit pr\u00e9sider non seulement \u00e0 leur formation mais aussi \u00e0 leur ex\u00e9cution. La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des contrats en d\u00e9pend. Le principe n'est pas nouveau. Dans Dalloz, Nouveau R\u00e9pertoire, vol. 1, p. 749, n\u00b0 77, on l'exprime ainsi:\nTout contrat impose \u00e0 chacune des parties l'obligation d'agir de bonne foi. Le manquement \u00e0 cette obligation, dans l'ex\u00e9cution d'un contrat, constitue un dol qu'il ne faut pas confondre avec le dol dans la formation d'un contrat.\nDans Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, 2e \u00e9d., tome VI, p. 508, n\u00b0 379, on lit ce qui suit:\nLes conventions doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es de bonne foi, dit l'article 1134. H\u00e9ritage du droit romain o\u00f9, en dehors des autres sens qu'elle a encore aujourd'hui, elle avait surtout une port\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise dans les actions de bonne foi, s'opposant aux actions de droit strict, l'id\u00e9e n'a actuellement dans l'article 1134 qu'une port\u00e9e plus floue. Elle signifie que tout contractant doit agir en honn\u00eate homme dans tout ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat. Ne pas agir en honn\u00eate homme constitue une faute. D\u00e8s lors, en ce qui concerne le d\u00e9biteur, il s'agit de savoir ce \u00e0 quoi il est tenu en vertu du contrat. C'est parce que le contrat ni la loi ne pr\u00e9cisent jamais compl\u00e8tement quels doivent \u00eatre ses agissements, et que c'est donc le juge qui doit dire quelle conduite il devait tenir en pr\u00e9sence des circonstances particuli\u00e8res o\u00f9 il s'est trouv\u00e9, qu'on dit, \u00e0 titre de directive, que cette con- chiite doit \u00eatre conforme \u00e0 la bonne foi. On entend par l\u00e0 que sa conduite doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9e non pas seulement sous l'angle de la prudence et de l'habilet\u00e9, mais aussi sous l'angle de l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9.\nVoir aussi: Mignault, Droit Civil Canadien, vol. 5, p. 264; Trudel, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil du Qu\u00e9bec, vol. 7, p. 345.\nLes tribunaux ne s'autoriseront pas de ce principe pour modifier les termes de la convention \u00e0 laquelle les parties ont donn\u00e9 leur accord de volont\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e, qui avait assum\u00e9 l'obligation de fournir un titre conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la deuxi\u00e8me condition des conditions de vente, devait sans doute, s'il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que son titre ne correspondait pas aux exigences de cette condition, y apporter les rectifications qui s'imposaient. L'obligation par elle assum\u00e9e ne comprenait pas cependant celle de deviner toutes les objections techniques que l'appelante pouvait \u00eatre susceptible de soulever et qu'un tribunal, ult\u00e9rieurement saisi de la question du m\u00e9rite de ces objections, aurait possiblement pu trouver fond\u00e9es. Il appartenait \u00e0 l'appelante, dont le notaire \u00e9tait au surplus virtuellement autoris\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 faire le n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la pr\u00e9paration de l'acte de vente en temps utile, de signaler \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e les rectifications auxquelles elle pouvait pr\u00e9tendre avoir droit.\nAssumant m\u00eame que l'intim\u00e9e avait l'obligation d'anticiper la possibilit\u00e9 de ces griefs et la possibilit\u00e9 que l'appelante en exigerait le redressement, je dirais que l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait raisonnablement justifi\u00e9e d'inf\u00e9rer de toutes les circonstances de cette cause que l'appelante n'y attachait aucune importance et n'entendait pas s'en pr\u00e9valoir. Ces circonstances, et particuli\u00e8rement la conduite de l'appelante en l'esp\u00e8ce rendaient n\u00e9cessaire une mise en demeure de sa part.\nAussi bien, je dirais avec la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'appel que l'appelante a la responsabilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9parer le dommage r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution de ses obligations. Je renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Monette, Filion & Labelle, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Hugessen, Macklaier, Chisholm, Smith & Davis, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

This decision was set aside by a majority of the Court of Appeal. The widow then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The Board's return on the motion, consisting of simply the application for compensation and the decision, was a proper one and there was no error on the face of the record. There was error in compelling the Board to supplement its return in the absence of any question going to jurisdiction.\nThe issue\u2014whether there was an accident arising out of and in the course of employment\u2014was unquestionably within the jurisdiction of the Board under Part I of the Workmen's Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 370, s. 76(1), and even if there was error, whether in law or fact, it was made within the exercise of the jurisdiction and was not open to any judicial review, including certiorari. Dominion Canners Ltd. v. Costanza, [1923] S.C.R. 46; O'Krane v. Alcyon Shipping Co. Ltd., [1961] S.C.R. 299, followed; Acme Home Improvement Ltd. v. Workmen's Compensation Board (1957), 23 W.W.R. 545, approved.\nThe submission that s. 76(1) of the Act was ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature on the ground that it infringed s. 96 of the British North America Act was abandoned in this Court. If an argument based on that ground was untenable (Workmen's Compensation Bd. v. C.P.R., [1920] A.C. 184; Kowanko v. J. H. Tremblay Co. [1920] 1 W.W.R. 787; Attorney-General of Quebec v. Stenec and Grimstead (1933), 54 Que. K.B. 230; Reference re The Adoption Act, [1938] S.C.R. 398; Labour Relations Bd. of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works Ltd. [1949] A.C. 134, referred to), the appellant's other argument based upon right of access to the courts fell with it. Its rejection as far as this Board was concerned was implicit in the judgments in the Dominion Canners case and in the Alcyon case. The restrictions on the legislative powers of the province to confer jurisdiction on boards must be derived by implication from the provisions of s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act. Short of an infringement of this section, if the legislation is otherwise within the provincial power, there is no constitutional rule against the enactment of s. 76(1).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Manson J. which had set aside a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Board and ordered the Board to assess compensation to the applicant.

Cleary, for the Attorney-General of Alberta. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] allowing an appeal from a judgment of Manson J. which had set aside a decision of the Workmen's Compensation Board and issued an order of mandamus directing the Board to assess and pay the compensation payable to the appellant. The appellant is the widow of the late John Farrell, who died in February 1959 while working at the North Vancouver General Hospital. She applied for compensation on behalf of herself and four children.\nThe Board decided that the workman died from natural causes and that his death was not the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. Following this decision, the appellant moved in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for mandamus with certiorari in aid. The material filed by the Board on the return of the motion was simply the application for compensation and the decision. As a result of further proceedings, the Court ordered the Board to file all the material that it had before it at the time it considered the appellant's claim, including a transcript of the evidence given at the inquest on the deceased workman. The material showed that the workman, unknown to himself or to anyone else, suffered from a serious heart disease and that he was found dead after having engaged in some physical exertion which his work at the hospital required.\nThe learned judge who heard the motion examined the material before him and came to a conclusion contrary to that of the Board. He held that the death was the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of employment, and directed the assessment and payment of compensation to the widow and dependents. It is, I think, plain that the learned judge really conducted a rehearing of the whole application by way of appeal, which is a procedure not provided by the Act and beyond the competence of a judge sitting on a motion for certiorari. His decision was properly set aside by the Court of Appeal.\nI agree with the majority reasons of the Court of Appeal that the Board's return, consisting of the application and its decision, was a proper one, that there was no error in law on the face of the record, and that there was error in compelling the Board to supplement its return in the absence of any question going to jurisdiction.\nThe issue here is a very simple one\u2014whether there was an accident arising out of and in the course of employment. This issue is unquestionably within the jurisdiction of the Board under Part I of the Act and even if there was error, whether in law or fact, it was made within the exercise of the jurisdiction and is not open to any judicial review, including certiorari. Section 76(1) of the Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 370, provides:\n76. (1) The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into, hear, and determine all matters and questions of fact and law arising under this Part, and the action or decision of the Board thereon shall be final and conclusive and shall not be open to question or review in any Court, and no proceedings by or before the Board shall be restrained by injunction, prohibition, or other process or proceeding in any Court or be removable by certiorari or otherwise into any Court; and without restricting the generality of the foregoing the Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into, hear, and determine:\n(a) The question whether an injury has arisen out of or in the course of an employment within the scope of this Part.\nTwo decisions of this Court have held that no Court has the power to decide in an action whether the case is one for compensation under the Act and whether the right of action is taken away under Part I. These decisions are: Dominion Canners Limited v. Costanza[3], and Alcyon Shipping Co. Ltd. v. O'Krane[4]. They are not confined in their application to the precise point under Part I of the Act which fell to be decided in them. They are of general application to all questions which arise for decision under Part I of the Act and which, by the very terms of s. 76(1), are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board and on which the decision of the Board is final and conclusive and not open to judicial review. This is the essential basis of the judgment under appeal and of the judgment of the same Court in Acme Home Improvement Limited v. Workmen's Compensation Board[5],and I am in complete agreement. A constitutional issue was raised on the hearing. The learned judge who heard the motion held that s. 76(1) was ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature on two grounds:\n(1) That the Legislature has no jurisdiction to prevent a review by the Courts of a decision of the Board upon questions of law since that deprives the subject of his right of access to the Courts.\n(2) That by such legislation the Board is constituted a superior District or County Court or a tribunal analogous thereto and the members thereof, not having been appointed by the Governor-General in Council pursuant to s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act, have no power or authority to exercise judicial functions.\nThe Court of Appeal ruled against both these grounds and on appeal to this Court, counsel for the applicant abandoned any attack on the Board on the ground of infringement of s. 96 of the British North America Act. It is very questionable whether there could be any profitable argument on this point after the judgments in Workmen's Compensation Board v. C.P.R.[6], Kowanko v. J. H. Tremblay Co.[7], Attorney-General of Quebec v. Slanec and Grimstead[8], Reference re The Adoption Act[9], and Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works Ltd.[10]\nIf an argument based upon s. 96 of the British North America Act is untenable, the other argument based upon right of access to the courts falls with it. Its rejection as far as this Board is concerned is implicit in the judgments in the Dominion Canners case and in the Alcyon case. The restrictions on the legislative power of the province to confer jurisdiction on boards must be derived by implication from the provisions of s. 96 of the British North America Act. Short of an infringement of this section, if the legislation is otherwise within the provincial power, there is no constitutional rule against the enactment of s. 76(1).\nI would dismiss the appeal without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the applicant, appellant: Shulman, Tupper, Worrall & Berger, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ladner, Downs, Ladner, Locke, Clark and Lenox, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960-61), 33 W.W.R. 433, 26 D.L.R.

Mastracchio, [1962] S.C.R. 53\nDate: 1961-10-03\nBanque Canadienne Nationale (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nDonato Mastracchio (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1961: May 18, 19; 1961: October 3.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Martland JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nContracts\u2014Disappearance of money from safe deposit box\u2014Bank's contractual liability\u2014Whether failure to take ordinary precautions\u2014 Master key used by unauthorized person\u2014Burden of proof\u2014Evidence\u2014 Civil Code, arts. 1018, 1242\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 312.\nFor a number of years the plaintiff, through a pr\u00eate-nom, had a safety deposit box in one of the defendant's branches in Montreal. Clause 7 of the agreement provided that the bank's liability was limited to taking ordinary precautions to prevent the opening of the box save by the plaintiff or his agent; and that the total or partial loss of the contents of the box did not constitute a presumption that the box had been opened by a person other than the plaintiff or his agent. The master key in the possession of the bank and one of the duplicate keys in the possession of the plaintiff were required to open the box.\nIn January 1956, the plaintiff placed in the box a total of $12,750 in Canadian and American currency. When he opened the box again some two weeks later, this amount was missing. The plaintiff claimed that the bank's employees had not taken sufficient care or precaution. The bank pleaded that it was only obliged to take ordinary precautions to prevent the box from being opened by a person other than the plaintiff or his agent. The trial judge maintained the action, and this judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. The bank appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J.: The plaintiff's evidence that he had put the money in the box and that it had disappeared was believed by the trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal. There was no reason to disturb their findings in view of the evidence of carelessness on the part of the bank.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott and Martland JJ.: The evidence went beyond the mere proof of the disappearance or loss of the contents of the safety deposit box. It established not only the occurrence of that loss, but also the fact that the plaintiff had not, nor any person authorized by him, removed those contents and thus that the money had been removed by an unauthorized person. The evidence also established that there had been specific instances of failure by the defendant to exercise ordinary precautions to prevent the opening of the box by an unauthorized person and that one of these failures might have contributed to the opening of the box by an unauthorized person. Clause 7 did not go so far as to require the plaintiff to prove by other evidence that an unauthorized person had gained access to the box. The plaintiff had made out a prima facie case. The defendant had failed to discharge the burden of showing that on the balance of probabilities none of these breaches of its duty had caused the loss.\nPer Taschereau J., dissenting: This was not a contract of deposit, but one of ordinary lease. There was no presumption against the defendant, either under the civil law or the contract. The burden was on the plaintiff to establish that the defendant had not taken the ordinary precautions to prevent the opening of the box by an unauthorized person and that the consequence of that negligence, if it existed, was the loss for which he was claiming. The plaintiff had failed to establish by a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Pr\u00e9vost J. Appeal dismissed, Taschereau J. dissenting.\nC. A. Geoffrion, Q.C., A. Gerin-Lajoie, Q.C., and Hazen Hansard, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nM. G. Robitaille, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014I agree that it is necessary first to construe the \"bail de coffret de suret\u00e9\" and that the important clause is no. 7. The first sentence limits the responsibility of the bank to take the ordinary precautions to prevent the opening of the safety deposit box by a person other than the respondent or his \"fond\u00e9 de pouvoir\". The second sentence reads as follows:\nLa disparition ou la perte totale ou partielle des objects et valeurs d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans la coffret ne constitue pas une pr\u00e9somption que le coffret a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert par une autre personne que le sous-sign\u00e9 ou son fond\u00e9 de pouvoir.\nIt is quite true that the box cannot be opened without one of the two keys given by the bank to Miss Sawka as \"pr\u00eate-nom\" of the respondent and which, according to his testimony, had been in his possession continuously. However, on the other hand, the box could not be opened without the master key retained by the bank.\nThe evidence shows that the bank throughout was very careless. Although at the conclusion of the period for which one rents the box the lock is supposed to be changed before renting it to another, that was not done in the case of the respondent with respect to the box in question. The previous rentor testified that he had kept the keys while he had rented the box and returned the keys to the bank upon giving it up, but in not one instance with relation to the particular box was the respondent required to sign the list of \"authorized signatures\" when he used the box, and we were told by counsel for the appellant that this occurred with reference to about five per cent of all the boxes. Again the rules and instructions to the bank employees provide that the \"locataire\" of a box or his representative is never to have access alone in the vault; someone should accompany each such person. Contrary to these instructions, to quote the appellant's factum, \"it was also shown that visitors to the safety deposit boxes at the branch in question were occasionally left alone in the vault\".\nThe respondent testified that he had put the money in the box on January 5, 1956, and that when he returned and opened the box on January 17, 1956, the money was gone. The trial judge believed the respondent and I am unable to read his reasons as indicating that he merely did so because he felt that otherwise he would be in effect declaring that the respondent was a perjurer. The trial judge referred to the peculiar circumstances but I can read his reasons in no other way than that, notwithstanding these circumstances and in view of all the evidence, he believed the testimony of the respondent. The majority of the Court of Appeal agreed with him and I can see no reason to disturb their findings in view of all the circumstances set out above.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting):\u2014Depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, le demandeur-intim\u00e9 est un client de la Banque Canadienne Nationale, o\u00f9 il a gard\u00e9 un d\u00e9p\u00f4t d'\u00e9pargnes substantiel \u00e0 la succursale rue Ste-Catherine 334 est, Montr\u00e9al. En octobre 1949, mademoiselle Anna Sawka loua de la Banque un coffret de s\u00fbret\u00e9, et signa le bail habituel qu'on lui pr\u00e9senta. Il n'est pas contest\u00e9 que la Banque-appelante savait que cette demoiselle repr\u00e9sentait bien l'intim\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, et qu'elle agissait en son nom. Il est arriv\u00e9 qu'au d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e 1956 une somme de $12,750 disparut de ce coffret, et l'intim\u00e9, all\u00e9guant la n\u00e9gligence de la Banque, l'a poursuivie devant les. tribunaux. L'honorable Juge Pr\u00e9vost de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu cette action, et la Cour du Banc de la Reine2, MM. les Juges Pratte et Choquette dissidents, a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement.\nMon coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Martland a r\u00e9cit\u00e9 tous les faits essentiels de cette cause et il me semble inutile d'y revenir. Je veux cependant insister sur les faits suivants qui me semblent \u00eatre les points d\u00e9terminants de cette cause.\nIl ne s'agit s\u00fbrement pas entre l'appelante et l'intim\u00e9 d'un contrat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et l'on ne peut, en cons\u00e9quence, trouver dans l'entente intervenue les caract\u00e9ristiques des obligations du d\u00e9positaire, qui sont essentiellement de conserver la chose, et de la rendre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re r\u00e9quisition. Il s'agit plut\u00f4t, \u00e0 mon sens, d'un louage ordinaire o\u00f9 la Banque, moyennant un prix stipul\u00e9, a mis un coffret \u00e0 la disposition de l'intim\u00e9. Ce dernier en avait la cl\u00e9 et la Banque conservait la cl\u00e9 ma\u00eetresse, de sorte qu'il fallait le concours des deux pour en pratiquer l'ouverture. Mais il est clair que ce n'est seulement qu'\u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition du locataire que le coffret pouvait \u00eatre ouvert. Lui seul en contr\u00f4lait l'acc\u00e8s. Seul il pouvait exiger que la Banque particip\u00e2t \u00e0 l'ouverture, et la Banque ne pouvait exercer une pareille autorit\u00e9.\nDans le bail intervenu, on y lit la clause suivante:\n7\u00b0. La responsabilit\u00e9 de la banque en vertu du pr\u00e9sent bail est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 l'obligation pour celle-ci de prendre les pr\u00e9cautions ordinaires pour emp\u00eacher l'ouverture de ce coffret par une personne autre que le sousign\u00e9 ou son fond\u00e9 de pouvoir. La disparition ou la perte totale ou partielle des objets ou valeurs d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le coffret ne constitue pas une pr\u00e9somption que le coffret a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert par une autre personne que le soussign\u00e9 ou son fond\u00e9 de pouvoir.\nQue l'on invoque la loi civile de la province, ou le contrat qui est la loi des parties, aucune pr\u00e9somption n'existe contre la Banque. C'est au demandeur-intim\u00e9 \u00e0 prouver que la Banque n'a pas pris des pr\u00e9cautions ordinaires pour emp\u00eacher l'ouverture du coffret, et \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que comme cons\u00e9quence de cette n\u00e9gligence, si elle existe, il a subi la perte pour laquelle il r\u00e9clame.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que le 5 janvier 1956, Fortin employ\u00e9 de la Banque qui connaissait bien l'intim\u00e9, et en possession de la cl\u00e9 ma\u00eetresse, a ouvert le coffret \u00e0 la demande de Mastracchio, qui avait aussi sa propre cl\u00e9. Il est \u00e9tabli qu'il y avait dans le coffret $12,750 qui furent en partie compt\u00e9s par Fortin \u00e0 la r\u00e9quisition de l'intim\u00e9. Pendant quelques minutes, Fortin n'a pas observ\u00e9 tous les mouvements de l'intim\u00e9, mais a constat\u00e9 qu'il a \u00abjou\u00e9\u00bb dans son coffret. Celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite ferm\u00e9 \u00e0 cl\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 et par Fortin. Il est aussi en preuve que le 17 janvier, soit douze jours plus tard, quand l'intim\u00e9 est revenu \u00e0 la Banque et a ouvert son coffret, l'argent \u00e9tait disparu. Personne ne sait o\u00f9 il est all\u00e9. Mais l'on sait \u00e9galement que dans l'intervalle, soit entre le 5 janvier et le 17 du m\u00eame mois, l'intim\u00e9, qui seul avait en sa possession la cl\u00e9 qui permettait l'ouverture de ce coffret, n'est pas venu \u00e0 la Banque, et que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de l'appelante qui contr\u00f4laient la cl\u00e9 ma\u00eetresse n'ont pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 son ouverture. A part cette cl\u00e9 ma\u00eetresse, toujours en possession de la Banque, il n'en existe que deux et c'est l'intim\u00e9 qui les gardait toujours dans sa poche, et il jure qu'il ne s'en est pas d\u00e9parti.\nLa d\u00e9termination de cette cause va donc d\u00e9pendre de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la preuve, et il est impossible de se baser sur des hypoth\u00e8ses pour prouver o\u00f9 r\u00e9sulte la responsabilit\u00e9. Il faut exclure les conjectures et les possibilit\u00e9s, car la loi interdit de pareilles sp\u00e9culations pour faire reposer une conclusion juridique. Les droits des parties \u00e0 un litige, en mati\u00e8re civile, doivent \u00eatre jug\u00e9s suivant la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, et il faut \u00e9galement examiner si le demandeur-intim\u00e9 qui avait \u00e9videmment le fardeau de prouver la n\u00e9gligence de l'appelante, a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 de celle-ci.\nJe crois que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir sa cause. Pour conclure que l'appelante a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations, il faudrait supposer qu'un employ\u00e9 de la Banque avait une cl\u00e9 semblable \u00e0 celle de l'intim\u00e9, que la serrure a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e avec la connivence de la Banque, qu'une nouvelle cl\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fabriqu\u00e9e avec un mod\u00e8le en cire, ou enfin qu'un tiers a vol\u00e9 la cl\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 et a tromp\u00e9 la vigilance des employ\u00e9s n\u00e9gligents de la Banque. Mais aucune r\u00e9alit\u00e9 ne correspond \u00e0 ces hypoth\u00e8ses, \u00e0 ces possibilit\u00e9s qui ne sont appuy\u00e9es sur aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. Au contraire, l'intim\u00e9 se charge de nous dire qu'il a toujours eu ses deux cl\u00e9s en sa possession, et il est \u00e9tabli hors de tout doute qu'il n'en existe que deux. Les employ\u00e9s de la Banque jurent \u00e9galement que l'on ne s'est pas servi de la cl\u00e9 ma\u00eetresse pour ouvrir ce coffret.\nNon seulement je crois que la demandeur-intim\u00e9 n'a pas prouv\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de sa demande, mais je trouve \u00e9trange certains aspects de sa conduite, qui sans \u00eatre conclusifs, n'aident pas \u00e0 faire pencher en sa faveur la balance des probabilit\u00e9s, et qui font planer dans mon esprit des doutes tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux. Je m'explique difficilement, en effet, que cet homme qui est un parieur reconnu aux courses et aux jeux de hasard de Las Vegas, prenne la peine, malgr\u00e9 que cela soit d\u00e9j\u00e0 arriv\u00e9, de faire compter par l'employ\u00e9 Fortin le 5 janvier en question le montant d'argent qu'il avait dans son coffret, et particuli\u00e8rement la somme qu'il avait en devises am\u00e9ricaines et dont il avait sans doute besoin pour son voyage projet\u00e9 dans le Nevada. Je trouve \u00e9galement suspect qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le dernier \u00e0 \"jouer\" dans son coffret alors que l'attention de Fortin \u00e9tait attir\u00e9e ailleurs momentan\u00e9ment, et qu'une fois le coffret ferm\u00e9 il ait gard\u00e9 les cl\u00e9s en sa possession durant quinze jours. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 le dernier \u00e0 avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ce coffret, et rien ne peut justifier de penser, \u00e0 moins d'entrer dans la sph\u00e8re des conjectures, qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert par qui que ce soit. Je m'obstine \u00e0 croire que l'on ne peut pas dire que les probabilit\u00e9s nous entra\u00eenent \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence de l'appelante.\nLa n\u00e9gligence que l'on reproche \u00e0 la Banque c'est que presque toujours l'intim\u00e9 ne signait pas le livre constatant ses visites \u00e0 son coffret. Ceci est exig\u00e9 par les r\u00e8glements de la Banque et, apparemment, il est arriv\u00e9 qu'ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivis, et la raison donn\u00e9e, c'est que l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait bien connu des employ\u00e9s de la Banque. On savait qu'il \u00e9tait locataire du coffret et qu'il \u00e9tait seul porteur des cl\u00e9s qui y donnaient acc\u00e8s. L'obligation d'exiger la signature du client est une question de r\u00e9gie interne destin\u00e9e \u00e0 la protection de la Banque qui a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 surveiller qui a acc\u00e8s aux coffrets. Souvent, les corporations ou les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s imposent \u00e0 leurs employ\u00e9s des r\u00e8glements de r\u00e9gie interne qui ne peuvent augmenter ou diminuer les droits des tiers. Ces droits ne se cr\u00e9ent pas plus qu'ils ne se perdent comme r\u00e9sultat de conventions intervenues inter alios. Un employeur peut s\u00fbrement exiger de son employ\u00e9 un standard de prudence beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que ne l'exigent les r\u00e8gles normales de la responsabilit\u00e9. Mais la violation de ces r\u00e8gles impos\u00e9es ne peut b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier aux tiers.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, dans le cas qui nous occupe, que l'absence de signature dans les registres soit ou non une n\u00e9gligence, il n'existe aucune relation entre cette faute all\u00e9gu\u00e9e et la disparition des argents du coffret. Il n'y a pas l\u00e0 de cause \u00e0 effet. En effet, du 5 au 17 janvier, l'intim\u00e9 ne pouvait pas signer car il jure qu'il n'est pas all\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque. Sans doute, la situation eut \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente si un tiers, inconnu des employ\u00e9s, en possession des cl\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9, et sans \u00eatre porteur d'un procuration, eut voulu avoir acc\u00e8s au coffret en question. On lui aurait \u00e9videmment refus\u00e9 l'acc\u00e8s. Mais ici, cette situation ne se pr\u00e9sente pas. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que personne n'est venu \u00e0 la Banque pour obtenir l'ouverture du coffret, et l'absence de signature me para\u00eet immat\u00e9rielle, car la vigilance de la Banque a \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement prouv\u00e9e. Aucun des employ\u00e9s durant la p\u00e9riode en question n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 requis de se servir de la cl\u00e9 ma\u00eetresse, et aucun preuve ne d\u00e9montre ce fait essentiel.\nD'accord avec MM. les Juges Pratte et Choquette de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, je suis d'opinion que le demandeur-intim\u00e9 qui avait le fardeau de la preuve, n'a pas prouv\u00e9 sa r\u00e9clamation et qu'il n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Banque.\nJe maintiendrais l'appel et rejetterais l'action avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014By agreement entitled \"Bail de Coffret de S\u00fbret\u00e9\" dated October 28, 1949, one Miss Anne Sawka, acting, to the knowledge of the appellant, as pr\u00eate-nom of the respondent, leased from the appellant safety deposit box no. 544 in the vaults of the appellant's branch situated at 334 Ste. Catherine Street East, Montreal. Clause 7 of that agreement provided as follows:\n7. La responsabilit\u00e9 de la banque en vertu du pr\u00e9sent bail est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 l'obligation pour celle-ci de prendre les pr\u00e9cautions ordinaires pour emp\u00eacher l'ouverture de ce coffret par une autre personne que le soussign\u00e9 ou son fond\u00e9 de pouvoir. La disparition ou la perte totale ou partielle des objets et valeurs d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le coffret ne constitue pas une pr\u00e9somption que le coffret a \u00e9t\u00e9 ouvert par une autre personne que le soussign\u00e9 ou son fond\u00e9 de pouvoir.\nThe respondent was well known at this branch of the appellant. He had kept an account there for many years and had had, for over two years, to his credit in his savings account, the sum of $50,000, from which there had been no withdrawals. To the knowledge of the appellant, he. used to keep substantial sums of money in this safety deposit box. It was of the usual type, the evidence showing that it had a double lock, the first part of which could only be opened by a master key, which remained in the possession of the bank, and the second by a key which was delivered in duplicate to the respondent at the time of execution of the agreement and of which no copy remained in the possession of the bank. In order to gain access to the box, the master key had first to be inserted in the lock and the first portion thereof unlocked, then the respondent would insert one of his keys, turn it in the lock and open the box.\nThe evidence shows that on January 5, 1956, the respondent came to the bank and requested an employee of the appellant, one Donat Fortin, with whom he had become friendly and who had already performed similar services for the respondent in the past, to change into new bills a sum of $3,000 in old bills which the respondent had with him.\nAfter having done this, Fortin, after securing the master key, accompanied the respondent to his safety deposit box and with him opened the box. Upon opening the box, the respondent removed therefrom some American currency which he requested Fortin to count. Fortin counted the currency which amounted to $5,500 and returned it to the respondent.\nThereupon the respondent busied himself with the box for some three or four minutes while Fortin remained close at hand.\nThe respondent testified that when he visited his box on January 5, 1956, he had in it $9,750 in U.S. and Canadian currency and that he deposited therein the $3,000 in new bills which he had obtained from Fortin in exchange for his old bills and then closed the box. The explanation given as to why the respondent asked Fortin to count the U.S. currency in his box is that he wished to know how much he had for travelling; this was not the first time that Fortin had counted money at the request of the respondent.\nThe respondent did not visit the bank again until January 17, 1956, on which date, accompanied by Fortin, he opened the safety deposit box when, except for some stock certificates and a ring, it was found to be empty. Fortin stated that he had been much surprised that the money was no longer there. There was no indication that anyone had forced open the box or made any attempt to this end. The respondent alleged and proved various particulars of failure by the appellant to exercise ordinary precautions to prevent the opening of the safety deposit box by an unauthorized person. The appellant itself had given certain instructions to its employees and had established standards of practice for safeguarding the safety deposit boxes, which were not observed. The following are examples of this:\nIt was shown that the employees of the appellant's branch, in certain cases, did not require a person to sign the register, showing the date and time of his visit, if he was well known to them. As a matter of fact, the respondent himself never signed with respect to his safety deposit box no. 544.\nAlthough the appellant purported to find \"des locataires d\u00e9sirables\", no particular investigation was made prior to leasing a safety deposit box to any person.\nVisitors to the safety deposit boxes at the branch in question were occasionally left alone and unsupervised in the vault.\nThe lock on the respondent's safety deposit box no. 544 was not changed in 1949 when it was first leased to him. The reason given by the appellant was that the previous lessee had terminated his lease only three days before and there had not been time to change the lock. The former lessee said that when he gave up his lease he had to return both keys to the box, in his possession, to the bank. During the time he had held the box, these keys had not left his possession nor had duplicates thereof been made.\nThe master key of the appellant was not kept securely in safe custody, but was left in an unlocked desk drawer. Some ten to twelve employees of the appellant had access to it.\nThe appellant relies upon clause 7 of the agreement as an answer to the respondent's claim. By the terms of that clause the appellant's liability, under its agreement with the respondent, is limited to taking ordinary precautions to prevent the opening of the safety deposit box save by the respondent or his agent. The second portion of the clause provides that the total or partial loss of the contents of the box shall not constitute a presumption that the box was opened by a person other than the respondent or his agent.\nI will deal with the latter portion of this clause first. The respondent has testified as to having left a certain sum of money in the box on January 5, 1956; that he did not return to the bank again until January 17; and that during that interval he had kept his safety deposit box keys in his own possession at all times. He stated, without contradiction, that he had not authorized anyone else to open the box on his behalf and that on the latter date, when he opened the box, the money had disappeared. By virtue of clause 7, the disappearance of the money, without other evidence, did not create a presumption that the box had been opened by someone other than the respondent or his agent. But the fact of the disappearance does create an inference that the box had been opened by someone. It is, then, established, by affirmative evidence, not only that the loss occurred from the box, but also that the box could not have been opened by the respondent or by any agent of his at the time the money was removed from it. Furthermore, in view of the absence of evidence to show that the box had been forced open, it is clear that the appellant's master key must have been used by some unauthorized person. In the light of that evidence, apart from any presumption, there is no other conclusion but that the box must have been opened by an unauthorized person.\nThe appellant sought to cast doubt upon the respondent's evidence, and to suggest that he had, himself, removed the money from the safety deposit box, by alleging that the respondent was a gambler, that his action in having some of the money counted by Fortin was a suspicious circumstance and that the respondent alone had been handling the contents of the box on January 5 after Fortin had counted the money and before the box was closed. As to the respondent being a gambler, the evidence was that the respondent had told Fortin on January 5 that he was going to Las Vegas \"pour jouer\". Fortin's evidence was that this was not the first occasion when he had been asked by the respondent to count money which the respondent had in his safety deposit box. It is not disputed that the respondent was handling the contents of the box after Fortin had counted the money and before the box was closed.\nAs against this evidence, which, in my opinion, falls very far short of establishing that the respondent was not, as every one is presumed to be, an honest person, is the evidence, previously mentioned, of the respondent's long association with the appellant's branch and of the fact that he had kept a large sum of money on deposit in his savings account. The respondent's evidence was accepted by the learned trial judge and by the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench3 and I see no reason for disturbing their conclusion.\nThe appellant contends that by virtue of clause 7 no inference of any kind whatever can be drawn from the loss of contents of the box. In other words, the respondent must prove by other evidence that an unauthorized person has gained access to his safety deposit box. In my opinion, the wording of the clause does not go that far. Furthermore, so to construe this portion of the clause would be to render the obligation of the appellant, defined in the first portion of the clause, virtually nugatory. Both portions of the clause must be considered together (Art. 1018 of the Civil Code). The second portion of the clause should not, if there is any doubt as to its meaning, be construed so as to have such an effect.\nI now turn to the first part of the clause, which defines the appellant's liability. It has been established in evidence that the appellant did fail in various respects to take ordinary precautions to prevent an unauthorized person from opening the box. The appellant contends, however, that this is not sufficient in itself. It is argued that the respondent must go further and establish affirmatively that some one or more of the alleged defaults actually resulted in the opening of the box by an unauthorized person.\nIf this is so, obviously an almost impossible burden is placed on the respondent. But is this contention justified? The respondent has proved that his safety deposit box was opened by an unauthorized person. He has proved loss as a consequence and he has proved specific instances of failure on the part of the appellant to exercise ordinary care, one of which, at least, might have contributed to the opening of the box by an unauthorized person. In my view, a prima facie case has been made which the appellant had to meet. The appellant had to show that, on the balance of probabilities, none of these breaches of its duty would have caused the actual loss. In my opinion that burden has not been discharged. It is only necessary to consider one instance of the appellant's breach of its obligation. The evidence shows that the box was not opened by force. Consequently it must have been unlocked. It could not have been unlocked without the improper use, by someone, of the appellant's master key, either to open the box, or in order to have a duplicate made for that purpose. If that key had been properly safe-guarded, it is unlikely that it could have been used for such a purpose. The evidence, however, is clear that the master key was not properly safeguarded. No adequate system was provided to prevent its improper use. This being so, I do not see how it can be contended, successfully, that this breach of its duty could not have been a cause contributing to the respondent's loss.\nIn summary, therefore, my conclusion is that the evidence in this case went beyond the mere proof of the disappearance or loss of the contents of the safety deposit box. It established, not only the occurrence of that loss, but also the fact that the respondent had not, nor had any person authorized by him, removed those contents and thus that the money had been removed by an unauthorized person. The evidence also established that there had been a failure by the appellant to exercise ordinary precautions to prevent the opening of the box by an unauthorized person and that such failure could have caused the loss which was sustained by the respondent. That being so, my opinion is that the decision of the learned trial judge and that of the Court of Queen's Bench was correct and, consequently, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Gerin-Lajoie & Laprade, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Robitaille, Fabien & Dansereau, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

As they did not enter into a pre-nuptial contract stipulating separation as to property, they were therefore, under the provisions of the Civil Code, married under the regime of the community of property. The income in question was made up of the husband's salary and rentals, and it was not disputed that this income constituted an asset of the community. The taxpayer claimed that under the provisions of the Code, the income was the income of himself and his wife in equal parts and that each should be assessed for one-half of the total income. The Minister contended that the husband alone was liable for the income tax. The taxpayer was successful before the Income Tax Appeal Board, but lost before the Exchequer Court. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed; the appellant was liable for tax on all of the income of the community of property.\nUnder the Income Tax Act, the tax is imposed on the person and not on the property, and the person who must pay the tax is the one whose enjoyment of the income is absolute, unfettered by any restriction on his freedom to dispose of the income as he sees fit. The amount of the tax is determined by the benefits that person receives.\nUnder the regime of community of property, all income\u2014with the exception of the proceeds of the personal work of the wife\u2014received by either consort and those derived from the assets of the community, fall into the community. The consorts are the co-owners of the property of the community. Although the wife is a co-owner she does not have all the rights which ownership normally confers. Her right is stagnant, nearly sterile, because it is unproductive during the existence of the community. It is only at the dissolution of the community that the wife will be vested with her full rights of ownership. The husband is the sole administrator of the community and has very broad powers. He collects the income from the community property. He alone can dispose of this income, he alone has the unrestricted enjoyment of it, and nothing can leave the common fund unless it results from the expression of his wish. He receives the income on his own account and not as agent or fiduciary for the benefit of his wife. Since the wife withdraws no benefit derived from the community property, no income tax can be claimed from her.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Fournier J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, reversing a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nP. F. Vineberg, Q.C., and P. Meyer, for the appellant.\nR. B\u00e9dard, Q.C., and M. Paquin, Q.C, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Il s'agit dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d'un appel d'un jugement rendu par M. le Juge Alphonse Fournier2, le 3 novembre 1959, renversant un jugement de la Commission d'Appel de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu. Les faits dans cette cause ne sont pas contest\u00e9s, et les parties ont en effet sign\u00e9 une admission. Pour la parfaite intelligence de la cause, cependant, ces faits peuvent se r\u00e9sumer ainsi:\nL'appelant Sura qui \u00e9tait domicili\u00e9 dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec au moment de son mariage, s'est mari\u00e9 sans passer par les formalit\u00e9s d'un contrat. Comme cons\u00e9quence de l'art. 1260 du Code Civil, les \u00e9poux se sont soumis aux lois et coutumes g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du pays, et la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de biens a donc exist\u00e9 entre eux. Evidemment, les parties ne contestent pas que le revenu des biens communs est un actif de la communaut\u00e9, tel que d\u00e9fini \u00e0 l'art. 1272 du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLa question qui se pose est de savoir si ce revenu de la communaut\u00e9 est le revenu seul du mari, ou si le revenu de cette communaut\u00e9 est pour moiti\u00e9 le revenu du mari, et pour l'autre moiti\u00e9 le revenu de la femme. Si le revenu de la communaut\u00e9 doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le revenu seul du mari, la cotisation faite par le Ministre est valide, mais si ce revenu doit \u00eatre divis\u00e9, tel que le pr\u00e9tend l'appelant, la cotisation faite par le Ministre doit \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nLe Ministre a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1956, que pour les ann\u00e9es 1947 \u00e0 1954, un seul rapport devait \u00eatre fait, et que l'appelant devait en cons\u00e9quence payer l'imp\u00f4t sur cet unique rapport. De cette d\u00e9cision l'appelant s'est pourvu en appel devant la Commission d'Appel de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les revenus devaient \u00eatre divis\u00e9s, que deux rapports distincts pour chaque ann\u00e9e devaient \u00eatre faits, un pour le mari et un pour la femme, ce qui r\u00e9duisait substantiellement la taxe imposable, et que le dossier devait en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre retourn\u00e9 pour nouvelle cotisation. En Cour d'Echiquier, devant qui s'est pourvu le Ministre du Revenu National, l'honorable Juge Fournier a renvers\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission d'Appel de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, et en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que les cotisations du revenu de l'appelant pour fins d'imp\u00f4t, pour les ann\u00e9es d'imposition de 1947 \u00e0 1954, devaient \u00eatre confirm\u00e9es et qu'un seul et m\u00eame rapport devait \u00eatre fait par l'appelant. C'est de ce jugement qu'appelle maintenant Sura.\nComme il s'agit de cotisations pour les ann\u00e9es 1947 \u00e0 1954, il est essentiel de voir quelle \u00e9tait la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale d'imp\u00f4t en vigueur \u00e0 ces dates respectives.\nEn 1947, c'\u00e9tait la loi que l'on retrouve dans les Statuts Revis\u00e9s du Canada de 1927, c. 97. L'article 3 est \u00e0 l'effet que pour les objets de la loi, le mot \"Revenu\" signifie:\nla gratification ou le profit ou gain annuel net, soit d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et susceptible de computation en tant que gages, salaires, ou autre montant fixe, ou non d\u00e9termin\u00e9 en tant qu'honoraires ou \u00e9moluments, ou comme \u00e9tant des profits tir\u00e9s d'une profession, ou d'une occupation ou vocation industrielle ou commerciale, financi\u00e8re ou autre, directement ou indirectement re\u00e7us par une personne de tout office ou emploi, ou de toute profession ou vocation, ou de tout commerce, industrie ou affaire, suivant qu'il y a lieu, que sa provenance soit du Canada ou d'ailleurs; et doit comprendre l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, les dividendes ou profits directement ou indirectement re\u00e7us de fonds plac\u00e9s \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat sur toutes valeurs ou sans garantie, ou d'actions, ou de tout autre placement, et, que ces gains ou profits soient partag\u00e9s ou distribu\u00e9s ou non, aussi les profits ou gains annuels d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de toute autre source, y compris etc.\nEn 1948, lors de la r\u00e9vision de la Loi concernant les imp\u00f4ts sur le revenu (11 et 12 Geo. VI, c. 52), la loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 refondue, et l'art. 2(1) \u00e9tait ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9:\n2. (1) Un imp\u00f4t sur le revenu est pay\u00e9, ainsi qu'il est pr\u00e9vu ci-apr\u00e8s, sur le revenu imposable pour chaque ann\u00e9e d'imposition, de toute personne r\u00e9sidant au Canada \u00e0 une \u00e9poque quelconque de l'ann\u00e9e.\n3. Le revenu d'un contribuable pour une ann\u00e9e d'imposition, aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente partie, est son revenu pour l'ann\u00e9e de toutes provenances \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur ou \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du Canada, et, sans restreindre la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, comprend le revenu pour l'ann\u00e9e provenant\n(a) d'entreprises,\n(b) de biens,\n(c) de charges et d'emplois. 4. Sous r\u00e9serve des autres dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente partie, le revenu provenant, pour une ann\u00e9e d'imposition, d'une entreprise ou de biens, est le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice en d\u00e9coulant pour l'ann\u00e9e.\n5. (1) Le revenu provenant, pour une ann\u00e9e d'imposition, d'une charge ou d'un emploi, est le traitement, salaire, et autre r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, y compris les gratifications que le contribuable a touch\u00e9es dans l'ann\u00e9e.\nRien dans les amendements subs\u00e9quents apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la loi, ne change le principe que ce n'est pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un bien qui est taxable, mais que la taxe est impos\u00e9e sur un contribuable, et est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le revenu que l'emploi, les entreprises, les biens, ou la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 procurent \u00e0 celui qui en est le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire l\u00e9gal. Comme l'a dit M. le Juge Mignault dans la cause de McLeod v. Minister of Customs and Excise3:\nAll of this is in accord with the general policy of the Act which imposes the Income Tax on the person and not on the property.\nOn ne peut pas plus mettre en doute cette proposition, qu'on peut entretenir la moindre h\u00e9sitation pour admettre, sans r\u00e9serve, que seul doit payer l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, celui qui en a la jouissance absolue, entach\u00e9e d'aucune restriction concernant la libre disposition qu'il juge \u00e0 propos d'en faire. (Vide Robertson Ltd. v. M.N.R.4).\nDans le cas pr\u00e9sent, les \u00e9poux, comme nous l'avons vu, sont mari\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale de biens. Ce r\u00e9gime est caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 par l'union \u00e9troite d'int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il \u00e9tablit entre les \u00e9poux. Il est fond\u00e9 sur la nature m\u00eame du mariage, et fait pr\u00e9sumer entre les \u00e9poux la convention de mettre en commun leur mobilier, leurs revenus, les fruits de leurs \u00e9pargnes et de leur commune collaboration. La communaut\u00e9 est une sorte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de biens r\u00e9partis en trois masses. La premi\u00e8re est form\u00e9e de ce que l'on appelle les \u00abbiens communs\u00bb, sp\u00e9cialement affect\u00e9e aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du m\u00e9nage, et c'est le principe fondamental sur lequel repose ce syst\u00e8me matrimonial.\nLa seconde est form\u00e9e des immeubles propres au mari dont il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire avant le mariage, ou dont il a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 de ses ascendants pendant sa dur\u00e9e. C'est sur ces biens personnels au mari que porte le douaire coutumier de la femme et des enfants. (1434 C.C.). La troisi\u00e8me masse de cette communaut\u00e9 comprend les \u00abbiens immobiliers\u00bb propres de la femme, dont elle est propri\u00e9taire, comme d'ailleurs le mari avant le mariage, ou qu'elle acquiert comme h\u00e9ritage lors de l'existence de la communaut\u00e9.\nLe revenue de ces trois masses sert \u00e0 augmenter les \u00abbiens communs\u00bb qui sont la copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9poux, et qui doivent normalement se partager \u00e0 la dissolution du mariage, par la mort ou le divorce, ou comme cons\u00e9quence d'un jugement pronon\u00e7ant la s\u00e9paration de biens. (Vide Mignault, vol. 6, p. 148 et suivantes).\nCe r\u00e9gime de communaut\u00e9 assure la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance du mari dans l'administration des biens. Comme cons\u00e9quence de la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur (art. 1292), le mari seul administre les biens de la communaut\u00e9. Il peut les vendre, ali\u00e9ner et hypoth\u00e9quer, sans le concours de sa femme. Il ne peut cependant, sans ce concours, disposer entre vifs \u00e0 titre gratuit des immeubles de la communaut\u00e9, ni de l'universalit\u00e9 ou d'une quotit\u00e9 du mobilier, si ce n'est pour l'\u00e9tablissement des enfants communs. Il peut n\u00e9anmoins disposer des effets mobiliers \u00e0 titre gratuit et particulier pourvu qu'il ne s'en r\u00e9serve pas l'usufruit et que ce soit sans fraude.\nCe fut aussi la volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur (1298 C.C.) que le mari seul ait l'administration de tous les biens personnels de la femme, c'est-\u00e0-dire de ses \u00abpropres\u00bb, et lui seul peut exercer toutes les actions mobili\u00e8res et possessoires qui appartiennent \u00e0 sa femme. Il lui est interdit cependant d'ali\u00e9ner ses immeubles sans le consentement de son \u00e9pouse.\nOn voit donc que, sans \u00eatre comme l'ont dit jadis les anciens auteurs, \u00able ma\u00eetre et seigneur de la communaut\u00e9\u00bb, le mari en est le seul administrateur, avec des pouvoirs tr\u00e8s \u00e9tendus. Le mari administre les trois masses et en per\u00e7oit les revenus qui servent \u00e0 augmenter l'actif commun. Lui seul peut disposer de ces revenus, lui seul en a la jouissance sans restrictions, et rien ne peut sortir du fonds commun \u00e0 moins que ce ne soit comme r\u00e9sultat de l'expression de sa volont\u00e9. Il re\u00e7oit pour lui, et nullement comme mandataire ou fiduciaire pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de son \u00e9pouse. Cette derni\u00e8re ne retire aucun revenu, et son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice consiste dans l'augmentation des biens communs dont elle est copropri\u00e9taire et dans lesquels elle a un droit \u00e9ventuel au partage futur. Une seule exception, apport\u00e9e par la L\u00e9gislature en 1931, permet \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale, d'administrer sans restrictions les biens qui sont le produit de son travail personnel. (C.C. 1425a et suivants). Mais cependant, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'un des \u00e9poux, ces biens accumul\u00e9s et non d\u00e9pens\u00e9s constituent un actif de la communaut\u00e9. Ce n'est pas le cas qui nous occupe, mais je tiens \u00e0 le souligner pour indiquer l'exception qu'a voulu faire le l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, reconnue par le droit civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nCe r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 contraste avec le r\u00e9gime de la s\u00e9paration de biens, que les futurs conjoints ont la libert\u00e9 de choisir, et o\u00f9 chacun des \u00e9poux contribue aux charges du m\u00e9nage, dans la proportion de leurs moyens respectifs. (C.C. 1423).\nQue le mari et la femme soient copropri\u00e9taires des biens de la communaut\u00e9, ne peut faire, il me semble, aucun doute dans l'esprit des juristes. Malgr\u00e9 les h\u00e9sitations qu'ont pu entretenir certains auteurs, je crois qu'il est maintenant universellement admis que c'est bien l\u00e0 la r\u00e8gle qui doit nous r\u00e9gir.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, Trait\u00e9 th\u00e9orique et pratique de droit civil, Du Contrat de Mariage, vol. 1, 3e \u00e9d., \u00e0 la page 581, dit:\n637. Le mari et la femme sont copropri\u00e9taires des biens de la communaut\u00e9. La communaut\u00e9 ou soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de biens entre \u00e9poux n'est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e que par un fonds commun, destin\u00e9 \u00e0 subvenir aux charges du m\u00e9nage et \u00e0 s'enrichir des \u00e9conomies momentan\u00e9ment confondues et finalement soumises au principe du partage \u00e9gal. Ainsi se trouve bien consolid\u00e9e, semble-t-il, l'id\u00e9e d'une copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9galit\u00e9, du moins th\u00e9orique, des droits des deux conjoints.\nAubry-Rau, 6e \u00e9d., Cours de Droit Civil, tome 8, p. 10:\nMais, dans les rapports des \u00e9poux entre eux, la maxime pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e n'avait pas une port\u00e9e aussi absolue; et la femme n'en \u00e9tait pas moins, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, m\u00eame pendant le mariage, copropri\u00e9taire des biens de la communaut\u00e9.\nLaurent, Principes de Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais, (Paris 1887), vol. 22, n\u00b0 1, p. 7:\nC'est que la femme est r\u00e9ellement copropri\u00e9taire. Les anciens auteurs le disent en toutes lettres. Dans Pesant v. Robin5, citant Baudry-Lacantinerie, M. le Juge Anglin approuve le passage suivant:\nEn somme, la v\u00e9ritable notion de la communaut\u00e9 nous para\u00eet \u00eatre qu'elle constitue une copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 entre \u00e9poux, soumise \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles particuli\u00e8res.\nMignault partage les m\u00eames vues, et il s'exprime ainsi, Droit Civil, vol. 6, p. 337:\nLa femme qui renonce perd toute esp\u00e8ce de droit sur les biens de la communaut\u00e9. Perd: car elle avait pendant le mariage des droits sur les biens de la communaut\u00e9. Elle \u00e9tait copropri\u00e9taire avec le mari, non pas sous la condition suspensive de son acceptation, mais sous la condition r\u00e9solutoire de sa renonciation. Si elle accepte, le droit r\u00e9soluble qu'elle avait devient irr\u00e9vocable; si elle renonce, il est r\u00e9volu r\u00e9troactivement, et le mari est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 seul propri\u00e9taire des biens qui composaient le communaut\u00e9.\nMignault rejette comme inadmissible la th\u00e9orie de Toullier qui a enseign\u00e9 que pendant le mariage, le mari est seul propri\u00e9taire; que le femme n'a que l'expectative de devenir un jour commune. En un mot, la th\u00e9orie de Toullier serait qu'il n'y a pas de communaut\u00e9 pendant le mariage, et c'est donc une erreur que commet Toullier quand il fait commencer la communaut\u00e9 alors que nous la faisons finir, c'est-\u00e0-dire au moment de la dissolution du mariage, de la s\u00e9paration de corps ou de biens. Comme le signale encore Mignault, la loi dit positivement que la communaut\u00e9 commence avec le mariage (art. 1269), et qu'elle finit avec lui.\nS'il en \u00e9tait autrement, et si la femme n'\u00e9tait pas copropri\u00e9taire des biens communs, elle aurait \u00e0 payer, lors de la dissolution de la communaut\u00e9, des droits de succession, car il s'agirait alors d'une transmission de biens lui venant de son mari. Mais, il n'en est pas ainsi, car il n'y a pas de transmission mais un partage, o\u00f9 elle prend la part qui lui revient et qui lui appartient depuis le mariage. Ce qu'elle re\u00e7oit ne provient pas du patrimoine de son \u00e9poux. Vide \u00e9galement les autorit\u00e9s suivantes qui sont au m\u00eame effet:\u2014LAURENT, Principes de Droit Civil, vol. 21, pp. 224\u2013225; PLANIOL et RIPERT, (Boulanger) Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil, 1957, vol. 8, pp. 328, 331, 704; JOSSERAND, Cours de Droit Civil, 1933, vol. 3, n\u00b0 14; HUC, Code Civil, 1896, vol. 9, n\u00b0 72; MARCADE, Droit Civil, 7e \u00e9d., vol. 5, p. 444; DURANTON, Cours de Droit Fran\u00e7ais, vol. 14, p. 105. Je n'entretiens aucun doute sur la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de cette proposition, mais pour la d\u00e9termination de la pr\u00e9sente cause, d'autres facteurs doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s. Ainsi, s'il est vrai, comme je le crois, que la femme est copropri\u00e9taire des biens communs, il est \u00e9galement vrai qu'elle n'a pas l'exercice de la pl\u00e9nitude des droits que conf\u00e8re normalement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. (C.C. 406). Son droit est informe, d\u00e9membr\u00e9, inf\u00e9rieur m\u00eame \u00e0 celui de quelqu'un qui a la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un bien et dont un autre a l'usufruit. Il est stagnant, presque st\u00e9rile, parce qu'improductif durant la vie du conjoint. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 la dissolution de la communaut\u00e9 que la femme sera investie de la pl\u00e9nitude de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, qui comporte le jus utendi, fruendi et abutendi, dont sa condition maritale l'avait temporairement d\u00e9pouill\u00e9e.\nC'est ainsi qu'elle ne retire aucun revenu des biens de la communaut\u00e9, dont le mari est le seul administrateur (C.C. 1292), sans qu'il ait besoin, d'une fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, d'obtenir le concours de son \u00e9pouse. Tous les revenus sont les siens dont il peut disposer, qu'il peut ali\u00e9ner, m\u00eame \u00e0 titre gratuit, sauf les restrictions impos\u00e9es par la loi. (C.C. 1292). Il r\u00e9sulte que la femme ne touche aucun revenu des biens communs, qu'elle n'a \u00abaucun traitement, salaire ou r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration\u00bb, que rien ne lui \u00abprovient d'entreprises, de biens, de charges ou d'emplois\u00bb'. Or, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui est taxable.\nLe loi, comme je l'ai signal\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, ne recherche pas le capital ou la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un bien. Elle s'adresse \u00e0 la personne, et le montant de l'imp\u00f4t est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices qu'elle recueille. Comme la femme n'en retire aucun, d\u00e9rivant des biens communs, il s'ensuit que le fisc ne peut rien lui r\u00e9clamer.\nCes principes que je viens d'exposer et qui doivent, \u00e0 mon sens, d\u00e9terminer le sort de la pr\u00e9sente cause, doivent \u00e9videmment r\u00e9gir les biens communs lorsqu'il s'agit de communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale. Dans le cas qui nous est soumis, il n'y a qu'une seule masse de biens, car il est admis que les conjoints n'avaient pas de \u00abbiens propres\u00bb. De plus, quand il s'agit de communaut\u00e9 conventionnelle, il est certain que la situation peut \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente, car les conjoints peuvent toujours par contrat, tout en stipulant la communaut\u00e9 qui doit d\u00e9terminer le r\u00e9gime marital financier, faire toutes sortes d'autres conventions qui, \u00e9videmment, ne doivent pas \u00eatre contraires aux bonnes m\u0153urs ni \u00e0 l'ordre public. (C.C. 1257, 1262, 1268). Pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente cause, il serait superflu de les discuter.\nJe dois dire que je suis d'accord avec M. Fisher de la Commission d'Appel de l'Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu, quand il dit qu'il y a copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens communs, mais je ne puis accepter sa conclusion que l'imp\u00f4t doit \u00eatre divis\u00e9. Admettre cette opinion, ce serait dire que la femme a un \u00abgain annuel\u00bb, personnel au sens de la loi de l'imp\u00f4t, ce qui n'existe certainement pas; ce serait dire \u00e9galement qu'elle a un \u00abrevenu imposable\u00bb pour chaque ann\u00e9e et que, \u00e9videmment, elle ne pourrait pas payer. Seul le mari peut payer \u00e0 m\u00eame les biens de la communaut\u00e9, et il est interdit \u00e0 la femme de le faire. La communaut\u00e9 n'est pas tax\u00e9e, et d'ailleurs elle ne peut l'\u00eatre, car elle n'est pas une personne juridique. Pesant v. Robin6.\nD'autre part, je refuse d'admettre la th\u00e9orie de M. le Juge Fournier de la Cour d'Echiquier, qui ne voit dans la communaut\u00e9 que les biens personnels du mari. Dans son jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9 il s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis d'opinion que pendant la dur\u00e9e de la communaut\u00e9, le mari est seul propri\u00e9taire des biens qui composent l'actif de la communaut\u00e9 et seul responsable des charges qui en constituent le passif.\nIl conclut qu'\u00e9tant seul propri\u00e9taire des biens communs, le mari doit seul payer l'imp\u00f4t. J'arrive \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que M. le Juge Fournier, que seul le revenu du mari est imposable, mais pour des raisons diff\u00e9rentes que j'ai expliqu\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment.\nOn a cit\u00e9 au cours de l'audition une nombreuse jurisprudence am\u00e9ricaine, d'o\u00f9 il semble ressortir qu'aux \u00c9tats-Unis, dans les huit \u00c9tats o\u00f9 est \u00e9tablie la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale, la copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 des biens existe entre les conjoints et que deux rapports d'imp\u00f4t doivent \u00eatre faits. Je dois signaler, cependant, que j'ai trouv\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rences dans les lois qui r\u00e9gissent ces \u00c9tats et que de plus, une influence, qui n'est pas d'origine fran\u00e7aise, a substantiellement chang\u00e9 certains principes fondamentaux.\nAu d\u00e9but du volume de Saunders (Lectures on the Civil Code of Louisiana), Juge de l'\u00c9tat de la Louisiane, un \u00e9minent avocat, H. P. Dart, a \u00e9crit un remarquable article sur les sources du Droit Civil de la Louisiane. Il est oblig\u00e9 lui aussi de reconna\u00eetre que Saunders admet l'infiltration de la Common Law dans le Droit Civil Fran\u00e7ais de la Louisiane. Voici ce qu'il dit:\nIt is his belief (Saunders) that judicial construction has had a tendency to import Common Law into our jurisprudence, perhaps unintentionally or because so much of our system is not dependent upon the Civil Law of France and Rome. He lays the blame upon court and legislature, and he warns us that we will soon lose touch altogether with the law of our origin, unless a higher standard of legal education is required by the Legislature or by the Supreme Court.\nQuelle que soit la valeur des autorit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es, je crois qu'elles ne peuvent pas lier cette Cour. Elles refl\u00e8tent une \u00e9conomie du droit civil qui ne correspond nullement \u00e0 la n\u00f4tre.\nPour les raisons ci-dessus, je suis d'opinion que l'appel droit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the appellant: Meyerovitch & Levy, Montreal.\nAttorney for the respondent: A.

The individual plaintiffs were all Roman Catholics who resided within three miles of the school in Middleton but at a greater distance than three miles from the school in North Walsingham. They were all assessed by the defendant township as Roman Catholic separate school supporters until 1959, when they were assessed as public school supporters on the basis of s. 57 of The Separate Schools Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 356, which provides that \u201csubject to the other provisions of this Part, no person shall be deemed a supporter of a separate school unless he resides within three miles in a direct line of the site of the schoolhouse\u201d. An appeal to the township Court of Revision against this assessment was dismissed. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court, pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from a judgment of that Court whereby an appeal from a judgment of the trial judge was allowed and it was declared that the plaintiffs were not entitled to be assessed as Roman Catholic separate school supporters. Held: The appeal should be allowed.\nFollowing the union which took place in 1944, the schools in Middleton and in North Walsingham became in the eyes of the law one school, not merely for purposes of administration, but in the words of subs. (1) of s. 33 of the Act \u201cfor all Roman Catholic separate school purposes\u201d. Once that happened, the board was free to decide in the interests of efficiency to transport the pupils who were in attendance at one of the schoolhouses forming part of the one school resulting from the union to the other schoolhouse. It would be a startling result if on doing this they must suffer the loss of revenue from the assessment of the parents of the children so transported. Such a construction would fail to give effect to the word \u201call\u201d in s. 33(1) of the Act. This result should be avoided by limiting the effect of s. 57 to disabling from being a separate school supporter a person whose residence is not within three miles of the site of either of the two schoolhouses which on the union became parts of one school, regardless of whether both or one only of the schoolhouses continued to be used.\nWhen the language used by the legislature admits of two constructions one of which would lead to obvious injustice or absurdity the courts act on the view that such a result could not have been intended.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Landreville J. Appeal allowed.\nHon, Arthur M. Lebel, Q.C., and F.G. Carter, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by the individual appellants, pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from a judgment of that Court1 whereby an appeal from a judgment of Landreville J. was allowed and it was declared that the appellants are not entitled to be assessed as Roman Catholic separate school supporters.\nThe plaintiff board is the Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic. Union Separate School for the United Sections number 6 in the Township of Middleton and number 22 in the Township of North Walsingham. The union was formed in 1944. Until 1959 the board operated a school in each section but in that year closed the school in Middleton and provided transportation for the pupils who had been attending that school to the school in North Walsingham. The only question of fact in dispute is whether the school in Middleton was closed permanently or temporarily.\nThe individual plaintiffs and the other ratepayers on whose behalf the action is brought are all Roman Catholics who reside within three miles of the schoolhouse in Middleton but at a greater distance than three miles from the schoolhouse in North Walsingham. They were all assessed by the defendant township as Roman Catholic separate school supporters until 1959 when they were assessed as public school supporters. They appealed to the Court of Revision against this assessment. The appeal of Andre Vandekerckhove, one of the present appellants, was dismissed and decisions upon the appeals of the other ratepayers were reserved to await the final outcome of the present action.\nThe reason for closing the schoolhouse in Middleton and transporting the pupils who had been attending there to the school in North Walsingham was explained by Mr. Causyn, the chairman of the board. At the Middleton school there were about 23 pupils in attendance; there was only one class\u2011room and one teacher who had the task of teaching eight grades. At the North Walsingham school there were four class-rooms with two grades to a room. Mr. Causyn testified that it was the view of the board that better education could be given with one teacher for every two grades than with one teacher for eight grades. In contemplation of the new arrangement the schoolhouse in North Walsingham was somewhat enlarged.\nThe question to be decided depends primarily on the true construction of ss. 33 and 57 of The Separate Schools Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 356. These read as follows:\n33.(1) The majority of the supporters of each of the separate schools situate in two or more public school sections, whether in the same or in adjoining municipalities, at a public meeting duly called by the board of each separate school may form a union separate school of which union the trustees shall give notice within 15 days to the clerk or clerks of the municipality or municipalities and to the Minister, and every union separate school thus formed shall be deemed one school for all Roman Catholic separate school purposes, and shall every year thereafter be represented by three trustees to be elected by the supporters of the union separate school as provided by section 26. (2) The trustees shall be a body corporate under the name of \u2018The Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Union Separate School for the United Sections numbers....................................... in the \u2019.\n57. Subject to the other provisions of this Part, no person shall be deemed a supporter of a separate school unless he resides within three miles in a direct line of the site of the schoolhouse.\nIt is not questioned that the appellants have all the qualifications and have taken all the steps necessary to entitle them to be assessed as Roman Catholic separate school supporters, unless they are prevented from being so dealt with by the terms of s. 57. The prohibition in that section is expressly made subject to the other provisions of the Part in which it is found. If therefore, as counsel for the appellants contends, the terms of s. 33 are effective to give the appellants the right to be assessed as separate school supporters that right will not be destroyed by the terms of s. 57.\nFollowing the union which took place in 1944, the schools in Middleton and in North Walsingham became in the eyes of the law one school, not merely, as was suggested in argument, for purposes of administration, but in the words of subs. (1) of s. 33, \u201cfor all Roman Catholic separte school purposes\u201d. Once that happened, if the board in the interests of efficiency decided to transport the pupils who were in attendance at one of the schoolhouses forming part of the one school resulting from the union to the other schoolhouse they were in our opinion free to do so. It would be a startling result if on doing this they must suffer the loss of the revenue from the assessment of the parents of the children so transported. Such a construction would fail to give effect to the word \u201call\u201d which is italicized above. This result can, and, in our opinion, should be avoided by limiting the effect of s. 57 to disabling from being a separate school supporter a person whose residence is not within three miles of the site of either of the two schoolhouses which on the union became component parts of one school, regardless of whether both or one only of the schoolhouses continues to be used.\nThere is ample authority for the proposition that when the language used by the legislature admits of two constructions one of which would lead to obvious injustice or absurdity the courts act on the view that such a result could not have been intended. A number of cases on this point are collected in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 10th ed., at page 201.\nThat the construction adopted by the Court of Appeal results in grave hardship was fully recognized by that Court and by counsel for the respondent, who argued however that the words used by the legislature did not permit of any other construction.\nWe have reached the conclusion that the words of subs. (1) of s. 33 should be construed as we have indicated above and that the wording of s. 57 is not effective to prevent this construction.\nIn view of our conclusion as to the true construction of the sections mentioned it becomes unnecessary to decide the question of fact, on which the Court of Appeal differed from the learned trial judge, as to whether the schoolhouse in Middleton was closed temporarily or permanently.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside and the judgment at trial restored including the order therein as to costs. The appellants are entitled to their costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed, judgment at trial restored, with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Nelligan & Carter, London.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Mackay & Innes, Simcoe.\n[1] [1961] O.R. 449, 28 D.L.R.

Its application was opposed by the appellant company as representative of the industry, and by the appellant union, International Woodworkers of America, the certified bargaining agent for the whole industry. Following an oral hearing at which all parties had full opportunity to call evidence, to cross-examine witnesses and submit argument, the Board visited two representative plants. Shortly before the view was held, the respondent suggested that the hearing be reopened for the purpose of making further representations. The Board decided against this but advised the interested parties that it would consider further representations in writing. The respondent made its submissions by letter. The Board sent copies of this letter to the appellant company and the appellant union, and informed the respondent by telephone that it had done so. The company and the I.W.A. replied in writing, but these letters were not sent to the respondent union, which consequently did not have an opportunity of answering the replies. Following the Board's rejection of the application for certification, the respondent brought an application for certiorari to quash the decision. This application was dismissed by the trial judge but granted on appeal to the Court of Appeal. The appellants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nBoth parties had been given a full opportunity to be heard. After a full oral hearing and a view of two representative plants, the Board merely gave the interested parties an opportunity to make any further submissions they chose. After hearing from one side and hearing from the other side in reply, it was not a departure from the rules of natural justice for the Board to hold that the debate had gone on long enough and that it was time to stop. Furthermore, the Board had fully complied with s. 62(8) of the Labour Relations Act, which provides that \"The Board shall determine its own procedure but shall in every case give an opportunity to all interested parties to present evidence and make representations.\"\nThe Board had every right to afford the company and the I.W.A. a reasonable time to reply to the further submissions of the respondent even if, as in the event, it meant an extension of the time set by the Board.\nThe record disclosed no basis for the finding below that the company and the I.W.A. had added substantially to the representations made by them at the oral hearing in their replies to the further submissions of the respondent.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Verchere J. dismissing an application to quash a decision of the Labour Relations Board. Appeal allowed.\nD. A. S. Lanskail, for defendant, appellant, Forest Industrial Relations Ltd.\nA. B. Macdonald, for defendant, appellant, International Woodworkers of America.\nA. W. Mercer, for defendant, appellant, Labour Relations Board of B.C.\nT. R. Berger, for prosecutor, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal[2] which quashed a decision of the Labour Relations Board. The respondent, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 882, had sought from the Board and had been refused certification as representative of the engineers and firemen in ten plants of the lumber industry. Its application was opposed by the appellant, Forest Industrial Relations Limited, as representative of the industry, and by the appellant union, International Woodworkers of America, which wished to retain its position as bargaining agent for the whole industry. Following the Board's rejection of the application, the respondent brought an application for certiorari to quash the decision. This application was dismissed by Verchere J. but granted on appeal to the Court of Appeal. The respondent's application, which was dated April 26, 1960, was made on behalf of what constituted but a small group of a large body of employees in each of the plants. The appellant union, the I.W.A., is the certified bargaining agent for the whole industry. On receipt of the application, the Board sent the usual notices to all interested parties, namely, to Forest Industrial Relations Limited, as representing the employers, to the appellant union, the I.W.A., and to the employees affected by the applications.\nThe Board, pursuant to the provisions of s. 12(2) of the Labour Relations Act, first made its own inquiries by an examination of the records, and on May 25, 1960, sent a notice of hearing to all interested parties for June 8, 1960. An oral hearing was held on that date in the presence of the appellant union, the appellant employer and the respondent union, at which time all parties had a full opportunity to be heard, to call evidence, to cross-examine witnesses and make their submissions. During the hearing the appellant employer invited the Board to visit representative plants. The Board agreed to do so and notified all parties that it would visit two plants on June 20, 1960.\nShortly before the view was held, the respondent union suggested that the hearing be reopened for the purpose of making further representations. The Board decided against this but advised the interested parties that it would consider further submissions in writing to be made not later than July 12, 1960. Forest Industrial Relations Limited replied that it had completed its submissions but requested an opportunity to reply if representations were made by others. The I.W.A. replied that its case was complete but that it wished to be informed if the hearings were to be reopened. The respondent union made its submissions by letter dated July 7, 1960. The Board sent copies of this letter to Forest Industrial Relations Limited and the I.W.A. by letter dated July 12, 1960, and informed the respondent union by telephone that it had done so. Forest Industrial Relations Limited replied in writing to the submissions of the respondent union by letter dated July 20, 1960, and the I.W.A. by letter dated July 22, 1960. These replies were not sent to the respondent union. On July 28, 1960, the Board notified the respondent union that its application was rejected on the ground that its units of employees were not appropriate for collective bargaining. On September 26, 1960, the respondent union moved for an order nisi to show cause why a writ of certiorari should not issue to quash the decision of the Board. It was this application which was rejected by Verchere J. and granted by the Court of Appeal.\nI have set out this outline of the course taken by these proceedings because, in my respectful opinion, on these facts the issues of jurisdiction and departure from the rules of natural justice, upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded, do not arise. The respondent's real complaint is that it should have been afforded an opportunity of replying to the submissions made by Forest Industrial Relations Limited and the I.W.A. in their letters of July 20 and July 22, 1960. Both parties in this case on these facts had been given a full opportunity to be heard. After a full oral hearing and a view of two representative plants, the Board merely gave the interested parties an opportunity to make any further submissions they chose. After hearing from one side and hearing from the other side in reply, it is not a departure from the rules of natural justice for the Board to hold that the debate had gone on long enough and that it was time to stop. Further, the Board fully complied with its own Act (s. 62(8)), which states that \"The Board shall determine its own procedure but shall in every case give an opportunity to all interested parties to present evidence and make representations.\"\nIt is also urged against the decision that the Board received the representations of the two appellants after the deadline that it had set for July 12, 1960. I cannot see that the mere departure from the date can have any bearing upon the decision in this case. The respondent did not send its written submissions until July 7 and these were not sent on to the two appellants until July 12. The Board had every right to afford these two interested parties a reasonable time to reply to the further submissions of the respondent even if it meant an extension of time. It was also said in the reasons of the Court of Appeal that Forest Industrial Relations Limited and the I.W.A. in their letters of July 20 and July 22 had added substantially to the representations made by them at the hearing of June 8. An examination of the record discloses no basis for such a finding. There is nothing in the record about the representations made and the evidence given on June 8. No stenographic record was made of this hearing and the material does not attempt to state what went on beyond the fact that there was an oral hearing with all interested parties present and with a full opportunity to adduce evidence, examine and cross-examine and submit argument. The two last mentioned letters of the appellants did no more than reply point by point to the representations made by the respondent in its letter of July 7. Counsel for the respondent was invited to compare his client's letter with the replies received to it and to point to any new material in the replies. He stated that there was no new material but that nevertheless his client had a right of reply and had been deprived of it. I do not think that his client had any such right as he asserted.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of Verchere J. The respondent, International Union of Operating Engineers Local 882, should pay to the appellants, Forest Industrial Relations Limited and International Woodworkers of America, their costs throughout. There should be no order for costs for the Labour Relations Board.\nAppeal allowed with costs to the appellants, Forest Industrial Relations Limited and International Wood-workers of America.\nSolicitor for Forest Industrial Relations Limited: D.

The Workmen's Compensation Board decided that he did not die as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment and rejected the widow's claim to compensation. The respondent continued to ask for further consideration of the case, and following an oral hearing the Board reaffirmed its previous decision. The respondent had submitted that the deceased's reason for the trip was to pick up certain equipment for his employer; that he also intended to visit his family was said to be incidental. An appeal to the Court of Appeal from dismissal of a motion for certiorari to quash the decision of the Board was allowed. The Board then appealed to this Court; the issue being whether there was a breach of a fundamental requirement of procedure which deprived the decision of the Board of its authority as one made within the jurisdiction. The fundamental breach was said to be the Board's failure to disclose to the applicant evidential facts upon which it based its decision.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nOn the facts of the case there was no refusal of disclosure and no nondisclosure amounting to refusal. This made it unnecessary to determine the duty of the Board, if any, to disclose information on its files. On the hearing the issues to be determined were plain to the applicant. There was no indication that counsel intended to question the statement which he knew the Board had that the employee was making the trip to see his family. With knowledge of this statement but not of its source, his argument was directed not to showing that it had never been made or that it was otherwise unreliable but that it was outweighed by the other evidence indicating that the workman was in the course of his employment. No issue going to jurisdiction was raised in this case.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The respondent had made a strong prima facie case in her attempt to establish that the deceased's death was caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. It could not lightly be assumed that the Board made a ruling contrary to the evidence and the law, and the most reasonable explanation of its decision appeared to be that it had in its possession some evidence other than that disclosed in the record which in its view outweighed the strong prima facie case made out by the respondent. In the circumstances, it was the duty of the Board to make full disclosure to the respondent of every item of evidence on which it proposed to base its decision including the contents of all statements made to its inspector and the names of the persons from whom those statements had been obtained, and, having done so, to give the respondent a fair opportunity to correct or contradict that evidence. The material indicated that it failed to perform this duty.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Whittaker J. dismissing an application for certiorari. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nC. C. Locke, Q.C., for the appellant.\nMiss M. F. Southin, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Eric Rammell, the husband of the respondent, was drowned on October 9, 1954, while crossing by boat from Homfray Creek to Campbell River in British Columbia. At the time of his death he was employed by Power Saw Sales & Service Limited as superintendent of a logging operation at Homfray Creek. The Workmen's Compensation Board decided that he did not die as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment and rejected the respondent's claim to compensation. A motion to quash the decision of the Board was dismissed by Whittaker J. but the Court of Appeal[2], did quash the decision and directed the issue of a writ of mandamus requiring the Board to hear and determine according to law the respondent's claim to compensation. The Board now appeals. The issue is whether there was a breach of a fundamental requirement of procedure which deprived the decision of the Board of its authority as one made within the jurisdiction. The fundamental breach is said to be the Board's failure to disclose to the applicant for compensation evidential facts upon which it based its decision.\nAn issue of this kind makes necessary a review of the Board's procedure in this case. The employer reported the death by letter dated October 29, 1954, and stated that the employee had been drowned in the course of his employment. The Board asked the employer to complete its regular form for the report of an accident. It obtained a death certificate and a copy of the report of the Coroner's inquest. On November 23, 1954, it sent a form of application for compensation to the widow, which was returned completed on November 29, 1954. In November it also received from its own inspector a report covering his investigation of the death made at Homfray Creek on October 23, 1954.\nOn December 1, 1954, the Board wrote to the employer to question its statement that the employee had been drowned during and in the course of his employment. The Board stated that other information on its file indicated that the deceased left the camp to see his family at Campbell River and was warned not to go and that in spite of this, the employee stated that he was going as he wanted to see his family. On December 8, the Board received a reply to this letter. The reply is not in the material filed on the motion but it appears from the printed case that it was this letter from the employer which was read to the Board by counsel for the applicant on the oral hearing in 1958.\nOn December 21, 1954, the Board asked the employer to call at its office to discuss the case. On January 10, 1955, Robert A. Challenger, the secretary of the employer, called on the Board and gave it information about the duties of the deceased and also about a piece of paper which had been found on the body. A few days later, on January 13, Challenger telephoned the Board to add to the information given at the interview on January 10. The Board gave its decision on March 7, 1955, rejecting the claim.\nOn March 10, 1955, the Board, in answer to a letter from the father of the deceased workman, stated that the evidence did not establish that the purpose of Mr. Rammell's trip was for the employer's business. The letter informs the father that the reason given by his son for making the trip was to see his family. The letter also refers to the piece of paper that was found on the body. The suggestion was evidently being made that this was an order form. The Board stated that the evidence from the employer indicated that Mr. Rammell had some packing slips in his pocket at the time of his death but they referred to previous trips which had been made.\nOn March 23, 1955, the Board wrote to Messrs. Anderson and Anderson, solicitors of Vancouver, who had written on behalf of the widow. The solicitors evidently had the Board's letter to Mr. Rammell Sr. and had questioned its accuracy. The Board informed the solicitors that Mr. Robert A. Challenger, secretary of the employer, had given it part of the information contained in its letter when he came in to see the Board on January 10. The letter also referred to the list of parts for equipment found on the body and stated that no such list had been received by the Board.\nMr. Rammell Sr. then made inquiries from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Campbell River concerning the slip of paper. The officer in charge reported on April 19, 1955, that two constables had seen the slip of paper on which the writing was badly faded and blurred because of water, that it had been difficult to establish whether it was a receipt or an order form but that the opinion of the constables was that it was an order form. He also reported that the paper had been lost and that it was assumed at the time that it had no importance except as a means of identification. On May 26, 1955, the two constables swore affidavits to the same effect. On June 3, 1955, P. E. Hornby, branch manager of the employer at Campbell River, also swore an affidavit that he had examined what appeared to be an order form which Constable McPherson had handed to him on October 9, 1954, and that this order form itemized parts for a power saw and nothing else.\nMr. Rammell Sr. had sent to the Board the letter of April 19, 1955, from the officer in charge at Campbell River. This letter contained a summary of the information which was shortly afterwards sworn to by the two officers and Hornby. The Board, however, in its reply dated April 26, 1955, stated that as the letter from the father and the enclosure with it contained no new information, its decision would not be changed.\nIn November 1955, Mr. A. E. Branca, Q.C., of Vancouver, asked for further discussion of the claim. The secretary wrote agreeing to this but Mr. Branca did not pursue the matter. He had, however, on July 11, 1955, obtained a letter from both P. E. Hornby and A. J. Hornby containing information to the same effect as that contained in the affidavit of A. J. Hornby sworn on June 3, 1955, and referred to above.\nOn April 9, 1956, Mrs. Rammell asked for further consideration of the case. On May 16, 1956, she sent in three affidavits which I take to be those of the two constables and A. J. Hornby. On May 31, 1956, the Board asked whether she had any additional evidence. She notified the Board on September 26, 1956, that she had nothing further to submit and on October 12, 1956, the Board confirmed its previous decision and notified her of its confirmation.\nIn April 1957 the Board received an inquiry from the Department of Veterans Affairs and explained to the department why the claim had been disallowed. Its letter is not in the material filed.\nOn February 19, 1958, Graham B. Ladner, the present solicitor for the applicant, telephoned the Board to say that he was acting for the widow, and on the following day the Board received a letter from him asking for the recognition of the claim. He referred to the lost slip of paper found on the body and made the submission that if the slip was an order, it would be conclusive evidence. He also enclosed a copy of the letter from A. J. Hornby and P. E. Hornby addressed to Mr. Branca, dated July 11, 1955.\nIn his reply to Mr. Ladner dated February 25, 1958, the secretary of the Board said that he did not know whether the slip would have any effect on the Board's decision. Mr. Ladner had been inquiring whether he should make an effort to locate the slip. The police had stated three years before that it had been lost. The secretary told Mr. Ladner by letter, as he had told him by telephone, that the workman himself made the statement that although it was a rough day he could make it as he wanted to see his family. Mr. Ladner then asked for an oral hearing and this was held on March 25, 1958. Mr. Ladner appeared on that date but no one appeared to represent the employer although notified of the hearing.\nAt the hearing, counsel for the applicant did not call any witnesses. He did, however, file the two Hornby letters, the first to Branca, dated July 11, 1955, and referred to above, and the second to himself, dated February 23, 1958. These letters are, of course, some evidence from which an inference could be drawn that in going to Campbell River, Rammell was in the course of his employment. Counsel made this submission that the reason for the trip was to pick up this equipment from the Hornbys and that a visit to the family was incidental. The order form was also referred to. Then counsel read a letter, dated December 7, 1954, from D. M. Challenger to the Board. D. M. Challenger was the manager of the employer. It was this letter which the Board received on December 8 and which asserted that the accident happened in the course of the employment. It was this letter that caused the Board to ask Challenger why he made this assertion and this reply, together with the subsequent invitation, led to the visit of Mr. R. M. Challenger to the Board on January 10, 1955, and Challenger's subsequent telephone conversation. In discussing Challenger, the chairman of the Board said:\nMr. Eades: Not much new. Mr. Challenger was in here and gave a statement and said it was Rammell's own boat.\nMr. Ladner: I believe that was correct. I have interviewed Challenger\u2014there are two of them and I have spoken to them both and no question in their minds that he was going over there primarily in the course of his duties.\nIt is quite evident from this that counsel knew that Challenger had given information about the boat and that counsel, after his interview with them, knew that they were still asserting that the employee was in the course of his employment.\nWe have therefore in this case both the manager and secretary of the employer, the Hornbys, who ran the repair shop, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, through their finding of what they referred to as order slips, all giving evidence tending to show that the employee was in the course of his employment. The Board, however, was emphasizing the employee's own statement that he was going to see his family in spite of the rough weather and the fact that he was using his own boat on a Saturday morning. The issues were fully apparent and disclosed at the hearing. Counsel knew that the question was the employee's own statement about his intentions and the fact that he was using his own boat. What other issues could there be apart from the assertions that I have mentioned tending to show that the man was in the course of his employment?\nIf counsel had thought that Challenger could give material evidence, he could have called him as a witness or presented evidence from him in some other form. He had interviewed both the Challengers. He knew what they would say, and he read a letter from one of them to the Board which was presumably favourable to his position. At no time either before or during the oral hearing did he state that he was working in the dark, that he wanted further information that the Board might have and which he lacked, or that anything was being held back from him. Specifically, he did not say that he questioned the report made by someone that the employee had said that he was making the trip to see his family. If he had had any doubt on this point, he had every opportunity to raise it and to demand any information which he lacked and which he thought he needed and should have.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal has no common ratio. The learned Chief Justice held that there had been no finding or determination that the death did not arise out of and in the course of the employment and that consequently the right to compensation still remained to be determined. Counsel for the respondent declined to argue this ground in support of the judgment. O'Halloran J.A. held that the inquiry and decision of the Board had not met the requirement of substantial justice because of failure to give the applicant for compensation a fair opportunity to know what was alleged against her and to contradict any relevant statement which might be prejudicial to her claim and that this principle was not affected by the prohibition in the Act against the divulging of information.\nDavey J.A. (dissenting) held on the facts of the case there was no refusal of disclosure and no non-disclosure amounting to refusal. This, in my respectful opinion, is the correct and obvious finding to be made on the facts of the case and made it unnecessary for him to determine the duty of the Board, if any, to disclose information on its files. On the hearing held in this case, the issues were plain to the applicant. There was no indication that counsel intended to question the statement which he knew the Board had that the employee was making the trip to see his family. With knowledge of this statement but not of its source, his argument was directed not to showing that it had never been made or that it was otherwise unreliable but that it was outweighed by the other evidence indicating that the workman was in the course of his employment. I agree with Davey J.A. and also with Whittaker J. that no issue going to jurisdiction is raised here. Consequently, the Court of Appeal should not have quashed the decision of the Board and issued the mandatory order.\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of Whittaker J. dismissing the application. The Board does not ask for costs and there will consequently be no order for costs in any court.\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The relevant facts are stated in the reasons of my brother Judson and in those of O'Halloran J.A. in the Court of Appeal.\nI do not understand that there is any disagreement in this Court or in the courts below as to the principle of law under which this case falls to be decided.\nThe appellant Board was under a duty to hear and determine the respondent's application for compensation. It was not bound to conduct its hearings in accordance with the procedure followed in the trial of an action but it was under a duty to give a fair opportunity to the respondent to correct or contradict any relevant statement prejudicial to her claim. If it failed in this duty its order would be the subject of certiorari and the Board itself would be the subject of mandamus. If authority is required for this fundamental proposition it is to be found in the words of Lord Loreburn L.C. in Board of Education v. Rice[3], which were adopted by Viscount Haldane L.C. in Local Government Board v. Arlidge[4].\nIt appears that the Board had received a report from one of its inspectors and founded its decision, in part at least, upon a statement or statements said to have been made to him. I do not think it can be determined with any certainty from the material before us who made these statements or what they contained.\nThe material indicates that the respondent had made a strong prima facie case to show that when her late husband met his death he was crossing by boat from Homfray Creek to Campbell River to obtain parts, listed in an order slip which he had with him, which were required in his employer's business. As is pointed out in the reasons of my brother Judson, the evidence of the manager and secretary of the deceased's employer, of the Hornbys who ran the repair shop at Campbell River, and of the officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who investigated the fatality all tended to support this view. If these were the facts, it would follow that the death of the deceased was caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, and the circumstances that he was using his own boat and that he wanted to see his family at Campbell River would not alter this result.\nWe cannot lightly assume that the Board has made a ruling contrary to the evidence and the law and the most reasonable explanation of its decision would appear to be that it had in its possession some evidence other than that disclosed in the record which in its view outweighed the strong prima facie case made out by the respondent. The material, as pointed out above, does establish that the Board had before it some evidence which was not fully disclosed.\nNo doubt, as my brother Judson points out, the issue to be determined was plain to the applicant; admittedly her husband met his death by accident and the sole question was whether that accident arose out of and in the course of his employment. What the applicant complains of is that the Board did not fully and fairly inform her as to what was the evidence which moved it to find against her on that issue.\nIn the particular circumstances of this case it was, in my opinion, the duty of the Board to make full disclosure to the respondent of every item of evidence on which it proposed to base its decision including the contents of all statements made to its inspector and the names of the persons from whom those statements had been obtained, and, having done so, to give the respondent a fair opportunity to correct or contradict that evidence. The material indicates that it failed to perform this duty.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ladner, Downs, Ladner, Locke, Clark & Lenox, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ladner & Southin, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961), 35 W.W.R. 145, 28 D.L.R.

One of the sons used a cigarette lighter in the process. The father and one of the sons started back upstairs leaving the other son (who died prior to the trial) still investigating, when an explosion of gas occurred. In the action for damages to the house, the father and the surviving son both testified that at no time did they suspect the presence of gas, and their evidence was accepted by the trial judge. It was conceded during the trial that gas had penetrated into the building from a break in a gas pipe outside the building, which was part of a propane gas distribution system owned and operated by the City and under its control. The action was maintained by the trial judge. This judgment was unanimously affirmed both as to the amount and the liability of the City, but a majority found that the father had also been at fault. The father having died, his wife, as universal legatee, appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored.\nThe only fault which could be attributed to the appellant's husband would be a fault of omission in failing to prevent his son from using or continuing to use a lighter when he knew or should have known that such use was dangerous. The explosion was due primarily to the presence of explosive gas for which the City was clearly responsible under art. 1054 of the Civil Code. A reasonably prudent layman could not be expected to know that propane gas is heavier than air and apparently would lie along the floor of the basement.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing in part a judgment of Desmarais J. Appeal allowed.\nMaurice Delorme, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nAlbert Rivard, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench2 which allowed, in part, an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court condemning respondent to pay to appellant's late husband, Rodolphe L. Vall\u00e9e, a sum of $5,890.36 as the amount of damage caused by fire to a house owned and occupied by the said Rodolphe L. Vall\u00e9e.\nThe fire in question resulted from a gas explosion which took place in the basement of the said premises, and at the trial it was conceded that gas had penetrated into the building from a break in a gas pipe outside the said building which was part of a propane gas distribution system then owned and operated by respondent and under its control. The cause of the break was not established.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench unanimously confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court as to the amount of the damage caused to the premises and as to the liability of respondent under art. 1054 of the Civil Code. The majority held however, that appellant's late husband was also at fault and reduced by one-half the damages fixed by the learned trial judge. Bissonnette and Hyde JJ. dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal.\nFrom that judgment, appellant as the universal legatee of her late husband (who died pending the appeal to the Court below) has appealed to this Court.\nThe facts are fully set out in the judgments below and are not now really in dispute. On the evening of the accident, the late Rodolphe Vall\u00e9e, his wife and their two sons, with some friends, were celebrating a family anniversary in the premises. Appellant had complained to her husband for some time previously of a peculiar odor in the house, which he said he himself could not detect. On the evening in question, the guests also noticed the odor which they were unable to identify, and Vall\u00e9e and his two sons (one of whom was a professional engineer) set out to inspect the house and see if they could discover it. Finding nothing in the kitchen, Vall\u00e9e and the sons went down to the cellar where they spent some fifteen minutes seeking for a possible source of the odor. One of the sons used his cigarette lighter in the process. They tried the gas meter without incident and then began to suspect the sewer. One of the sons started back upstairs followed by the father, leaving the other son (who died prior to the trial) still carrying on the investigation, when an explosion occurred \u2014presumably from the ignition by the flame of the cigarette lighter\u2014of gas which had seeped into the cellar from outside. Vall\u00e9e and the surviving son both testified that at no time did they suspect the presence of gas. Their evidence on this point was not shaken on cross-examination and it was accepted by the learned trial judge.\nAs Bissonnette J. pointed out in the Court below the fault, if any, of appellant's late husband could only have been a fault of omission, in that he failed to prevent his son from using or continuing to use a cigarette lighter when he knew or was bound to know that such use was dangerous.\nThe search in the basement for the source of the objectionable odor was carried on without mishap for some fifteen minutes in the immediate vicinity of the pipes and gas meter with the aid of a cigarette lighter, but precisely what happened after this inspection as the father and one son were leaving the basement, is not established.\nThe explosion was due primarily to the presence of explosive gas for which respondent was clearly responsible under art. 1054 of the Civil Code. This propane gas is heavier than air and apparently lay along the floor of the basement. In the circumstances this was not a condition which, in my opinion, a reasonably prudent layman could be expected to know about. With great respect, I am unable to agree with the conclusion reached by the majority in the Court below that appellant's late husband was at fault, and in part responsible for the accident.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judment of the learned trial judge, with costs here and in the Court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Leblanc, Delorme, Barnard & Leblanc, Sherbrooke.\nAttorney for the defendant, respondent: A.

Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nContract\u2014Assignment of debt with notice\u2014Whether absolute transfer or merely a pledge\u2014Civil Code, art. 1174, 1571.\nIn December 1955, A Co. owed the plaintiff S6,906.68 for materials furnished and assigned to the plaintiff a debt of $6,841.42 it claimed was owed to it by the defendant. The transfer, a copy of which was duly served on the defendant as required by art. 1571 of the Civil Code, purported to assign and transfer the debt (c\u00e8de et transporte) and concluded by these words: \"The present security is granted subject to the other securities which [the grantee] presently holds or may hold\". In the action, following the refusal of the defendant to pay the amount under the assignment, the defendant pleaded that the assignment was not an absolute transfer but was one by way of pledge only. The trial judge dismissed the action on that ground, but his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe words \"c\u00e8de et transporte\", in the absence of some qualifying term, meant a transfer of the ownership of the debt. No such qualification could be found in the agreement. The whole tenor of the document was in the opposite sense and the concluding words of the transfer could not have the effect of constituting the contract merely one of pledge. The amount owing to the plaintiff was somewhat greater than the amount of the debt transferred, and the transfer of a debt with or without the acceptance of the debtor does not effect novation. The fact that the plaintiff was entitled to retain any other security it may have held until its debt was paid in full did not affect the absolute character of the assignment it had taken.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Boulanger J. Appeal dismissed.\nHon. Mark Drouin, Q.C., and J. P. Bernier, for the defendant, appellant.\nRen\u00e9 Fournier, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014The sole matter at issue in this appeal is whether the transfer to respondent of a debt owing by appellant to a company known as Agel Construction Limit\u00e9e was an absolute transfer or merely a pledge of the said debt.\nThe facts which are not in dispute are these: Agel Construction Limit\u00e9e had built a house for appellant at a contract price of $25,800 on which it claimed a balance owing of $6,841.42. On December 21, 1955, the said Agel Construction Limit\u00e9e was indebted to respondent in an amount of $6,906.68 for materials furnished and on that date executed the following instrument\u2014a copy of which was duly served on appellant as required by art. 1571 of the Civil Code\u2014which reads as follows:\nTRANSPORT DE CR\u00c9ANCE\nPour bonne et valable consid\u00e9ration, Agel Construction Limit\u00e9e, ici repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par monsieur Roger G\u00e9linas, son Pr\u00e9sident, d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 par r\u00e9solution des Directeurs et des Actionnaires de la Compagnie, adopt\u00e9e le 22 novembre 1954, et dont copie est demeur\u00e9e annex\u00e9e \u00e0 l'original des pr\u00e9sentes, c\u00e8de et transporte \u00e0 J.

Antoine Mercier, n\u00e9e Bastien, domicili\u00e9e au num\u00e9ro 1,342 de la rue Duquet, cit\u00e9 de Sillery, en vertu d'un contrat de construction dont le solde est actuellement de six mille huit cent quarante-et-un dollars et quarante-deux cents ($6,841.42).\nJ. M. Dessureault Inc. pourra toucher en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie toutes les sommes d'argent qui sont ou seront ainsi dues au soussign\u00e9, donner pour et en son nom, sur paiement, bonne et valable quittance, et imputer \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 les sommes qu'elle recevra, aux dettes et responsabilit\u00e9s du soussign\u00e9, \u00e9chues ou non \u00e9chues, qu'elle choisira \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 leur date d'anciennet\u00e9, et sans \u00eatre tenue d'en \u00e9tablir l'existence.\nSi le paiement de toute somme d'argent ainsi due au soussign\u00e9 se faisait au moyen d'un ch\u00e8que, ordre de paiement, mandat, billet ou autre effet \u00e0 l'ordre du soussign\u00e9 ou \u00e0 son ordre conjoint avec d'autres, J. M.

M. Dessureault Inc. et \u00e0 chacun de ses officiers, tout pouvoir et mandat requis.\nJ. M. Dessureault Inc., sans y \u00eatre tenue, est autoris\u00e9e:\u2014\n1.

M. Dessureault Inc. peut actuellement ou pourra d\u00e9tenir.\nAppellant having refused to comply with a demand for payment, respondent instituted the present action. In its plea appellant, without prejudice, acknowledged liability to the extent of $3,946.32, and the action was proceeded with for the balance of $2,895.10. By its amended plea appellant alleged that the transfer in question was not an absolute transfer but was one by way of pledge only. At the trial it was conceded that if the transfer was an absolute one respondent was entitled to judgment in the amount claimed in its action. The sole issue before all courts therefore has been the interpretation and effect to be given to the document of transfer dated December 21, 1955.\nThe interpretation of the said transfer urged by appellant found favour with the learned trial judge, but his judgment was unanimously reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench2 and I am in respectful agreement with that view.\nThe words \"c\u00e8de et transporte\" used in the transfer, in the absence of some qualifying term, mean a transfer of the ownership of the debt\u2014Lalibert\u00e8 v. Larue et Les Appartements Lafontaine3. I find no such qualification in the agreement. Indeed the whole tenor of the document is in the opposite sense and the concluding words of the transfer cannot, in my view, have the effect of constituting the contract merely one of pledge. The amount owing to respondent was somewhat greater than the amount of the debt transferred, and the transfer of a debt with or without the acceptance of the debtor does not effect novation (C.C. 1174). In taking a transfer of the debt in question, respondent was entitled to retain any other security it may have held until its debt was paid in full without affecting the absolute character of the assignment it had taken.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the defendant, appellant: Hon.
