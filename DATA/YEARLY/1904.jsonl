The Minister observes that section 3 of chapter 84 of the \"United States Statutes at Large,\" part 1, Public Laws 1845-1851, contains a provision having reference to the selection of swamp lands to be granted to certain states of the Union, which reads as follows: 'All legal subdivisions, the greater part of which are subject to overflow and thereby rendered unfit for cultivation, shall be included in the list, but when the greater part of a sub-division is not of that character, the whole of it shall be excluded therefrom; (the legal sub-division in the United States' system of survey, as in the Canadian, consists of forty acres.) That the definition seems a fairly good one and would apply to the case now under consideration and he, the Minister, recommends that it be adopted as applicable to the lands to be selected for the purpose of being granted to the Province of Manitoba, under the provisions of the Act 48 & 49 Vict. ch. 50, sec 1, hereinbefore referred to.\n\"The Minister further observes that the United States' statute provides that the selection shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and the lands to be selected shall be such as are not held or claimed by individuals; that the selection shall be made by surveyors appointed for that purpose by the United States; that the expense of the selection shall be defrayed by the states interested; and that the lists and surveys, where surveys are necessary, shall also be made at the expense of the states interested.\n\"The Minister recommends that the selection necessary to make the grant to the Province of Manitoba shall be made by two surveyors, appointed for that purpose by the Minister of the Interior; that the two surveyors so appointed shall be paid, and the other expenses incident to the selection defrayed, by the Province of Manitoba; that the lands to be selected shall be swamp lands according to the definition hereinbefore recommended for adoption, and shall consist of unoccupied and unclaimed lands at the disposal of the Government of Canada; that the selection shall not commence to be made before the 20th of May in any one year and that whatever portion of such work is not completed by the 1st of October in the said year shall remain in abeyance until after the 20th of May in another year, and so on until the selection has been completed.\n\"That the surveyors, appointed as hereinbefore provided, shall report from time to time to the Minister of the Interior, until the whole grant to which the Government of Manitoba is entitled under the said Act 48 & 49 Vict. ch. 50, sec. 1, has been made up, and they shall furnish lists of the lands selected by them, and the said lists shall be subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council upon reports made from time to time by the Minister of the Interior; and the signification in writing to the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba of the approval of such lists by His Excellency shall operate to vest the title in the lands described in the said lists in Her Majesty for the purposes of the Province of Manitoba.\n\"The committee concur in the foregoing report of the Minister of the Interior and the recommendations therein made, and they advise that the requisite authority be granted to carry the same into effect.\"\nOn the 16 April, 1888, the Minister of the Interior reported that the surveyors appointed for the purposes mentioned in the foregoing order-in-council had made a joint report on 16th Feb., 1888, submitting a revised and corrected list of certain lands selected by them as \"swamp lands\" for approval in accordance with the terms of the order-in-council, and the Governor-General-in-Council, thereupon, under the provisions of the satute, 48 & 49 Vict., ch. 50, ordered that the lands mentioned in said list should be and become \"vested in Her Majesty for the purposes of the Province of Manitoba.\" Subsequently other lands selected as \"swamp lands\" in like manner were transferred to the provincial government.\nThe defendant for the purposes of the suit admitted that: (1) Certain Crown lands in Manitoba were, in pursuance of 48 & 49 Vict., ch. 50, sec. 1, shewn to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands and transferred to the province accordingly: (2) Between the 20th July, 1885, when the said Act received assent, and the various dates when the above mentioned transfers were made to the province, the Dominion Government received certain sums of money produced by the sale of timber, hay and other emblements off some of the said lands so transferred as aforesaid: (3) The Government of the Dominion has retained such sums of money to the use of the Crown for the purposes of the Dominion of Canada.\nBy the judgment appealed from[3] the Exchequer Court of Canada decided in favour of the defendant and the present appeal is asserted on behalf of the Province of Manitoba.\nDaly K.C. and J. Travers Lewis for the appellant. To fully appreciate the question reference should be made to the orders-in-council passed prior to 48 & 49 Vict. ch. 50, and to the debates which took place in the House of Commons. The appellant craves leave to refer to these orders-in-council and debates, as found in \"Hansard,\" because this is merely a controversy between the Crown, as represented in one right by the Dominion, and in the other by the Province of Manitoba, and not between subject and subject. The question in controversy concerns land vested in the Crown. No subject of the Crown is a party to this action; and, for these reasons, counsel should be permitted to refer to these orders-in-council in the \"Hansard\" debates.\nIt clearly appears, from the reference to and quotations made from the statutes of the United States, in the orders-in-council of 19th June, 1886, that it was the express intention and desire of the Government of Canada to pursue the same \"policy\" towards Manitoba in reference to these swamp lands that the Government of the United States had pursued towards the Western States of the Union, that Canada was to adopt the \"American system,\" in dealing with the swamp lands in Manitoba. There were good reasons for this. The United States statute was passed in 1850. Numerous controversies had arisen in connection with the selection and administration of swamp lands, and valuable precedents were thus available, to which the Government might have reference in dealing with the lands. The physical features were similar and the system of surveys in the states affected is identical with the Dominion Lands surveys in Manitoba.\nIn the Act of Congress, granting the swamp lands to Arkansas and other states, the words \"that there be and is hereby granted\" are used in the enacting clause. These and other words of similar purport were advisedly omitted from the first section of the Dominion Act, as it was not necessary to use operative words of grant. See The Queen v. Farwell[4]; Attorney-General for British Columbia v. The Attorney-General for Canada[5].\nThe words \"shall be transferred to the province and enure wholly to its benefit and uses,\" in the Act of 1885, have the same force and operative effect as the words, \"that there be and is hereby granted,\" in the United States statutes, and, consequently, amounted to a grant in pr\u0153senti, of all \"swamp lands\" in the Province of Manitoba to the province, subject only to the Dominion Government being satisfied as to the character of lands. The lands passed to Manitoba on the day when the Act was assented to. The title became perfected when the lands were identified and vested by orders-in-council, the latter merely giving precision to the title. A statute amounting to a present grant does not require the formalities required in an ordinary grant of land to make it effective. Rutherford v Greene's Heirs[6]; Lessieur etal v. Price[7] at page 76 per Catron J.; Railroad Co. v. Freemont County[8]; Railroad Co. v. Smith[9]; Schulenberg v. Harriman[10]; Missouri K. T. Railway Co. v. Kansas Pacific Railway Co.[11].\nThe title to the lands remaining in the province, and the lumber and hay cut upon the land, as well as any other emblements, belong to the province.\nIn Langdeau v. Hanes[12] Field J. held (p. 530) that a legislative confirmation of a claim to land was a recognition of the validity of the claim, and operated as effectually as a grant or quitclaim and that the title there questioned was perfect long before the issue of a patent. French v. Fyan[13] follows the same construction as to the grant in pr\u0153senti. In Wright v. Roseberry[14] Field J. held that the grant of swamp lands to the several states was one in pr\u0153senti passing title to the lands from the date of the Act and requiring only identification to render title perfect. In San Francisco Sav. Union v. Irwin[15] Field, J, held it to be a grant in pr\u0153senti, to each state then in the Union, of lands situated within its limits of the quality described, which could not be defeated, nor impaired, by the delay or refusal to have the list made and patent issued. See also Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Orton[16] at page 479; Railroad Co. v. Baldwin[17] at page 429; Leavenworth L. & G. Railroad Co. v. United States[18]; Denny v. Dodson[19].\nIf this contention prevails, and the grant to Manitoba be held to have been a present grant, operating as an immediate transfer of the lands afterwards shewn to be swamp lands, then, from and after the 20th July, 1885, Manitoba became and was entitled to all income and profits derived from said lands, and, consequently, the Dominion Government should account to Manitoba therefor. The Act of 1885 does not contain any reservation of exception in favour of the Dominion. The grant is absolute and Manitoba should enjoy the same relationship to the Dominion as an ordinary purchaser; the rules between vendor and purchaser should apply. See Leake's Uses and Profits of Land, p. 29; Dart's Vendors and Purchasers (6 ed.) p. 611. The grantor cannot derogate from his own absolute grant, so as to claim rights over the thing granted. Suffield v. Brown[20], per Westbury L. J. at page 190; Wheeldon v. Burrows[21], at page 42; Crossley & Sons v. Lightowler[22]; at page 486; Russell v. Watts[23], at page 572.\nManitoba contends that, from and after the 20th July, 1885, the Dominion was a trustee in the premises. There was an implied trust created by the Act and the ordinary equitable rules as between subject and subject should apply. Perry on Trusts (5 ed.) sec. 30. The Crown may be a trustee; Canada Central Ry. Co. v. The Queen[24]; Lewin on Trusts (10 ed.) 68, 153; Acland v. Gaisford[25] at page 32; Wilson v. Clapham[26]; Ferguson v. Tadman[27]. If the settlor proposes to convert himself into a trustee, then the trust is perfectly created; and whenever a person, having a power of disposition over property, manifests any intention with reference to it in favour of another, the court, when there is a sufficient consideration, will execute that intention through the medium of a trust, however informal the language in which it happens to be expressed. Holroyd v. Marshall[28], per Westbury L. J. at page 209. The Dominion, being trustee for Manitoba, has no right to retain the profits of these lands. No trustee can derive a profit from the exercise of his office, or derive any personal advantage from the trust property Lewin on Trusts (10 ed.) 296, 328; Wightwick v. Lord[29]; Heathcote v, Hulme[30], at page 131. We cite also Williams on Real Property (19 ed.) 171; Washburn Real Property, (ed. 1902) vol. ii. secs. 1441\u20142, 1150, 1501; Aberdeen Town Council v. Aberdeen University[31].\nTurning once more to the statute, even the marginal note to the section in question reads: \"Swamp lands to belong to the province;\" Sheffield Waterworks Co. v. Rennet[32], at p. 421; Venour v. Sellon[33]; and it is to be observed that by sec 7 it is provided that \"the grants of land . . . authorized by the foregoing sections shall be on the condition that they be accepted by the province . . . as a full settlement of all claims made by the said province . . .\" The expression deliberately used is \"the grants of land.\" The statute did not, therefore, merely provide for a future transfer of the swamp lands, but itself characterized the consideration for the settlement of all provincial claims as statutory grants in pr\u0153senti.\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondent. The American cases cited by the appellant have no authority in this court; at best, they may be used only to support arguments. Besides, the Statute at Large, referred to, is, qua the point now in issue, essentially different from the Canadian Act, as will appear from a comparison of the two enactments.\nThere is a long series of decisions in the United States courts upon their statute of which it will be sufficient to mention the leading cases of Railroad Company v. Smith[34]; French v. Fyan[35]; Wright v. Roseberry[36]. In these cases it was held that the plain and indisputable grant made by the words in section 1, must be considered to govern the whole statute which was a grant in pr\u0153senti and this notwithstanding the very strong grounds for negativing such a construction contained in the provisions of section 2. Were it not for the express grant in section 1, it would seem that none of the courts would have been disposed to favour such an interpretation for we find that, notwithstanding the distinct terms of grant in section 1, Mr. Justice Clifford of the Supreme Court in the case of Railroad Company v. Smith (1) dissented from the judgment of the court. There are also judgments in opposite sense in the United States. See Thompson v. Prince[37], where, though overruled in Keller v. Brickey[38], Mr. Justice Scott adhered to his opinion given in the former case. In the Canadian Act there is absolutely no grant nor anything equivalant to a grant and nothing from which an intention to make one could be inferred. It has been suggested that it was the intention of the Dominion Government to follow the course of the United States Congress in assigning swamp lands in the State of Arkansas and other states to the Government of such states, and the official debates of the House of Commons have been cited. There is nothing in the official debates to support this contention. It appears, on the contrary, from several passages, that the Dominion Government understood that the swamp lands would not be transferred to the province until they had been shewn to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be such. See debate on the bill reported in the official debates, 1885, vol. II, at page 2794.\nThe swamp lands which, until the passing of the statute, were undoubtedly vested in the Crown in right of the Dominion remained vested in the Crown after any transfer under the Act. The only change, therefore, is that, after transfer, they enure to the benefit of the province. There is in this Act nothing but a direction that, after the happening of a future event, viz., the lands having been shewn to be swamp lands, they shall be transferred to the provincial administration. If any lands which are swamp lands are never shewn, to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government, to be such, they will never be transferred.\nAs will be seen by section 2 of the United States statutes it is the duty of the Secretary of the Interior to take the initiative in the necessary proceedings for ascertaining the lands to be granted and for completion of the conveyance. By the Canadian statutes no such duty is imposed upon the Dominion Government. All that is provided is that the \"lands which may be shewn to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands shall be transferred.\"\nThe method actually adopted for determining which were swamp lands to be transferred is shewn by the order-in-council. It would seem that the Minister of the Interior somewhat gratuitously accepted the task of ascertaining what were swamp lands which would come under the operation of the statute. How, exactly, the transfer was carried out does not appear to be material. The Act has provided that the lands shall be transferred and the order-in-council is sufficient evidence that all requisite preliminaries have been carried out and the transfer duly completed.\nThe respondent refers to Thompson v. Prince[39]; Keller v. Brickey[40]; Rutherford v. Greene's Heirs[41]; The Queen v. Farwell[42]; Railroad Company v. Smith[43].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nThe appellant contends that this statute should be read as if it enacted an actual and unconditional grant of the swamp lands in question in favour of Manitoba. Now, upon the very wording of the statute, that contention cannot prevail. The grant is conditional. It takes effect only if there are any swamp lands, and so, necessarily, only when it has been ascertained if there are any, and where they are. Shall be transferred when ascertained to be swamp lands cannot mean are transferred in pr\u0153senti.\nThe statute does not say \"are transferred,\" simply because parliament did not intend to transfer the title in pr\u0153senti. The words are plain, and cannot receive the forced construction for which the appellant contends. I agree in my brother Davies' reasoning and conclusions,\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014The first section of chapter 50 of 48 & 49 Vict. enacted on the 20th July, 1885, by the Parliament of Canada,\nAn Act for the final Settlement of the Claims of the Province of Manitoha on the Dominion,\nprovides that\nall Crown lands in Manitoba which may be shewn to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands, shall be transferred to the province and enure wholly to its benefit and uses.\nIt is re-enacted almost word for word in section four of chapter 47 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886, with a slight variation which I believe is of no importance. The words \"which may be shewn,\" etc., are replaced by the following: \"which are shewn, etc.\"\nSection two provides for \"an allotment of land,\" etc., which\nshall be selected by the Dominion Government and granted as an endowment to the University of Manitoba,\nfounded a few years previously.\nBy sections three and five, a certain annual pecuniary indemnity, \"for the want of public lands\" is increased to $100,000 such increase to date from the 1st July, 1885.\nSections four and six authorize the advance of certain sums of money and the re-adjustment of the yearly or semi-yearly subsidies and allowances to be calculated also from the 1st July, 1885. Doubts having arisen as to the true construction of section six an interpretation Act was passed during the following session of 1886, which affects only the money payments.\nClause seven provides that\nthe grants of land and payments authorized by the foregoing sections shall be made on the condition that they be accepted by the province (such acceptance being certified by an Act of the Legislature of Manitoba) as a full settlement of all claims made by the said province for the reimbursement of costs incurred in the government of the disputed territory, or the reference of the boundary question to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and all other questions and claims discussed between the Dominion and the Provincial Government, up to the tenth day of January, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five.\nOn the 26th May, 1886, by 49 Vict. ch. 38, sea 1, the Legislature of Manitoba passed the following acceptance:\nThe Legislature of the Province of Manitoba accepts the grants and payments as authorized and construed by the above recited Acts as a full settlement of all claims by the said Province upon the Dominion, as therein set forth, up to the tenth day of January, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five.\nThe Dominion statute does not provide for any means or method of selecting these swamp lands \"to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government evidently this was considered to be a mere matter of administration and left to the action of the Dominion Government. It was eventually settled by an order-incouncil of the 19th June, 1886. The order-in-council recites that it is expedient to make \"a selection of the swamp lands to be granted\" to Manitoba, provides for the appointment of two surveyors or commissioners by the Minister of the Interior, who are empowered to select the lands in the manner indicated in the American statutes relating to the grant of federal swamp lands (which is recited in the order-in-council), and to furnish from time to time lists of the lands so selected, the whole at the expense of Manitoba, and finally declares that\nthe signification in writing to the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba of the approval of such lists by His Excellency shall operate to vest the title in the lands described in the said lists in Her Majesty for the purposes of the Province of Manitoba. Of course anything in this or any order-in-council contrary to the statute is ultra vires.\nThe surveyors proceeded with their work (which is yet unfinished) and reported lists from time to time which were duly transmitted to Manitoba with the approbation of His Excellency. In these orders in Council the Canadian Government declares\nthat the lands mentioned in the said annexed list * * * be and the same are hereby vested in Her Majesty for the purposes of the Province of Manitoba.\nThe appellant contends that all Crown lands in Manitoba shown at any time to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be Crown swamp lands, became from the date of the passing of said Act the property of Manitoba, including all surface rights, timber, hay crops, baser metals and all other territorial revenues derived from the said lands on and after the 20th July, 1885, the date of the passing of the statute, after deducting costs and charges which the department of the Interior incurred in administering the said lands By his action he demands that an account be taken and payment be ordered.\nThe question is whether section one of the Canadian statute constitutes a transfer in pr\u0153senti of the swamp lands or whether it is a grant stipulated to take effect only on and at the time of the happening of a future event, viz., the selection of the lands to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government as swamp lands.\nThe court below held that this transfer dates only from the orders-in-council. Mr. Justice Burbidge remarks:\nThe statute provides that all Crown lands in Manitoba which may be or (as enacted in the Revised Statutes) are shown to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands shall be transferred to the province and enure wholly to its benefits and uses. But when shall such lands enure to the benefits and uses of the province? The answer, it seems to me, must be, when they have been shewn to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands and have been transferred; and until they are so transferred the Government of Canada have, I think, not only the right to administer such lands, which, as has been said, is not disputed, but also the right to take the revenues arising therefrom to the use of the Dominion.\nWith due deference, it seems to me that this argument goes to the delivery and actual possession of the lands and not to the title or transfer which is in the statute.\nThe appellant has referred us to several American decisions rendered in interpretation of a statute (U. S. Statutes at Large, vol. 9, 519, [1850], respecting swamp lands) similar in many respects to the one under consideration, but apparently very different as to clause one. The language of the American statute is \"that there be and is hereby granted to the State of,\" etc., the swamp lands intended to be conveyed. The expression in the American statute \"hereby,\" that is by means of this, leaves little room for doubt that a transfer in pr\u0153senti was contemplated by Congress, and for this reason I consider that the numerous American decisions defining the nature of the grant under that statute are of little value in the determination of the meaning of clause one of the Canadian Act.\nOther American decisions, however, are quoted by the appellant which seem to me to be quite in point. They were rendered in interpretation of legislative land grants worded in the very language of our Canadian statute. The oldest and leading case is undoubtedly Rutherford v. Greene's Heirs,[44] decided in 1811 by the Supreme Court of the United States when that high tribunal was presided over by one of the greatest jurists of modern times, Chief Justice Marshall. Almost every word of his elaborate judgment applies to the case before us, and I cannot do better than reproduce part of it in support of the view I take of the question. Referring to an Act passed in 1782 by the State of North Carolina \"for the relief of the officers and soldiers of the continental line and for other purposes therein mentioned,\" the eminent judge says:\u2014\nThe 10th section enacts: \"that 25,000 acres of land shall be allotted for, and given to, Major General Nathaniel Greene, his heirs and assigns, within the bounds of the lands reserved for the use of the army, to be laid off by the aforesaid commissioners, as a mark of the high sense this state entertains of the extraordinary services of that brave and gallant officer.\"\nThis is the foundation of the title of the appellees.\nOn the part of the appellant it is contended that these words give nothing. They are in the future, not in the present tense, and indicate an intention to give in future, but create no present obligation on the state, nor present interest in General Greene. The court thinks differently. The words are words of absolute donation, not indeed of any specific land, but of 25,000 acres in the territory set apart for the officers and soldiers.\n\"Be it enacted that 25,000 acres of land shall be allotted for and given to Major General Nathaniel Greene.\" Persons had been appointed in a previous section to make particular allotments for individuals, out of this large territory reserved, and the words of this section contain a positive mandate to them to set apart 25,000 acres for General Greene. As the act was to be performed in future, the words directing it are necessarily in the future tense.\n\"Twenty-five thousand acres of land shall be allotted for, and given to Major General Nathaniel Greene.\" Given when? The answer is unavoidable\u2014when they shall be allotted. Given how? Not by any future act,\u2014for it is not the practice of the legislatures to enact that a law shall be passed by some future legislature,\u2014but given by force of this Act.\nIt is suggested that the answer to the question, \"Given when?\" indicates that a gift in pr\u0153senti was not intended. Evidently here Chief Justice Marshall refers to the lands with metes and bounds. But the answer to the question: \"Given how?\" shews that the gift was created not by the operation of the allotment or survey but by force of the statute. This is made more clear from his following remarks:\u2014\nIt has been said that to make this an operative gift, the words \"are \"hereby\" should have been inserted before the word \"given\" so as to read, \"shall be allotted for, and are hereby given to,\" &c. Were it even true that these words would make the gift more explicit, which is not admitted, it surely cannot be necessary now to say that the validity of a legislative act depends, in no degree, on its containing the technical terms used in a conveyance. Nothing can be more apparent than the intention of the legislature to order their commissioners to make the allotment, and to give the land when allotted to General Greene.\nThe 11th section authorizes the commissioners to appoint surveyors, for the purpose of surveying the lands given by the preceding sections of the law. In pursuance of the directions of this act, the commissioners allotted 25,000 acres of land to General Greene, and caused the track to be surveyed. The survey was returned to the office of the legislature on the 11th of March in the year 1783. The allotment and survey marked out the land given by the Act of 1782, and separated it from the general mass liable to appropriation by others. The general gift of 25,000 acres lying in the territory reserved for the officers and soldiers of the line of North Carolina, and now become a particular gift of the 25,000 acres, contained in this survey * * *\nIt is clearly and unanimously the opinion of this court that the Act of 1782 vested a title in General Greene to 25,000 acres of land, to be laid off within the bounds allotted to the officers and soldiers, and that the survey made in pursuance of that act, and returned in March, 1783, gave precision to that title and attached it to the land surveyed.\nThe soundness of this doctrine has never been questioned in any court of the American Union; on the contrary it has since been frequently reaffirmed by the United States Supreme Court, and more particularly in Lessieur v. Price[45]; Langdon v. Hanes[46]; Schulenberg v. Harriman[47]; Wright v. Roseberry[48].\nAmerican decisions, although not binding, have always been of great weight with English and Canadian courts in the absence of any jurisprudence of their own, as in this particular instance. See Niagara District Fruit Growers Stock Co. v. Walker[49]; Scaramanga & Co. v. Stamp[50]; Itter v. Howe[51]; Skillings v. Royal Ins. Co.[52], part 2; In re Missouri Steamship Co.[53]; Wells v. Gas Float Whitton No. 2[54].\nThe reasons advanced by Chief Justice Marshall commend themselves to my mind; they are convincing, and I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the grant to the Province of Manitoba dates from the statute and not from the respective orders-in-Council.\nAlthough we have no jurisprudence directly in point, yet it cannot be said that we are entirely without authority. In two well considered cases decided by this court a few years ago, I find dicta, propositions and principles which seem to agree with the American decisions. I refer to The Queen v. Farwell[55] and especially The Attorney General of British Columbia v. The Attorney General of Canada[56], as the latter went to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. As in this instance public lands had been granted by statute by one government to another in Canada for consideration; 1st, by the order-in-Council or Articles of Union (Art. 11) of British Columbia, agreed to in 1871 and having the force of an Imperial Statutute; 2ndly, by an Act of the British Columbia Legislature, 43 Vict. ch. 11, passed in 1880; and 3rdly, by another Act of the same legislature, 47 Vict. ch. 14, section 2, passed in December, 1883, in substitution of 43 Vict. ch. 11. All three enactments purport to aid in the construction of a railway through the province, since built and known as the Canadian Pacific, and for that purpose grant to Canada in trust a large tract of public lands in British Columbia\nalong the line of the railway before mentioned wherever it may be finally located, to a width of twenty miles on each side of the line, as provided in the order in Council, section 11, admitting the Province of British Columbia into Confederation. (47 Vict. ch. 14. sec. 2.)\nThese public lands had never been surveyed, and even in 1883, when the last provincial statute was enacted in settlement of long pending difficulties and disputes between the two governments, the line of railway had been only partly located. The wording of the grant is not the same in all the enactments, although I am not prepared to admit that the meaning is different in any of them. Section 11 of the Articles of Union declares \"that the Government of British Columbia agreed to convey to the Dominion Government, etc.\"; the Act 43 Vict. ch. 11 uses the expression \"the lands being granted to the Dominion Government, etc.\"; and section 2 of 47 Vict. ch. 14, enacts that \"there shall be and there is hereby granted to the Dominion Government,\" etc.\nThe Judicial Committee and this court, Henry J. dissenting, did not doubt that the grant was absolute and operated immediately. Judges were divided, not as' to the date of the grant, but only as to whether it included precious metals. The Judicial Committee seems to hold that a transfer of the lands, including territorial revenues, was made by force of the 11th Article of Union rather than by the subsequent provisions of the provincial statutes, the difference in language not being noticed by their Lordships, probably as of no importance in the determination of the point before them. They quote only the Article of Union as the origin or creation of the grant. A few extracts from the reports of the elaborate opinions delivered in all the courts will show that they are at least high authorities in the determination of the point before us. Mr. Justice Fournier who alone in the Supreme Court was of opinion that the grant did not include the precious metals, said:\nDans le trait\u00e9, sec. 11, l'obligation est \"to convey to Dominion Government, &c., &c., a similar extent of public lands,\" dans Pacte 43 Vict. ch. 11, \"lands being granted to the Dominion for the purpose, &c., &c.\", dans la 47 Vict. ch. 14 (Colombie), sec 2. \"there shall be, and there is hereby granted to the Dominion Government, in trust, &c., &c., to be appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, the public lands along the line of the railway, &c., &c.\" Dans la sec. 7 de ce dernier acte les expressions sont: \"There is hereby granted to the Dominion Government, three and a half million acres of land, &c, &c.\" On voit que dans toutes les expressions employ\u00e9es pour faire l'octroi, il n'en est pas une seule qui comporte l'id\u00e9e qu'il y ait autre chose que la terre qui soit octroy\u00e9e. Toutes les expressions sont claires, pr\u00e9cises, n'accordant qu'une seule chose, la terre, et ne laissent aucune place au doute. (page 368.)'\nAnd in The Queen v. Farwell[57], the eminent judge added:\u2014\nIn the case of Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada, p. 345, which was decided by this court yesterday, I had occasion to express my opinion upon the question of the ownership of the precious metals in these railway lands, but as regards the construction to be put upon the statute granting provincial lands in aid of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, I think the expressions used are quite sufficient to convey the lands to the Dominion, and therefore Farwell's title from the Government of British Columbia is void; but I come to this conclusion with the reserve I made in the other case, that the conveyance does not cover the gold and silver mines. * * * (Page 428.)\nChief Justice Ritchie:\u2014\nIt was a a statutory transfer or relinquishment by the Province of British Columbia of the right of that province in or to such public lands to the Dominion of Canada, to be managed, controlled and dealt with by the Dominion Government in as full and ample manner as the Provincial Government could have done had no such Act been passed * * * (Page 358).\nMr. Justice Taschereau concurred with Mr. Justice Gwynne. Mr. Justice Gwynne:\u2014\nThis language of the 11th article of the treaty with reference to the transfer from British Columbia to the Dominion of Canada of this tract of land never could be literally complied with, that is to say that by no species of conveyance could the land be conveyed to the Dominion Government as grantees thereof. That Government, from the nature of the constitution of the Dominion, could not take lands by grant or otherwise, nor could it have the power of appropriation of the tract in question, otherwise than under the direction and control of the Parliament of Canada. When, therefore, as part of the terms upon which British Columbia was received into the Dominion, it was agreed that a tract of the public lands of the Province of British Columbia should be conveyed in such manner as to be subjected to being appropriated as the Dominion Government may deem advisable, what was intended plainly was, as it appears to me, that the beneficial interest which the province had in the particular tract of land as part of the public domain of the province should be divested, and that the tract, although still remaining within the Province of British Columbia, should be placed under the control of the Dominion Parliament as part of the public property of the Dominion. * * * (Pages 375, 376.)\nAnd in The Queen v. Farwell[58], the learned judge remarked:\u2014\nI concur with the majority of this court that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons sufficiently stated in the case of Attorney General of British Columbia v. Attorney General of Canada p. 345; the title of Canada is preferable to the treaty alone, and the Acts of Parliament which were passed to carry out the provisions of the treaty. (Page 428.)\nMr. Justice Henry in The Attorney General for British Columbian. The Attorney General for Canada[59] based his judgment upon his previous opinion in The Queen v. Farwell(1), decided in the Exchequer Court in 1886, in which he declared the grant to Canada void for, among other reasons, 1st. \"That the land is not described or defined; 2nd. That the statute did not operate as an immediate transfer.\" But the learned judge is alone in taking this view of the case, at pages 403 and following. We have the advantage of the opinion of Mr. Justice, afterwards Chief Justice Strong, in the case of The Queen v. Farwell[60], where the Supreme Court held that the grant to Canada in aid of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway was absolute and operated immediately, and declared void a subsequent patent of a parcel of these lands by the province to one Farwell. This case was not appealed to the Privy Council and I presume is binding upon us, especially as it does not conflict with the decision of the Privy Council in The Attorney General of British Columbia v. The Attorney General of Canada[61], the point as to precious metals not being involved.\nMr. Justice Strong said:\nI am of opinion that the objection that the statute required a grant or some subsequent instrument to carry it into execution wholly fails. It was clearly self executing and operated immediately and conclusively so soon as the event on which it was limited to take effect happened, that is as soon as the \"line of railway was finally located.\" Whether upon that event occurring, it operated by relation from the date of its enactment so as to avoid intermediate grants by the Province of British Columbia is an inquiry which the facts of the present case do not require us to enter upon, for the respondent acquired no title to this land until after the line of railway was finally located. * * (Page 425.)\nThe result is that when the letters patent under the great seal of British Columbia issued on the 16th of January, 1885, assuming to grant this land to the respondent, the province bad no title to the land and consequently nothing to grant, an absolute title thereto having previously vested in the Dominion under the statute 47 Vict. ch. 14, upon the final location and ascertainment of the line of railway. (Page 427.)\nIf I understand the learned judge correctly, the final location of the line of railway was a suspensive condition merely of the executed and complete title or possession of the particular lands granted, and not of the general grant or title which \"was clearly self-executing and operated immediately.\" Of course we have not to deal in the present case with the rights of third parties. The effect of the grant has to be considered between the immediate parties to it and in that case the fulfilment of the suspensive condition had a retroactive effect from the day of the grant. Conditio existans retrotrahitur ad tempus contractus Such is the rule of the Roman law and of the English law also; so the learned judge tells us on another occasion; Leblanc v. Robilaille[62].\nThe Lords of the Judicial Committee did not express different views upon the nature of the grant, nor its perfection. They admit its validity and the immediate transfer of the lands and their territorial revenues, but declare that it did not include precious metals, which were distinct, they held, from lands and from part of the prerogative rights of the Crown.\nLord Watson, speaking for the court, first quoted in full article 11 of the order-in-council of 1871, and continued:\nWhether the precious metals are or are not to be held as included in the grant to the Dominion Government, must depend upon the meaning to be attributed to the words \"public lands\" in the 11th Article of Union. The Act 47 Vict. c. 14, s. 2, which was passed in fulfilment of the obligation imposed upon the province by that article and the agreement of 1883, defines the area of the lands, but it throws no additional light upon the nature and extent of the interest which was intended to pass to the Dominion. The obligation is to \"convey\" the lands, and the Act purports to \"grant\" them, neither expression being strictly appropriate, though sufficiently intelligible for all practical purposes. The title to the public lands of British Columbia has all along been, and still is, vested in the Crown, but the right to administer and to dispose of these lands to settlers, together with all royal and territorial revenues arising therefrom, had been transferred to the province before its admission into the Federal Union.\nLeaving the precious metals out of view for the present, it seems clear that the only \"conveyance\" contemplated was a transfer to the Dominion of the provincial right to manage and settle the lands, and to appropriate their revenues. * * * It therefore appears to their Lordships that a conveyance by the province of \"public lands\" which is, in substance, an assignment of its right to approximate the territorial revenues arising from such lands, does not imply any transfer of its interest in revenues arising from the prerogative rights of the Crown. The 11th article does not appear to them to constitute a separate and independent compact. It is part of a general statutory arrangement, of which the leading enactment is, that, on its admission to the Federal Union, British Columbia shall retain all the rights and interests assigned to it by the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, which govern the distribution of provincial property and revenues between the Province and the Dominion; the 11th article being nothing more than an exception from these provisions. The article in question does not profess to deal with jura regia; it merely embodies the terms of a commercial transaction, by which the one government undertook to make a railway, and the other to give a subsidy, by assigning part of its territorial revenues.\nThe exception created by the 11th Article of Union, from the rights specially assigned to the province by sect. 109, is of \"lands\" merely. The expression \"lands\" in that article admittedly carries with it the base metals, that is to say \"mines\" and \"minerals\" in the sense of sect. 109. Mines and minerals in that sense, are incidents of lands and, as such, have been invariably granted, in accordance with the uniform course of provincial legislation, to settlers who purchased lands in British Columbia. But jura regalia are not accessories of land; and their Lordships are of opinion that the rights to which the Dominion Government became entitled under the 11th article did not to any extent derogate from the provincial right to \"royalties\" connected with mines and minerals under sect. 109 of the British North America Act.\nI find the same principles laid down in another decision of the Privy Council. I refer to The Government of Newfoundland v. Newfoundland Railway Co.[63] decided in 1888. By contract confirmed by an Act of the legislature of the colony, the government covenanted and agreed to pay certain money subsidies in aid of the location, construction and operation, for a certain number of years, of 340 miles of a railway from St. John's to Hall's Bay and also to grant in fee simple to the Syndicate Company 5,000 acres of land for each one mile of railway completed throughout the entire length of 340 miles. The said fee simple grant of 5,000 acres of land per mile to be made to the said Syndicate Company upon completion of each section of five miles of railway, or fraction thereof, at the terminus at Hall's Bay.\nThe statute or contract then contains provisions for ascertaining the lands to be granted which were to be selected within a certain time by the railway company in alternate sections or blocks.\nLord Hobhouse said:\nAs regards the grants of land, they (their Lordships) feel little difficulty. It does not appear quite clearly what has been done with respect to these lands, but the argument has proceeded on the footing that in some cases grants have been completed; in some the company has selected blocks (as by the contract it has a right to do) but no grants have been made; and in the rest there has been no selection of blocks.\nIn their Lordships' views, the contract is not so framed as to make the grants of land dependent in any way on the completion of the whole line, or upon anything but the completion of each five-mile section. As each of these sections was completed, the right to twenty-five thousand acres of land became perfect. The company has time allowed to select its blocks, but may if it pleases make the selection at once. There may, or rather must, be delays in selection, and in the formalities of conveyance. But their Lordships think that it would not be in accordance either with the objects for which grants of this kind are intended, viz: the immediate attraction of settlers, or with the frame of the contract, if they were to hold that the perfect right which the company has gained on completion of each section is lessened by such delays[64].\nThe decree of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland that the Government should make the grants of the said lands was confirmed, although in some cases, as stated by Lord Hobhouse, no selection of blocks of land had been made.\nThe question in issue in The Attorney General of British Columbia v. The Attorney General of Canada[65] does not present itself in the present case, and therefore it cannot be said that the case is in point. The Queen v. Farwell[66] is perhaps more so. Lord Watson and nearly all the Judges of the Court based their judgment upon the Articles of Union of British Columbia and not upon the statute of that Province. Whether The Queen v. Farwell (1) is in point or not, it cannot be denied that a great deal has been said by all the eminent judges which throws light upon the nature and effect of a statutory transfer or grant of public lands by one government to another like that of the swamp lands.\nThe language of the Canadian statute of 1885 now under consideration seems to me to be stronger than that of any other statute quoted above. The word \"transferred\" used in section one of the Dominion Act leaves less room for doubt than the words \"agree to convey\" in the Articles of Union of British Columbia, \"agree to grant\" in the Newfoundland statute, or \"allotted\" and \"given\" in the North Carolina Act, at least in the mind of the Canadian Parliament. That is made more clear when we compare it with sect. 2 which provides for an endowment to the University of Manitoba. The lands given must be selected first and granted after, probably by a patent, although a donation in pr\u0153senti may be contemplated, a point we are not called upon to decide. It cannot be denied that the language of sections 1 and 2 of the Canadian statute is different and much stronger in section one. The swamp lands are granted first and selected after and delivered without the necessity of a patent.\nAmerican statutes respecting swamp or other public lands require the issue of a patent, but in such a case it is held to operate merely as record evidence of a complete title, adding nothing to the legislative grant beyond identification or delimitation. The Canadian statute, it is admitted, does not require a patent, which is looked upon as impracticable under our system of government, all public lands being held by one and the same sovereign, the King of England, although for different purposes, whereas the United States and the different states of the Union form distinct sovereignties. Transfers of lands from the Dominion to a Province are invariably made by force of the statute without a patent. In conformity with this practice, the Dominion Act of 1885 enacts that the swamplands in Manitoba shall be transferred, and by this I presume that Parliament did not mean only the mere power to transfer or even the naked transfer or grant, which is the expression used in section 7\u2014the words \"transfer\" and \"grant\" being moreover synonymous\u2014but the fee simple, right, title, estate, property, ownership and possession legally resulting upon a grant of land to the grantee, altogether distinct from the complete title and the actual possession of the particular lots of land resulting from the surveys, selection and delivery made under the statute.\nThese grants of public lands amounting to sales, as they were made for consideration, cannot be considered in the light of sales of things moveable sold by number or measure, which according to numerous decisions are not perfect till the counting or measuring is done. They are sales in the lump and not by number or measure; they have for object a specific kind of lands, namely, Crown swamp lands, which can easily be ascertained and selected. This selection is a mere incident in the transaction, which could be carried out even against the will of the Dominion Government. It is so far from being a condition precedent that if by any possibility the Dominion Government did refuse to select the lands that selection could be enforced by a decree of the Exchequer Court. It has nothing to do with the title, but merely with the delivery and actual possession of the lands. If before delivery the lands should disappear through an earthquake or any other Act of God, the loss would fall, not upon the Dominion, but upon Manitoba, who would have no claim for an indemnity; likewise, accretion would benefit Manitoba alone. This is the true test of ownership.\nThe Dominion Act, different in this respect from all American statutes, does not provide for the appointment of surveyors to select the lands. It merely enacts that the Dominion Government must be satisfied that the lands are swamp lands. That Government is not authorized to \"vest\" these lands in Manitoba, as was done by the order in Council of the 16th April, 1888; this took place by the operation of the statute. However, as these words affect only the actual possession and do no harm, no reasonable objection can be made against their use. But the Dominion Government cannot declare that they \"vest the title in the lands\" as was done in the order in Council of the 19th of June, 1886. This is contrary to the statute as I read it.\nThis order in Council shows that the Dominion Government has practically adopted the American method of selecting the lands, well aware that it was settled by a long standing jurisprudence and that it would be a safe guide for all concerned. They might, however, have adopted any other mode, the statute requiring in general terms only the expression of their satisfaction in the premises.\nAnd if section one means only a grant in futuro, why the words at the end of it \"and enure wholly to its benefits and uses?\" If these words take effect only from the date of the orders in Council, they are useless and without meaning, for no one will dispute, and it is admitted by the respondent, that without them the Province of Manitoba would be entitled to all the territorial revenues of the swamp lands from the date of the orders in Council. They were not inserted to make that point clearer, for it is not disputable; they were used to emphasize that the grant preceding immediately was in pr\u0153senti and not in futuro.\nIt appears to me that section 7 indicates that the selection of the lands has nothing to do with the existence of the grant or title. It says that\nthe grants of land and payments authorized by the foregoing section shall be made on the condition that they be accepted by the province (such acceptance being certified by an Act of the Legislature of Manitoba) as a full settlement of all claims made by the said province, etc.\nThat is the only expressed condition attached to the very existence of the grant which undoubtedly had the effect of suspending it till the condition had been accomplished. Under well settled rules of law it would be inoperative if the event does not happen; but if it does, the fulfilment of the condition makes the grant perfect from its date, for as Lord Bacon observes\nthe assent of the grantee is presumed to an act which is for his benefit until he dissents.\nBacon's Abridg vol 4, p. 537, Vo. Grants.\nThe selection of the lands to the satisfaction of the Dominion is not mentioned in section 1 as a condition suspensive of the title of the swamp lands; it is not available to the Dominion to defeat the grant; but even if it was, its fulfilment would have a retroactive effect from the date of the statute.\nThe respondent in his statement of defence alleges that \"any right, title or interest whatever\" of the province did not accrue until such lands had been shown to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands.\nThis is adding to the language of the statute, and I am not prepared to do so. It is contended that this language is implied from the expressions in section 1\nwhich may be shown to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands.\nThese words do not imply a suspensive condition as to the particular swamp lands with metes and bounds; they establish a mere covenant on the part of the Dominion authorities that they will select the lands; they do not support the contention advanced by the respondent; they do not create the right, title or interest of the province which is in the statute, and according to the rule of law that the proprietor is entitled to the territorial revenues of his property, these must reckon from the date of title, that is, of the statute. Such is the principle followed in all the American cases cited at the Bar, where it is shown that the grant is in pr\u0153senti, and I believe they are in accordance with the English common law. See Am. & Eng. Enc. of Law, (2 ed ) vol. 14, p. 1113; vol. 26, pp. 326, 344 and notes.\nI find in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886, ch. 47, unmistakable evidence that Parliament intended to grant in pr\u0153senti. Clause 4 of chapter 47 re-enacts this first section and immediately before we read in clause 3:\nAll ungranted or waste lands in the province shall be vested in Her Majesty, and administered by the Governor in Council for the purposes of Canada.\nNo one can doubt that this provision, although in the future tense, has a present operation. I cannot see any reason why the same Parliament, when using the same language in section 4 of the same statute, did not mean the same thing, especially as this interpretation is the only one which meets the circumstances of the case.\nI do not look upon the Canadian statute of 1885 as an ordinary piece of legislation, passed in the interest only of the Dominion at large. It is more a compromise of claims made by a Province against the Dominion, or perhaps more correctly an offer of settlement of claims proposed by the latter which the province has accepted. After this acceptance the statute is in the nature of an agreement or contract for consideration between the Dominion and Manitoba which, I take it for granted, could not very well be repealed or altered except with the consent of the province.\nMoreover, the view I take of the meaning of that statute is the only one consistent with the circumstances of the case and any other construction would, it seems to me, partly defeat the object of the Act. The province has no public land like Ontario and Quebec and the other old provinces, and in compensation for this it is allowed a yearly indemnity which by that very statute is increased from $45,000 to $100,000. A large amount of land in the province, granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Hudson Bay Company, was exempt from school and municipal taxes. Thereafter swamp lands shall belong to the province. The yearly and half yearly money subsidies and allowances based upon population are also increased. A fresh advance to the province of $150,000 was authorized to meet the cost of constructing a lunatic asylum and other exceptional services. Manitoba had incurred a large expenditure in the government of a vast disputed territory since known as New Ontario, which she lost by a judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, thereby being deprived of extensive revenues derived from the population settled in that territory. It is evident from the reading of the statute that she was entitled to some indemnity from the Dominion. All its provisions show that the increases in money were to commence at once, even before the Act was passed, namely, from the 1st July, 1885. If the interpretation given by the respondent is to prevail, one grant only, and a most important one, is to be beneficial in futuro, viz., the grant of swamp lands. The immediate revenue from this source was however needed to reclaim these very lands. The province had to provide for the costs of survey and selections, a course not generally pursued except when dealing with one's own lands. Great expense for draining and irrigation would be incurred, and if the province is to receive only the bare land, denuded of timber and other territorial revenues, it may be doubtful if the grant would be of any benefit. This could not have been intended by the Parliament of Canada. Substantial and immediate satisfaction was evidently demanded and accorded. Claims made against the Dominion had to be satisfied presently. To decide that these swamp lands would be available in five, ten, fifteen, twenty years, or even later, is to defeat the object of Parliament. It is especially in such a case that we must enforce the rule of law embodied in our Interpretation Act, viz:, that every Act of Parliament must receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best insure the attainment of the object of the Act and of every provision or enactment thereof, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nFinally, the respondent has not contended in his factum, and I do not understand that he seriously advanced any contrary proposition at the Bar that if the grant be in pr\u0153senti the appellant is not entitled to an account of the revenues and profits from the 20th July, 1885, till Manitoba was put in actual possession under the orders-in-council. Whether considered as a trustee in law or in fact, the Dominion Government having received revenues and profits which did not belong to it, must account for them to the Province of Manitoba.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the action of the appellant maintained with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The question to be decided in this appeal is as to the proper construction of the Dominion statute 48 & 49 Vict. ch. 50, entituled \"An Act for the final Settlement of the Claims made by the Province of Manitoba on the Dominion.\"\nThe first section of that statute reads as follows:\nAll Crown lands in Manitoba which may be shewn to the satisfacfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands, shall be transferred to the Province and enure wholly to its benefits and uses.\nThe section is substantially re-enacted in ch. 47 of the Revised Statutes of Canada. The dispute is as to the meaning of the section, whether it is to be construed as operating in pr\u0153senti so as immediately to confer the right on Manitoba to the swamp lands therein referred to or as doing so only as and when these lands were shewn to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands. I agree with the learned judge of the Exchequer Court that the shewing of the lands to be swamp lands to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government is a condition precedent to their use and benefit enuring to Manitoba. There are no words of present transfer used in this section as was the case in Farwell v. The Queen[67], and as are to be found in many of the United States cases referred to during the argument. On the contrary the language used, I think, refers to the happening of some future necessary action to identify the lands and makes their transfer conditional upon that action taking place. It was impossible to locate, identify or describe in a statute the swamp lands of Manitoba or to separate them from the other lands of the Dominion Government. It was impossible even to approximate their acreage. They could only be identified and located after a careful survey by competent surveyors, shewing them to be \"swamp\" as distinguished from other lands; and it seems to me that by the very terms of the section it was only those lands shewn to be \"swamp\" to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government, which were to pass to Manitoba. They could not pass until the facts to enable the Dominion Government to reach a conclusion as to the character of the lands had first been obtained and submitted to the Government. What was to pass? All Crown lands shewn to the satisfaction, etc., to be swamp lands. When were they to pass? Surely only and as they were so shown. They clearly could not pass on the enactment of the Dominion statute, for apart from questions of identity in respect of the lands and satisfaction of the Government as to their quality, the seventh section expressly provided that the grants of land and payments of money authorized were made and authorized on the condition that they should be accepted by the province as a full settlement of its claims, etc. Nothing is said about the lands passing when Manitoba accepted which was not till the following year. We were referred to many United States cases on similar statutes granting lands from the United States to individual states of the Union. But they do not help, at all, in the construction of this statute, because the language used in them is quite different and could leave little, if any, doubt that the grants were to be in pr\u0153senti. The language of the 9th United States Statutes at Large (1850) page 519, is \"that there be and is hereby granted.\" Similar language was used in the British Columbia statute, 47 Vict. ch. 14, which came before this court for construction in the case of The Queen v. Farwell[68], and as Mr. Justice Strong there said:\nIt (the statute) was clearly self-executing and operated immediately and conclusively so soon as the event on which it was limited to take effect happened, that is as soon as the line of railway was finally located.\nWe were pressed with the decision of Chief Justice Marshall in the United States case of Rutherford v. Greene's Heirs[69]. I have read the decision most carefully, but confess that as read by me it is a strong authority for the respondent in this case. The only part of the judgment applicable to the case at Bar is that which puts a construction upon the statute as to the time when the gift of the lands attached. The distinguished jurist answering a contention that the words in the statute gave nothing to General Greene expressed his opinion that they were words of absolute donation, not indeed of any specific land, but of 25,000 acres in the territory set apart for the officers and soldiers. The words of the section there in controversy were\nthat 25,000 acres of land shall be allotted for and given to Major General Greene, his heirs and assigns, within the bounds of lands reserved for the use of the army to be laid off by the aforesaid commissioners as a mark of the high sense, etc.\nAfter pointing out that in a previous section persons had been appointed to make particular allotments for individuals and quoting the above words of the section granting to General Greene, the Chief Justice asks:\nGiven when? The answer is unavoidable, when they shall be allotted. Given how? Not by any future act, for it is not the practice of legislation to enact that a law shall be passed by some future legislature, but given by force of this Act.\nAs a fact the Dominion Government seems to have gratuitously assumed the duty of surveying and selecting the swamp lands. No complaint is made either of the terms on which the surveys and selections were made, nor is it alleged that there has been undue delay. It was quite open to Manitoba to have had the surveys made if the province had so determined and to have placed the necessary evidence before the Dominion Government to have satisfied it of the existence and location of swamp lands to which it was entitled under the statute. But nothing of the kind was done. The method and manner of location was left entirely to the Dominion without protest or complaint.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nKILLAM J (dissenting).\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court proceeded upon the view that the transfer referred to by the statute was to take place only upon its being shown to the satisfaction of the. Dominion Government that the lands were \"swamp lands,\" that in the meantime the lands were to be administered by the officers of the Crown for the Dominion, and that this involved the right of the Dominion to the beneficial enjoyment of the lands in the interval.\nI quite agree that a formal conveyance of the lands was not necessary. The lands were vested in the Crown and were to remain so vested. And the province was to have no right to occupy or deal with the lands in the interval. Whether the proposed transfer was to be by force of the statute or was to require a formal act seems to me unimportant. At any rate, for its completion, some indication of the Dominion Government being satisfied that the lands were swamp lands would be contemplated.\nBut it does not appear to me to be a necessary consequence that the absolute right to the beneficial enjoyment was to remain in the Dominion until the Government became so satisfied. In my opinion the statute 48 & 49 Vict. ch. 50, sec. 1, necessarily imposed a limitation upon the right of the Dominion to administer and beneficially enjoy the lands.\nBy the statute constituting the Province of Manitoba, 33 V. ch. 3, sec 30 (D.) 1870,\nall ungranted or wastelands in the province shall be * * * vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of the Dominion, subject, &c.\nBut such administration must, of course, be treated as subject to the control of Parliament, which could dictate the purposes. In this case it did dictate that certain lands were to be applied to a particular purpose. By various other enactments the Parliament of Canada has fettered the executive in the administration of Dominion lands. Certain sections have been allotted to the Hudson Bay Company; others have been set aside for school purposes for the benefit of the Province of Manitoba or the North-West Territories; others have been allotted or agreed to be granted to railway companies; other dispositions have been provided for. The authorities administering the lands must do so subject to these enactments and to the rights arising under them.\nIt seems to me that, by virtue of the Dominion Act, 48 & 49 Vict. ch. 50, and the acceptance of its terms by the provincial Act, 49 Vict. ch. 38, there arose a legislative contract between the Dominion and the province, under which, in consideration of the release of certain claims of the province, the dominion was to make certain grants to the province and to do other things of value to the province and its inhabitants. The Dominion Act, then, should be interpreted by analogy to the principles applied to contracts for the sale of land. It was as if a party agreed to sell all portions of an estate which should be ascertained to be woodland, or pasture land, or of some other character. The fact that the Dominion Government, and not an independent party, was to be the judge of the character could not affect the matter.\nThe logical conclusion from the reasoning of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court would be that the officers of the Crown for the Dominion could continue to dispose of all swamp lands in Manitoba, as before the Act of 1885, and appropriate the proceeds without liability to account therefor. Such a construction would go far to render nugatory the agreed grant of the swamp lands to Manitoba. It does not appear to me that it is any answer to this reasoning to say that the lands were not likely to be sold to any considerable extent or that the province could trust to the sense of right and justice of the Dominion authorities. It must be assumed that the Dominion intended to bind itself to something, that some distinct right was intended to be given to the province. Otherwise the Dominion would do no injustice by disposing of the lands as it saw fit.\nIn my opinion the Act was intended to operate with reference to all lands which were Crown lands at the time of the enactment and which should thereafter be shewn to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands. It is true that the right to occupy and control and administer the lands was to accrue at a future date. But the agreement and the statutory direction for the transfer would not be fulfilled by transfer of the lands stripped of timber or otherwise rendered of much less intrinsic value.\nIn the case of an agreement between two private individuals for the sale and purchase of land, executed on the part of the purchaser, the vendor would be enjoined against the destruction of timber or other waste or made to account therefor, and he would be made to account for rents and profits or to allow an occupation rent for lands beneficially occupied.\nThe words \"shewn to the satisfaction of the Dominion Government to be swamp lands\" should, in my opinion, be treated as descriptive only of the lands to be transferred. They are not words of condition, except in so far as the ascertainment of the lands imposed a condition upon the completion. But once ascertained, applying the principles applicable to contracts of sale, the right to the benefits and uses should be deemed to have accrued not later than the execution of the consideration on the part of the province.\nThe provincial statute accepting the grants and payments in settlement of the claims was not enacted for about a year after the Dominion statute; but the claims were old ones existing prior to the Dominion Act. I think that the acceptance should be treated as relating back, so that the consideration should be deemed to have been executed at the passing of the Act of 1885.\nIt must have been in the contemplation of Parliament that the work of ascertaining the character of the lands would occupy years. No provision was made for the payment of interest or other compensation for the inevitable delay. About the time of the enactment of the provincial Act an order was made by the Governor-General-in-Council laying down certain rules to guide in settling the character of the lands, and providing for the selection of the swamp lands by two surveyors appointed by the Minister of the Interior, but paid by and conducting their work at the expense of the Province. This was merely a provision for the practical working out of the statute, which must necessarily take a long time, and is, I understand, not yet completed.\nThe provision is that the lands are to be \"transferred to the province and enure wholly to its benefits and uses.\" Taking the prior words as defining the lands to be transferred and of which the uses and benefits are to enure to the province, I think that the proper construction is to treat it as speaking from the time of its enactment and as providing that the uses and benefits were to enure from that time to the province. This construction appears strengthened by the use of the word \"wholly\" and by the analogy of contracts of sale, it has the advantage, also, of giving some effect to the words \"enure wholly to its benefits and uses,\" which would be absolutely useless with reference to the period following the completed and formal transfer.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

In October, 1894, a license to search for minerals was granted to the Dominion Coal Co. over lands in the neighbourhood of those leased to Murray and was alleged by the appellant to include a portion of such leased lands. In July, 1897, the company applied for a lease for coal mining of a portion of the lands covered by its license to search, including the parts said to have been leased to Murray. The contention on the part of the company was that the commissioner had never given any decision upon this application, and that he was bound by law to do so. It was this application which the court in Nova Scotia had commanded the commissioner to \"take into consideration.\"\nThe proceedings on the application of the respondent company are fully set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K C. and Mackay for the appellant. The appellant decided that the application had been disposed of and could not be re-opened. Such decision could have been appealed from and such decision as the commissioner should have given obtained. No appeal having been taken, mandamus will not lie. See Rex v. Justices of Middlesex[1].\nMandamus sets the machinery of the courts in motion but will not direct the performance of any judicial act. High on Extraordinary Legal Remedies, sec. 152. The Queen v. Justices of Middlesex[2].\nThe following cases were also cited. Mott v. Lockhart[3]; Williamson v. Bryans[4]; Meyers v. Baker[5]; Fielding v. Mott[6]. Lovett for the respondents. Mandamus is the proper remedy. The Queen v. Adamson[7]; The Queen v. Boteler[8].\nThe decision of the commissioner must not be uncertain nor doubtful. The King v. Archbishop of Canterbury[9].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. \u2014 I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Killam.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I reluctantly yield to the conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed. I do so reluctantly because, in my opinion, while the decision given by the commissioner in the first instance was defective and uncertain in neglecting to decide expressly upon the application of the respondents for a lease it was rendered certain by the commissioner's second decision of the 21st April, 1900. In this latter decision he affirmed the validity of the lease to Rev. Mr. Murray, and the fact that it was considered by him as the evidence of the contract made by the department with Murray leasing to the latter a piece of land described in the lease. It further decided that the coal company's application could not be granted in its entirely but that the department was\nprepared to grant to the Dominion Coal Company a lease of so much or the ground described in said application, dated as above (meaning respondent's application), as is not covered by the lease granted to said John Murray.\nThis decision seems to me to have covered everything which, on the application before him, the commissioner was called upon to decide. Of course it might have been couched in more formal language but in view of the questions of overlapping as between Murray's existing lease and respondents' application for one, which were raised on the investigation hold by the commissioner, and of the definite and emphatic statement made in his evidence by Dr. Gilpin, the deputy-commissioner, that the only objection to granting the application was the one of its overlapping Murray's lease, I think it was quite clear and definite. I am not therefore surprised that with the evidence of this decision of his predecessor standing as part of the records of his department the present commissioner should have declined re-opening a case which as far as his records shewed he was quite justified in considering as closed and settled by his predecessor. I am quite at a loss to understand how this decision came to be set aside by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Of course its validity depends upon the conclusion being reached that the first attempted decision of the commissioner was invalid for uncertainty and a nullity. That being conceded I do n6t understand the grounds upon which the court acted in setting aside the decision of the 21st April. No reasons were given by the learned judges and the assumption in the formal rule quashing the appeal of the Dominion Coal Company on the ground that the decision\nwas signed by the deputy-commissioner and is not a decision of said commissioner from which an appeal can be asserted\nwas, as I understand, admitted in the argument at Bar to be a mistake as the document in question was signed by the commissioner's own name and by himself. Of course the holding of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that the decision of the commissioner of the 21st of April, 1900, \"was not one from which an appeal could be asserted,\" could be supported on the ground that the commissioner was at the time functus officio, having already given his decision. But I do not understand this reason is advanced by either of the litigants or by the court itself and in the absence of any reasons for the judgment we are left in the dark as to the grounds on which it was based. I gather from the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend in the present appeal that the court looked upon the decision in question merely as an explanation of his first attempted decision and not as a substantive decision. But in view of the fact that the second decision incorporated the first one in its very words and then went on to supply its deficiencies I cannot think that the suggested reason would be held a good one. However the decision setting aside this last decision of the commissioner is final and I feel myself bound by it as did the trial judge in this action. I do not agree with either the trial judge or with Mr. Justice Townshend, who delivered the judgment of the court in banco, that the commissioner was to say yes or no to the application simply. From the evidence before the] commissioner it appeared that Murray's lease granted some years before the Dominion Coal Company's application was made might overlap the lands applied for in the latter. Whether it would do so or not depended largely upon the construction of the lease and other facts to be determined. Were the posts and specific distances in the description of the lands leased to control and the reference to the original application for a license to search to be treated as falsa demonstration or was the latter line to control the specific distances? These were legal questions on which the commissioner I think had no right to pass. What lands were legally covered by Murray's lease was a question to be determined afterwards by the court in a proper action. No decision of the commissioner could either contract or expand the legal boundaries of Murray's lease. But a simple affirmative answer might well land the department in the position of having granted the same lands to different parties and possibly involve it in an expensive litigation. I conceive therefore that the commissioner might well grant the Dominion Coal Company's application subject to and excepting thereout such lands as might be found and determined to be included in the Murray lease; in other words, bounding it by the lands, whatever they were, described in the Murray lease. Such a decision would leave the respective claims of the parties for adjudication by the proper tribunals and such a decision I would have supposed but for the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia had been reached and expressed in the document signed by Mr. Commissioner Church of the 21st April, 1900.\nI was at first inclined to adopt the appellant's contention that the respondents in applying for a madamus had mistaken their remedy which was by way of writ of scire facias. But further consideration has convinced me that this is not so. The questions to be determined between the parties here, as I understand them, depend not so much upon whether Murray's lease should have been granted or not as upon the meaning of the description in the lease. What respondents want is a determination of their application for a lease. That they are entitled to have. We are all of opinion that what is called the first decision of Commissioner Church was void for uncertainty. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has held, and its decision on the point is final and binding, that the second decision of the commissioner was \"not one from which an appeal would lie\" and therefore was not a decision at all. There is no other remedy is it appears to me open to the respondents under the circumstances than the one they have taken, and that being the controlling test as to whether an action for a mandamus will lie the question must, I think, be decided in favour of the action lying.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Killam.\nKILLAM J.\u2014The principal contention on the part of the commissioner is that his predecessor in office, long ago, considered the company's application and gave his decision with reference thereto, and that another commissioner is not bound to re-open the matter and decide upon it anew.\nThree written documents are relied upon as constituting the decision of the former commissioner.\nThe document of the 7th April, 1899, purported to express a decision upon a dispute between the Dominion Coal Co. and the Rev. John Murray, relative to the overlapping of Murray's lease by the company's application for a lease. The decision was that Murray's lease was not void or uncertain, and that it be and remain the evidence of the contract between Murray and the Crown.\nThis did not, upon its face, determine anything regarding the company's application. A reference to the notice of investigation and to the full record does not seem to extend its effect in this respect. It is argued that the necessary result of adjudging Murray's lease good was to preclude the commissioner from granting a lease to the company of the common ground. But it does not appear whether the commissioner found that there was any overlapping, or what he considered he ought to do with reference to the company's application.\nThe second document was a copy of a letter signed by the deputy-commissioner and sent by him to the company's solicitor, purporting to express what the ommissioner considered to be the effect of the prior decision. The company's appeal from a decision of the commissioner as of the date of that letter was quashed, on Murray's motion, upon the ground, as stated in the rule or order of the court, that\nthe letter of February 1st, 1900, signed by the deputy-commissioner is not a decision of said commissioner from which an appeal can be asserted.\nThe third document was also made the subject of an appeal, which, again, was quashed, on Murray's motion, upon the ground, as set out in the rule or order of the court,\nthat the document of April 21st, 1900, signed by the deputy-commissioner, is not a decision of said commissioner from which an appeal can be asserted.\nThe appellant, in his factum, states that the reference to the document as signed by the deputy commissioner was an error.\nThe service upon the commissioner of the statutory notice required for the purpose of initiating the appeal does not appear to me to have the effect of making the commissioner a party to the appeal. It is a notice to the tribunal being appealed from for the purpose of informing it of the appeal and of procuring the transmission of the requisite material. It is a step in carrying the matter from the original tribunal to the appellate court.\nBut it appears to me that the inferior tribunal must be bound by the judgment of the appellate court in the matter, without being a party thereto.\nThe quashing of the appeals would not necessarily have determined that there was no appealable decision, were it not for the statement of the grounds. This statement, however, is a binding adjudication which works an estoppel between the parties. See Alison's Case[10]. It was adjudged by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, as between the parties to the appeal, that the commissioner had not given an appealable decision in the matter. On this ground the company was precluded from exercising its statutory right to appeal from what the commissioner's successor now says was an appealable decision. In that matter, and as between those parties, he should not be permitted to take that position.\nThe statute did not, in express terms, command the commissioner to give an appealable decision. But it appears to me to have given to the holder of a license to search a right to acquire a lease of a portion of the area covered by the license, upon duly making his application to the commissioner. The commissioner is given jurisdiction to inquire into and decide upon the application, and his decision is subject to appeal to the highest legal tribunal of the province.\nIt was imperative upon him to exercise the jurisdiction when called upon to do so by a party interested and having the right to make the application. Rex v. Havering Atte Bower[11]; Macdougall v. Paterson[12]; Julius v. The Lord Bishop of Oxford[13].\nAlthough the Commissioner is a member of the Executive Council of the Province the Act gave him jurisdiction to decide upon a question of right, and made his decision subject to review by a legal tribunal. It appears to me that, in such a matter, he was not to act as a member of the executive or as the agent of the Crown, but he was given jurisdiction to exercise a judicial function, which a party in the position of the respondent company had a right to call upon him, and the court the power to command him, to exercise. It is true that, when the decision is given, the remedy is by way of appeal. But until there is a decision there can be no appeal.\nI express no opinion upon the questions of the correctness of the decisions in the Nova Scotia court that the documents mentioned were not appealable decisions.\nBy virtue of the conclusions of the court, the company was not allowed to appeal from them and could not now do so if we considered that the conclusions upon this point were erroneous.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

The statement of claim alleged the receipt by Brown of a large number of sums of money on the plaintiffs account, amounting in the aggregate to $1,262.75, and failure to account for or pay over the same.\nBrown did not defend the action, but the sureties did. By their statements of defence, besides generally denying the allegations in the statement of claim, they set up the following defences:\u2014\n1. Dishonesty of Brown while employed by the plaintiff prior to the giving of the bond, known to the plaintiff and fraudulently concealed from these defendants when the bond was given;\n2. Large indebtedness of Brown to the plaintiff arising in the course of such prior employment fraudulently concealed from these defendants;\n3. Material change in Brown's remuneration as fixed by his agreement with the plaintiff, made after the giving of the bond without the knowledge or consent of the sureties;\n4. Similar material alteration of the nature of Brown's employment;\n5. Failure of Brown, from the first month of his employment after the bond, to remit moneys monthly as required by his agreement, under which plaintiff had a power of dismissal for such default, and retention of Brown;\n6. Practically a repetition of the 5th, with allegations that it was the plaintiff's duty to notify the sureties of the default and omission to do so;\n7. Systematic failure by Brown to remit, and neglect to notify sureties;\n8. Dishonesty and misconduct of Brown, prior to defaults sued for, entitling plaintiff to dismiss, and retention of Brown, and connivance of plaintiff with him in the continuance of dishonesty; 9. Similar dishonesty and misconduct, and fraudulent concealment from sureties.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Meagher, with a jury, and upon the answers of the jury to certain questions judgment was directed to be entered for the plaintiff. The sureties moved to set aside the findings of the jury and the order for judgment, and to have judgment in their favour or a new trial.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia set aside the findings and the order for judgment and directed a new trial.\nThe plaintiff association carries on the business of life insurance.\nThe defendant was employed by the plaintiff from 1891 to September, 1900. One contract of service, made in 1895, terminated at the end of 1897. After some negotiations during the months of January, 1898, a new contract was made, in writing, dated 1st January, 1898, by which Brown was to act as agent of the association for five years from that date at such places as the association should from time to time designate. By the terms of this instrument Brown was to canvass for new insurance; to collect premiums when instructed by the association or its authorized officers; to well and faithfully account to the association for all moneys, securities, &c., which should be received by him as such agent or come into his possession for or on account of the association; to remit to the association all such moneys or securities collected by him at least once in each month, or as often as might be required by the association; \"to obey and carry out any lawful order or instructions given to or received by him from the managing director or other constituted authority of the association respecting the operations of the said association, and conform to the rules of the association not to neglect the business of the association or misconduct himself in the conduct therof; \"before entering on his duties as such agent to give a bond, with sureties satisfactory to the said association, for the faithful performance by him of the foregoing agreements, stipulations and conditions, for the sum of one thousand dollars.\"\nBy the instrument the association agreed to pay to Brown certain remuneration. \"Upon the first year's premiums, as collected, under policies issued through his instrumentality,\" various rates of commission were provided for, according to the system. \"Upon all renewal premiums, as collected, under policies secured through his instrumentality, which are now in force or shall hereafter be secured by him a commission of 5 per cent\" was to be paid. These commissions were to be subject to deductions of those paid to local agents, the rates of which were limited.\nThe agreement further provided that the association might terminate and cancel it at any time for breach of any of the conditions, stipulations and agreements on Brown's part, and, also, that it might be terminated by the association at any time upon one month's notice.\nThe bond sued on bore date the 3rd day of February, 1898. It began with the recital of Brown's appointment as agent under the agreement mentioned, \"which agreement forms the basis of this obligation,\" and that these defendants had \"agreed to become sureties for the faithful carrying out of the said agreement.\" The condition was that Brown should account for and pay over moneys received, and well and truly \"perform, observe and discharge all duties and obligations contained in the said agreement and on his part to be performed,\" and indemnify and save harmless the association from loss and damage by reason of any act, matter or thing done or omitted to be done by him contrary to the agreement.\nThe plaintiff association was represented in Nova Scotia by Frederick W. Green, general manager for the Maritime Provinces, with headquarters in Halifax. Brown's headquarters and place of residence were at Wolfville, but his field occupied several counties and he had four sub-agents in different places. Brown's instructions were to send monthly returns to the Halifax office. These were to be made by the 10th of each month in respect of the business of the preceding month. His financial reports were made upon forms supplied to him from the Halifax office, partly filled up. He remitted by his own cheque, unaccepted, upon a bank in Wolfville. Remittances received in Halifax were frequently held, undeposited, for some days, pending the checking of returns. On a few occasions Brown requested that particular cheques be held over as long as possible. On the 10th July, 1900, Brown's report for the preceding month was received at the Halifax office, showing a balance of $781.93 to be remitted, and with it a cheque for that amount. After a few days this was deposited in a bank and sent to Wolfville for collection when payment was refused, and on the 18th July the cheque was protested for want of funds. Notice of protest reached the Halifax office on the 20th July in Green's absence and came to his knowledge a few days later.\nUnder date of 27th July Green wrote Brown asking for a remittance of the amount of the protested cheque and referring to a prior letter on the same subject, not produced. On the 2nd August Brown replied, with a remittance of $450, explaining that he had failed to properly check his bank account and asking for an advance against the balance for a few days. On the 14th Aug. Green notified the defendant Kirk of the shortage and of Brown's explanation, and on the 21st August he gave formal notice to both sureties that Brown had failed to account for moneys received to the amount of $1,469.18, and that they would be held liable to the amount of the bond. On the 6th September Green dismissed Brown after getting from him a final report showing the shortage to be $1,262.76.\nBrown was called as a witness for the defendants, and gave direct evidence of having on several occasions prior to the. defaults sued for expressly admitted to Green that he was short of funds to make his remittances.\nIn 1899 Brown asked for and obtained from the association a loan of $400 upon the security of property belonging to his wife. According to his account he first asked for this loan in March or April. It was finally made in June. It was in interviews with Green about this loan that Brown claimed he made some of the admissions mentioned, and his statement was that the advance was directly applied by Green to cover the shortage in June, 1899.\nIn the early part of 1900, Green made advances to Brown on account of commissions upon premiums for which the association held notes or acknowledgements, but on which commissions only would be payable when the premiums should have been actually paid. Brown testified to having made similar admissions to Green upon obtaining these.\nThe defendant Kirk testified to admissions by Green to himself of having long known of Brown being in arrear and to having lent him money to keep him in good standing with the company.\nGreen directly contradicted both Brown and Kirk upon these points, and both Green and the Halifax cashier expressly denied any knowledge of Brown being in default until after the protest of the cheque of July, 1900.\nTo account for the requests to hold the cheques, Green stated that Brown sometimes included sums not actually paid to him in money, for some of which he might hold cheques of policy holders or of sub-agents which might turn out worthless. Brown admitted that occasionally he did return as paid small sums which he had not received, and that, in one case, he had done so with reference to a note of the defendant Kirk for over $200.\nBrown's returns of July, August and September, 1900, were put in evidence. Upon each was printed the following:\u2014\n\"Note.\u2014All drafts or cheques for remittances (to be on chartered banks) must be payable at par in Toronto, or at some place where the Canadian Bank of Commerce, the Ontario Bank or the Imperial Bank has a branch.\"\nAt the close of the portion of each account relating to the credits to Brown was printed \"By Draft, Marked Cheque, P. O. Order, to balance.\"\nUpon the June report was a printed form of \"Instructions to the Manager or Agent,\" having at the foot of the printed signature \"J. K. Macdonald, Managing Director.\" These instructions were partly as follows:\u2014\n\"5. Commissions are to be charged only on the premiums actually collected and remitted to the head office. * * * * *\n7. Your remittance for balance due must be made either by chartered bank draft, marked check, post office order, or by express.\n8. The payment of premiums not actually received by you is done at your own personal risk, and the association will not, under any circumstance, be responsible to return the same upon the non-receipt by you.\"\nUnder Brown's engagements with the association before 1898, considerable advances had been made to him for travelling and other expenses. In his former agreement there was some provision for these being secured upon, or repayable by the application of, commissions on renewal premiums.\nGreen stated in evidence, \"at the time agreement of '98 was made we had an understanding with Brown that his old commissions would go in reduction of old account, and his new commissions would be paid him in cash. He received his commissions on new premiums until discharged. Some paid in cash and some through his returns by treating them as equal to cash. * * About spring of 1898 or may be later the old arrangement with Brown was varied by allowing him the commision in cash on old business which he was collecting himself in place of using it to reduce old account. The old understanding was that advances should cease, and that the commission on old business should be applied to reduce the balance in his commission account prior to 1898. Don't allow him any commission at all since discharged. Commissions on business secured since 1898 by him would be about $40 to $60 a year, depending on the continuance of the business.\"\nThe learned judge before whom the cause was tried instructed the jury that \"it was the duty of the plaintiff company to disclose as promptly as possible to the sureties any notice or knowledge they received or had of any breach of duty, misconduct or dishonest act on the part of Brown\"; that the knowledge of Green or notice to him in these respects would be the knowledge of or notice to the association; and that the burden was upon the defendants to prove, to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury, that the association had such notice or knowledge some considerable time before its communication to the defendants.\nThe learned judge pointed out the conflict between Green's evidence and Brown's upon this question of notice, and left it to them to determine as to the weight to be given to Brown's. He told the jury that it was for them to give such effect to Green's story,\u2014 regarded in the light of the protested cheque, and the notice thereof to Green, and the effect these ought reasonably to have had upon his mind in the matter of notice\u2014as they thought it was under the circumstances reasonably entitled to.\nHe also adverted to three contentions made, as he stated, by the defendants' counsel:\n\"1 That the mortgage loan of itself conveyed notice to the defendants that Brown was in default to them;\n2. That his reports in themselves necessarily conveyed notice of his default to them; and\n3. That his request to hold over his cheques, and Green's compliance therewith, was in itself a confession of default, especially when regarded in the light of the report which preceded or accompanied such cheque.\"\nHe left to the jury four questions, which, he stated, had been prepared and agreed upon by counsel.\nThese questions and the answers of the jury were as follows:\n\"1. Had the plaintiff company during the negotiations for the loan on mortgage, or at the time the mortgage was given, knowledge that Brown had received moneys on account of the company which he used for his own purposes? No.\n2. Had the plaintiff company-knowledge that Brown had received moneys on account of the plaintiff and which he had not paid over as required by his agreement, when Brown's cheques were held over and not deposited in the regular course of business by the plaintiff? No.\n3. On July 20th, 1900, had the plaintiff company knowledge that Brown had received moneys on plaintiff's account and which he had failed to pay over as required in the regular course of his employment? No.\n4. Did Green at Dorchester admit to Kirk that he had had knowledge of defaults by Brown at several times prior to July 1st, 1900, and that he, Green, had been helping him from time to time to keep him in good odour with the company? No.\"\nThe majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia were of opinion that the answers to the second and third questions were against the weight of evidence.\nMr. Justice Townshend based his opinion upon the disobedience, on Brown's part, of the printed instructions as to the methods of remitting moneys, considering that compliance with such instructions was so material a part of the agreement forming the basis of the sureties' obligation that the association should have dismissed Brown therefor.\nThe court therefore ordered a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. The plaintiffs appealed.\nW. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellants. Permitting the agent to depart from the terms of the instructions given him will not discharge the sureties; Mayor of Durham v. Fowler[2]; but there must be conduct amounting to fraud. Dawson v. Lawes[3]; Caxton v. Dew[4]; Hamilton v. Watson[5]; Town of Meaford v. Lang[6]; Exchange Bank v. Springer[7]; Niagara Dist. Fruit Growers Stock Co. v. Walker[8]. The findings of the jury should not have been disturbed. Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright[9]; Fraser v. Drew[10]; Commissioner for Railways v. Brown[11].\nAn order for a new trial may be reversed on appeal. Solomon v. Bitton[12]; Webster v. Friedeberg[13].\nNewcombe K.C. for the respondents. The court below ordered a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, which exercise of discretion will not be interfered with on appeal. Eureka Woolen Mills Co. v. Moss[14].\nThe retention of Brown in the company's employ after he had made default in remitting monies as instructed discharged the sureties. Phillips v. Foxall[15]; Sanderson v. Aston[16]; Holme v. Brunskill[17]; Pidcock v. Bishop[18].\nRitchie K.C. in reply. As to interference with discretion of the court below see London Street Railway Co. v. Brown[19]; Pidcock v. Bishop (10) was distinguished in Mackreth v. Walmesley[20].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Upon the authority of Black v. The Ottoman Bank[21], in the Privy Council, and of The Niagara District Fruit Growers Co. v. Walker[22], in this court, I would allow this appeal.\nThe attempt by the respondents to raise here questions of fact which they did not raise at the trial must fail; Lyall v. Jardine[23]. I agree with Mr. Justice Killam on all the points. SEDGEWICK J. dissented from the judgment of the court for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting.)\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia granting a new trial. The action is upon a fidelity bond signed by the respondents in favour of the appellant for $1000. Four questions were submitted to the jury by consent and answered in favour of the company. Thereupon the trial judge (Meagher J.) directed judgment to be entered upon said findings and referred the determination of the amount of the defalcations to a special referee who fixed it at $909, for which amount judgment was entered with interest and costs. The respondents appealed to the full court which set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial. The learned judges did not agree as to the reason's of judgment. Townshend J. held that the agreement of engagement of Brown had been violated by the company in many essential particulars and that the sureties were thereby discharged. Weatherbee and Graham JJ. considered the verdict as being contrary to the weight of the evidence. All came to the conclusion to order a new trial.\nI do not see that the course taken by the court in banco can cause any real injustice to the appellant, if the action is well founded; it is not dismissed, it is merely submitted to a new test. A new trial may however relieve the respondents from liability, especially if the questions to the jury are framed so as to exhibit before the trial judge and the jury the true position of the parties, as disclosed by the evidence of Green, the general manager of the company in the Maritime Provinces, and other witnesses. It is partly set forth in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the statement of defence; but it may be necessary for the defendants to amend the pleadings so as to agree with the facts proved. They should fully lay before the jury the breaches of contract on the part of the company pointed out by Mr. Justice Townshend, and also the past defalcations of Brown (not merely his indebtedness to the company) as local agent of the company, and the secret agreement made by Green with him with regard to the same, which were concealed from the sureties when they signed or delivered the bond, and according to the best authorities were sufficient to void their obligation.\nIn Railton v. Mathews[24] decided by the House of Lords, one George Hickes was re-appointed the agent in Glasgow of a Bristol firm, Mathews & Leonard, drysaltery, he finding security for his fidelity. He offered his brother and one Railton; they were accepted by the Bristol merchants, who caused a proper bond to be prepared and transmitted to the agent in Glasgow where it was signed by him and his two sureties without having any communication with either of them, and without making any arrangement with Hickes as to the payment of the balance standing against him as agent during the two previous years. Hickes being denounced as a defaulter to the sureties, they made inquiry and discovered that in the course of his previous employment the Bristol firm knew that he had appropriated the funds of the firm, and that at the time the bond was demanded he was a defaulter. Lord Cottenham said:\nI find several facts appealing as having passed between the party who was the subject of the suretyship and those by whom he had been previously employed; and I find the matter stated in these terms: That the parties totally failed to communicate the said circumstances, or either of them, or the existence of any balance on the agency accounts then standing against the said George Hickes, to the pursuer or to the said Henry William Hickes; and, on the contrary, while they accepted and took possession of the said bond, they fraudulently suppressed and concealed the said whole facts and circumstances regarding the conduct and irregularities of the said George Hickes, &c.\nIt. has not been contended, and it is impossible to contend, after what Lord Eldon lays down in the case of Smith v. The Bank of Scotland[25] that a case may not exist in which a mere non-communication would invalidate a bond of suretyship. Lord Eldon states various oases in which a party about to become surety would have a right to have communicated to him circumstances within the knowledge of the party requiring the bond; and he states that it is the duty of the party acquiring the bond to communicate those circumstances, and that the non-communication, or, as he uses the expression, the concealment of those facts would invalidate the obligation and release the surety from the obligation into which he had entered.\nLord Campbell, page 942:\nThe question really is: What is the issue which the court directed in this case? Whether the pursuer, Edward Railton, was induced to subscribe the said bond of caution or surety by undue concealment or deception on the part of the defenders, or either of them? The material words are, \"undue concealment on the part of the defenders.\" What is the meaning of those words? I apprehend the meaning of those words is, whether Railton was induced to subscribe the bond by the defenders having omitted to divulge facts within their knowledge which they were bound in point of law to divulge. If there were facts within their knowledge which they were bound in point of law to divulge, and which they did not divulge, the surety is not bound by the bond; there are plenty of decisions to that effect, both in the law of Scotland and the law of England. If the defenders had facts within their knowledge which it was material the surety should be acquainted with, and which the defenders did not disclose, tin my opinion the concealment of those facts, the undue concealment of those facts, discharges the surety; and whether they concealed those facts from one motive or another, I apprehend is wholly immaterial.\nAnd as the trial judge had misdirected the jury to the effect that a concealment to be undue must be wilful and intentional, a new trial was ordered.\nI take it for granted that this decision is binding upon us notwithstanding what has been said or held the contrary by other courts. It has been contended that Railton v. Mathews[26] cannot be reconciled with another decision rendered a year or two after by the same tribunal in Hamilton v. Watson[27]. But Hamilton v. Watson (2) was a very different case, for it applied only to. a suretyship to a banker for a cash advance.\nThere is a great difference between the credit of a man and his character, his solvency and his honesty. The suretyship does not stand upon the same basis in both cases. The credit surety had a right to expect that the cash advance would be made, and in fact it was made, in that case, by the banker according to the usages of banking business. The principal debtor or borrower or his sureties have nothing else to expect from the banker.\nIn the case of a fidelity bond, the surety has a just and legal expectation that the creditor will not trust his money or his property to a man known to him to be dishonest and that the commissions earned by the agent during the existence of the bond would help him at least to discharge his liabilites incurred in the course of his agency. I think therefore there is a vast difference between the two cases. If this distinction did not exist, Lord Campbell who pronounced the judgment in both cases would have placed himself in a contradictory position, within a very short time, without any expression on his part of intending to do so. This cannot reasonably be. presumed. The difference between a fidelity contract and a credit guarantee is pointed out in Lee v. Jones,[28]\nShee J. said:\nThere is a wide difference as respects what might naturally be expected to be the actual state of the account of one man with another, between the case of a suretyship for a man requiring and applying for a cash-credit to bankers with whom he had had previous dealings, and whose business is to lend capital to penniless persons on the security of sureties, and the case of a suretyship for a surety for others.\nHamilton v. Watson[29] is not therefore inconsistent with Railton v. Mathews[30]. It is moreover a strong authority for the contention of the respondents that an agreement, such as is admitted by Green, is fatal to their suretyship. The argument on the part of the surety was that the circumstances of the case showed the \"probable existence\" of a secret agreement that the fresh credit was to be applied to the payment of an old debt. Lord Campbell said:\nNow, in this case, assuming that there had been the contract contended for, and that had been concealed, that would have vitiated the suretyship. There is no proof nor is there any allegation that there was any such contract. There is, therefore, neither allegation nor proof, and what then does the case rest upon? It rests merely upon this, that at most there was a concealment by the bankers of the former debt, and of their expectation, that if this new surety was given, it was probable that the debt would be paid off. It rests merely upon non-disclosure or concealment of a probable expectation. And if you were to say that such a concealment would vitiate the suretyship given on that account, your lordships would utterly destroy that most beneficial mode of dealing with accounts in Scotland.\nAnd the Lord Chancellor concluded:\nIf there was a stipulation that it was to be so applied, and these were the conditions upon which the money was advanced, it might have effected the transaction. Bat, in order to raise that question there should have been an averment upon the record that such an agreement had been entered into.\nThe principles laid down in the above cases have been applied in many cases, more particularly in Stone v. Compton[31]; Lee v. Jones[32]; Phillips v. Foxall[33]; Sanderson v. Aston[34]. See also Davies v. London St Provincial Marine Insurance Co.[35] In this case the plaintiff is charged with fraudulent concealment of past dishonesty on the part of the agent; the secret agreement is not alleged; probably it was unknown to the defendants till it was admitted by Green at the trial but it was proved beyond any question.\nBlack v. The Ottoman Bank[36] does not conflict with the above decisions; it was a very different case; it was not one of continued employment and of anterior defalcations; there was no secret agreement injurious to the interests of the surety; in fact it refers to a state of affairs happening after the bond had been entered into. Niagara Fruit Growers Stock Co. v. Walker[37], is clearly distinguishable, for in that case there was no secret agreement as to the payment of old accounts; none was necessary, as the agent, Walker, had in each previous year settled with his own means and in a manner satisfactory to the principals, the balance due from him in respect of his agency for every preceding season. In the present case no such settlement had been effected; only advances had been made by Green acting for the Company to cover up the deficiencies, and at the time of his re-engagement, on the 1st January 1898, he stood in default for a large sum of money, about $2,000, and likewise when the bond of the respondents was subsequently obtained in February following. He should not have been re-engaged by Green, but if re-engaged at all, it should have been at the risk of the company, as was done previously, and not of the sureties unless informed of the fact. The exacting of a fidelity bond after the agent had acted for years without any, satisfies me that it was a scheme on the part of Green to throw the loss upon some outsiders. The sureties cannot lawfully be used to make good past deficiencies, unless willing to do so. Can it be supposed that they would have signed the bond if they had been acquainted with his previous dealings with the Company? Green says in his evidence:\nAt the time agreement of '98 was made we had an understanding with Brown that his old commissions would go in reduction of old account, and his new commissions would be paid him in cash. * * The old understanding was that advances should cease, and that the commission on old business should be applied to reduce the balance in his commission account prior to 1898.\nThis is a plain admission by the appellant of past defalcations and of a secret arrangement to satisfy the same out of current earnings of Brown, a material fact which was undisclosed to the sureties and amounted to a fraud in law and in fact.\nThis evidence would perhaps be sufficient to dismiss the action but it was not passed upon by the jury. The defendants did not move for the dismissal of the action. They only applied for a new trial which was granted to them by the full court, which is the best judge of its own procedure. The evidence of Green may possibly be explained or supplemented; and to avoid any surprise, it is reasonable to submit it to the appreciation of the trial judge and jury with the other circumstances of the case. The point of the secret agreement was taken in the Court below, as appears from the report of the case[38]. If standing alone it would probably not be sufficient to allow a new trial, as it was not pleaded, but this new trial has been ordered for other reasons which I approve in a certain measure and I think it is in the interest of justice that the whole case should be re-opened. I quite agree with the majority of the judges that the verdict is contrary to the weight of evidence. I am not prepared to say that the reasons of judgment advanced by Mr. Justice Townshend are unfounded. The proper time to decide the nice points of law the learned judge elaborately discusses will be when the case will come back for adjudication after all the facts have been passed upon by the jury.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal for the reasons stated by Killam J.\nKILLAM J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed, and the judgment for the plaintiff restored.\nThe questions submitted to the jury were directed solely to the acquisition by the plaintiff association of knowledge of Brown's defaults. The answers to the first and fourth depended upon the relative credibility of Browne and Kirk's evidence respectively, on the one side, and Green's, on the other. The jury might well have discredited Brown, and they probably considered that Kirk misunderstood Green. No serious objection is made to the propriety of the answers to these two questions.\nIt being fairly open to the jury to disbelieve Brown's evidence of his express admissions to Green, the objections to the answers to the remaining questions must be confined, as they were by the majority of the court below, to the inferences which should be drawn from the clearly ascertained facts. Those inferences again were for the jury to draw, and their findings upon them should not be disturbed unless they were such as, reasonably viewing the whole of the evidence, the jury could not properly reach. Commissioner of Railways v. Brown[39]; Council of the Municipality of Brisbane v. Martin[40]; Australian Newspaper Co. v. Bennett[41]. Green testified to circumstances which show that the including in Brown's monthly statements of moneys as being received did not conclusively establish their actual receipt by him. Green's evidence received some corroboration from Brown's own. In a letter of 8th July, 1899, Brown wrote Green:\nHave remitted some which have not received money for as yet; so do not send cheque till you have to.\nThe printed instructions from the head office recognized it as not improbable that agents would make such remittances. A man in Green's position would have a knowledge of the practice in these respects which might well make him hesitate to conclusively adopt the view that a request for delay in forwarding a cheque was necessarily attributable to misappropriation of funds. The questions put to the jury were as to the plaintiff's knowledge of Brown's receipt of moneys not paid over. They were not as to knowledge merely of facts calculated to lead to inquiry, not as to negligence in failing to ascertain what the apparent facts were calculated to suggest. It appears to me that the answer to the second question was not merely such as could reasonably be given, but probably also the correct one.\nThe third question was, apparently, directed to the knowledge to be imputed through receipt of the notice of protest of the cheque. Green states that he was out of town then. It does not appear when the notice was first seen by any person conversant with the circumstances. So far as dishonour of the cheque is concerned, the association was bound by the bare receipt of notice; but its receipt in the office did not of itself constitute knowledge that Brown had received moneys on the plaintiff's account which he had failed to pay over as required in the regular course of his employment. For this purpose an inference from circumstances was required.\nThe notice of dishonour is not put in evidence. If in the form given by \"The Bills of Exchange Act, 1890,\" it merely stated that the cheque had been presented and protested for non-payment. Its contents and the fact of dishonour might well be consistent with a case of a slight insufficiency of funds, which might be due to Brown's not having received some of the moneys covered by the cheque or to some unintentional error which could be satisfactorily rectified and explained. Still the presumption would be that a large part of the moneys had been actually received by Brown, and to any one in Green's position there would be conveyed the information that Brown had received some moneys on the plaintiff's account which he had in fact failed to pay over within the time required by the regular course of business. But if, in strictness, this is the knowledge contemplated by the question, still it cannot be said that the jury erred in finding that the company had not that knowledge on the 20th July. The onus was upon the defendants to show knowledge in some person empowered for that purpose to represent the company. In my opinion, the jury were fully justified in finding that this onus had not been discharged as regards the particular date to which they were confined by the question.\nThe case was very much stronger for finding that Green had positive knowledge that Brown was a defaulter when he received the latter's letter of 31st July, or when he wrote on the 27th July notifying him that further collections would not be sent to him, or even on the preceding Wednesday\u2014the 25th\u2014when they had the conversation to which that letter refers. But the latter is the earliest date at which, in my opinion, there can properly be imputed to the company such knowledge as cast upon it any duty to terminate the risk or obtain the sureties' consent to its continuance.\nBut whatever the exact date in July at which the knowledge was acquired, it would affect the quantum of liability only. Unless otherwise discharged, the sureties were responsible for the prior shortage. It has been argued before us that they were entirely relieved from liability on three grounds:\u2014(1) Concealment by the plaintiff, when the bond was given, of an agreement or arrangement for the application of a portion of the commissions upon the previous advances to Brown; (2) Disobedience by Brown of instructions as to the times and methods of remitting moneys, and his retention in the plaintiff's employ thereafter without the knowledge or consent of the sureties; (3) Variation of the terms of the contract of service by advances on account of commissions before they were strictly due, without the knowledge or consent of the sureties.\nNo questions relating to any of these points were left to the jury; none of the facts affecting them have been found by the jury; none of them were set up in the pleadings.\nThe statements of defence did allege prior indebtedness of Brown to the association and fraudulent concealment of this, but nothing as to any agreement for the application of commissions. They alleged a duty to remit at least once in each month and continuous defaults; but nothing as to instructions or their disobedience, nothing as to the methods or precise dates prescribed. They alleged a material change in Brown's remuneration, but nothing about the times of payment.\nThe decisions in Hamilton v. Watson[42] and The Niagara District etc., Co. v. Walker[43], shew that the mere existence of prior indebtedness is not a fact which must necessarily be communicated, though under some circumstances its concealment might be fraudulent as against the surety. In Hamilton v. Watson[44] it appeared that advances made upon the security in question had been used to discharge a former liability to the lender. Lord Lyndhurst L. C. there said:\nThe mere circumstance of the parties supposing that the money was to be applied to a particular purpose, and the fact that it was intended to be so applied, do not appear to me to vitiate the transaction at all. If there was a stipulation that it was to be so applied, and these were the conditions upon which the money was advanced, it might have affected the transaction. But in order to raise that question, there should have been an averment upon the record that such an agreement had been entered into.\nIn the present case, it came out incidentally, during Green's cross-examination, that there was some \"arrangement\" or \"understanding\" with Brown for the application of commissions on renewal premiums under former insurance policies upon the previous advances. If an agreement to that effect had been alleged, this language might have afforded such evidence of it as to warrant the inference of an agreement; but under the circumstances, it does not seem to me proper to take hold of these expressions, where no inquiry was made or called for respecting the real terms and nature of the \"arrangement\" or \"understanding\", and act upon them as shewing a definite agreement. There may have been a suggestion to that effect by Green, an expression of intention, hope or expectation by Brown. If indebtedness need not be disclosed, the debtor's expressions of his hopes and intentions respecting its liquidation must stand in the same category. The fact of the subsequent application amounts to no more than appeared in Hamilton v. Watson (1). No specific dates or methods of accounting and remitting Were provided for by the contract of employment or the bond of indemnity. By the former Brown was to remit at least once in each month, or as often as might be required by the association, and he was to obey and carry out lawful orders and instructions. The bond was conditional upon Brown's performance of all his obligations under the agreement. No specific instructions were referred to or embodied in either. Whether any, or, if so, what instructions on these points were in force when the agreement or bond was entered into, we are not informed. The instructions to which reference is specially made are those which were printed upon the back of Brown's report for June, 1900. Mr. Justice Meagher says that these were presumably in use when the agreement and bond were given. Mr. Justice Townshend proceeds upon this inference and treats the instructions as practically embodied in the agreement. With all respect, I conceive the inference to be wholly unwarranted. No case of the kind being set up in the pleadings, it would be unsafe to make any inference whatever from the appearance of this printed matter on the back of this report. They may not have been issued as instructions. There may have been others which varied them. The forms may have been old ones in use at some time, whether under Brown's former employment or under that in question, but long before disregarded by mutual consent even if not by express direction. There being no issue upon the question we cannot assume any state of facts. As the association was not bound to give any particular directions in these matters, it was free to cancel or alter any that were given.\nAs laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Black v. The Ottoman Bank[45]. The surety guarantees the honesty of the person employed, and is not entitled to be relieved from his obligation because the employer fails to U9e all the means in his power to guard against the consequences of dishonesty.\nThere was no change of remuneration, but payments were made in advance of the times when they were strictly due. The association held notes and other securities which might not be realized. Brown had performed the services necessary to entitle him to commission upon them if they should be paid. There was no express stipulation against paying the commissions in advance. The association had guarded itself against being obliged to pay commissions on premiums which might never be received. It chose subsequently to take the risk that a portion at least would eventually be paid, and gave Brown commissions which they could safely assume that he had earned.\nNo authority is cited for the proposition that such a course produces a change of position which discharges the surety. In my opinion it does not.\nOn all of these points, if raised by the pleadings, there would naturally have been issues for the consideration of the jury. There is no evidence of any concealment from the sureties of anything whatever. For all that appears they may have been fully informed of the prior debt, of the alleged arrangement for its discharge, of the variations in the methods of remitting and of the advances on account of non-matured commissions. These matters were not in issue and we can make no assumption of concealment from the want of evidence upon them. Concealment of the prior indebtness hot being of itself fraudulent, the plaintiff was not called upon to give proof of knowledge or of circumstances relating thereto. Neither in their pleadings, nor by evidence, nor otherwise, have the defendants asserted any concealment or want of knowledge or consent on the points now sought to be raised. At the trial no question was raised as to the execution of the bond or the existence of defaults within its terms. Prim\u00e2 facie the liability of the defendants was established. The onus was thrown upon the defence. The questions to be submitted to the jury were settled by counsel. They were directed to points on which the defendants relied to negative liability. If other facts were relied on for the purpose, they should have been put forward then.\nWhen the case came up on motion for judgment, the only course open was to give judgment for the plaintiff There being still a question of amount raised, this was left to a referee. The defendant's counsel had picked on certain particular times as those on which knowledge of defaults was acquired and, having succeeded as to none, no limitation as to time was made in the reference. It is to be noticed, however, that the amounts charged as received after the 25th July constituted a comparatively small portion of the alleged shortage, and as against these should be placed all the credits given Brown for August. The amount for which judgment went against the defendants falls short of the claim by more than the difference.\nIt appears to me that, under such circumstances, the judgment could not properly be disturbed. The answers of the jury were, in my opinion, amply warranted by the evidence. The judgment directed by the trial judge was the only one he could direct under the circumstances. There was no error on the part of judge or jury. Every defence sought to be raised was tried and disposed of. To allow a new trial for the purpose of inquiring whether there are other defences would be against all precedent.\nIn Browne v. Dunn[46], Lord Halsbury said: My Lords, I cannot but think that this case, although the amount involved is small, raises very important questions indeed. Amongst other questions I think it raises a question as to the conduct of the trial itself and the position in which the people are placed when, apart altogether from the actual issues raised by the written pleadings, the conduct of the parties has been such as to leave one or more questions to the jury, and those questions being determined they come afterwards and strive to raise totally different questions because upon the evidence it might have been open to the parties to raise those other questions. My Lords, it is one of the most familiar principles in the conduct of causes at nisi prius, that if you take one thing as the question to be determined by the jury and apply yourself to that one thing, no court would afterwards permit you to raise any other question. It would be intolerable and it would lead to incessant litigation if the rule were otherwise. I think Dr. Blake Odgers has with great candour produced the authority of Martin v. Great Northern Railway (1) which lays down what appears to me a very wholesome and sensible rule, namely, that you cannot take advantage afterwards of what was open to you on the pleadings, and what was open to you on the evidence if you have deliberately elected to fight another question and have fought it, and have been beaten upon it.\nSee, also, Martin v. Great Northern Railway Co.[47]; Clough v. London & Northwestern Rway. Co.[48]; The Tasmania[49]; Connecticut Fire Ins. Co. v. Kavanagh[50]; Nevill v. Fine Art & Gen. Ins. Co.[51]; Karunaratne v. Ferdinandus[52]; Star Kidney Pad Co. v. Greenwood[53].\nThese cases shew that the same principle prevails under the present practice as at common law. It was acted on by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Davis v. The Commercial Bank of Windsor[54].\nUnder the Act 54 & 55 Vict. c. 25, s. 2, an appeal now lies to this court \"from the judgment upon any motion for a new trial.\" The decision of the Eureka Woollen Mills Co. v. Moss[55], was before that enactment. The majority of the court below proceeded upon the view that the findings of the jury were against the weight of evidence. In Commissioner of Railways v. Brown[56]; Council of Brisbane v. Martin[57], and Australian Newspaper Co. v. Bennett[58], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reversed the orders of Australian courts granting new trials on this very ground. In the case of The Metropolitan R. Co v. Wright[59], the House of Lords affirmed the order of the Court of Appeal reversing a similar order of a Divisional Court. These cases show that a grant of a new trial on this ground is not an exercise of discretion with which an appellate court will refuse to interfere. In my opinion there was no ground whatever for interfering with the original judgment and it should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants; H. C.

S. Rep. 158) that illness of the employee by which he is permanently incapacitated from performing his service would itself terminate the contract.\nHeld, also, Killam J. dissenting, that an illness terminating in the employee's death and during the whole period of which he is incapacitated for service is a permanent illness though both the employee and his physician believed that it was only temporary.\nBy a rule of the employer an employee was only to be paid for time he was actually on duty. One of the employees had accepted and signed a receipt for a month's wages from which the pay for two days on which he was absent from duty was deducted and his conversations with other employees shewed that he was aware of the rule, but no formal notice of the same was ever given him. Having died after a long illness his executrix brought an action for his wages during such period and the jury found on the trial that he did not continue in the employ after notice of the rule and acquiescence in his employment under the terms thereof.\nHeld, that such finding was against evidence and must be set aside. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThis action was brought by the plaintiff, a widow, as executrix of the last will and testament of her husband, the late John H. Marks, deceased. The defendant is a body corporate and maintains and operates a line of ferry steamers across the Harbor of Halifax, between the Town of Darmouth and the City of Halifax. The said John H. Marks in his lifetime was in the employ of the defendant as captain of one of the defendant's ferry steamers. The agreement under which he was employed was in writing and is as follows:\u2014\n\"No. 7 Memorandum of Agreement between the Darmouth Ferry Commission of the one part and John H. Marks of Darmouth in the Countyof Halifax of the other part.\n\"The said John H. Marks agrees to serve the Dartmouth Ferry Commission in the capacity of captain at the monthly wages of sixty dollars per month. Such service to commence on the first day of March, A. D. 1899, the wages for each calendar month to be paid on the 10th day of the following month, and such service to be terminated by one calendar month's notice on either, side, to be given at any time. Should either party wish to terminate the service without such notice the Commission to be entitled to do so by paying one month's pay, and the said John H. Marks by forfeiting to the Commission one months pay. Any period of service prior to the commencement of a calender month to be paid pro rai\u00e2 on the 10th day of such calendar month. Nothing in these presents to effect the right of either party to terminate the relation hereby created for lawful causes. \"In witness whereof, the party of the first part has hereunto subscribed his name, and the parties of the second part have hereto affixed their corporate seal.\nWitness JOHN H. MARKS.\nH. Watt. A. C. JOHNSON,\nChairman.\nWALTER CREIGHTON,\n[Seal] Act. Secretary.\nUnder this agreement Marks began serving the defendant as captain on the first day of March 1899. A resolution was passed at the meeting of the commission held on 8th January, 1900, as follows, namely \"Resolved. That after this date no employee will be paid for any time he or she be absent from duty.\" There is no evidence of any formal notice to Marks of the contents of this resolution but he submitted to a deduction of wages under it and admitted knowledge of it to other employees. Marks became ill on the 15th December, 1900, and from that time until the date of his death was not able to perform his duties as captain of the defendants' steamer. He was confined to the house for three or four months. In May, June and July, he was able to be out of doors and apparently was recovering. Dr. Cunningham, who attended him, thought that he might be able to get back to work in the summer and told him so. Dr. Stewart, a consulting physician who was called in consultation with Dr. Cunningham, also considered the illness a temporary one. However, early in July, 1901, Marks became much worse and called Dr. Smith in attendance upon him who diagnosed the case as cancer of the stomach in an advanced stage. He died on 16th July, 1901.\nThe plaintiff, as executrix, brought this action to recover $416.00 wages from 15th December, 1900, until 16th July, 1901, at $60 per month under the said agreement.\nThe action came on for trial before the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia with a jury, at Halifax, during the April term of the Supreme Court, 1902. Questions were submitted to the jury whose answers were as follows:\n\"1. Was the resolution of January 8th, 1900, communicated to John H. Marks shortly after its adoption by the defendant Commission? A. No.\"\n\"2. Did the said John H. Marks continue in the employ of the defendant Commission after notice of this resolution and acquiese in said employment under the terms of said resolution? A. No.\"\n\"3. Did the said John H. Marks remain in the active discharge of his duties in the employment of the defendant Commission until his death? A. In the employ but not active.\"\n\"4. Was the illness of said John H Marks and of which he died of temporary or permanent character? A. Temporary.\"\n\"5. Was John H. Marks after the 16th day of December, 1900, prevented by a permanent illness from performing any service under his contract with the defendant? A. No.\"\nOn these findings the learned Judge directed judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for $416.00, the amount of her claim.\nFrom that judgment the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco and moved to set aside the findings of the jury and for judgment in favour of the defendant.\nThe said appeal and motion came on for argument before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, the following Judges being present, viz., Weatherbe J., Townshend J., Graham E. J., and Meagher J. The court were evenly divided in opinion, Mr. Justice Weatherbe and Mr. Justice Graham being of opinion that the appeal and application for new trial should be dismissed and that the plaintiff should have judgment, while Mr. Justice Townshend and Mr. Justice Meagher were of the opinion that judgment should be entered for the defendant. In accordance with the practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia an order was granted dismissing the said appeal and application without costs. From this judgment the present appeal has been asserted by the defendants.\nRussell K C. and McInnis for the appellants. In a contract for service it is an implied condition that the servant will continue to be in a state of health which will enable him to perform his services. Johnson v. Walker[2]; Robinson v. Davison[3]; Boast v. Firth[4].\nRespondent's deceased husband was aware that he would not be paid for the time he was absent and acquiesced in that condition of his service.\nJudgment can be entered for appellant notwithstanding the findings of the jury. Nixon v. Queen Ins. Co.[5]; McDowell v. Great Western Railway Co.[6].\nW. B. A. Ritchie K. C., for the respondent. There was a yearly hiring of respondent which could not be divided. Cuckson v. Stones[7]; followed in K\u2014\u2014 v. Raschen[8]\nThere was no acquiescence in the resolution. De Busche v. Alt[9]; and no estoppel; Proctor v. Bennis[10].\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE and SEDGEWICK and NESBITT JJ. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies. DAVIES J.\u2014The late Captain John Marks, on or about the 1st of March, A.D. 1899, entered into a written agreement with the Dartmouth Ferry Commission, as follows:\nNo. 7. Memorandum of agreement between the Dartmouth Ferry Commission of the one part and John H. Marks of Dartmouth, in the county of Halifax, of the other part.\nThe said John H. Marks agrees to serve the Dartmouth Ferry Commission in the capacity of captain at the monthly wages of sixty dollars per month. Such service to commence on the first day of March, A.D. 1899, the wages for each calendar month to be paid on the tenth day of the following month, and such service to be terminated by one calendar month's notice on either side, to be given at any time. Should either party wish to terminate the service without such notice, the commission to be entitled to do so by paying one month's pay, and the said John H. Marks by forfeiting to the commission one month's pay. Any period or service prior to the commencement of a calendar month to be paid pro rat\u00e2 on the tenth day of such calendar month. Nothing in these presents to affect the right of either party to terminate the relation hereby created for lawful cause.\nCaptain Marks continued in the service of the Commission until the 15th of December, 1900, when he became ill and unable to work. He never was able to resume his work after that date, and on the 16th July, 1901, he died. The commission paid him his wages up to the 15th of December, 1900, that being the last day he worked for them, and he signed the December wage or pay list acknowledging receipt of the amount paid to him. There is no evidence whatever as to what took place at the time Captain Marks received this payment and signed the pay list. Some time previously, on 8th January, 1900, the commission had passed a resolution\nthat, after this date, no employee will be paid for any time he or she be absent from duty,\nbut there was no evidence that this resolution had been communicated to Marks. There was abundant evidence, however, that he knew of the resolution having been passed, and complained or grumbled to some of his fellow employees about it. Evidence was also given that in the month of April, 1900, four months after the resolution was passed, Marks was docked in the pay sheet for the month for one day he had been absent, and that he signed the pay sheet receiving $58 for his month's pay; also that he signed the December pay sheet in which he was docked for all the working days of the month after the fifteenth when he was taken ill and gave up work.\nAfter Captain Marks's death, his executrix brought this action for seven months' wages up to the day of his death, contending, first, that the commission could not by resolution change or import a new term into the written contract with deceased, and that the evidence did not show any such acquiescence or consent on his part to the resolution as bound him, nor any conduct on his part inconsistent with his rights under the agreement. She contended, further, that illness on the part of Captain Marks incapacitating him during all the seven months sued for from discharging any of his duties under his agreement with the commission and terminating with his death, while it might have justified the commission in putting an end to the agreement by notice as therein provided, did not, in the absence of any such determination of the contract, prevent him or his executrix, after his death, from recovering his wages.\nThe case was tried before the Chief Justice, with a jury, and the questions put to the latter and the answers given by them are as follows:\n1. Was the resolution of January 8th, 1900, communicated to John H. Marks shortly after its adoption by the defendant Commission?\u2014No.\n2. Did the said John H. Marks continue in the employ of the defendant Commission after notice of this resolution and acquiesce in said employment under the terms of said resolution?\u2014No. 3. Did the said John H. Marks remain in the active discharge of his duty in the employment of the defendant Commission until his death?\u2014In the employ, but not active.\n4. Was the illness of the said John H. Marks, and of which he died, of temporary or permanent character?\u2014Temporary.\n(Added at the instance of Mr. Ritchie.)\n5. Was John H. Marks, after the 16th day of December, 1900, prevented by a permanent illness from performing any services under his contract with the defendant?\u2014No.\nUnder these findings, the Chief Justice directed judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the full amount of the claim and, on the case coming before the full court of Nova Scotia on a motion to set aside these findings, the court being equally divided, the motion was dismissed.\nFrom this judgment the Dartmouth Ferry Commission appealed to this court.\nIn the view I take of the law, it is not necessary for me to say anything on that branch of the appeal which relates to the \"no work no pay\" resolution, so-called.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Townshend on the substantial question of the liability of the defendants to pay Captain Marks wages for the seven months during which he never worked or was able to work. From the day when he first gave up his work, 15th December, until the day of his death, Captain Marks was a sick man, utterly unable to discharge his duties and made no pretence of being able to do so. He was from that date, beyond any doubt, permanently disabled by sickness from attending to his work. Some argument was attempted to be advanced that when he was first taken ill, he himself hoped and his medical adviser also hoped and believed his illness was only temporary. But in the face of the facts which subsequently developed that he was suffering from an incurable malady, which soon afterwards caused his death, it does not appear to me possible seriously to argue that the deceased's illness was only temporary. The findings of the jury on this point are clearly contrary to the evidence and the facts and must be set aside. It is quite true that the deceased and his medical adviser both hoped and believed, at first, that his illness was only temporary, but their belief or hope cannot alter the truth subsequently disclosed. That truth is now admitted and is beyond controversy that on and after the 15th of December, when Captain Marks ceased working, he was permanently disabled from doing his work he had contracted to do. In law, this disablement is termed the act of God. It not only, in my opinion, justified the Commission in formally determining the contract, if they had chosen to take that course, but by rendering it impossible that he could ever afterwards discharge his duties under his contract, the permanent disablement determined and ended the contract. The consideration which moved the Commission to promise wages was gone. The mutuality necessary for longer continance of the contract ceased Captain Marks could not be sued by the Commission for non-performance by him of his promise to serve them in the capacity of captain of one of their steamers. He could plead to any such action, disablement or incapacity by the act of God. The same result would have followed if he had become insane or had lost the physical use of his limbs. The fact of the disablement arising from occult internal troubles cannot make any difference. There is no analogy between such permanent disablement and temporary sickness. The law permits the latter on the ground of common humanity to be offered as an excuse for not discharging duty temporarily and suffers the disabled party to recover wages for the time he is temporarily away from his work. But while releasing the permanently disabled workman from damages for the non-performance of his contract, it does not permit him to recover wages without doing, work. No case can be found so deciding. We are asked to create a precedent. This permanent disability goes to the very root of the consideration for the promise on the part of the Commission to pay wages. The covenant on the part of the employee to serve as master was not one independent of the employer's covenant to pay wages. They were interdependent and the promise to pay was dependent upon the performance of the work covenanted to be done. The belief of the employee or his medical adviser that the former's disability was only temporary cannot affect the question in the light of the subsequent knowledge which revealed its permanency. The excuse for not working for a short time, which a temporary illness would justify, cannot apply to absence from work caused by permanent disability. The reasoning on which the cases were decided of Boast v. Frith[11]; Robinson v. Davison[12]; Poussard v. Spiers[13]; and also the case of Johnson v. Walker[14]; fully sustain these propositions.\nThe action, therefore, must fail, but, while setting aside the findings of the jury on the fourth and fifth questions, as being contrary to the evidence, we are not able, under the Judicature Rules of Nova Scotia, as interpreted by this court in the recent case of Green v. Miller[15], to direct judgment to be entered for the defendant as such a judgment would be inconsistent with the findings of the jury.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court appealed from and a new trial ordered, the costs of the trial to abide the event. KILLAM J.\u2014This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in an action brought by the executrix of the will of the late John H. Marks, a former employee of the appellant commission, to recover wages for a period during which the deceased was wholly incapacitated by illness from performing any service. The cause was tried by a jury, and upon their answers to certain specific questions judgment was entered for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed. A motion was made to set aside the findings as being against the weight of evidence and to have the action dismissed. Upon an equal division the court refused the motion.\nThere is a singular dearth of clear authority respecting the effect of the disability of an employee arising from illness upon the right to wages and in determining or giving the right to determine the contract of service.\nIn Chandler v. Grieves[16], it was held that a seaman was entitled to wages for a period during which he was wholly disabled through an injury received in the course of his duty. The court said that\nclearly the law marine ought to be followed in the construction of the contract, and they directed an inquiry to be made in the Court of Admiralty whether, according to the usage there adopted, a disabled seaman, in similar circumstances, would be entitled to wages for the whole voyage, or only up to the time he was so disabled.\nAfter inquiry, it was stated\nthat in every case there to be found, a seaman disabled in the course of his duty was holden to be entitled to wages for the whole voyage, though be had not performed the whole.\nIn Abbott on Shipping, (7 ed.) p. 619, it is laid down that\nas a seaman is exposed to the hazard of losing the reward of his faithful service during a considerable period in certain cases so, on the other hand, the law gives him whole wages, even where he ha3 been unable to render his service, if his inability has proceeded from any hurt received in the performance of his duty or from natural sickness happening to him in the course of the voyage.\nIn Beale v. Thompson[17], after referring to Chandler v. Grieves[18], Chambre J. said:\nIn every contract of service, the contract goes on though the servant be disabled by sickness. A servant is never conceived to enter into an engagement that he will continue in health; it is no part of the contract that he will do so.\nHeath J. said;\nThe hiring of mariners for a voyage is an executory contract, the service must be performed before. the wages become due. There are many things which will dispense with the actual service, such as sickness and any accidental infirmity that happens after the mariner has entered on his services; but then the mariner is usually on the ship and the ship is earning freight, so that there is a fund out of which the wages may be paid.\nAnd Lord Alvanley C. J. said:\nOn these articles the contract must be considered as entire, and as long as that contract subsists there can be no such thing as an interruption; it is either entirely at an end or entirely subsists.\nThe case usually cited as the leading authority is Cuckson v. Stones[19]. In reality, however, the decision was founded upon the special nature of the contract in question, as Lord Campbell C. J. distinctly indicated.\nThe plaintiff was employed as an expert brewer for ten years. The defendants were to pay him a lump sum in advance and weekly wages and to furnish him with a house and with coals for the whole term. About a year from the end of the term, the plaintiff became ill and continued so for about seven months, during which time he was unable to personally attend to the business, but gave advice to the defendants who consulted him from time to time. The defendants paid the wages for some months of the period of illness and, upon the plaintiff's recovery, he went on with his work and was paid as before. It was admitted that the contract continued. As declared and as proved, the promise to pay was clearly an independent promise, the consideration for which was the plaintiff's executory promise to serve; and the agreement to pay wages was only a part of the consideration for the plaintiff's promise. There was but one entire contract. Upon general principles, the performance of the service was not a condition precedent to the obligation to pay. Disability arising from natural illness was an absolute excuse for non-performance. There was no default on the part of the plaintiff. The decision affords very little assistance in determining whether, under a contract such as that now in question, actual service is an absolute condition precedent to the right of payment. It is important, however, for an expression of opinion by Lord Campbell regarding the effect of illness upon the relation of the parties. He said:\nWe concur in the observation of Willes J. in Harmer v. Cornelius[20], and if the plaintiff from unskilfuness had been wholly incompetent to brew, or by the visitation of God he had become, from paralysis or any other bodily illness, permanently incompetent to act in the capacity of brewer for the defendant, we think the defendant might have determined the contract. He could not be considered incompetent by illness of a temporary nature; but if he had been struck with disease so that he could never be expected to return to his work, we think the defendant ought to have dismissed him and employed another in his stead. Instead of being dismissed, he returned to the service of the defendant when his health was restored and the defendant employed him and paid him as before. At the trial the defendant's counsel admitted that the contract was not rescinded. The contract being in force, we think that there was no suspension of the weekly payments by reason of the plaintiff's illness and inability to work. It is allowed that under this contract, there could be no deduction from the weekly sum in respect of his having been disabled by illness from working for one day of the week; and while the contract remained in force, we see no difference between his being so disabled for a day or for a week or for a month. These views were pronounced as indicating the considered opinion of the court. They do not seem to have been since questioned by any court. They should, I think, be accepted as governing the rights of the parties under contracts of a similar nature.\nIn K \u2014\u2014 v. Raschen[21], the plaintiff had been employed at a yearly salary subject to dismissal on one month's notice. The service began on the 2nd of July, and continued until the 30th of July, when the plaintiff was given leave of absence until the 6th of August, on account of illness. He remained unable to work until the 2nd of September, when he returned and tendered his services, which were refused. On the 20th of August he was given notice that he was dismissed. He Was held entitled to recover his wages for the whole period of illness. So far as the report shews the only serious position raised was upon the defendant's contention that there was no liability because, it was claimed, the illness was due to the plaintiffs own misconduct. It appeared, however, that the misconduct occurred before the engagement, and there was nothing to indicate that the plaintiff knew, when he contracted, that he was afflicted with an infirmity likely to disable him. The court considered that illness was to be taken as prim\u00e2 facie due to the act of God, and that the plaintiff should not be deemed to have warranted his permanent capacity for work.\nIn Elliott v. Liggens[22], the plaintiff was employed at weekly wages, subject to dismissal on a week's notice He was partially incapacitated by accident but continued to work as well as his condition allowed for several months, when he was dismissed upon the agreed notice. He claimed and was awarded, by agreement, half his weekly wages by way of compensation under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act, 1897.\" After his discharge, he sued in a County Court for the remainder of the weekly wages and recovered judgment. The King's Bench Division reversed the decision on the ground that, by claiming and receiving the compensation, he lost any right which he might otherwise have had to his ordinary wages. The opinion of the court upon the right, if this had not been done, was not indicated.\nIt seems clearly settled that under a contract to furnish the personal services of a particular person, there is an implied qualification that it is subject to such person being in health to perform the services when the time for their performance comes, and that the party so contracting is excused by the disability, without his fault, of the person who is to render the services. Boast v. Frith[23]; Robinson v. Davison[24]; Poussard v. Spiers[25]; Spalding v. Rosa[26]; Dickey v. Linscott[27].\nIn Poussard v. Spiers (3), the employer was held excused for refusing to accept the services where the performer was disabled when the time came for entering upon them and the time was deemed so material as to be of the essence of the contract.\nThe contract in question in the present case was in writing and was set out and admitted in the pleadings. It was as follows:\nNo. 7.\u2014Memorandum of Agreement between The Dartmouth Ferry Commission, of the one part, and John H. Marks, of Dartmouth, in the County of Halifax, of the other part.\nThe said John H. Marks agrees to serve The Dartmouth Ferry Commission in the capacity of captain at the monthly wages of sixty dollars per month. Such services to commence on the first day of March, A.D. 1899, the wages for each calendar month to be paid on the tenth day of the following month, and such service to be terminated by one calendar month's notice on either side, to be given at any time. Should either party wish to terminate the service without such notice, the commission to be entitled to do so by paying one month's pay, and the said John H. Marks, by forfeiting to the commission one month's pay. Any period of service prior to the commencement of a calendar month to be paid pro rat\u00e2 on the tenth day of each calendar month. Nothing in these presents to affect the right of either party to terminate the relation hereby created for lawful cause.\nIn witness whereof, the party of the first part has hereunto subscribed his name and the parties of the second part have hereunto affixed their corporate seal.\nWitness,\n(Signed) H. Watt.\n(Signed) JOHN H. MARKS.\n(Signed) A. C. JOHNSTON,\nChairman,\n(Signed) WALTER CHREIGHTON,\n(Seal.) Act Secretary.\nMarks served the commission in the capacity of master of a ferry boat from the 1st of March, 1899, to the 15th of December, 1900. From the latter date until the 16th of July, 1901, when he died, he was wholly incapacitated by illness from performing any services and performed none. This is distinctly established by the evidence of the plaintiff herself.\nIf then, upon a proper construction of this contract, the actual performance of service during each month was an absolute condition precedent to the right to payment of the wages for the month, the action should have been dismissed.\nAlthough the deceased was employed in the work of navigation, it does not appear to me that it is to be presumed that the parties contracted with reference to the custom found in Chandler v. Grieves[28] to prevail in the employment of mariners on sea-going ships. There is no evidence of any custom which the parties can be assumed to have had in view. In Lampleigh v. Braithwaite[29], it is said;\nBut, if it be executory, as in consideration that you will serve me a year I will give you ten pounds, here you cannot bring your action till the service performed. But if it were a promise, on either side, executory, it needs not to aver preformance; for it is the counter-promise and not the performance that makes the consideration.\nAnd in Thorp v. Thorp[30], Holt C. J. said:\nIf A. covenant with B. to serve him for a year and B. covenant with A. to pay him ten pounds, there, A. shall maintain an action for ten pounds before any service; but if B. had covenanted to pay ten pounds for the said service, there A. could not maintain an action for the money before the service performed. And there is a great reason for this diversity; for when one promises, agrees or covenants to do one thing for another, there is no reason he should be obliged to do it till the thing for which he promised to do it is done; and the word \"for\" is a condition precedent in such a case. See also Y. B. 15 H. VII.. 10 pl. 17.\nThe modern principle is to endeavour to ascertain from an examination of the whole contract what was the real intention of the parties; but if it appears that it was the performance and not the promise that was to constitute the consideration for the counter-promise, this still gives rise to the presumption that performance was intended to be a condition precedent.\nHere the only specific promise is that of Marks to serve in a certain capacity at certain wages. The counter-promise to pay must be inferred from the words \"to be paid\". The monthly wages were to be paid after the month's service was to be rendered. Upon these circumstances alone, the natural presumption would appear to be that the performance of each month's service was to be a condition precedent to the right to the month's wages. But, if so, complete performance would be necessary. Failure of performance for one day would, unless some qualification is to be implied from the nature and subject matter of the contract, involve the same result as a failure for all but one day. It is a well established principle that, under such a contract, failure to serve for a portion of a month, when attributable to the fault of the employee, disentitles him to the wages for the whole month. For each month the contract is entire. I do not think that, in the absence of an express stipulation, an intention would be implied that, upon partial failure of performance due to illness, the monthly wages were to be apportioned. In the case of a domestic servant this would certainly not be done. I see no greater reason for implying it in the case of a clerk employed in an office or shop, or of one in the occupation of the deceased.\nIn the contract before us are the words,\nany period of service prior to the commencement of a calendar month to be paid pro rata on the tenth day of such calendar month.\nThese follow immediately the provisions for termination of the contract at any time, not necessarily at the end of a month, and were probably directed particularly to that contingency. I cannot infer from their use an intention that a deduction should be made for time lost through illness if this should not be inferred from the previous language.\nThe real qualification to be implied is, I think, the one recognized in the cases to which I have referred. As the employee does not warrant the continuance of his physical ability to work, he does not contract absolutely and at all events to do so. Disability due to illness excuses him. And since his promise is so qualified, strict and full performance of service is not a condition precedent to the right to wages. The wages are payable for such service as he can reasonably be called upon to give and for such only.\nThese appear to me to be the principles justifying the decison in K\u2014\u2014\u2014v Raschen[31] and the judicial opinions expressed in Beale v. Thompson[32] And there seems to be no ground for distinguishing between different periods of illness, so long as the contract subsists. Disability due to this cause and lasting for months would not seem to have a different effect from such disability lasting for nine-tenths of a month or for one day only. There is no precise point at which a line can be drawn. I cannot concur in the opinion which I understand to be held by the other members of this court, that the illness of Marks, ipso facto, put an end to the contract. Both the question as to whether the illness of which Marks died was of a temporary or permanent character and the answer appear, at first sight, anomalous. But they were evidently dictated by the peculiar nature of the case. Apparently, Mark's illness was not considered to be permanent until a few days before his death. He appeared to be recovering, but he then had a relapse which resulted fatally. And it was fully open to the jury to find, upon the medical evidence, that the malady which incapacitated him for nearly the whole of the seven months was independent of that which brought about the death and that the existence of the latter was unsuspected until the relapse occurred.\nThe jury have found that Marks remained in the employ of the commission until his death; that is, they found that the contract remained undetermined. The evidence appears to me to have justified the finding. There was no date, prior to the end of June, when the parties deemed the contract as determined. Month by month, as I interpret the original contract, the wages would accrue. And once accrued, the right to them could not be taken away by what subsequently occurred or became apparent. In the words of Lord Alvanley in Beale v. Thompson,[33]\nas long as that contract subsists there can be no such thing as an interruption; it is either entirely at an end or entirely subsists.\nLord Campbell, in Cuckson v. Stones,[34] put incapacity arising from illness on the basis of incompetency, as giving a right to determine the contract. But it would be clearly in the power of the master to waive a right to discharge for the incompetency of the servant; and so, I think, the right to discharge for incapacity arising from illness would be waived and lost by conduct shewing a continuance of the employment.\nI am, however, of opinion that the answer to the second question was against the weight of evidence. It was a double question:\nDid the said John H. Marks continue in the employ of the defendant commission after notice of this resolution and acquiesce in said employment under the terms of said resolution?\nThe resolution referred to was adopted by the commission on the 8th January, 1900, and was as follows:\nThat after this date no employee will be paid for any time he or she be absent from duty.\nMarks did remain in the employment of the commission after the passing of the resolution. There is no question about that. In accordance with the resolution, deductions were made from his wages for time lost. He accepted the payments and receipted for them. He is dead and the secretary whose duty it would be to give him formal notice of the resolution is dead. The proper inference from the circumstances is that Marks had notice of the resolution. Witnesses testified orally to conversations with Marks which, if believed, shewed that he both knew of and had assented, though unwillingly, to the modification of his contract proposed by the resolution. No evidence was given of any refusal by him to accept the terms of the commission or of any claim by him to the wages deducted or to wages for any period of his illness. There was no contradictory testimony.\nThe evidence appears to me overwhelmingly in favour of the view that Marks, by his conduct, if not in words, expressed to the commission his assent to the modification proposed, and that the commission was thereby induced to continue him in its service. If he had not led them to believe in his assent, they would, no doubt, have long ago discharged him.\nI cannot help thinking that the jury failed to fully comprehend the question. They may have thought that formal notice was intended, or that the acquiescence must be willing and with approbation.\nIt does not appear to me that the corporate seal raises any difficulty. The commission did not agree to retain Marks in its service or to pay him for a definite period. The contract was determinable on either side by the giving of a month's notice, or by payment or loss of a month's wages. It was quite competent for the parties to take notice of the resolution as a notice of intention to discharge from the former contract and to agree upon a continuance of the service only upon special terms. It was quite competent for Marks to waive formal or more definite notice or to accept employment on the new terms in lieu of the monthly wages.\nUpon the ground that the answer to the second question was against the weight of evidence, I assent to the allowance of the appeal and the granting of a new trial.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: F.

S.N. S. (1900) c. 79.\nD. was engaged in moving cars at a quarry of the company. The cars were loaded at a chute under a crusher and had to be taken past an unused chute about 200 feet away supported by a post placed 7\u00bd inches from the track. D. having loaded a car found that it failed to move as usual after unbraking and he had to come down to the foot-board and shove back the foot-rod connected with the brake. The car then started and he climbed up the steps at the side to get to the brake on top but was crushed between the car and the post. He could have got on the rear of the car instead of using the steps or jumped down and walked along after the car until it had passed the post. The manager at the quarry had been warned of the danger from the post but had done nothing to obviate it.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (36 n. S. Rep. 113) Davies and Killam JJ. dissenting, that D.'s own negligence was the cause of his injury and the company were not liable.\nHeld per Davies and Killam JJ. that the position of the post was a defect in the company's works under the Employers Liability Act which was evidence of negligence.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff\nThe facts of the case are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Weatherbe, at the trial, as follows: \"Plaintiff was injured by being squeezed between a car on which he was brakesman and a post, alleged to be too near the track by reason of negligent construction.\nIt was plaintiff's duty to move the car from the chute when it was filled, and when in motion to jump quickly on the rear end of the car and walk along to put down the brake, and while doing so he was struck by a post supporting an unused chute of the company.\n\"Plaintiff had climbed up and took the brake off, and, owing to some defect, the car would not start. Then he shook the car, which still could not be moved. He then came down to the foot-board and shoved back the rod connected with the brake. On going up the car started and, being unable to jump clear, he was crushed between the post and the side of the car.\n\"On warning the foreman of this post he said 'we will not bring any cars that way,' but owing to neglect in shunting cars on another track the mischief occurred.\n\"Plaintiff's entire body was squeezed in a inch space, and was injured, he says, 'right across the system.' The injury, he says, is so great that he may never get over it. He was unable to walk for 13 days after the injury. After, he was obliged to get an easier job. For 10 weeks he could only average four days a week. After a month and a half's rest he commenced to work again, but does not seem to be much better. He was going to meet two doctors for consultation when called to attend the court.\n\"He averaged a dollar and a half a day as wages when well, sometimes he got $1.75 a day.\n\"He applied to the official in charge of the quarry for damages, and two letters of Mr. Jennison are in evidence, in one of which he says the matter has been referred to the head office at Sydney, where no doubt the matter will be considered.\n\"The defence pleaded, denying any negligence whatever on defendant's part and setting up contributory negligence. Defendants denied that plaintiff was injured and put him to the proof of everything;\u2014 though plaintiff had been for some time employed by the company, he had been but a short time at the work at which he was injured.\n\"Plaintiff called the 'walking boss' Stamper. He admits that the post was too close to the car and if he had built the chute, he would have given three feet of room instead of 7 or 8 inches.\n\"George Lawrence, under whom plaintiff worked, was called by the defence and I regard his evidence as corroborative of the manner in which the accident occurred. He also corroborated plaintiff as to his inability to do his usual work.\n\"Another brakesman was called Jesso who, on cross-examination, admitted that the steps on the side of the car which plaintiff used were generally used for the same purpose and are placed there to get up and down.\n\"Jennison, who was in charge of the quarry for defendant company, was also called for the defence. He started the construction of the plant but did not complete it. He says very suggestively that 'this particular part I did not construct, fortunately.' He does not know the width of the cars and whether they are wider than ordinary cars.\"\nOn the facts so found the learned judge gave judgment for the plaintiff and assessed the damages at $850 with costs. The company appealed to the court in banco which affirmed the judgment of the trial judge but reduced the damages to $600. From this judgment a further appeal was taken by the company to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLovett for the appellants.\nHarris K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would allow this appeal and dismiss the respondent's action on the ground that, even if the company were negligent in allowing the post to remain so close to the track, yet the respondent by reasonable care and ordinary prudence could have avoided this accident.\nAs I read the evidence, if he had stepped off to the ground immediately on the car starting, he would not have been hurt. He is not merely guilty of contributory negligence but is the victim of his own carelessness. It is a case where it was perfectly in the power of the servant, by keeping his eyes open, to guard himself against a possible danger of which he was fully aware. If, by not doing so, he suffers injuries he must take the consequences of his own neglect. Without the respondent's negligence or stupidity this accident would never have happened.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs in this court and in the court in banco, and the action is dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Graham in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, to which I have not much to add, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed. The action was brought under The Employers Liability Act of Nova Scotia which is similar to that of Ontario. In his able presentation of the case for the appellants, Mr. Lovett contended that there was no evidence of any negligence on the part of the defendants (appellants) \"arising out of any defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, buildings or premises connected with, intended for or used in the business of the employer.\" His argument was that the statutory negligence must be negligence per se in the condition or arrangement of the ways, etc. But I think the decided cases clearly show that the defects to which the statute refers are defects having regard to the use to which the ways or premises are to be applied or the mode or manner in which they are to be used. The use of the railway with the presence of the post complained of where it was might not be negligence under some circumstances and might be under others. Walsh v. Whitely[2]; Heske v. Samuelson[3], the head note of which says:\nThe Employer's Liability Act, 18S0\u2014which gives a workman a right of action against his employer for personal injury by reason of a defect in the condition of the machinery used in the business of the employer\u2014applies to the case where a machine, though not defective in its construction, was, under the circumstances in which it was used, calculated to cause injury to those using it.\nAs Lord Coleridge C.J. says:\nIf it was not in a proper condition for the purposes for which it was applied there was a defect in its condition within the meaning of the Act.\nThis decision was affirmed and followed by the Court of Appeal in Cripps v. Judge[4], and also in Walsh v. Whiteley, cited above, and has not so far as I have found been questioned. I am of opinion that in the circumstances of this case the user of the railway to load the cars with stone from the crusher with the post complained of and which caused the injury to the plaintiff, fixed where it was, brings the case within the meaning of the section.\nThe appellant further contended that the maxim volenti non fit injuria applied and that its application ousted the plaintiff's claim. But I think the evidence given as to the complaint made by the plaintiff to the manager or superintendent of the danger which the continued maintenance of the post in question would probably cause, and the assurances given to the plaintiff respecting it, constitute, apart from other considerations, a complete answer to that contention.\nMr. Beven in his work on Negligence, vol. 1, page 383, lays down the following as one of the three propositions which may be accepted as the result of the decided cases so far as they relate to the application of this maxim:\nWhen the master is under a statutory liability to take precautions in any particular work the presumption of law is, that as between the master and the workman the fact of the workman working in the absence of the statutory safeguards does not discharge the master from his liability to compensate the workman for injuries sustained through the master's neglect to provide the statutory safeguards; and this presumption can only be rebutted by clear proof of an undertaking of the employment by the workman with a knowledge of the risk involved and of the master's duty in respect thereof.\nAdopting this as I do as a fair though possibly not exhaustive definition of the liability of the master under the conditions assumed, I fail to see where the evidence of any such understanding on the part of the plaintiff can be found.\nThe statutory safeguard in this case is of course the proper condition of the ways and premises of the defendants' railway for the purposes and under the circumstances in which they were being used at the time the plaintiff sustained his injuries. As I have already held this was defective, and the defect had been brought expressly to the knowledge of the defendants and assurances given that it would be remedied.\nThe only other contention advanced by the defendants was that the plaintiff contributed by his own negligence to the injury he received. The case of Ryan v. The Canada Southern Railway C.[5] was cited in support of this contention. But that case was decided on the ground that the injury could not have happened if the deceased had not placed himself in the position to be injured by the switch stand and that he had not satisfactorily explained why he was there. The facts of the case are stated on page 746 of the report as follows:\nHis position as brakesman should have been on top of the car, but for some reason or other, of which there is no evidence, he was on the side of the car holding on to the steps of the ladder, etc.\nIn the case at Bar there was, in my opinion, ample evidence giving satisfactory reasons why the plaintiff was on the side of the car when injured and the case relied upon has not, therefore, in my opinion, any relevance.\nNESBITT J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nKILLAM J.

Engineers of the company were employed by the town to survey the lands required for the site and to make a plan which was filed as required by the statute. M., two years later, after the company had excavated a considerable part of the land, brought an action for trespass claiming that it included five chains belonging to him and, at the trial of such action, the main contention was as to the boundary of his holding. He obtained a verdict which was affirmed by the full court.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from (36 N. S. Rep. 28) that the only question to be decided was whether or not the land claimed by M. was a part of that indicated on the plan filed; that the sole duty of the engineers was to lay out the land which the town intended to expropriate; and whether it was M's land or not wa3 immaterial as the town could take it without regard to boundaries.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The facts of the case sufficiently appear from the above head-note and the judgment of the court on this appeal.\nLavett for the appellants.\nNewcombe K. C. and McInnis for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is an action brought against the appellant company for trespass on a lot of land at Sydney, in the County of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.\nThe trial judge found in favour of the plaintiff, which judgment was confirmed by the Supreme Court in banco, and an appeal was taken to this court.\nThe appellant company was incorporated for the purpose of manufacturing iron and steel, and the town of Sydney desiring that the works of the company should be located within its limits, obtained from the legislature an Act authorising it to give a site for their works. The Act is chapter 84 of the statutes of 1899, and provides in effect as follows:\u2014\nThe Town of Sydney is hereby empowered to expropriate, acquire, purchase, take over and hold so much land within the limits of the town as may be necessary to furnish a location for the works of the company, a plan showing the site or location of such lands and lands covered with water, easements, privileges and other rights shall be filed in the office of the Registrar of Deeds of the County of Cape Breton by the town clerk of the said Town of Sydney immediately after the town council of the said Town of Sydney shall by resolution provide for such acquisition or expropriation, and on the filing of the said plan all the right, title and interest in said land and lands covered with water, easements, priviledges and other rights, shall forthwith absolutely vest in the Town of Sydney. Under this statute the town employed engineers of the appellant company to survey the lands required for the site of the steel works and to make a plan; this they did, and it was duly filed in the office of the Registrar of Deeds after the town council had passed the resolution required by the statute.\nThe sole question to be decided in order to determine this appeal is whether or not the locus upon which it is alleged the appellant company committed trespass was included in the plan or was outside of it.\nThe site chosen and selected consisted of a considerable tract of land bounded on the north and north-west by the waters of Sydney Harbour; on the south-east by the line of the Sydney and Louisburg Railway; on the south-west by a line staked by the surveyors on the ground, and subsequently marked by iron posts, extending from the railway mentioned to the Reserve Mine Railway and thence along the line of Reserve Mine Railway to the harbour waters.\nThe whole point in dispute is as to the location of the north-eastern corner of the property, the respondent contending that this corner is five chains nearer the harbour than the company says it is?\u2014these five chains being the land in dispute. In surveying the grounds the engineers commenced from a certain well known and defined point in the waters of Sydney Harbour: they proceeded along the line of the Sydney and Louisburg Railway until they came to a point which, in their opinion, would be sufficiently landward to afford adequate ground for the company's works. At this particular point they placed a stake. There was here no indication of any kind that it was a boundary line but they were told as a matter of fact it was the end of a boundary line between John McDonald and one Alexander McLennan. From that point across to the Reserve Railway they staked a line the stakes indicating that the line was a line between John McDonald and Alexander McLennan, and for these stakes there were shortly afterwards substituted iron posts, also indicating the supposed boundary line.\nAfterwards the company erected their works upon the site chosen, with a railway or siding on the locus. Now it happened that five chains harbourward from the point mentioned on the Sydney and Louisburg Railway there was another point which was intended to indicate the corner of a lot of which one John McDonald had given an option of sale to the plaintiff Duncan McLennan. The sale had not been completed at the time of the filing of the plan, but it subsequently was, and the plaintiff brings his action holding that that conveyance gave him title as against the town of Sydney and the defendant company.\nThe plan filed purports to be a plan of lands and lands covered with water in the Town of Sydney, C.B., required for proposed blast furnaces to be erected by Henry M. Whitney\u2014scale 400 feet to one inch,\u2014and the description upon the plan refers to the corner in dispute as the division line between the lands of John McDonald and the lands of Alexander McLennan. Which point is the true corner? I am of opinion that the point marked upon the ground by the surveyors governs. It is true that at that point there was no division line between John McDonald and Alexander McLennan, but that was the point intended to be the corner of lands to be expropriated, the lands which the town of Sydney intended to pay for and transfer to the company, and the lands which the company expected to receive.\nThe plan it was proved was a substantially accurate picture or representation of the lands intended to be expropriated, and one could by scaling, having regard to the railways, roads and other objects marked upon the plan, ascertain from the plan, within a few feet, the proposed boundary, irrespectively of the stakes or posts upon the ground. The plaintiff's position, however, is that because there was a division line between himself, Duncan McLennan, and one John McDonald, it must be presumed that that division line was the one intended and not the alleged division line which the surveyors were informed existed between John McDonald and Alexander McLennan. This, in my view, is absolutely fallacious. The marking upon the plan of the boundary in question with John McDonald on one side and Alexander McLennan on the other, the latter being a fictitious person, made it, for the purposes of the expropriation, a boundary line identifying that boundary as the one mentioned in the description, and there is, in my judgment, no ground which would compel the company to accept any other boundary than that one. The surveyors making the plan may have called the corner point in question by any name they chose. The fact that they designated that point in the way they did whether accurately or inaccurately affords no justification for the plaintiff's claim. If they had called it Black Acre and marked it on the ground as Black Acre the plaintiff unquestionably would be out of court. I am unable to conceive why the plaintiff can make the company stop in their landward claim at his boundary; that boundary might have been a few feet from Sydney Harbour or miles distant from it. They were entitled to the lands included within the plan and were limited by the boundaries indicated upon the plan irrespective altogether of any actual boundary line whether within or without the lands surveyed. I need not discuss the authorities but the following cases and references support the propositions which have enabled me to come to the conclusion I have; Lyle v. Richards[2]; Nene Valley Drainage Commissioners v. Dunkley[3]; Llewellyn v. Earl of Jersey[4]; Devlin on Deeds, section 1022, etc.; Penry v. Richards[5]; O'Farrell v. Harney[6].\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants; Pearson, Lovett & Covert.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ross & Ross.\n[1] 36 N.

S. Rep. 211) reversed and a new trial ordered.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] maintaining, by an equal division of the judges, the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe following statement of facts is taken from the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia:\n\"This is an action to recover damages for alleged assault and battery on the plaintiff. The defendant was, during the session of 1902, the chief messenger of the House of Assembly of the province. The plaintiff during that session frequented the House and its corridors in the promotion of a petition which she had presented to the House, in the previous session of 1901, and which had not been dealt with or disposed of by the House or the Government. For reasons which appear from the evidence, the defendant in the alleged discharge of his duty as an officer of the House, and by the direction of the Speaker, requested the plaintiff to retire from the House and its corridors. This direction the plaintiff refused to obey and defendant thereupon removed her with no more force than was necessary. The House was not, at the time of plaintiff's removal, in session, but had been adjourned in the usual course from the previous sitting. The defendant's eighth plea appears to embrace his grounds of defence. It is as follows:\n\"'8. The defendant says he is the chief messenger of the House of Assembly, and that one of his duties is to preserve order and decorum in the House of Assembly, and about the precincts and corridors thereof, and that the plaintiff at the times alleged in the statement of claim was creating a disturbance in the House of Assembly, in the committee rooms thereof, and in the corridors of the said House, and that the defendant, after he had requested the plaintiff to cease making such disturbance and to leave the said house, committee room and corridors, and after the plaintiff had refused to leave the said house, committee rooms or corridors, or desist from creating a disturbance in said house, committee rooms or corridors, gently laid hands upon the plaintiff and removed her from said house, committee rooms and corridors thereof, using no more force than was necessary, and this is the assault complained of in the statement of claim herein.' The question then appears to be, assuming as the defendant alleges that at the times alleged in the statement of claim the plaintiff was creating a disturbance in the House of Assembly, in the committee rooms, and in the corridors of the said House, whether or not the defendant could, after requesting her to retire, legally remove her from the precincts of the House, although the House was not in formal session with the Speaker in the chair. Was the conduct of the plaintiff, before and at the time she was requested to retire from the corridors of the House, such as to justify the language of the plea that \"the plaintiff was creating a disturbance in the House of Assembly, in the committee rooms thereof, and in the corridors of the House?\n\"The evidence of the plaintiff relates first to the occurrences during the session of 1901 which, for the reasons stated by the learned trial judge, have no relation to the question to be decided in this appeal. As to the occurrences during the session of 1902, when the alleged assault was committed, the plaintiff says:\n\"'I attended again at the session of 1902, 28th February. I was in the hall near the glass door. I met some of the members. Defendant there assaulted me. He took me by the shoulders and violently shook me and pushed me. He pushed me and tried to throw me down stairs. He had been drinking. I could smell liquor on his breath. I said to him\u2014'If you will leave me alone I will go out.' He did not leave me alone. I was afraid of him and when he went to open the door on Granville Street I ran out the other way to get rid of him. I was so much afraid of his treatment that I never went there again.'\n\"Cross-examined by Mr. Drysdale.\u2014'It is true that formerly, on another occasion, I had called the Attorney General a thief. I had a quarrel with him. (Here the witness got much excited.) Before I was assaulted the last time, one of the members from Cumberland told me to wait and I could then see the members. Defendant said I could not speak to the members. On all occasions of my visits to the House I was there about my property and my petition. I had formerly been told by the Speaker that I must have justice done me.'\n\"It was with difficulty that the statements of the plaintiff in cross-examination could be understood on account of her rapid utterance. She volunteered many statements not touching the issue with respect to her petition, and the subject of that petition, which I was obliged to prevent.\n\"During the cross-examination I learned that the first assault of which the plaintiff had given evidence without objection was barred by the statute which was pleaded.\n\"This was the evidence for the plaintiff.\n\"The defendant was then called and testified as follows:\n\"'In 1901 plaintiff met the Attorney General and called him a rogue, thief and liar. Mr. Longley then ordered me to put her out. She refused to go and I took her by the arm and led her down stairs and she went out. I did not use more force than was necessary. I did not shake her, as she says. She frequently came to the corridors twice a day, and every day sometimes. This was at both sessions. She intercepted the members and talked very loud sometimes. She screamed and on different occasions I had to stop it. The Speaker sent a message to me in the smoking room. The House was not in session at the time I put her out After the message I got from the Speaker from his room, in the smoking room\u2014(All evidence of messages from the Speaker, or directions from the Speaker or members is objected to.)\u2014I asked her to go out and she went outside in the hall. The Speaker then sent for me to his room and then I undertook to use force. The Speaker had said 'Go and put her out!' She came back the next day after the second assault. She had talked quite loudly and at first when I had orders from the Speaker refused to go, but afterwards went. She was in the hall when I first took hold of her.'\n\"Cross-examined.\u2014'This is not the first person I had heard talking loudly I had heard members talk loudly while the House was not in session. I had the orders, in 1902, of the Speaker's messenger from the Speaker's private room to remove plaintiff when I first touched her, and then after that she broke away from me. The Speaker sent for me. I was eight or ten feet away from her when plaintiff talked loudly. Could not say whether Speaker heard her. 1 was acting on the Speaker's instructions in 1902. She struggled a little. I put the same lady out in 1900 and 1901. Persons having business with members went where she had gone. The House was not sitting, nor was there any committee sitting when I put plaintiff out in 1902, and the Speaker was in his own room away from the place where the plaintiff was.'\n\"The Hon. Mr. Longley, the Attorney General of the province, and a member of the House of Assembly, testified as follows:\n\"'I am Chairman of Committee on Law Amendments and was at the time of the affair in 1901. I was in my own office and going to my desk to get papers to take to committee room, Sitting at the desk plaintiff called out,\u2014'thief, scoundrel, rogue.' I paid no attention to this on this day, and plaintiff was not molested. On the next day when I went to my desk I paid no attention at first to the plaintiff, but on my way to the committee room she followed me and kept shouting and I told the messenger: he must preserve order. He just quietly removed her. There seemed to be no difficulty\u2014(Objected to as the statute is pleaded to above.)\u2014In 1902 session I was not present at plaintiff's removal, but she frequented the committee in the same way. She was obviously crazy. Became necessary to have plaintiff permanently removed. She was in the corridor and around the House of Assembly continuously and became an intolerable nuisance. Talked wildly and loudly and in an excited state. This continued till the time of the last removal.'\n\"Cross-examined.\u2014'I am a member of the Government of Nova Scotia. The plaintiff's petition referred to in the resolution in the journals in 1901 was before the Government and we took no action on it.'\n\"Clifford Marriot, sworn:\n\"'I am the Speaker's messenger. During the last four sessions. I was present in 1902 at the place where the affair occurred between plaintiff and defendant. Plaintiff was in the smoking room before I saw her or defendant went to her. The Speaker had been in the smoking room when plaintiff was present and several members also. The House was not in session. After a while the Speaker went out of that room and went to his own room. He beckoned to me to follow him to his room. The Speaker gave me a message.\u2014(All evidence of what Speaker said objected to.)\u2014The Speaker said: 'Tell Payson that woman must go out. I can't have her bothering the members.' I went and told Payson and he spoke to her. She was in the corridor. He said 'the Speaker says you must go out.' She said 'how dare you order me out?' Payson put his hand on her arm and she went quietly until she reached the hall. She then resisted and Payson let go immediately. When Speaker was in the smoking room plaintiff was talking loudly. This was previously. After Payson let go and came into the corridor I went to the Speaker and he said 'is that woman out?' I said 'she is in the hall.' He said 'why is she not out? I said 'she would not go.' He told me to tell Payson to come to him. He said 'I want to see him.'\n\"Cross-examined.\u2014'I can't say that the first order was more than that she must go out. Plaintiff had documents in her hands when in the smoking room.'\n\"Frank Greenough sworn:\n\"'I was present when defendant put plaintiff out. I saw them go down the first stone steps. The Speaker's messenger said\u2014(objected)\u2014then to Payson that the Speaker had given orders to put her out. He said 'I got orders from the Speaker to have you put out.' She had been between the two doors. He took her by the arm. One hand on her arm the other on her shoulder, and they went down together. I did not see Payson shake the plaintiff.'\n\"Cross-examined.\u2014'I did not see Payson attempt to put her out on two occasions. I did not see the occasion when she broke away. I did not see her go down the steps.'\n\"Mr. O'Connor objects (as the Attorney General had given evidence) that he should address the jury. I thought it was a question for the Attorney General himself.\n\"The Attorney General addresses the jury in closing for defendant. Mr. O'Connor closed for plaintiff.\n\"All this evidence appears to lead to the inevitable conclusion that the language used by the Attorney General to describe the conduct of the plaintiff while frequenting the precincts of the House is not in any degree exaggerated. According to the contention of counsel for the plaintiff there is no remedy for this kind of thing unless the House be in session and the Speaker in the chair, and until the House be thus clothed with formal authority, anyone so disposed may invade the House and its committee rooms with impunity, till a formal resolution can be passed to commit the offender for contempt.\n\"Chapter 20 of the Revised Statutes, (N.S.) sec. 18, subsection b. enacts:\n\"'That the House and committees and members thereof respectively shall hold, enjoy and exercise such and the like privileges, immunities and powers as are from time to time held, enjoyed and exercised by the House of Commons of Canada, and by the committees and members thereof respectively, and such privileges and immunities shall be a part of the general public law of Nova Scotia and taken notice of judicially.'\n\"And section 25, sub-section 5, makes assaults upon or interference with officers while in the execution of their duty a violation of the Act and punishable accordingly.\"\nAt the trial a verdict was entered for the plaintiff and the damages assessed at $500. On appeal to the full court, the Chief Justice was of opinion that the verdict should be set aside and judgment entered for the defendant while Mr. Justice Graham was in favour of ordering a new trial. The other two judges, Townshend and Meagher JJ. agreed with the trial judge, and there being an equal division of opinion, the verdict for the plaintiff stood.\nNewcombe K.C. and McInnis for the appellant referred to May on Parliamentary Practice (10 ed.) pp. 63, 69, 187 and 332 n; Comyn's Dig. (5 ed.) vol. 5 p. 275; Bradlaugh v. Gossett[2] Lovett and Glyn Osier for the respondent, cited Bourinot on Parliamentary Procedure and Practice p. 157; Landers v. Woodworth[3].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and SEDGEWICK J. were of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This action was one brought to recover damages for an assault alleged to have been committed by the defendant the chief messenger of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Nova Scotia in removing, pursuant to the order of the Speaker, the plaintiff from the smoking room and corridor of the House, and from the stair-case leading up to the corridor. At the time the plaintiff was so removed the House was not in actual session, having adjourned for a short interval, and the fact seems to have had much influence in leading the learned trial judge and at least one of the judges sitting in banc to the conclusions they reached. It is much to be regretted that the report of the trial and of the judge's charge to the jury are so meagre. Sufficient facts however appear to enable a conclusion to be reached as to the legal rights of the respective parties.\nThe plaintiff appears to be an an excitable and rather erratic person who, in the years 1900 and 1901 prior to the year 1902 when the alleged assault tried in this action was committed, had been forcibly removed from the precincts of the House of Assembly in the interest of order and decorum. In 1901 she had violently and apparently without provocation attacked the Attorney General while he was engaged as Chairman of Committee on Law Amendments, calling him a \"thief, scoundrel, rogue\" and the defendant, the chief messenger, had, at the Attorney General's request, removed her from the building. In giving his evidence in the present action the Attorney General, after referring to this incident, stated that\nshe was obviously crazy. Became necessary to have plaintiff permanently removed. She was in the corridor and around the House continuously and became an intolerable nuisance. Talked wildly and loudly and in excited state. This continued till the time of the last removal.\nThere was no cross-examination of the Attorney General on these points and no evidence was offered by the plaintiff calling in question the learned gentleman's statement. They stand uncontradicted and the opinion as to the mental condition of the plaintiff which they are calculated to make on the reader is confirmed by the learned trial judge who in a note to the plaintiff's cross-examination reported:\nIt was with difficulty that the statements of the plaintiff in cross-examination could be understood on account of her rapid utterances. She volunteered many statements not touching the issue with respect to her petition and the subject of that petition which I was obliged to prevent.\nThe statement of claim in the action, which was obviously prepared by herself and so stated in argument, goes still further to confirm the impression to be gathered from the evidence and the judge's notes that she was, to say the very least, an extremely erratic and excitable personnage possessed with the impression that she was the victim of some cruel wrong done to her in respect of an estate which she claimed and supposed she had been deprived of in the Island of Cape Breton by, as she alleged, the robbery of the Attorney General and others. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia from the judgment entered by the trial judge for the plaintiff on the verdict of $500 given by the jury, the court was equally divided, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Graham being in favour of judgment being entered for the defendant or a new trial being granted, while Mr. Justice Townshend and Mr. Justice Meagher were in favour of maintaining the judgment. Under these circumstances the judgment of Weatherbe J. stood confirmed.\nThe legal questions in dispute are complicated by being mixed with questions of fact, and as the jury were not asked any questions but gave a general verdict merely, it is somewhat difficult to determine precisely some facts with reference to the House of Assembly rooms, corridors and precincts, which it is desirable if not absolutely necessary to know.\nFrom the statement of counsel at the Bar and from the record, however, it is plain that the House of Assembly occupies the first floor to the eastward of the staircase leading from the ground floor of the Provincial Building, while the Legislative Council occupies the western end of the same flat. A long corridor runs from one chamber to the other and the legislative library runs between both chambers and their rooms and is common to both. I should not have supposed it open to reasonable doubt that the corridor and all the rooms adjoining used and occupied by the members of the House as committee rooms and offices as well as the Chamber itself were part of the precincts of the House and equally so that the staircase leading up to this corridor and up and down which members and the public generally had to go to reach or leave the House and the committee rooms, was a part of such precincts. I cannot think that any one or number of people could gather either in this corridor or on this staircase and so conduct themselves as to hinder if not prevent the carrying on of public business and justify themselves on the ground that they were not within the precincts of the House. I gather from the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend that it was largely if not altogether founded upon the ground that the plaintiff at the time she was forcibly removed by the defendant was in \"the general hall of the Provincial Building\" and not \"within the actual precincts of the House\" The learned judge goes on to say:\nThe alleged assault having taken place outside of that portion of the provincial building exclusively assigned to and occupied during the sessions by the members of the House of Assembly, it would seem quite clear that neither the Speaker nor chairman of any committees nor yet any member of the House had any authority as such to interfere with plaintiff in entering or remaining in the halls leading to the Assembly Chamber.\nSo far as \"the halls\" which lead to and from the public offices of the province and places other than the Assembly room are concerned, this may well be so, but it cannot be so and is not, in my opinion, so, as regards the staircase leading from the entrance on Granville street up to the corridor of the House. If a person was of such eccentric violent habits and conduct as made her presence an \"intolerable nuisance\" which ought to be removed from the Assembly Room or the working or Committee Rooms and their corridors, can it be for a moment contended that she could safely take her position at the head of the staircase up and down which members must pass on going to or from their Legislative Chamber or Committee Rooms and so placed set alike the House and its officers at defiance? As the necessary if not the sole immediate access to the House of Assembly quarters I am of the opinion that this staircase is a part of the precincts of the House and just as much so as the corridor to which it leads and from which and upon which the Assembly Chamber and Committee Rooms open.\nThe learned judge appears entirely to ignore the forcible removal of the plaintiff from the smoking room which was charged as part of the assault and which was left to the jury without any specific instructions as to its being part of the precincts of the House or as to the control which the Speaker could rightly exercise there as against mere strangers. I am unable to gather from the judge's charge to the jury whether they were instructed on either of these points. The question would appear to have been left entirely at large.\nMr. Justice Meagher, who concurred in supporting the judgment entered upon the verdict, seems to base his judgment upon the right of the public as distinct from the privilege or liberty of access to the Legislative Chamber and the Committee Rooms, which right was not, in his opinion, to be\nsubject to the arbitrary whim or caprice of the Speaker or messenger of the House, and so long as the public did not unduly interfere with the freedom of public duties of Members or Committee.\nBut the defendant, while admitting that the public have such access as a matter of license or privilege, contends that it is a license or privilege merely conceded by the House expressly or tacitly and capable of being withdrawn or refused as occasion requires. It is not contended by him that such right or privilege of access is to be \"exercised subject to the arbitrary whim or caprice of the Speaker or messenger of the House.\" Nor was it argued at the Bar that in ordering the removal of the plaintiff the Speaker acted from any arbitrary whim or caprice. On the contrary it seemed to be admitted that whether he acted legally or otherwise his orders were given bon\u00e2 fide and after he had personally seen and heard the plaintiff in the smoking room and in the exercise of what he honestly believed to be alike his right and his duty. The true rule which must guide the Speaker and the officers of the House in the exercise of their duty of preserving order and decorum is, in my judgment, correctly stated by Mr. Justice Graham in his able and clear judgment. His reasoning and the authorities he cites in support of it are conclusive as shewing that the public have access to the Legislative Chamber and to the precincts of the House as a matter of privilege only, and under either express or tacit license, which can at any time be withdrawn or revoked when in the interest of order and decorum it is judged to be necessary. That withdrawal of license can either be general as regards the whole public or special with respect to individuals who make themselves so offensive as to prejudice the proper conduct of public affairs committed to the Assembly or its Committees. It can ex necessitate be exercised by the Speaker or officers of the House in proper cases as against individuals offending against the rules of order and decorum or interfering with the proper discharge of their duties by members in the intervals of the adjournments of the House between its sessions, as well as by the House when actually sitting. Any other rule would leave the Assembly rooms, the meetings of committees or the work of the members carried on during the adjournment at the mercy of any individual or body of men who might obtrude themselves into the Chamber or its Committee Rooms and prevent the public business being carried on. Of course I do not refer to any arbitrary or capricious or malicious action on the part of the Speaker or his officers, but one which was a bon\u00e2 fide exercise of what I consider to be a necessary power. In this case, as I before said, Mr. Speaker's order was not alleged to be malicious, and in my judgment cannot be said to be either arbitrary or capricious. The evidence as to its having been well founded is to me overwhelming. The plaintiff who had been several times previously ejected from the precincts of the House obtruded herself into the smoking room where the Speaker and other members were (see the evidence of Marriott the Speaker's messenger) and the Speaker give orders that she should be removed. The defendant, the chief messenger, in giving his evidence says:\nShe (the plaintiff) frequently came to the corridors twice a day, and every day sometimes. This was at both sessions. She intercepted the members and talked very loud sometimes. She screamed and on different occasions I had to stop it. The Speaker sent a message to me in the smoking room. The House was not in session at the time I put her out. After the message I got from the Speaker from his room, in the smoking-room. * * * (All evidence of messages from the Speaker, or directions from the Speaker or members, are objected to.) I asked her to go out, and she went outside in the hall. The Speaker then sent for me to his room and then I undertook to use force. The Speaker had said: \"Go and put her out.\" She came back the next day after the second assault. She had talked quite loudly and at first when I had orders from the Speaker refused to go, but afterwards went. She was in the hall when I first took hold of her.\nThe jury should have been told that if they believed the facts to be as related by the Attorney General and the officers of the House and the other witnesses for the defence the action of the Speaker and of the chief messenger was justifiable. The plaintiff had no right to remain in the smoking-room or the corridors when ordered to leave, nor, in my opinion, had she any right to remain against orders at the head of the staircase and so obstruct and interfere with and annoy members while going to and from the Chamber or the rooms. I think also the trial judge was wrong in refusing to instruct the jury when asked by counsel for defendant to do so\nthat if the plaintiff was creating a disturbance in the smoking-room the Speaker or any other member then there had a right to order her removal.\nAt present and under the charge given to the jury it cannot be ascertained for what the damages were awarded, whether for expulsion from the smoking-room and the corridor, which were beyond any doubt within the precincts of the House, or merely for expulsion from the head of the stairway. I do not think the learned trial judge was right in putting the arbitrary limitation he did upon the powers and duties of the chief messenger so far as they related to the preservation of order and decorum in the House and its precincts as pleaded in the 11th paragraph of the defence. \"This\" he said\nrefers to a disturbance while the House and Committees were in session which was not the case as to the last assault and therefore not applicable.\nThere is no law or reason justifying any such limitation. The powers and duties of the officers of the House with respect to the preservation of order and decorum within its precincts are as applicable to the intervals of time of adjournments between the sessions as to the sessions themselves. Since the decision of the Judicial Committee in the case of Fielding v. Thomas[4], affirming the constitutionalty of the Provincial Legislation affecting the powers and privileges of the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia contained in ch. 3 of the R. S. N. S., 5th series, many judicial doubts upon these points formerly held have been removed. The 20th section so far as it relates to the assembly of the Province is as follows:\nIn all matters and cases not specially provided for by this chapter or by any other statute of the Province the House of Assembly and the Committees and members thereof respectively shall at any time hold, enjoy and exercise such and the like privileges, immunities and powers as shall for the time being be held, enjoyed and exercised by the House of Commons of Canada and by the respective Committees and members thereof, and such privileges, immunities and powers shall be deemed to be and shall be part of the general and public law of Nova Scotia and * * * be taken notice of judicially. Now the powers, privileges and immunities of the House of Commons in Canada are practically the same as those of the House of Commons in Great Britain, although the distribution of the different powers of maintaining order and decorum may be relegated to different officials from those in England. Mr. May in the Parliamentary Practice, 10th ed. 199, while defining the duties of the Sergeant-at-Arms, says they are inter alia the maintenance \"of order in the lobby and passages of the House,\" and at page 190\nupon information that a man had assaulted a member in the lobby? the Speaker directed the sergeant to take the offender into custody.\nIn the note to page 332 he says:\nThe area within the walls of the Palace of Westminster compose the Parliamentary precincts.\nApplying these general principles and rules to the case before us I cannot have any doubt that it was the duty of the trial judge to have charged the jury that the Speaker was within his rights when, after having had an opportunity of forming a judgment upon the manner in which the plaintiff conducted herself on the occasion of the alleged assault in the smoking-room of the House in 1902, and with his knowledge of her previous history in offending against the order and decorum of the Assembly, over which he presides, he ordered the officials to remove her beyond the precincts of the House. That it did not matter whether the person to whom he instructed the carrying out of his orders was the Sergeant-at-Arms, the chief messenger or an ordinary messenger or doorkeeper. That the question whether the Speaker acted maliciously or capriciously in giving his order might perhaps in some cases be raised, but that in this case there was no evidence on which they could find either malice or caprice. That the precincts of the House embraced as well the smoking-room and the corridor and staircase leading to it and the Assembly Room as the latter room itself, and that the powers of the officials of the House could be exercised as well for the preservation of order in the adjournments between the sessions as during the sessions, in all cases of course the question of bona fides being pre-supposed but being open to adjudication, and, lastly, that the question whether the officer had been guilty of excess in discharging his orders was one peculiarly for them to decide.\nI do not think that if the jury had been properly charged upon these points they could under the evidence have found for the plaintiff. I have not deemed it necessary to call attention again to the several authorities collected and reviewed by Mr. Justice Graham in his judgment. I think they fully sustain the position he took that the liberty of access which the public has to attend the proceedings of the House of Assembly and its Committees and to visit the precincts and rooms of the House is not a right but a license or privilege capable of being revoked, and when properly revoked as to any one leaving him or her a trespasser and liable to expulsion as such. I fully agree alike with his reasoning and his conclusion but being of opinion that directing a judgment to be entered for the defendant would be inconsistent with what must have been the necessary findings of the jury in reaching their general verdict I think the appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the court appealed from and a new trial granted, the costs of the first trial to abide the event.\nNESBITT J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.\nKILLAM J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted. I concur in the reasoning of Mr. Justice Graham as to the plaintiff having no legal right to enter and remain with the precincts of the Legislature. Prim\u00e2 facie she would be there by license only. The evidence establishes clearly that the place in which the alleged assault took place was within those precincts and that the acts complained of were done in removing the plaintiff therefrom.\nWhile not prepared to say that in no case would a member or messenger of the House of Assembly have authority, mero motu, to remove an intruder behaving in a disorderly manner or so as to endanger the peace or safety of the members or officers of the Assembly, I prefer to base my conclusion, in this instance, upon the ground taken by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia. I think that the speaker, though not in the chair, had the implied authority to direct the removal of any person not having an absolute right to insist on being within the precincts, whose conduct appeared to him to be a disturbance of the peace, order or comfort of those having such a right. And I think that this authority was sufficiently pleaded.\nAs, however, there was some evidence of unnecessary violence, there was a case to go to a jury under proper direction, and the action could not properly have been dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nThe appellant in person.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

B. Rep. 229) that the private property of the testator as well as the ecclesiastical property vested in him as Bishop was devised by this clause and the fact that there were specific devises of personal property for other purposes did not alter its construction. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] affirming the decree of the Judge in Equity in favour of the defendants.\nThe only question to be decided in this case was the construction of the clause set out in the head-note of the will of the late Eight Reverend Bishop Sweeny, of St, John, N.B. The plaintiffs filed a bill in Equity for a decree that the Bishop died intestate as to the real and personal property which he owned in his private capacity, the plaintiff, Catherine Travers, claiming the same as his next of kin. The Judge in Equity decided that there was no intestacy and his judgment was affirmed by the full court. The plaintiffs then took an appeal to this court.\nPugsley K.C. and Quigley K.C. for the appellants. This will was prepared by the testator himself but the construction must be the same as if it had been written by a lawyer. Thellusson v. Rendlesham[2].\nThe surrounding circumstances must be taken into consideration in construing it. Webber v. Stanley[3].\n(The learned counsel then referred to the evidence and admissions of the respondent shewing that the testator was possessed in his private capacity of family property and of real estate that was conveyed to him for ecclesiastical purposes.)\nThese admissions and the evidence referred to shew that the title to property intended for church purposes was vested in the testator as an individual and it was such property he had in mind when he wrote the clause containing the general devise. He says in that clause that all church property should be vested in the Bishop in trust for church purposes and he bequeaths all his property to the church in trust for such purposes. He thus identifies the property conveyed to the individual but which should have been conyeyed to the ecclesiastical corporation. See the rule of interpretation laid down by Lord Westbury in Parker v. Tootal[4], and Lord Selborne's rule in Hardwick v. Hardwick[5].\nThe fact that the testator may have died intestate as to the portion of his property claimed by the appellants cannot be invoked against the construction called for by the language of the will and surrounding circumstances. Webber v. Stanley[6] approved in Smith v. Ridgway[7]; Pedley v. Dodds[8]; Slingsby v. Grainger[9].\nThe heir at law cannot be disinherited except by clear and unambiguous language. Ferguson v. Ferguson[10]; Hall v. Warren[11].\nStockton K.C. and Barry K.C. for the respondents. The disputes between the Bishop and his sister were disposed of by the reciprocal deeds of partition, the payment of $2,000 to Mrs. Travers, the appellant, and the releases from the appellants to Bishop Sweeny in 1894. The release is to the Bishop as an individual; as administrator of his father's estate; as a trustee of that estate, if such relationship existed, and also as Bishop of Saint John. These transactions took place in 1894. The appellant, Mrs. Travers, had her share of her father's estate and the Bishop had his. Each could do with her or his share as it seemed to them best. The property then ceased to be property belonging to any estate. Shortly after that, in April, 1895, the Bishop made the will in controversy in this suit. Is it reasonable to suppose he meant not his own estate, his individual property, but property belonging to the church? He was not making a will as Bishop of Saint John; he could not will church property if he had so desired. All such property by operation of law was continued to his successor in the office of Bishop.\nThe court must avoid, if possible, giving any effect to the argument that the Bishop intended to die intestate, as to his individual property, and that the true construction of the clause quoted must be confined to church property, because he happened at the time of his death to hold two or three unimportant pieces of church property in his individual name. We must construe the will and ascertain its meaning and intent from the language used. The proper interpretation of the language will give his intention.\nThe rule of construction, applicable to all wills, is well settled and must dispose of this appeal as laid down by Lord Wensleydale in Grey v. Pearson[12]. The ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency. A long list of cases from that time to the present have followed that rule, the latest of which is Inderwick v. Tatchell[13]. Practically the same rule is laid down in Roddy v. Fitzgerald[14]; and Abbott v. Middleton[15]. The courts, if possible, should so construe wills as to avoid an intestacy: Edgeworth v. Edgeworth[16], per Lord Hatherly, at p. 40; In re Redfern, Redfern v. Bryning[17]; In re Harrison[18], per Esher M.R.\nThe reason assigned by the testator for giving all his property to his successor, even if incorrect, cannot control a bequest actually made or power given. Cole v. Wade[19]; Holliday v. Overton[20]; Williams v. Pinckney[21]; Jarman's 12th rule, vol. 2, (5 ed.) 841; Ex parte Dawes[22], per Esher M.R.\nAs to the doctrine of ejusdem generis, limiting the operative words of the will by the preceding words, the will can only apply to the testator's individual property, he could not will property not his own, and the courts will disregard the doctrine when the effect of regarding it would be to cause a partial intestacy See Underhill and Strahan on Interpretation of Wills, p. 21; Parker v. Marchant[23]; Anderson v. Anderson[24], per Esher M.R. If he intended his individual property to go to his heirs-at-law, why did he not, by apt and plain words, say so? In this case the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words used is large enough and sufficiently explicit to devise and transfer all the testator's estate to his successor in office. Any other construction would be straining the language from its ordinary meaning and cause an intestacy, which the courts, if possible, must avoid. The following cases also support the contentions of the respondents, viz.: Hodgson v. Jex[25]; Shore v. Wilson[26]; Scale v. Rawlins[27]; Thellusson v. Rendlesham[28]; Lowther v. Benlinck[29]; Leader v. Duffey[30]; Jones v. Curry[31].\nThe respondents also adopt the authorities and reasons given in the judgments in the courts below, and from these authorities and reasons, and the authorities cited herein, contend that the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick should be affirmed, and the appeal dismissed, and with costs. THE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014I have had communication of my brother Davies's opinion and I agree in his reasoning and conclusion I shared at one time in his doubts, and I cannot say that I am yet thoroughly satisfied that the testator intended to bequeath his private property to the Church. But though the case on the part of the appellant was as forcibly and ably argued by Dr. Quigley as it could possibly have been, yet he failed to convince me that the judgment appealed from is clearly wrong. The testator would have given nothing to the Church if his will is to be construed as bequeathing only what really belonged to it, and the devise of all his estate real and personal would be a devise of none of his estate at all.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The question for determination in this case is the true construction of the general devise or bequest in the will of the Right Reverend John Sweeney, late Roman Catholic Bishop of St. John, N.B. The clause reads as follows:\nAlthough all the church and ecclesiastical and charitable properties in the Diocese are and should be vested in the Roman Catholic Bishop of St. John, New Brunswick, for the benefit of religion, education, and charity, in trust, according to the intentions and purposes for which they were acquired and established, yet to meet any want or mistake, I give and devise and bequeath all my estate, real and personal, wherever situated, to the Roman Catholic Bishop of Saint John, New Brunswick, in trust for the purposes and intentions for which they are used and established.\nThe will was written by the Right Reverend gentleman himself, and it was admitted in the answer to the bill filed praying for a declaration as to the meaning of the will that, at the time it was written and also when the testator died, several parcels of real estate which should have been vested in the Bishop in his corporate name in trust for the Roman Catholic Church for the benefit of religion, education and charity\nstood on the records in the name of Bishop Sweeney personally.\nI concur in the conclusion reached by the Equity judge, Mr. Justice Barker, who heard the cause, that there has been no intestacy and that everything the Bishop owned or possessed at his death, and which was not otherwise specifically devised in his will, passed under this clause to the Roman Catholic Bishop of St. John. I agree in general with the reasons for his judgment given by that learned judge, but as I entertained for a time grave doubts arising out of the ambiguous language used at the close of the clause quoted above, I thing it desirable to add a few words. The judgment of the Equity Court was confirmed on appeal by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and this appeal is taken from the latter judgment.\nIn the able and exhaustive argument addressed to us by Dr. Quigley, for the appellant, much stress was laid upon the opening words of the disputed devise\nalthough all the church and ecclesiastical and charitable properties etc. etc., yet to meet any want or mistake.\nIt was said that these words had reference to two subject matters only; 1st, to the real estate, admittedly standing in the Bishop's personal name and which should have stood in his corporate name; and, secondly, to certain personal property and effects used by the Bishop in and about the services of his cathedral but admittedly not his private property; and it was argued that the words were intended to rectify the \"want or mistake\" referred to in the clause and afforded a key to and controlled the meaning of the general words which followed. I cannot accede to this argument. The utmost that can be said for the language used is that it expressed, in a more or less ambiguous way, reasons or motives which influenced the testator in making the general disposition of his property which followed. Standing alone however the words could not be fairly construed as limiting to church properties only the generality of the succeeding devise. My difficulties and doubts arose not out of the introductory words of the devise but of those at its close, namely,\nin trust for the purposes and intentions for which they are used and established.\nWere these descriptive of the property devised or only a limitation upon the user of that property? What did \"they\" refer to? The word could not, says the appellant, refer to his own private estate whether real or persona], for the language is quite inapplicable to such properties, and being inapplicable the conclusion must be that he was dealing only with the church properties standing in his name or used by him in the services of the church and to which the words were applicable. But reflection has convinced me that however inapt the language of the sentence may be the meaning is sufficiently plain and that the words are not descriptive of the property intended to be devised but are simply a limitation upon the user of that property, or, in other words, a trust. The word \"they\" in my judgment, refers to the \"church, ecclesiastical and charitable properties in the diocese\" which in the beginning of the sentence he had declared are and should be vested in the Roman Catholic Bishop of St. John, N.B., for the benefit of religion, education and charity. He desired to devise as well the church properties standing in his personal name as also his own private properties to his successor and intended to impress upon them all the trusts for religion, education and charity, upon which as he had declared in the opening part of the sentence, the Bishop should hold all the church and ecclesiastical and charitable properties. Difficulties may possibly arise in determining to which of the particular trusts the private property of the Bishop embraced in the general devising words should be subject, whether for the benefit of religion or education or charity, and in what proportion for each. But that his intention was to devise and bequeath all he owned or possessed at his death to his successor in the Bishopric, and to and for the benefit of the Roman Catholic religion, education and charity within the diocese, I am satisfied. I think that intention sufficiently well expressed and if the language does not leave a legal discretion sufficiently broad to the devisee, then, any difficulties arising out of the trusts must be disposed of as and when they arise on a proper application to the courts. No such difficulties are before us for determination now and once it is held that the words are not words descriptive of the property devised and bequeathed but are simply expressive of a trust we need go no further.\nIt was argued that the specific bequests of the coupon bonds held by the testator to the Roman Catholic Bishop of St. John, for the special purposes mentioned in the will, shewed that the general words of the disputed clause did not include all of his personal estate and that the further bequests of $500 to have masses\nsaid for the benefit of his soul and the souls of his departed relatives and $100 to one of his executors\nin token of good will and on account of trouble he may have in the execution of the will\nconfirmed that view. The argument is a legitimate one to advance. But the fact that the bequests of the coupon bonds was made for certain special trusts and purposes set out in the will, shows that the testator's intention was that these special bonds whatever their amount (about which there was much dispute but no evidence) should be applied only for the particular objects specified by him and not generally\nfor the benefit of religion, education and charity in connection with the Roman Catholic Church in his diocese.\nHe \"earmarked\" them accordingly. There is more weight in the argument arising out of the other two small bequests but looking at the purposes for which they were made and the trivial amount of the bequests I do not think they should be considered as in any way altering the construction which otherwise should be given to the words of the general devise.\nMuch learning and ingenuity were expended by counsel in suggestions as to what, having regard to the evidence, the deceased Bishop may or must have intended. In the view, however, I take as to the meaning of the disputed clause, all such speculations are of no assistance. The distinguished prelate must be taken to have meant what he said in his will, and that meaning is the one, in my opinion, decreed by the Court of Equity and confirmed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nI think the doubts and difficulties necessarily arising from the use of language somewhat doubtful and ambiguous in the will, and the great gain which must follow from an authoritative decision of the highest Court of Appeal in Canada as to the meaning of these words, fully justified the appeal being taken and that the costs should be paid out of the estate.\nNESBITT and KILLAM JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William Pugsley.\nSolicitor for the respondents: John L.

The logs being in custody of a boom company, orders were given to deliver them as agreed. e., a dealer in lumber, telephoned the owner asking if he had them for sale and was answered \"No, i have sold them to McK.\" e. then purchased a portion of them from McK. who did not pay the owner therefor and he brought an action of trover against E.\nHeld, affirming the judgment under appeal (36 N. B. Rep. 169) Nesbitt and Killam JJ. dissenting, that the owner having induced e. to believe that he could safely purchase from McK. could not afterwards deny the authority of the latter to sell.\nHeld per Nesbitt and Killam JJ. that as there was no evidence that the owner knew the indentity of the person making the inquiry by telephone, and nothing was said by the latter to indicate that he would not make further inquiry as to McK.'s authority to sell there was no estoppel.\nHeld per Taschereau C.J. that as the owner had given McK. an apparent authority to sell, and knew that he had agreed to buy for that purpose a sale by him to a bond fide purchaser was valid.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs. The facts of the case are stated by Mr. Justice Barker in his judgment on the motion before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick as follows:\n\"This case was tried before Mr. Justice Landry without a jury and a verdict entered in favour of the plaintiff, for $2766.63. This is an action of trover brought to recover the value of a quantity of logs sold and delivered by one McKendrick to the defendant, and of which the plaintiff claimed to be the owner. It appears that, in the autumn of 1899, the bank made certain advances to one George W. Upham to enable him to carry on his lumbering operations during the following winter. Upham got out a quantity of logs which in pursuance of an agreement made by Upham with the bank, when obtaining the advances, were hypothecated to the bank under section 74 of the Bank Act. This hypothecating is dated April 20th, 1900, and it assigns to the bank as a security for their advances, which amounted in all to some $18,000, upwards of three millions of spruce logs free of all lien except stumpage which logs were to be driven by Upham to the Fredericton Boom in that spring. There were some further advances made later on but that fact is not important in this ease. By a memo on the hypothecation agreement, Upham authorized the bank to sell the logs to any corporation, person or persons, either at private sale or public auction as to the bank might seem meet. The logs were driven into the boom as agreed and the bank, acting under the authority of the Bank Act and Upham's consent, on the sixteenth day of July, 1900, entered into an agreement of sale of all these logs with McKendrick, who was a lumber manufacturer residing at Fredericton and is so described in the agreement. By the terms of this sale the bank agreed to sell and deliver all these Upham logs to McKendrick for the sum of $8.60 per M. sup. feet, delivered through the boom and at the boom scale. McKendrick, on his part, agreed to purchase at this price and to pay for the logs as they were delivered. The property in the logs was to remain in the bank until the same were paid for, and the contract only extended to and covered such of the logs as might pass through the Fredericton Boom.\n\"On the 18th day of July, 1900, the bank sent to the boom company a written order as follows: 'Please deliver to C. F. McKendrick all the George W. Upham logs passing through your boom during the season of 1901.' A similar notice was given by the bank to Sewell, who has charge of the delivery of logs after they have been rafted in the boom, to the various owners. Acting under these instructions the boom company and Sewell delivered these Upham logs to McKendrick. For many years previous to this time McKendrick had been in the business of buying, selling and manufacturing lumber and, when this sale was made, he was operating two mills in the vicinity of Fredericton, all of which the bank seemed to be fully aware of. All of these logs were disposed of by McKendrick but, out of the proceeds, he only paid to the bank $10,000. The logs in question in this suit are a portion of the Upham logs which the defendant bought from McKendrick, and paid for. The purchase was made in August, 1900, but, before making it, the defendant communicated with Mr. White, the bank's manager at Woodstock, who had the entire management of this whole matter, both with Upham and McKendrick. The defendant says that some three months before he purchased, he, by telephone, asked Mr. White if he had the Upham logs for sale and he replied 'No, he had sold them to McKendrick.' The defendant says that having received this answer from Mr. White he purchased from Mr. McKendrick. Mr. White does not deny this conversation though he says he does not recollect it. The defendant had been engaged in the lumber business all his life and was thoroughly conversant with the method of getting lumber to. the booms, its rafting there and its delivery to the owners afterwards. He heard nothing of the bank having any claim on this lumber until some eighteen months after he had purchased, when they made a demand upon him for it.\"\nThe action was tried by Mr. Justice Landry without a jury and resulted in judgment for the plaintiffs for the value of the logs purchased by defendant from McKendrick. A motion to the full court to have the judgment set aside and judgment entered for defendant or a new trial granted was successful and a judgment was entered for defendant.\nConnell K.C. and Carvell for the appellants. No property passed to McKendrick until the logs were paid for. Ex parte Crawcour[2]; Farguharson Bros. & Co. v. King[3]; Forristal v. McDonald[4]; 6 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law 2 Ed. pp. 440-1, 453\nWhite did not wilfully mislead defendant even assuming, of which there is no evidence, that he knew it was defendant who made the inquiry by telephone; there can, therefore, be no estoppel. Pickard v. Sears[5]; Freeman v. Cooke[6]; Bell v. Marsh[7]; Carr v. London & North Western Railway Co.[8]; Andrews v. Lyons[9]; 11 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law 2 Ed. p. 431.\nPugsley K. C. and Gregory K. C. for the respondent. The bank having delivered the logs to McKendrick without exacting payment in advance must be held to have waived their right especially as they subsequently shewed a willingness to accept payment from time to time as sales were made.

Gummings[13].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts of this case appear at full length in the opinions delivered by the learned judges of the court a quo, now reported at page 169, volume 36, New Brunswick Reports.\nEither upon the ground taken by the Chief Justice of New Brunswick, that McKendrick had full authority to sell under the circumstances of the case, or, if he had not, upon the ground taken by the other judges that the bank is estopped from now invoking his want of authority, the bank's action must, in my opinion, fail, and this appeal be dismissed. The dealings by the bank were such as to clothe McKendrick with an apparent authority to sell and convey a good title to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser, subject to the condition that the purchaser, or McKendrick himself, should pay to the bank whatever amount of the price of sale was sufficient to satisfy its advances, the bank relying upon McKendrick for the fulfilment of that condition. They knew that he bought to resell. And White's answer that he had not the logs for sale, because he had sold them to McKendrick, or in other words, because McKendrick had bought them, completes the evidence that McKendrick had full authority to sell. When the bank put McKendrick in possession for the very purpose that he should resell, surely they cannot say that he had no power to sell to Estey. But, assuming that McKendrick had not that power, the bank is estopped from now availing itself of it. The bank would now claim the benefit of a suppressio veri by its manager, White, that would have misled any reasonable man, as it misled Estey, McKendrick, the bank's debtor, is insolvent and, if the bank could recover against Estey, it would be only because he was not justified in believing that when White said that he had sold to McKendrick, he, White, gave him to understand that McKendrick had bought the whole interest.\nNow, in common parlance, for any one to say that he has sold his property, without adding a word more, means that he has parted with all his interest in it. The unfairness of mental reservations in the transactions of ordinary business is so apparent that the courts do not view them with favour.\nThis case is one, I might say, of res ipsa loquitur. Estey was undoubtedly, in fact, misled by White. There is no room for questioning his good faith in purchasing from and paying McKendrick. It is by wilfully not telling him the whole truth that White induced him to buy from McKendrick. White, it is true, was not obliged to speak at all, but, when he did speak, he had no right to mislead Estey by telling him what would reasonably induce any intending purchaser to believe that if he wanted to buy he had to go to McKendrick. The question put by Estey to White was one that he, White, must necessarily, under the circumstances, as a fair inference of fact, have known to be from an intending purchaser, whoever he was. The maxim memo plus juris transferre potest quam se ipse habet, has no application where the owner of goods has so lent himself to accredit the title to another person.\nIn fact, I am strongly inclined to think that White, in answering Estey as he did, was prompted by his desire to get, in the interest of the bank, a purchaser for these logs, expecting the bank's advances to be repaid out of the price of sale and trusting McKendrick for it. Now that McKendrick has abused the confidence White reposed in him, the bank would have their loss fall upon Estey and make him pay a second time the large amount he, bon\u00e2 fide, paid to McKendrick. Their contention, to my mind, is untenable.\nGIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought by the plaintiff bank against Estey to recover from him the value of a quantity of lumber or logs purchased by the latter from one McKendrick some two years before the action was brought. Judgment had been entered by the trial judge in plaintiff's favour for $2,766.63, being the value of the logs, and this judgment, on appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, was reversed and judgment entered for the defendant. From the latter judgment the plaintiff bank appeals to this court.\nOn some of the important questions involved in the case the evidence is regrettably meagre, the parties at the trial having assumed much which does not distinctly appear upon the record. The facts however which, in my opinion, are sufficiently proved, and, if proved, determine the issues in defendant's favour, are as follows:\nThe bank, which was carrying on business in New Brunswick and had an agency at Woodstock managed by Mr. George White, became through its business operations the owner of a quantity of logs known as the Upham logs, on the St. John river. The defendant Estey was and had been for a great many years a lumberman carrying on business on the said river buying and selling logs and sawing the same into deals and boards, etc. One McKendrick to whom the bank sold the logs (conditionally) was also a lumberman on the St. John River, residing at Fredericton, and engaged before and at the time he bought the logs from the bank in dealing and trading in lumber and logs, and known to the bank manager to be engaged, as stated by him in his evidence,\"in buying and selling lumber\" and had a very short time before leased a small saw mill from the bank, on the bank of the river. At the time of the sale by the bank to McKendrick, nothing was said one way or the other as to the use he should put the logs to, whether saw them up or sell them. A day or two after the sale of the logs, White, the bank manager, sent the boom company, in whose custody the logs were, a written order to deliver to McKendrick\nall the Upham logs passing through your boom during the season of 1900\nand also sent a similar order to one Sewell, who had charge of the delivery of the logs to their various owners after they had been rafted in the boom. One of the conditions contained in the contract of sale between the bank and McKendrick was as follows:\nThe property in the said logs to remain in the Peoples Bank of Halifax until the same be paid for.\nShortly after the sale to McKendrick was made, Estey, who resided at Fredericton, on the St. John river, telephoned to White, the bank manager at Woodstock, with respect to these logs. The evidence with respect to this vital conversation is exceedingly meagre. White has no recollection of it at all and Estey's version of it is as follows:\nQ. Before purchasing from Mr. McKendrick did you have any communication with Mr. White in respect of these logs?\u2014A. I did. Q. Will you state what the nature of that communication was?\u2014A. It was over the telephone. I asked Mr. White if he had the Upham logs for sale, and he said, No, he had sold them to Mr. McKendrick.\nQ. That is Mr. White, the Manager of the People's Bank at Woodstock?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That was before you bought from Mr. McKendrick?\u2014A. Oh yes, sometime before.\nQ. Approximately how long before?\u2014A. I would think no less than three weeks before.\nQ. Having received this answer from Mr. White did you then purchase the logs from Mr. McKendrick?\u2014A., I did.\nA question was incidentally raised during the argument on the absence of any direct and positive evidence that it was White who was at the other end of the telephone when Estey asked the question. But I think, as no such doubt was raised at the trial when it could have been at once either confirmed or removed, or in the court below, and as all the arguments had treated the conversation as having taken place between the real parties, White and Estey, who were known to each other, that weight should not now be attached to the question raised. I think the only fair and legitimate inference to be drawn from the evidence of Estey, above quoted, and from his cross-examination on the conversation, is that both parties knew to whom they were speaking.\nAt the time Estey purchased the logs in question from McKendrick, he gave him his acceptance for the purchase money, $3,000, which on maturity was duly paid- He was an innocent purchaser for value and did not learn until long after payment that the bank had any claim to the logs. The bank had given its orders to the boom master, and Sewell, the tug master, to deliver possession of the logs to McKendrick who was able to satisfy his purchaser, Estey, on that point. It seems to me therefore that the legal question is reduced to the construction which, under the circumstances of the case, and bearing in mind the nature and character of the business carried on by the several parties concerned, and the relations in which they respectively stood to each other, ought to be put upon the telephone conversation. When Estey asked White, the bank manager, the question whether he had the Upham logs for sale the latter knew he was being asked it by a man who was and had been for years engaged in the lumber business in buying and selling logs and other lumber on the St. John River. It was not therefore to be assumed to be a question asked from mere idle curiosity but a business question asked by a business man for business purposes; and it seems to have been answered in the same spirit by Mr. White, who not only gave a categorical answer that he had not the logs for sale but went further and volunteered the information that he had sold them to McKendrick. Now here is a bank dealing with two lumber merchants, both buyers and sellers of logs and other lumber, and known to its Manager as such. The latter tells one of these merchants, who asks whether he has certain logs for sale, that he has not, that he has already sold them to the other merchant. He was not asked to whom, he had sold them. He volunteered that information. What reasonable conclusion ought Estey to have reached on receiving that answer? Certainly, in my opinion, the one that McKendrick was the real as well as the apparent vendee possessing the ordinary power of sale which attaches to an ordinary purchaser. It seems to me that having volunteered to give Estey, a probable purchaser, the information he did, White was bound if he intended to act upon his strict rights to have warned Estey of the secret reservation of property in the bank. When he told him he had sold to McKendrick he only told part of the truth He must be taken to have known what construction a reasonable business man, trading in lumber, would put upon such an answer, and impliedly at the very least to have held out McKendrick as a purchaser with power to resell. If the latter had not been a buyer and seller of lumber; if he was merely a mill owner engaged in sawing logs into deals and boards, such an implication would not necessarily perhaps arise. But considering McKendrick's known business I cannot doubt that such an answer, followed by the orders to the boom master to give him possession of the logs, amply justified the implication by Estey that McKendrick had the property in as well as the possession of the logs.\nI do not think any difference of opinion exists as to the law governing the case although there are differences as to its application to the admitted facts and the legal inferences to be drawn from them.\nIn The London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[14], Lord Herschell says:\nThe general rule of the law is that where a person has obtained the property of another, from one who is dealing with it without the authority of the true owner, no title is acquired as against that owner, even though full value be given and the property be taken in the belief that an unquestionable title thereto is being obtained, unless the person taking it can shew that the true owner his so acted as to mislead him into the belief that the person dealing with the property had authority to do so. If this can be shewn a good title is acquired by personal estoppel against the true owner.\nThis is after all only an elaboration of the doctrine laid down by Ashhurst J. in the well known case of Lickbanow v. Mason[15], where he says:\nWe may lay it down as a broad general principle that wherever one of two innocent persons must suffer by the acts of a third he who enables such third person to occasion the loss must sustain it.\nAnd see 6 Am. & Eng. Enc, p. 482. In Henderson & Co. v. Williams[16], the present Lord Chancellor, Halsbury, adopts the language of Savage C. J. in Root v. French[17], who in speaking of a bona fide purchaser who has purchased property from a fraudulent vendee and given value for it, says:\nHe is protected in doing so upon the principle just stated that when one of two innocent persons must suffer from the fraud of a third he shall suffer who by his indiscretion has enabled such third person to commit the fraud. A contrary principle would endanger the security of commercial transactions and destroy that confidence upon which what is called the usual course of trade materially rests.\nIn the later case of Farquharson Bros. & Co. v. King & Co.[18], the same learned chancellor reaffirms his adherence to the proposition of law as formulated above by Chief Justice Savage, and remarks on page 332, in reply to those who challenge the accuracy of the language used:\nThese words \"who by his indiscretion\" appear not to have made much impression upon those who were commenting upon this matter;\nand later on\nof course it depends on the sense in which you are to understand the word \"enabled,\"\nand then he goes on to illustrate the difference between the conduct and language of one who acts and speaks towards those to whom he owes a duty and towards others to whom he owes none.\nWith the greatest possible deference to those of my brethren who take a contrary view from that which I have stated, I have gone over the evidence most carefully and have reached the conclusion tersely expressed by Mr. Justice Barker in his judgment in the court below\nthat it would be little less than a fraud to permit the plaintiff to set up a title to the property purchased superior to that of the defendant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nSince writing the foregoing, I have had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by my Brother Nesbitt and I am glad to find that we agree as to the law and differ only as to our appreciation of the facts, and the legal inferences which should be drawn from the evidence.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting)\u2014The plaintiffs had made advances to one Upham and obtained security under section 74 of the Bank Act on a quantity of logs stored in a boom at Fredericton, N.B.\nSubsequently Upham released all his interest in the logs to the bank and it became known that the bank had for sale the Upham logs. One McKendrick, on the 16th July, 1900, became the purchaser of these logs under an agreement in the following language:\nMEMORANDUM OF CONTRACT made this 16th day of July, A.D. 1900, between the People's Bank of Halifax, of the one part, and Cyrus P. McKendrick, of the City of Fredericton, Lumber Manufacturer, of the other part.\nThe said People's Bank of Halifax, having the right to sell hereby contracts and agrees with the said Cyrus F. McKendrick to sell and deliver to him in the Fredericton Boom, all the logs cut, gotten or purchased by George W. Upham, during the logging season of 18991900, which logs are now chiefly in the limits of the Fredericton Boom and the balance are in the course of transit and bear the several marks following:\u2014XUX, MXU, GGU, 'U'; this sale to include all of the said George W. Upham's logs whatever marks the same may bear, and all logs marked with any of the marks rendered, entered or recorded with the said Fredericton Boom Co. by the said George W. Upham for the season of A.D. 1900, at and for the sum of eight dollars and sixty cents per thousand superficial feet, delivered through the boom, boomage paid, regardless of size of logs, boom scale to be accepted. And the said Cyrus F. McKendrick hereby purchases from the said People's Bank of Halifax all the said logs hereinbefore mentioned to be delivered at the said Fredericton Boom at the price aforesaid of eight dollars and sixty cents per thousand superficial feet, and agrees to pay therefor as the same may be delivered.\nThe property in the said logs to remain in the People's Bank of Halifax until the same be paid for, and this contract only to extend to and cover such of the said Upham logs as may pass through the said boom.\n(Signed,) PEOPLE'S BANK OF HALIFAX,\nBy G. A. White, Manager,\nWoodstock, N.B.\n(Signed.) C. F. McKendrick.\nMcKendrick at the same time leased from the bank a mill which Upham had been using intending apparently to manufacture the logs into sawn lumber. McKendrick also had another mill where he was manufacturing lumber. On the 18th July, 1900, the manager of the bank at Woodstock gave an order to the Fredericton Boom Co. as follows:\nWoodstock Agency, July 18th, 1900.\nThe Fredericton Boom Co., Fredericton.\nPlease deliver to C. F. McKendrick all of the Geo. W. Upham logs passing through your booms during the season of 1900.\n(Signed,) PEOPLE'S BANK OF HALIFAX,\nBy G. A. White, Manager,\nWoodstock.\nAnd on the 13th of August McKendrick gave the bank a cheque for $10,000 and the bank gave him a release of 1,162,790 feet in the words and figures following:\nWoolstock, N.B., August 13th, 1900.\nReceived from C. F. McKendrick the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in full payment for one million one hundred and sixty-two thousand seven hundred and ninety superficial feet of logs delivered to him under the contract of sale of the Geo. W. Upham logs to him by the People's Bank of Halifax, which said number of feet of unsawed logs are hereby released to him and become his property, the first one million one hundred and sixty-two thousand seven hundred and ninety superficial feet of unsawed logs sawn by the said McKendrick to be considered as the logs hereby released.\n(Signed,) PEOPLE'S BANK OF HALIFAX,\nG. A. White, Manager.\nMr. McKendrick was asked:\nQ. You admitted and recognized to Mr. White that you could not sell these logs without his release, didn't you?\u2014A. Well, I asked for a release, yes. On the 9th August, Mr. Estey, defendant, purchased from McKendrick 321,702 feet of logs and apparently about the time that the Upham logs were for sale by the bank Mr. Estey says:\nQ. Before purchasing from Mr. McKendrick did you have any communication with Mr. White in respect of these logs !\u2014A. I did.\nQ. Will you state what the nature of that communication was?\u2014\nA. It was over the telephone. I asked Mr. White if he had the Upham logs for sale, and he said no, he had sold them to Mr. McKendrick.\nQ. That is Mr. White, Manager of the People's Bank at Woodstock?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That was before you bought from McKendrick?\u2014A. Oh yes, sometime before.\nQ. Approximately how long before?\u2014A. I would think not less than three weeks before.\nQ. Having received this answer from Mr. White did you then purchase the logs from Mr. McKendrick?\u2014A. I did.\nAnd Mr. White in his examination says:\nQ. Did you also inform Mr. Estey by telephone to the same effect that the logs were sold to McKendrick?\u2014A. I don't remember.\nQ. You have no recollection one way or the other upon the subject?\u2014A. My impression is that I did not, because I don't remember him telephoning me about it.\nQ. What you say is that your mind is a blank upon the subject of his telephoning you at all?\u2014A. Yes; I have no recollection.\nQ. Therefore if we are able to prove that he did telephone you what you say is you do not remember?\u2014A. If you prove he did, it must be so; but I have no recollection of it.\nQ. But if it so your memory might be at fault?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe respondent referred particularly to a letter of the 22nd September, 1900.\nWoodstock, N.B., Sept. 22nd, 1900.\nC. F. McKendrick, Esq,\nFredercton.\nDear Sir\u2014Yours of 21st received, and contents noted.\nIt would appear from your letter that you consider the matter of payment to us of very secondary importance. I do not view it in that light. If you have not disposed of more deals than we released we may see our way clear not to demand payment before the 30th inst. Please let me know by return mail the quantity sold and also the amount you will agree to pay to us on September 30th.\nYours truly,\n(Signed,) Q. A. WHITE,\nManager.\nAnd a further letter of September 29th:\nWoodstock, N.B., Sept. 29th, 1900.\nC. F. McKendrick, Esq.,\nFredericton.\nDear Sir,\u2014You have again failed to make payment on Upham logs as agreed. You must make payment not later than the 3rd. I regret exceedingly having sold the logs to you. It seems very strange that you would buy that quantity of logs and agree to pay' cash as delivered without having any idea where the money was coming from to pay with.\nAs I have to go out of town on the 4th or 5th for several days I must have payment made before that time.\nYours truly,\n(Signed,) G. A. WHITE,\nManager.\nAnd on November 16th:\nWoodstock, N.B., November 16th, 1900.\nC. F. McKendrick, Esq.,\nFredericton.\nDear Sir,\u2014After seeing Mr. Richey of the B. of M. yesterday afternoon, I did not have time to see you before taking the train.\nAs you have doubtless been informed we decided to let matters stand until such time as you are able to get around and prepare a full statement of your affairs, and that in the meantime if the deals, boards and scantlings can be loaded and sent to St. John and there held, to have that done.\nWhat few logs are left, if you cannot get them sawed I hope you will be able to place them where they will not be lost in the spring. I forgot to get from you the name of owner of woodboat that took deals to St. John, who deals were intended for, and where they likely are at the present time. Please let me know.\nI trust that you are continuing to improve and that when you get around matters will be so arranged that you will be able to continue your business. I am informed that Dibbles cannot do anything until the 4th December, and as I understand it the B. of M. have no right to dispose of the mill at the present time.\nYours truly,\n(Signed,) G. A. WHITE,\nManager. And on November 20th:\nWoodstock, N.B., November 20th, 1900.\nC. F. McKendrick, Esq.,\nFredericton.\nDear Sir,\u2014I am in receipt of yours of the 19th inst., and note contents. I trust you may continue to improve.\nI have just received a telegram from Ruddick which reads as follows: \"Cushing stole from wharf scow J. S. G. 4 States Bank of Montreal owns deals. McKean replevins deals for advances made on same to McKendrick October 9th.\" You will understand the deals replevined by McKeans are not the same as referred to in re Cushing.\nI may go to St. John to-night and if so will be at the Victoria to-morrow. In reference to the deals claimed by McKean I would like if possible to get the name of scows, date of shipment, etc., and when these deals were sawed.\nYou will understand that if these scows were loaded out of the first 1,162 M. that you sawed out of the Upham logs we cannot hold them. If they were not we can.\nWill you try and be ready to give me the information to-morrow in case I should ask you for it to-morrow from St. John. If I do not please write me to-morrow afternoon, so that I will get it next day. If I go to St. John will send you a p. c. If I do not and you have any important information write me at Victoria.\nYours truly,\n(Signed,) G. A. WHITE,\nManager.\nMr. White in examination of these letters says:\nQ. You were willing to wait until he did dispose of the deals so as to pay you?\u2014A. I thought when the deals were there we were comparatively safe and good for the money and a short delay wouldn't make much difference.\nQ. Mr. McKendrick had two mills had he not?\u2014A. I believe he was running two mills that summer.\nQ. One was called the Upham mill and a mill across the river called the Robinson mill?\u2014A, I believe so.\nQ. And these logs he was sawing at both mills?\u2014A. Yes I discovered afterwards. I didn't know it at the time. I didn't know it along in the summer.\nQ. Can you tell me about what time in October you were there?\u2014\nA. It would be late in October.\nQ. And you say that then the logs were substantially all disposed of?\u2014A. Yes, I say they were most all gone, and the deals were there he said were gone too. And again he says:\nI took it that he was disposing of what we had released, and he distinctly told me\u2014\nWitness: I was not aware that he was disposing of any except what we had released. * * * I was afraid that possibly he was. He repeatedly told me previous to that that it was not being shipped.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Landry and apparently was adjourned for argument, and practically all the cases which were submitted to this court were discussed before the trial judge whose judgment is as follows:\nAfter the attention and care I have given this case, and I feel I have given it all the attention and care I can reasonably give it, I have had some time to look at the evidence, which has been on my mind since I heard it. I have arrived at the conclusion that I will have to find for the plaintiff on both counts of the declaration and assess the damages for the value of the lumber that was received by the defendant, Mr. Estey, from the boom-master, or whoever represented the boom-master, by the order of McKendrick, which would be $2,766.63.\nI do not announce that decision, however, without expressing some regret that an innocent person like Mr. Estey should be made to suffer; but still I find that the law of our country is such with circumstances and facts existing as I find them to exist in this case, I have to give the verdict against him. In point of fact if my decision had been the other way I would have said the same thing in reference to the bank\u2014regret the bank suffering, which would also be an innocent party, the damages; but under the law as I find it the plaintiffs protected themselves better than Mr. Estey did, and therefore the damages fall on him after he has already paid for the logs. I find the law to be that and I find the facts such that I will direct the clerk to enter a verdict on both counts for $2,766.63 for the plaintiff.\nAn appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and subsequently four propositions were argued:\n1. That the appellant bank by the statement of its agent, Mr. White, to the defendant that he had sold the Upham logs to McKendrick, and by its conduct, is estopped from denying McKendrick's right to dispose of the logs and for claiming property in the logs on the bank.\n2. The appellant bank waived its right to be paid for the logs on delivery. 3. The appellant bank knew the logs were purchased by McKendrick for the purpose of re-sale, and having delivered the logs to McKendrick and clothed him with the possession and ostensible right to sell, any secret reservation of title or property in the bank would be fraudulent and void as against an innocent purchaser for value.\n4. That the logs sold by McKendrick to the respondent were included in or were part of the logs released by the bank upon payment of the $10,000.\nJudgment was delivered by the court composed of Tuck C..J., Hanington, Barker, McLeod, Gregory and Landry JJ. All were in favour of the defendants with the exception of Mr. Justice Landry.\nI have stated the facts at some length because the case seems to me to be one of considerable importance. I have examined all the authorities cited and many others, and it seems to me that the court below has erred in its application of the decisions.\nI think the better plan is to see what were the rights as between the parties themselves and then see how far the rights of the bank had been displaced by anything that occurred. I think it is clear on the facts that I have stated, that the intention of the parties was that the logs should be delivered to McKendrick without the bank insisting upon payment as a condition precedent to the delivery, but that it was intended that McKendrick should get possession of the logs, the property of the logs to remain in the bank until payment was received. Such a transaction is, in the absence of statutory enactment, a perfectly valid and binding one. It is quite competent for parties to make such an agreement as that an unpaid vendor may reserve property in goods sold, the passing of the property being in either case a matter of intention which can be controlled by the contract of the parties, and it is equally law, now too well settled to admit of dispute, that upon a sale and delivery of personal estate on condition that the title is not vested in the vendee until the purchase money is paid, the vendor may recover the property from an innocent third person obtaining title from such a vendee, assuming the vendor is guilty of no conduct which as between him and the bon\u00e2 fide purchaser disentitles him to enforce his remedy. It is equally well settled that, apart from statute, entrusting a person with possession of goods does not constitute a holding of such person out as entitled to dispose of them, and that at common law no man can give a better title to his personal property than he himself has, with the engrafted exceptions that if the sale was a sale in market overt, or if it was a sale made to one engaged in the daily traffic of goods in small quantities, such as a shopkeeper who resold, then the sale to a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser was good, the principle apparently being that if one puts another in the possession of goods for the very purpose as the vendor must be aware of the vendee retailing them to the general public then such a disposition is repugnant to the retention in good faith of a property in the goods, and the vendor can not claim as against a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser of the goods in such case that the property has not passed. Such also are cases of giving possession and apparent title to sale agents or factors. Can it be pretended here that this transaction comes within such an exception? As between the parties clearly it was not so intended., McKendrick admits that the parties to the document assumed that if he proposed making any sale of sawn lumber obtained from the logs that he should get that quantity released and the draft or cheque received in payment handed to the bank in exchange for the release. I cannot see that this transaction differs at all in principle from the daily transactions under section 74 of the Bank Act and which are well known throughout this country. It has been deemed in the public interest that banks should be allowed to make advances to their customers to enable them to get out logs, and when the logs were gotten out that the bank should receive security. It is not necessary to register and under such security the bank retained a title in the logs and any lumber manufactured therefrom, and the practice has grown up to the extent of millions of dollars per annum. The lumberman making a sale of the lumber ships same to the order of the bank, and the bill of lading is held by the bank until it receives either a draft or cheque in payment. It is perfectly apparent, not only from McKendrick's evidence but the letter from the bank relied on by the defendant, which I quoted above, that the intention was to send deals, boards and scantlings to St. John, there to be held, meaning, to be held to the order of the bank, otherwise the letter would have no meaning.\nI think this entirely disposes of the second and third contentions of the plaintiff, and but for the telephone conversation, to be hereafter referred to, the bank would have had a perfect right to follow the goods as has been done in numerous cases in the reports and recover them from a party who had not the title; in other words, that Estey could receive no better nor higher title than McKendrick had.\nI do not think there is anything in the fourth contention as it is perfectly plain that what was intended was that a certain quantity of deals, to the extent of about 1,000,000 feet, were to be released, and that whatever, lumber was first cut from the logs should be applicable to this, and that no other property was intended to be released.\nThis brings us now to the consideration of the so-called estoppel by the telephone conversation. In my opinion this question must be found in favour of the bank. In the first place there is no evidence to shew that White was aware who the person was who was asking the question, and while it may be said that it is fair to assume upon the evidence that White did probably understand that it was the defendant who was asking the question, I think the surrounding circumstances must determine the question of an estoppel. The bank had the Upham logs for sale. Various parties had been inquiring as to the purchase. Two or three days before the bank had disposed of them to McKendrick, giving him at the same time a lease of a mill, as I pointed out, with the apparent intention that they should be sawn into lumber. At any rate all this shows is that a person called up to know if \"the bank\" had the logs for sale. It is not shown that White had any reason to suppose that the question was directed to anything more than that point, and his answer, \"No, the logs have been sold to McKendrick\" to my mind only points to a statement of fact that the bank had put it out of its power to sell the logs. There is no suggestion that the person inquiring gave any indication that he was making any inquiry except for the purpose of ascertaining whether the bank was still in a position to make a sale. There was nothing in such a simple inquiry to lead any reasonable man to suppose that under the circumstances McKendrick was likely to be applied to for the purchase of the logs, or, as I have before pointed out, that McKendrick, if he was applied to, would in any sense attempt to deal with the logs without obtaining a release from the bank as he did in the case of a sale to the Bank of Montreal. Had anything been said by Estey to indicate to manager of the bank that he was likely to pursue the inquiry further and to go to the person to whom the logs had been stated to be sold, I think then and then only would an estoppel have arisen had the manager failed to point out that although he had said that he had sold them to McKendrick that he still retained an interest in them by way of vendor's lien. The very nature of estoppel means that a person has misled another; that he in good faith ought to be precluded from setting up that a certain state of facts existed because he has asserted by his language or conduct the contrary to a person who, he had reason to suppose or believe, would act upon his statement or conduct, or that the person could reasonably believe that it was meant to be acted upon. I think the best statement of the law that I have seen is to be found in 11 Am. & Eng. Ency., (2 ed.) at page 431. It is stated that\nto constitute an estoppel it must be shewn that the person sought to be estopped has made an admission or done an act with the intention of influencing the conduct of another, or which he had reason to believe would influence his conduct, inconsistent with the evidence he proposes to give, or the title he proposes to set up. It appears however to be the prevailing rule that it is not essential that the conduct creating the estoppel should be characterized by an actual intention to mislead and deceive. If, whatever a man's real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take the act or representation to be true, and believe that it was meant that he should act upon it, and he did act upon it as true, the party making the representation will be precluded from contesting its truth.\nI may say that this goes further in favour of the defendant than any of three celebrated rules laid down by Brett J. in Carr v. London and Northwestern Railway Co.[19] at pages 316-317, which are as follows:\nOne such proposition is, if a man by his words or conduct wilfully endeavours to cause another to believe in a certain state of thing which the first knows to be false, and if the second believes in such state of things, and acts upon his belief, he who knowingly made the false statement is estopped from averring afterwards that such a state of things did not in fact exist. * * * * * *\nAnother recognized proposition seems to be that if a man, either in express terms or conduct, makes a representation to another of the existence of a certain state of facts which he intends to be acted upon in a certain way, and it be acted upon in that way, in the belief of the existence of such a state of facts, to the damage of him who so believes and acts, the first is estopped from denying the existence of such a state of facts.\nAnd another proposition is that if a man, whatever his real meaning may be, so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take his conduct to mean a certain representation of facts and that it was a true representation, and that the latter was intended to act upon it in a particular way, and he with such belief does act in that way to his damage, the first is estopped from denying that the facts were as represented.\nI think the evidence fails as to both \"knowledge and intent\" which are essentials to estoppel. I quote as most applicable the observation of Parke B. to counsel in Freeman v. Cooke[20].\nYou do not mean to argue, that, if a person makes a misstatement, without any intention that another party should act upon it, and when he could not expect that another party would act upon it, that, in such a case, he is bound?\nI think that the defendant has failed to bring himself within the rule and that the plaintiff bank is entitled to recover the sum found by the trial judge together with costs in all the courts.\nKILLAM J. also dissented from the judgment of the majority of the court for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

In an action by the contractors for the full amount of the contract price the trial judge refused leave to amend the claim by adding a count for quantum meruit; found that the works were still incomplete at the time of action but entered judgment in favour of the plaintiffs for a portion of the contract price with nine-tenths of the costs. The defendant alone appealed, from this decision and the trial court judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that, as the whole of the works had not been completed at the time of the institution of the action, the condition precedent to payment had not been accomplished and the plaintiffs had no right of action under the contract.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at the City of Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Saint Francis, which maintained the plaintiffs action, to the amount of $3,7917.71 with costs.\nThe questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgment of the court, delivered by His Lordship, Mr. Justice Girouard. Lafleur K. C. and Cate for the appellant.\nBelcourt K.C. and Panneton K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nGIROUARD J.\u2014On the 26th March, 1900, in the City of Sherbrooke, the firm of A. Blondin & Co., plumbers and gas fitters, at St. Hyacinthe, undertook to perform certain work of plumbing and heating in a certain building of the appellant then in course of construction in the City of Sherbrooke. The work was stipulated to be finished on the 1st July, 1900; the price as stipulated for the plumbing job was $1,500, and for the heating $4,000. Two contracts were signed containing about the same clauses, especially as to the completion and payment of the work. In the plumbing contract the respondents agreed\nto furnish all the labour and material for a first class plumbing job al complete,\naccording to certain plans and specifications fully set out. The price of $1,500\nwas to be paid when the work is all completed satisfactorily to said Whiting.\nFinally the two following clauses are to be found in the plumbing contract:\nAll work to be completed and tested by July 1st, 1900, any work on this contract left undone after that date shall be deducted from our contract price, twenty dollars per day for each and every day. and retained by said Whiting as liquidated damages and the same shall be satisfactory to us. * *\nShould the contractors not complete this contract, that is, fail so to do, they shall then pay to the said Whiting one thousand dollars within thirty days from such failure for damage she will have sustained thereby.\nIn the heating contract the respondents agreed\nto furnish all labour and material necessary for a first class heating apparatus to heat the entire building according to certain plans and specifications fully set out. The respondents guaranteed to heat the whole building to seventy degrees Far. when the temperature would be ten degrees below zero, and that\nthey shall not receive any pay on this contract until the work is all completed to the satisfaction of the said Whiting.\nIt was also understood between the parties\nthat the price agreed upon by the said contractors will be $4,000, to to be paid when all such work is completed, not any pay before the completion of all this contract.\nThe following clauses are also to be found in the heating contract :\nThe contractors hereby agree to commence working on said contract within eight days after signing this contract, also to complete all said contract by the first day of July, 1900, that is to say all work above basement. Should the said contractors fail to complete any of the contract above basement by that date then the said contractors shall pay to the said Whiting twenty dollars per day for each and every day the said contract remains incomplete, and the said Whiting shall deduct such from the contract price and retain such as liquidated damages.\nAll work on this contract in basement must be completed by July 1st, 1900, if not, the same forfeit by the contractors, twenty dollars per day, shall be made by them from their contract price.\nShould the contractors not carry out their part of this contract, that is, fail to complete, they then, within thirty days, shall pay to the said Whiting one thousand dollars for damages that she has sustained by them not fulfilling their contract.\nThe work was not completed on the first July, 1900, and in fact late in the fall on the 10th November, 1900, and on the 15th December of the same year, the respondents were protested and requested to complete their work, giving particulars at the same time.\nOn the 1st February, 1900, the respondents sued the appellant for the full contract price of the two jobs, and also for certain damages, alleging that they were complete and that any defect or delay in the completion of the work was due to the fault of the appellant and her agents.\nThe appellant met this action by referring to the above clauses of the contract and that as the respondents had not completed their work no action had accrued to them for any part of the price money and that the action taken was premature, reserving to herself a right to recover such damages as the respondents might be liable for. At the closing of the enqu\u00eate, the respondents moved to amend their declaration by adding a count for quantum meruit which was rightly refused three days later.\nFinally on the 21st March, 1902, after a voluminous enqu\u00eate covering over a thousand pages of the printed case, Mr. Justice Lemieux, who heard and saw the witnesses, found that the respondents had not completed their work and proceeded to deduct from the contract price, first, the sum of $1200 from the price of the heating apparatus contract, and one hundred dollars from the price of the plumbing contract, and finally condemned the appellant to pay the sum of $3,791.71 with interest and costs, the appellant paying nine tenths of the cost of enqu\u00eate. The learned Judge has left no notes of his judgment, but his formal judgment is fully motive, I extract from it three considerants bearing upon the point which is the ground for our judgment :\nConsid\u00e9rant que les dits Demandeurs, bien que d\u00fbment requis par prot\u00eat de compl\u00e9ter le dit contrat et de poser la quantit\u00e9 additionnelle tuyaux requise par les specifications qui faisaient partie du dit contrat, ont refus\u00e9 de ce faire et que la D\u00e9fenderesse avait le droit de faire compl\u00e9ter le dit contrat et de retenir sur le prix arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre les parties le co\u00fbt additionnel de travaux de completion. * *\nConsid\u00e9rant que telle somme de douze cents piastres doit \u00eatre d\u00e9duite de celle de trois mille six cents piastres, montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par les demandeurs, en vertu du dit contrat laissant en leur faveur une balance de deux mille quatre cents piastres qui est la valeur des travaux de posage du dit appareil de chauffage, faits par les demandeurs, prouv\u00e9e par nombre de t\u00e9moins et non contredite par la d\u00e9fence * *\nConsid\u00e9rant, n\u00e9anmoins, comme le disent plusieurs t\u00e9moins, les nomm\u00e9s Lamarche et Ballentyne qu'il est in\u00e9vitable dans les grands contrats de cette nature, que quelques pi\u00e8ces de plomberie ne soient pas quelque peu d\u00e9fectueuses et incompl\u00e8tes et qu'il y a lieu pour \u00e9viter de nouvelles litigations entre les parties, et ce bien que le montant n'en ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaitement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la preuve de retrancher et d\u00e9duire sur la somme de quinze cents piastres montant du dit contrat pour travaux de plomberie, celle de cent piastres pour la r\u00e9paration ou completion de certaines pi\u00e8ces de plomberie incompl\u00e8tes ou d\u00e9fecteuses etc.\nThe appellant appealed from this judgment to the Court of Review in Montreal, which, on the 18th June, 1903, purely affirmed the same with costs. (Taschereau, Loranger and St. Pierre JJ.)\nThe appellant now appeals from that judgment to this court.\nThat judgment establishes beyond doubt that the work contracted for by the respondents either for heating or plumbing, was not completed when they took their action In fact the evidence shews that it was so completed by the appellant after the institution of the action. The respondents cannot complain of this judgment as they did not appeal from it and they are consequently found in default within the terms of the contract As we read the contract the full completion of the work was a condition precedent or suspensive of the payment of any money under the contract and until it is accomplished the respondents have no action; such is the well settled jurisprudence of Quebec : Bender v. Carrier ([1]) in 1887; Saumure v. Les Commissaires d'Ecole de St, Jerome ([2]) in the Court of Review in 1888; Stanton v. La Compagnie du Chemin de Fer Atlantique Canadien ([3]), in 1891, in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, and The Royal Electric Co. v. The Corporation of the City of Three Rivers ([4]) in 1894 in this court.\nWe fully realise the desire of the learned judge to put an end to a very expensive litigation, but to do so there must be a proper issue between the parties, that is, an action by one or other of the parties to have the various accounts and claims between them adjusted and settled after the completion of the work. Two witnesses were examined to establish the value of the work remaining to be done, but this was done only incidentally in support of the allegation of the defence that the work had not been completed. The evidence was never intended to establish the claim of the appellant for expenses in finishing the work or liquidated damages under the contract.\nThe appeal is, therefore, allowed with costs in all the courts, sauf recours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cette, Wells & White.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Panneton & Leblanc.\n[1] 15 Can.

The contract granted the franchise for the period of thirty years from the 1st of August, 1892, and one of its clauses provided that the company should pay to the city, annually, during the. term of the franchise, \" from the 1st of September, 1892, upon the total amount of its gross earnings arising from the whole operation of its said railway, either with cars propelled by electricity or with cars drawn by horses \" certain percentages specified, according to the gross earnings from year to year. Upon the first settlement, on the 1st of September, 1893 the company paid the percentages without any distinction between earnings arising beyond the city limits and those arising within the city, but, subsequently, they refused to pay the pertages except upon the estimated amount of the gross earnings arising within the city. In an action by the city to recover the percentages upon the gross earnings of the tramway lines both inside and outside of the city limits;\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, the Chief Justice and Killam J. dissenting that the city was entitled to the specified percentages upon the gross earnings of the company arising from the operation of the tramway both within and outside of the city limits APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court District of Montreal by which the plaintiffs action was dismissed with costs.\nThe questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nAtwater K. C. and Ethier K. C. for the appellant.\nCampbell K. C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting.) The amount involved in the controversy between these parties is a very large one for the determination of the case will affect not merely the sum now demanded by the appellants in the present action for the years 1893, 1894 1895 and 1896 but also the amounts to be paid to them by the respondents under the thirty years' contract in question for the other twenty-six years of its duration.\nAs correctly stated by the appellant in the factum the whole controversy upon this appeal is as to whether the appellant is entitled to the percentage in question upon the whole earnings of the respondents or only upon those which the respondents earn and collect within the city limits.\nI am of opinion that the appellant is entitled to claim percentage exclusively upon what the respondents earn and collect within the city limits and that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in that sense should be affirmed.\nIt appears from the contract itself that tenders had previously been called for by the appellant for the building and operation of a street railway in the City of Montreal. The appellant had no powers outside of the city and did not intend to contract in any way for anything to be done outside of the city limits, And it clearly did not do so. The by-law of the city council (which has to be read as forming part of the contract) and the contract itself, provide for a passenger railway in the streets mentioned in the schedules thereto (sec. 12 of contract, sec. 43 of by-law) within the city limits. Not a single clause of either the contract or the by-law has or could possibly have been intended to have any application outside of the city. The respondents could since, at any time have ceased to operate their railway outside the city without committing a breach of their contract with the appellant.\nThe appellant's contention that clauses 36 and 37. can be singled out of the contract, so as to have an extra territorial application, when, it must concede, all and every one of the other clauses of it apply territorially to the City of Montreal exclusively, cannot, in my opinion, prevail. When clause 36 says\nthe total amount of its gross earnings arising from the whole operations of its said railway;\nor as sect. 35 of the by-law as promulgated in French says,\nsur le montant total de ses recettes brutes provenant de toute lexploitation de sea dites voies ferr\u00e9es,\nthat clearly means, it seems to me, the railway authorized by the by-law and contracted for the \" voies ferr\u00e9es s mentioned in the schedules and no other. And article 37 of the contract likewise applies exclusively to the subject matter of the contract, to the gross earnings of the company within the City of Montreal, to the gross earnings of the lines of railway that the company has by the first clause of the contract covenanted to build and operate.\nThis percentage is the price that the company pays to the city for if s franchise in the city and the \"privilege of using its streets, but that the company should also pay the city for a benefit it frets not from it but from the neighbouring municipalities, would appear to me unreasonable. That is a consideration not by itself conclusive but one it seems to me not to be altogether disregarded in the construction of the wording of this contract.\nThe appellant seems to rely in support of its contention upon the state of facts that existed at the time when this contract was passed but in a case where the contract itself is clear and explicit no extrinsic facts can be allowed to make it say what it does not say. Then by sect. 42 of the by-law it would seem that the contracting parties intended that all past contracts and agreements should be considered as merged in the new contract.\nThen, if, as the appellant contends, the state of things as they existed previously had been in the minds of the contracting parties, would it not have bound the respondents to continue the operation of their railway outside of the city limits, instead of leaving them free to either sell or abandon those parts of it or run them altogether as a separate undertaking?\nThe appellant's efforts to get assistance from art. 42 of the contract are exclusively based on taking for granted what may be the subject of a serious controversy between the parties at the termination of the contract. It is expedient, in my opinion, to reserve judgment upon the construction of that article till we, or our successors, are called upon to adjudicate upon it.\nBy art. 34 of the contract (sec. 22 of the by-law) the company is not entitled to charge any rate exceeding five cents for the conveyance of a passenger from one point in the city to another in the city, but that restriction has no application outside the limits of the city, so that the company might well, without breach of this contract, charge 25 cents, or whatever they please, for conveying a passenger from any point in an outside municipality to another point therein, and the appellant would claim a percentage on these 25 cents.\nThat contention cannot be upheld.\nI cannot see that the appellant can invoke in support of its case the contracts that the respondents have made or might have made with any other corporations. These are altogether res inter alios acla. It may have been in their interest for the respondents to run all of their lines as one concern but that does not take away the right they would have had, and now have, of treating their lines, outside of the city as entirely separate.\nFor these reasons, which are substantially those given by Mr. Justice Davidson in the Superior Court, and by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIt is in evidence, and found as a fact by the two courts below as reported by the two referees, one of whom was the appellant's treasurer, that, however unsatisfactory the mode of computation adopted by the respondents may have been, an injustice resulting from it. if any has worked in favour of appellant. So that the appellant has received at least all and perhaps more, than the percentage it was entitled to. Then the appellant has not proved any specific amount of the earnings of the company within the city upon which a judgment could in any case be entered.\nI would add to the judgment, if desired, a reserve of the right the city might have in an action of account or otherwise that amount to be ascertained if possible, in any way which might be considered more equitable than that adopted by the respondents.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal gives rise to a nice question of interpretation of contract involving large sums of money. The respondents, as the name indicates, operate a line of electric railway on the streets of the appellant, extending through a certain number or adjoining towns and villages, which form the suburbs of the city.\nThe contract recites that tenders having been called for by the appellant, \" for the establishment and operation \" of an electric passenger railway in the City of Montreal the tender of the respondents was accepted on the 19th of July, 1892;\nthat a specification for the establishment and operation of the said railway was, consequently, prepared.\nby the city council and submitted to the company for approval l that\nafter discussion of the said specification by the said company and suggestions made by the latter,\nthe city council passed a by-law, No. 210, on the 21st of December, 1892, u amending such specification;\" and that finally, the said by law constituted the contract which was subsequently, on the 8th March, 1893, put in notarial form and signed by all the parties. It is stated in the deed that copies of the tender and of the specification are annexed to it, signed ne varietur, together with a copy of the by-law. The latter is alone filed and we cannot tell in what particulars it differs from the other documents. The tender might, perhaps, throw some light upon the consideration which the company undertook to pay for the franchise. One thing clearly results from the recitals in the contract * it was not the work of the city alone, but of the two parties. Another fact which appears to be equally certain from the evidence is that, as far as clause 36 is concerned, both parties understood, at the beginning, that it covered the earnings of the whole system.\nIn consideration of the concession or franchise to run street cars through the city, the respondents have promised, by clause 36, to pay to the appellants a certain percentage\nof the total amount of the gross earnings arising from the whole operation of the said, railway.\nWhat is the meaning of this convenant? Does it cover the receipts from the operation of the railway accruing from the carriage of passengers over any part of the railway within the city limits even if entering the car and paying fare outside these limits? That is the main question submitted for our decision.\nThe Superior Court (Davidson J.) and the Court of Appeal (Lacoste C. J., Blanchet and W\u00fcrt\u00e8le JJ.) held that this obligation was limited to the actual receipts within the city, where the passenger was carried within those limits only, and only a mileage percentage of those receipts where the passenger was carried, either to or from the city from or to the suburbs; Boss\u00e9 and Ouimet JJ. dissenting.\nWith due deference I must confess that I cannot understand the force of the reasoning of Chief Justice Lacoste speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal. True the parties have provided for the construction and operation of an electric railway within the city; that was the main object of the contract between them, and for that reason several clauses have reference to that railway only; but quite a few relate to the whole system for instance clause 36. Nothing prevented them from stipulating that the consideration to be paid by the railway company should consist in a certain percentage of the total amount of its gross earnings, no matter where received. The company has only one system of railway having its head-office, works and power-house in the city with mere ramifications or extensions outside. It is like a body having its head, its heart and arteries within the city and a few distant veins extending without. There is only one system of railway from which the company gets its revenue, puts it in one cash box and undertakes to pay a percentage to the city. Nothing could be more reasonable in a contract with a municipality granting a concession to a street railway company\u2014the charges for travelling upon which were a fixed or lump sum and not a mileage rate\u2014than a stipulation that all fares paid under which the traveller passed over the the rails within city limits should be taken into account in estimating the percentage payable to the City. It must also be remembered that the tickets giving a right to travel anywhere over the system of the street railway company could be purchased anywhere, and so many for $1 and that the holder could use them all strictly within the city limits or in travelling partly within and partly without those limits, but the price paid went into the gross earnings. True the exercise of the franchise granted by the city is confined to the city territory; but it cannot be denied that it was intended to influence and did in fact influence the franchises obtained from the outside municipalities; without it they were of little value to either party. It does not therefore astonish that in determining the percentage or consideration to he paid to the city, both parties contemplated the operation of the whole railway. The words \"total amount of the whole operation\" must mean that, and if not they have no meaning, for they are unnecessary if the earnings are merely those received in the city. Without them, especially the last, the clause would be complete: it would then read:\nThe Company shall pay etc , upon the amount of its gross earnings-arising from the operation of said railway, etc.\nAnother way of testing the meaning of the words\ntotal amount of the gross earnings arising from the whole operation of the said railway is to consider what would be meant if, instead, it spoke of the \" total operating expenses of whole operation of the said railway. \" it could hardly be suggested that if say 56 per cent would be a fair average for motive expenses that must mean the motive expense of operating the railway in the city alone. and so with respect to that part of the expenses consisting of wages paid. Would it not be plain in the latter case that the words total operating expenses included all the wages paid the men and not only a proportionate part thereof arrived at either on a mileage basis or on that of a population basis or any other arbitrary basis.\nIn fact there is no justification in the contract for making the deductions \" from the total amount of the gross earnings,\" sanctioned by the judgment appealed from. it is assumed to be an equitable method of dividing such gross earnings. But, apart from the fact that the contract itself does not provide for any such adjustment, the appellant contends that it is most inequitable. As between railways charging for their tickets a sum based upon a mileage rate such an adjustment of receipts, where the ticket covers a part of the mileage travelled on each road, is alike necessary and just. But it is altogether inapplicable to such a contract as this, with a fixed fare irrespective of distance carried, and, besides being largely based upon a rule of thumb, may work most inequitably towards the city.\nThis aspect of the case seems to have been overlooked by a majority of the judges. It is discussed by Mr. Justice Ouimet. He demonstrates to my satisfaction at least that the \"gross earnings \" of all the cars running within the city, electric and others, was intended by clause 36 of the contract whether the fares were actually collected in or out of the city. He further points out that the method according to mileage adopted by the railway company of making certain deductions for fares received in outside municipalities is arbitrary and unwarranted by the contract. The learned judge correctly concludes:\nDe deux choses l\u2019une; ou le chemin de fer que la compagnie a construit et op\u00e8re dans la cite est un chemin de fer ind\u00e9pendant, distinct des prolongements de ses circuits dans la banlieue, ou le tout forme un seul r\u00e9seau, un seul syst\u00e8me dont le tronc se trouve dans la cite avec prolongements \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur. Dans le premier cas, il faut que les lignes suburbaines soient s\u00e9par\u00e9es du tronc principal et op\u00e9r\u00e9es s\u00e9par\u00e9ment comme deux enterprises distinctes. Tant que le tout sera op\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un seul et m\u00eame syst\u00e8me de chemin de fer, cette question de s\u00e9paration des recettes ne peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e.\nWe might rest our judgment upon the elaborate and well considered opinion of Mr. Justice Ouimet and allow the appeal. Speaking for myself, who have lived for fifty years in Montreal and its suburbs and like the learned judges in the courts below, am familiar with the localities and the geography of the country and the modus operand of the Montreal Street Railway Company from its inception to the present day no more information as to the facts would be required than those given in their notes. But to one not so acquainted, it might be necessary to give details and review the evidence which is to be found in the charter of the railway company and its amendments the various by-laws and contracts entered into with the City of Montreal and adjoining municipalities, the plan of the said electric railway, and the documentary and oral evidence adduced. This review, it seems to me, is necessary to truly appreciate the real value of the franchise granted by the City of Montreal and determine the construction of the contract of the 8th of March 1893. These various sources of information are not disputed by the parties. Both, in the course of the argument of their counsel, presented their case as if they were as well known to this court as they were to themselves and to the judges of the courts below, and have relied only upon the contract with the city. They did not refer to the plan, nor to the contracts with the adjoining municipalities; they did not print them although filed as exhibits and agreed to form part of the case. It was only when reading the printed evidence before us that we were able to notice their existence and demanded the sending up of the manuscript record so as to be able to judge of their contents The plan, as explained in the evidence, graphically shows some of the localities interested, and fully indicates (in colour) the electric railway contemplated by the contract, the lines constructed for horse cars and to be constructed for electric ears in the city. The evidence further establishes that, early in 1893, the company commenced the construction of the electric system within the city immediately after the signing of this contract; (clause 15). But the work in the outside municipalities was not started till some time after, and in some of them nearly one year after. At the time of the contract, the company had only horse cars in Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde and St. Henri along Notre Dame Street and for a little distance in Maisonneuve and also in Westmount through St. Catherine Street to Green Avenue. So says Mr. St. George, the city surveyor, who produced the plan. Clause 12 of the contract says :\nUntil further orders the cars shall run in the streets mentioned in the schedule of routes herein below indicated, and designated on the plan hereunto annexed, signed by the parties hereto and by the under-signed notary ne varietur and the several circuits shall remain as they are now established.\nThe railway is shown on the plan as passing through Montreal, Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde and C\u00f4te St. Antoine, now Westmount. Mr. St. George testifies that the plan shows this v very clearly.\" The plan, which is 46 by 83 inches, is reproduced below in a reduced form; it will undoubtedly help to acquire a fair knowledge of the geography of the premises. The streets upon which the railway was not yet intended to pass are left out, although many have since been supplied by the company with electric service; in fact all the leading streets, with the exception of Dorchester and Sherbrooke, were occupied by the railway. I have added outside of the plan a few localities : to the west; Verdun, C\u00f4te St. Paul, St. Henri, Lachine, Toutes Gr\u00e2ces and Montreal West; to the north; C\u00f4te des Neiges, St. Laurent and Cartierville; on the Back River; Outremont, St. Louis du Mile End (now the Town of St. Louis ) St. Jean Baptiste and St. Denis Wards, (both parts of the city,) Sault au R\u00e9collet on the Back River; to the east; De Lorimier Village, Maisonneuve and Longue Pointe; and finally St. Lambert and Longeuil on the southern side of the River St. Lawrence. [Page 472]\nIt seems to me, that this plan, as explained by the witnesses, is an important element in determining the meaning of the words s said railway\" in clause 36, for why indicate these outside lines if not contemplated by the contract with the city?\nClause 36 says :\nThe company shall pay to the city annually, from the first of September, 1892, upon the total amount of its gross earnings arising from the whole operation of its said railway, either with cars propelled by electricity or with cars drawn by horses, etc.\nThe courts below rely upon the first clause for a definition of the word \u201crailway.\" This clause declares :\nThe Montreal Street Railway Company aforesaid shall establish. and operate, subject to the conditions hereafter mentioned, lines of railway for the conveyance of passengers in the city by means of cars propelled by electricity, in the streets hereinafter mentioned, and in all other streets which may hereafter be determined by the council of the City of Montreal.\nBut as pointed out by Mr. Justice Ouimet, this cannot be the entire meaning of clause 36, as it expressly provides for a percentage on the earnings of horse cars as well. The \"plan and the evidence give us the explanation of this stipulation. They establish that horse lines extending into outside municipalities might be kept, and were in fact kept, for some years. So city treasurer Robb says. As the city could not provide for electric service within their limits it exacted the percentage on horse cars as well, to protect its revenue, till the electric system was complete in and out of its limits. Undoubtedly, the city also had in view the term fixed for the completion of the electric system within the city, namely, the 1st September, 1895\nClause 44 conveys the same intention :\nIn the case of annexation by the city of any of the outside municipalities, the company shall be obliged within three months after being ordered by the council, to extend their system through that new annexed portion of territory not already provided with electric cars' and to furnish a similar service as is furnished to the city Horse cars might be kept on for years in the outside municipalities. This result was out of the control of the city, but if any of them be ever annexed, the electric system shall at once be extended through it by the railway company without any charge or indemnity. In fact all the outside municipalities might come in and the railway company could claim nothing. Why? Because the contract with the city was intended to apply to the whole system of this railway company both in and out of the city.\nAnd what can be the meaning of clause 37 of the contract if the. contention of the respondents be upheld? None whatever. It would be of no effect. But are we not bound to construe that clause in a sense that will give some effect to it even if it exceeds clause 36, rather than one in which it can produce none? Art. 1014 C. C. Clause 87 reads as follows :\nThe said company shall render quarterly a true and just account and statement in writing of the whole of their gross earnings and allow proper inspection of all books, accounts, returns and vouchers for the purpose of checking and verifying such accounts by the city treasurer, city auditor or other accountant appointed by the city council, such accounts to be rendered and to date from the first day of September, 1892, and to take place every three months on the first days of December, March, June and September in each succeeding year.\nThe statements rendered by the company of their gross earnings shall be so rendered accompanied by a statutory declaration to be made by the president, vice president, treasurer or other authorised officer of the company verifying the correctness thereof.\nThis clause was clearly intended to give an indisputable effect to clause 36 and to permit the city to collect without trouble or question its proportion of the gross earnings of the railway. It is in evidence that at the beginning no claim was made for. any deduction; just the reverse actually happened. It was only asserted on the 27th October, 1893, when the company passed the following resolution : Mr. Cunningham (the general manager), submitted a statement showing the amount of revenue collected in St. Cunegonde and St. Henri during the past year and which has been included in the returns made to the city and subject to a fixed charge of four per cent, but which he suggested should properly be deducted, as also the estimated earnings received in Cote St. Antoine and Maisonneuve. The deduction referred to meeting the approval of the board, the secretary was directed to declare accordingly.\nHow can such a declaration with arbitrary deductions made such as those suggested in this resolution, be held to be a compliance with a clause requiring \"the said company to give a true account of the whole of their gross earnings?\" Where is such a deduction authorised? It is purely arbitrary, and without any authority.\nThe city protested, but to the present time deductions for what is assumed to form the outside receipts have been regularly made by the company, notwithstanding the city's repeated protestations and reservations. Hence the present action for the difference for the years 1893 to 1896, inclusive, amounting altogether to $21,050.87 according to the returns of the company.\nThe position taken by the company is untenable; it amounts to this : Clause 37 does not establish the amount which you are entitled to under clause 36; we are willing that you should use it, but only to a certain limit you must accept our deductions for gross earnings estimated as received outside the city limits, and if you are not satisfied with this prove your case the best way you can. They admit at the same time that this cannot be done, because all the receipts have been mixed up and cannot be separated. Articles 430 and 442 of the Civil Code enumerate certain rules which are obligatory in certain specified eases of admixture and confusion or m\u00e9lange, but the present one does not fall within that class of cases. Article 429 however lays down, as a principle applicable to all the other cases that they are subordinate to the general rules of \"natural equity.\" In a case like this, according to the English law, the wrongdoer, that is the party who does the admixture, is the one to suffer. Lawrie v. Rathbun ([1]). I believe that this reasonable rule is within the spirit of the Roman law although I cannot find any text in point. Probably the law of Quebec is to the same effect under articles 429 and 1053 of the Civil Code. It was a fault on the part of the company to have so mixed up the receipts that they cannot be separated. The two accounts, if two must exist as contended by the respondents, should have been kept apart, according to actual figures and not imaginary ones. At all events, under the circumstances, there is only one right course to follow, which is not only equitable but also legal : give full effect to clause 37 so as to make clause 36 workable. I must add that I cannot see upon what ground the company can claim any deduction, at least as long as the service in the outside municipalities is part of the city railway system. I do not wish, however, to be understood as expressing any opinion as to its right under its contract with the city to establish an independent service m these municipalities.\nClause 34 and 35 provide for the collection of fares.\n34. The company shall not be entitled to charge any rate exceeding five cents for the conveyance of a passenger from one point to another (either going or returning) except between the hours of twelve p.m. and six a.m., when they shall have the right to charge ten cents, without transfer, as above provided in article twenty-nine. A passenger, on paying his fare, shall be entitled to a transfer without further charge from any one of the company's cars to another at a point where routes connect or intersect, so as to enable him to make one continuous trip from one point to another. Children carried on their parents knees shall be conveyed free of charge. 35. The Company shall also be held to sell tickets in all their offices and cars at the rate of six for twenty-five cents, and twenty-five for a. dollar and to provide tickets for school children at the rate of ten for twenty-five cents, and the Company shall also sell eight tickets for twenty-five cents available between the hours of six and eight o'clock in the morning and between the hours of five and seven o'clock in the evening, on all week days; said hours variable at option of the City Council.\nIt is not suggested that in these two clauses the contract contemplates only the railway within the city. Ever since it has been operated, the uniform and daily practice of the company has been to convey city passengers to any part of the system, without charging any extra fare, whether carried in the city only or to and through outside municipalities. \"From one point to another\", according to the interpretation thus sanctioned by the parties themselves, refers undoubtedly to the whole railway system.\nLikewise, the contracts with the outside municipalities deal with the railway as a whole, running through the city and the adjoining municipalities and not as an operation confined to their respective limits. By its charter in 1861, the company, then known as The Montreal City Passenger Railway Co., was empowered to run, with the license of the City Council, horse cars upon the streets of the city and also\nalong the highways in the parish of Montreal, leading into the said streets and contiguous thereto,\nin consideration, as explained by the evidence, of a license or business tax which in 1892 amounted to $5000 and so much for each car or horse. (Old Canada,. 24 Vict. c. 84). This parish of Montreal, situated round and out of the city limits, formed what, for more than two hundred years, was known as la banlieue or the suburbs of the city, and comprised, among others, the very municipalities in question in this cause. It is fully described in the Arr\u00eat des Paroisses of the 3rd March, 1722, published in the Edits et Ordonnances, vol. 1, p. 443. At that time the city was confined to the territory enclosed in stone walls within the boundaries of the West Centre and East Wards of to-day; between the River, Craig, Lacroix (near C.P.R. depot) and McGill streets as shewn on the plan and is yet designated by the name of Old Montreal, forming an independent parish called\" Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al. \"At the time of the execution of the contract with the city in 1893, the suburbs were not the old ones known as Faubourgs St. Joseph, St. Antoine, St. Laurent and Quebec, which had already been absorbed by the city; they were new and were, nearly all, almost in their infancy. Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde which in 1871 had a population of 1500 had one of 9,291 in 1891; St. Henri, an old village heretofore called L Les Tanneries des Rolland \", with a population of 2,815 in 1871 had 13413 in 1891; Westmount which in 1871 had a population of 200 mostly composed of farmers and gardiners, had 3076 in 1891. St. Louis, which had 800 in 1871 had increased to 3537 in 1891. Maisonneuve, unknown in 1871 had a population of 3,958 in 1891. The total population of the suburbs is now about 64,000. These figures and details of past and present geography are taken partly from the evidence and partly from public statutes and official census which under article 1207 of the Civil Code we are bound to notice and are essential to determine the meaning of the words \" Parish of Montreal l used in the charter of the railway company.\nHaving secured the city franchise, the company turned its eyes to the outside municipalities and obtained from them similar and even greater privileges : 1\u00ba, from Maisonneuve by contract signed on the 27th of May, 1893; 2\u00b0. from c\u00f4te St. Antoine, now Westmount, by contract of the 11th August 1893; 3\u00b0. from Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde by contract of the 10th April, 1894; and 4\u00ba. from St. Henri also by contract of the 10th April 1894. The contract with the city was probably executed under powers granted by the legislature in 1886 49 & 50 Vict. ch. 86. The contracts with the outside municipalities contain pretty nearly the clauses and conditions of the city contract, except that the company is free from the payment of any percentage, and is exempted from all taxes, and finally Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde and St. Henri promised not to license any elevated railway. The passengers from these out-side towns and cities became entitled to travel on the city street cars not only through their own territory, but also through the City of Montreal, on a footing of equality with its citizens as to fares, tickets, transfers and connections. The contracts with Maisonneuve and Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde will illustrate this; Maisonneuve, clause 17 :\nThe company shall not be entitled to charge any rate exceeding five cents for the conveyance of a passenger from one point to another in the limits of the town or in the City of Montreal, or in the town of Maisonneuve and the City of Montreal together (either going or returning). A passenger on paying his fare shall be entitled to a transfer without further charge from any of the company's cars to another at a point where routes connect or intersect, so as to enable him to go without interruption from one point to another in Maisonneuve or in the City of Montreal.\nThe contract with Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde is more liberal:\nThe company shall be bound to carry passengers upon the line to be so constructed, as well as upon all its lines which shall be in operation within the City of Montreal, Maisonneuve, C\u00f4te St. Antoine and St. Henri at the same prices, charges, conditions and privileges as those imposed on the said company by the City of Montreal.\nFully equipped with these extraordinary powers, equal to if not greater than those held by any street railway in the Dominion, the Montreal Street Railway Company, in 1894, went to the Legislature of Quebec for confirmation of these powers. It represented that it has converted part of its street railway system into an electric railway system and. has made contracts with the City of Montreal, the town of Maisonneuve and the town of C\u00f4te St. Antoine etc.\nThe contract with Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde and St. Henri are not mentioned as no arrangement had yet been concluded with them. An Act 51 Vict. ch. 73 was passed on the 8th January, 1894, whereby the said contracts are\nconfirmed and shall have force and effect, according to their tenor, as fully as if the same were incorporated in the present Act.\nFew street railway companies possess greater privileges and a more valuable property. The outside municipalities have made wonderful progress under the operation of the electric tramway. Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde has now a population of 10,912; St. Henri, 21,-192; Westmount, 8,856; St. Louis, 19,033; Maisonneuve 3,958. Montreal has also increased, not however in the same proportion; its population, which in 1891 was 219,616 is now 267,730. This difference is due in a great measure to the electric service which secures to the inhabitants of outside municipalities one of the most important advantages enjoyed by the citizens of Montreal, namely cheap and quick transportation, without sharing their high rate of taxation, their large public debt and some antiquated public works. From the evidence, I gather that the company is operating 60 miles of railway, one third being in the outside municipalities or suburbs. Its franchise is nominally for thirty years, but practically for a longer period if not for ever, for under clause 42 of the contract the city cannot then nor at any time after, assume the ownership of the railway without paying, not its cost price, but its value, and I presume its market value By clause 43 the contract is not to be deemed as giving \"an exclusive franchise\"; but under clauses 12 and 13 no rival line can be licensed by the city even over streets not used by the company, unless the latter be given the preference to establish said line Lines of omnibuses are unknown in Montreal and the only public mode of transportation within the city is by the street cars of the respondents or cabs. The city may however grant a franchise for an elevated or suspended railway; but by its contracts with Ste. Cun\u00e9gonde and St. Henri the company has rendered this reservation almost valueless for these outside municipalities have agreed not to allow any such elevated company. The company has no business tax to pay in fact no tax whatever except on its real estate which however must be considerable, for under clause 45\nall plant, rolling stock, generators and motors necessary for the working of the said road, shall be manufactured within the limits of the City of Montreal. The shops power houses and offices of the company shall also be situated within the city limits,\nunder the penalty of the forfeiture of its franchise (clause 40). I presume that the words \"said road\" mean undoubtedly the whole system and are used in the same sense as s said railway\" in clause 36.\nI have entered into these details to show the value of the franchises granted by the city. This point is not foreign to the case before us; it is on the contrary most pertinent and \u00e0 propos. A sound and salutary rule has been established by almost a universal jurisprudence that franchises of this kind must be construed liberally in favour of the grantor and most strictly against the grantee. See Cyc. of Law and Procedure, vo. \" Corporations,\" vol, 10, p. 1088, and Broom's Legal Maxims, (7 ed.) p. 448, where all the cases are collected.\nTaken apart from the other clauses of the contract, clause 36 is perhaps open to some doubt, which has already divided the judges of the court below and divides the members of this court. Taken with the other clauses of the contract, the majority of this court have come to the conclusion that the clause is not open to any doubt. But even if it is we think that the above rule should be applied and that the city be given the benefit of the doubt.\nFor these reasons, the appeal is allowed with costs and the conclusion of the appellant's demand is maintained in principal, interest and costs as prayed for.\nDAVIES and NESBTTT JJ. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal for the reasons stated by Girouard J.\nKILLAM J. (dissenting) \u2014The questions involved in this appeal arise upon the construction of a written agreement under which the respondent company operates a street railway system in the City of Montreal.\nThe agreement bore date the 8th March, 1893. It began with the recitals that the city corporation had called for tenders for \" the establishment and operation of an electric passenger railway in the City of Montreal;\" that the tender of this company (a copy of which was said to be annexed) had been accepted by the city at a meeting of the city council held on the 19th July, 1892; that \" a specification for the establishment and operation of the said railway (a copy of which was said to be annexed) had been prepared by the council of the city and submitted to the company for approval l that, after discussion of the specification by the company and suggestions by it, the city, on the 21st December, 1892, had passed a by-law (also said to be annexed) amending the specification; and that the company had accepted the by-law and authorized its president and secretary to sign an agreement in conformity with the by-law. By the first article :\nThe Montr\u00e9al Street Railway Company aforesaid shall establish and operate, subject to the conditions hereinafter mentioned, lines of railway for the conveyance of passengers in the city by means of cars propelled by electricity, in the streets hereinafter mentioned, and in all other streets which may hereafter be determined by the council of the City of Montreal.\nThen followed a large number of articles relating to the system to be used, the powers to be conferred upon the company, the mode of construction, powers reserved to the city, the streets to be traversed, the time of completion, the removal of snow and ice, and regulations respecting the running of the cars.\nBy article 34 :\nThe company shall not be entitled to charge any rate exceeding five cent\\s for the conveyance of a passenger from one point to another (either going or returning) except between the hours of twelve p.m. and six a.m., when they shall have the right to charge ten cents, without transfer, as above provided in article 29. A passenger, on paying ills far\u00e9, shall be entitled to a transfer, .without further charge, from any one of the company's cars to another at a point where routes connect or intersect, so as to enable him to make one continuous trip from one point to another.\nThe 35th article provided for the sale of tickets at somewhat reduced rates.\nThen came the article upon which this action is based.\nBy article 36:\nThe company shall pay to the city annually from the first of September, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, upon the total amount of its gross earnings arising from the whole operation of its said railway either with cars propelled by electricity or with cars drawn by horses :\nFour per cent of its gross earnings up to one million dollars;\nSix per cent of its gross earnings from one million to one million five hundred thousand dollars. &c, &c.,\nthe rate increasing with the increase of earnings.\nBy article 37: The said company shall render quarterly a true and just account and statement in writing of the whole of their gross earnings, and allow proper inspection of all books, accounts, returns and vouchers for the purpose of checking and verifying such accounts by the city treasurer, city auditor or ether accountant appointed by the city council, such accounts to be rendered and to date from the first day of September eighteen hundred and ninety-two, and to take place every three months on the first days of December, March, June and September in each succeeding year.\nThe statements rendered by the company of their gross earning shall be so rendered accompanied by a statutory declaration to be made by the president, vice-president, treasurer or other authorized officer of the company verifying the correctness thereof.\nBy article 39 :\nThe company shall be liable for all damages which may be occasioned to any person or property by reason of the construction, maintenance, repairs or operation of the railway.\nBy article 40 :\nThe company shall be bound to construct the different railway lines in the manner and within the delays mentioned in the present contract; to establish their shops, workshops, offices and other buildings within the limits of the City of Montreal, and to comply with the other requirements of article 45 under the penalty of the forfeiture of their contract and privileges, &c.\nArticle 41 provided penalties to be paid by the company for contravention of the contract.\nBy article 42 :\nIt is agreed between the said city and the said company that the present arrangement or contract for the establishment and operation of the said electric railway shall extend over a period of thirty years from the first of August eighteen hundred and ninety-two.\nThis article then went on to give to the city the right, after the expiration of the thirty years, and upon certain specified terms and conditions, to\nassume the ownership of the said railway and all its real estate, appurtenances, plant and vehicles belonging to the company and necessary for the operation of its line.\nBy article 44 :\nIn the case of annexation by the city of any of the outside municipalities, the company shall be obliged, within three months after being ordered by the council, to extend their system through that new annexed portion of the territory not already provided with electric cars and to furnish a similar service as is furnished to the city.\nBy article 45 :\nAll plant, rolling stock, generators and motors necessary for the working of the said road shall be manufactured within the limits of the City of Montreal, The shops, power-houses and offices of the company shall also be situated within the city limits.\nArticles 12 and 46 provided a detailed schedule of the routes and streets by and. on which the railway was to be operated.\nArticle 12 :\nThe trac\u00e9 of routes in the different streets of the city as well as the establishment of circuits and transfer connections, shall be made and shall remain under the control of the city council. Until further orders the cars shall be run in the streets mentioned in the schedule of routes herein below indicated and designated on the plan hereunto annexed, signed by the parties hereto and by the undersigned notary, ne varietur, and the several circuits shall remain as they now are established But whenever the public service shall require it the city shall have the right, by simple resolution of the council, to change and modify such circuits, etc.\nArticle 46 :\nThe company shall establish and operate their electric passenger railway in the following routes and in the manner hereafter mentioned, to wit;\n(Here follow details specifying the various routes).\nBy article 48 former by-laws concerning the company were to be repealed, and the company relinquished all its franchises and privileges conferred by such by-laws and its contracts with the city.\nThe copy of the company's tender and of the original specification stated in the agreement to have been annexed to the agreement do not appear to have been put in evidence. One can only conjecture that the amended specifications were really embodied in the agreement and by-law. The by-law was passed the 21st December, 1892. It did not merely authorize the making of the agreement. It enacted in imperative terms most of the provisions of the agreement.\nThe terms of the previous by-laws and of the con- tracts between the city and the company are not shewn.\nThe company was incorporated in 1861 by Act of Parliament of the former Province of Canada which has several times been amended by Acts of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec.\nSpeaking very generally the company was authorized to construct and operate railways upon and along the streets in the city of Montreal, and upon and along the roads and highways in the Parish of Montreal (admittedly more extensive than the city), and in the municipalities adjoining the city, and the company was authorized to enter into agreements with the city and the municipalities, and they respectively with the company, upon various point relating to such railways; inter alia, the amounts of license fees to be paid by the company annually and the amounts of the fares to be paid by passengers.\nOn the 8th January, 1894, the Provincial Legislature passed an Act ratifying the agreements theretofore made with the city and with the towns of Maisonneuve and C\u00f4te St. Antoine, and giving the company power to consolidate with, or acquire the lines of, any other company upon the island of Montreal. By that Act it was recited that the company had converted part of its street railway system into an electric railway system and had made contracts with the city and the two towns mentioned with reference to the operations of an electric street railway within these municipalities.\nWhen the by-law was passed and when the agreement was made, the company owned and was operating a street railway system in Montreal, with extensions into surrounding municipalities. Originally the cars were drawn by horses and continued to be so, at least for the most part, until the making of the formal agreement. The purpose of the new agreement evidently was to provide for a change of motive power. The city engineer stated, in his evidence that the change to electricity was made in 1892. It is not clear whether he meant by this to refer to the affecting of the arrangements for the change, or to an actual change in fact of the motive power in use on some part of the railway. Possibly the construction of the new system had been begun in 1892, but it does not appear whether any part of the railway was operated by electricity when the agreement was finally executed.\nIt appears to me absolutely clear that the agreement was intended to apply solely to a street railway system within the limits of the city of Montreal, including 01 course territory that might from time to time be added to the city. Prim\u00e2 facie, that would be all that the city would assume to contract about. The agreement originated in the call of the city authorities for tenders \"for the establishment and operation of an electric passenger railway in the City of Montreal.\" The enactments of the by-law could have force, as enactments, only within the city, and it must be implied that they were intended to have force respecting railway lines within the city only. The details relating to dealings with the streets by the city or the company could refer only to streets within the city. So, also, provisions respecting the speed of cars, the places and periods of stopping and many other matters which were not proper for the interference of the council in localities beyond the city limits. The stipulation respecting the company's liability for damages comes within the same reasoning. The provisions for assumption by the city of the ownership of the railway, &c, should be presumed to refer only to lines within the city. In agreements with outlying municipalities similar powers were reserved to them respecting lines within their limits.\nThe plan referred to in the contract was one indicating the streets of the City of Montreal. The limits of the city were not shewn, except upon the west. Along many of the streets were drawn red lines. There was nothing in the contract or upon the plan to shew that these indicated lines of railway, existing or proposed, though the city engineer stated in his evidence that the routes were indicated by different colours. Two of these lines in red, one along Wellington Street and one along Centre Street, extended beyond the line marking the western limit of the city, but the detailed enumeration of the routes Nos. 4 and 18, distinctly specified the proposed lines as extending on those streets to the city limits. Indeed, on a large number of the routes the city limits were expressly mentioned as the starting or finishing point. In the cases of many others they were clearly within the city limits. Neither upon the plan nor in the schedule of routes does there appear to me to be any indication whatever that the lines of railway forming the subject matter of the contract extended or were to extend outside the limits of the city.\nUpon the argument before us there was no suggestion whatever that the plan or the schedule afforded any evidence that the words \"the said railway\" in the 36th article were intended to include extensions into the suburbs.\nI take it, then, that neither agreement nor by-law upon its face purported to deal with any railway lines or system beyond the limits of the city. The sole reference to outside municipalities or territory was contained in the 44th article, and that assumed to deal with them only upon the hypothesis of future annexation to the city, and when annexed. In that event the company could be required to extend its system into the added territory if this should not then be provided with electric cars. And this was not confined to the case of its being so provided by this company; it extended to such a provision from any source.\nIt is true that there were some stipulations not explicitly confined to \"the said railway,\" or to the lines within the city only; thus, the 34th article provided for the limit of the charge for conveyance \"from one point to another,\" and the right of transfer where routes connected or intersected; the 39th article for liability for damages by reason of the construction, &c. \"of the railway.\" The 40th for the periods of construction of \"the different railway lines.\" But all of these must necessarily be confined by construction to the subject matter of the contract \"an electric passenger railway in the City of Montreal\"\\ (as in the recital), or \"lines of railway for the conveyance of passengers in the city\" (as in the first article of the contract). These provisions come directly within article 1020 of the Civil Code, applied by the court below,\nHowever general the terms may be in which a contract is expressed, they extend only to the things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to contract.\nIn this class comes the 37th article of the contract, requiring the company to render quarterly an account \"of the whole of their gross earnings.\" This clause was ancillary to the 86th article, and intended only to provide a scheme for ascertaining the earnings upon which the percentages were to be paid. It appears to me utterly unreasonable to use it for the purpose of attaching to the 86th article an extended meaning. The very fact that when the contract was made, the company had and was operating lines outside the city seems to me to weaken rather than to strengthen the case for the city. If it had been intended that payments were to be made upon the earnings of the outside lines, one would expect this to be clearly stipulated for.\nAnd I can attach no weight to the circumstances that the earnings from cars drawn by horses were included, and that the earnings were to be computed from a day anterior to the execution of the contract\nNaturally, time was required for the completion of the electric system, and in the interval portions of the lines would be operated by horse power. The tender of the company was accepted in July, 1892; then followed negotiations upon the details; in December the by-law was passed. When construction of the new system was in fact begun, when electric power was first used on any part of the lines, we do not know. Nor do we know when the period expired for which payments under the former system were made. The parties chose to fix the first of September, 1892, as the commencement of the first yearly period in computing the payments, as they chose to fix the first of August, 1892, from which to compute the thirty years of duration. None of those matters throw any light whatever upon the point now in controversy.\nThe company's agreement was to pay specified percentages\nupon the total amount of its gross earnings arising from the whole operation of its said railway.\nThe natural meaning of these words confines the stipulation to the earnings from the operation of the lines within the city. The word \"whole\" does not extend the natural meaning. It is still a question as to what it is the whole operation of which is referred to. I think it very probable that the word \"whole\" was inserted in connection with the words ''either with cars propelled by electricity or with cars drawn by horses,\" with a view to assist in including both methods of operation.\nA perusal of the whole contract and a consideration of the circumstances existing and necessarily contemplated at the time of the execution of the contract appear to me to establish, beyond any doubt, that the parties intended the stipulation to be confined to the earnings from the city lines only. Indeed, had it not been for the strong contention to the contrary on the part of the counsel for the city, and its apparent acceptance by some of the members of the court, I should not have felt it necessary to indicate at such length the reasons for my own opinion.\nThen, we come to the question : What were the gross earnings of the company \" from the whole operation of its said railway?\" The company continued the operation of its lines within and without the city. What were the terms upon which it was operating when the contract in question was made we do not know; whether it then kept separate the receipts from the lines within and without the city we are not informed. Whether single fares were then charged for one journey from without the city to points within, or vice versa, whatever the distance, we are not told. After the completion of the contract with the city, the company entered into contracts for the operation of street railway systems in surrounding municipalities, connecting with the city system. By these it agreed to carry passengers to and from these municipalities and from and to points in the city and other points on its lines irrespective of distances, at single fares of the same amounts as between different points in the city. It conducted its operations accordingly. No account was kept of the portions of the railways for conveyance upon which these fares were paid The whole set of railways was operated as one system, with motive power supplied from the same plant within the city, and managed from the same office; and all the receipts went, without distinction, into the same treasury. It is contended that under these circumstances the receipts from all sources were receipts upon which the percentages were payable under the 36th article of the contract. I cannot agree with that contention.\nIt does not appear to me that the extension of the lines and the system of operating them made the extensions beyond the city a part of \"the said railway\" referred to in the contract within its meaning. The reasoning which I have already used excludes that conclusion.\nNor does it seem to me that either the fares for carriage wholly outside the city or the whole of the fares for carriage between points within and points without can properly be said to arise from the operation of the lines which alone formed the subject matter of the contract. The existence and operation of the lines within the city may have been necessary to the existence and profitable operation of the outside lines, but the earnings of the latter arise so indirectly from the operation of the former that they cannot properly come within the class of earnings to which the contract refers. And in the case of fares earned for carriage partly within and partly without, while the operation of the city lines was a necessary condition precedent to their being earned in that way so also was the operation of the other lines. I think that the proper way is to consider for what services such fares are paid. The fare for such a journey is paid partly for carriage within and partly for carriage without the city. The earning arises equally from the operation of both sets of lines. The portion which should be deemed to be earned by the outside line cannot properly be said to be an earning arising from the operation of the portion within the city to any other extent or in any other manner than if these were two systems under different managements with arrangements for the interchange of traffic.\nWhile the city stipulated against excessive fares, it did not stipulate that the maximum should be charged. The company was not bound to charge the maximum for the portion of a journey which should be wholly within the city. There seems to have been nothing in the contract which would prevent the company from making traffic arrangements with connecting companies upon a basis of charges similar to those upon its own lines, with provisions for a fair apportionment. Indeed a contract of that kind was made with another company in July 1893 under which as I would infer from the evidence of the respondent company's manager the companies are now working.\nThe local situation of the power plant and of the business office is wholly immaterial. The case would not be different if they were placed without the city.\nThe sole difficulty in the case arises from the system under which a single fare is charged for an entire journey, irrespective of distance. This was a system which the parties must have contemplated as not unlikely to be extended to connecting lines.\nThe Legislature confirmed agreements to that effect with two outside towns at the same time as that with the city.\nIf it once be granted, as I think it must, that the company could apportion by arrangement with another company, it must follow, I conceive, that it could apportion as between its inside and its outside lines. And in that case it becomes only a question of fact whether the apportionment made by the company is the proper one, or, if not, what other should be adopted.\nThe apportionment of earnings between different portions of a railway, or different railways operated in one system, must be found necessary from time to time in the Courts and in such cases reference must be had to the principles upon which those interested in such works are accustomed to act. It is not always possible to do this upon a basis of mileage or one otherwise capable of strict mathematical calculation.\nIn Pullan v. Cincinnati & Chicago Air Line Railroad Co. ([2]) an apportionment by the master of the court was considered and approved, although admittedly approximate.\nIn the case of the Manitoba and North Western Railway, where there was a mortgage on one portion of the line and the whole line was subsequently mortgaged together, separate receivers were appointed, and it was necessary for them to settle upon a basis of apportionment under the sanction of the court in Manitoba. It was also found necessary, during the litigation, to settle on a basis of apportionment between that railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway, which was then its only connection.\nUnder The Railway Taxation Act of Manitoba, R. S. M. [1902] c. 166, s. 5, a provincial tax is imposed upon the gross earnings in the province of railway companies owning or operating lines of railway within the province. All, or nearly all, of those railways extend into other parts of Canada, and a large portion of their traffic is between Manitoba and outside points.\nSimilarly, the City of Montreal and the neighbouring municipalities might be empowered to tax the earnings, of the street railway lines within their respective boundaries. In any such case it becomes necessary to devise an equitable basis of apportionment of through traffic, and the fact that it could not be ascertained with absolute mathematical accuracy would not be a ground for assigning to any one part of a line the earnings of the whole.\nThe city had no direct right or interest to or in any portion of the earnings. It was not even a mortgagee thereof. It had simply a contractual right to be paid amounts based upon the earnings of the city lines. The receipts were the absolute property of the company which could mix them together and do with them as it chose. The company was under no obligation to keep books or accounts in any particular manner. It was bound only to allow such as it should keep to be inspected by the civic officials, and to render statements of its earnings, though its mode of keeping accounts might raise inferences against it\nThe rendering of statements showing the amounts of the gross earnings from all sources does not appear to me to stop the company or to bind it otherwise to pay percentages upon the whole amounts, as deductions were made in these very accounts for the proportions claimed by the company to be due to the outside lines There may have been some confusion or some errors at first; but the amount now sued for includes percentages upon sums earned during the first and every succeeding year under the contract and claimed by the company as not proper to be included. The statements have been made up in different forms at different times; but the claim of the company in each year has been the same and the differences of form were matters of book-keeping only.\nThe courts below were satisfied that the system of division adopted gave to the city all that it could properly be entitled to, and, indeed, operated to the advantage of the city. I see no reason to dissent from that conclusion.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ethier & Archambault.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson & Hague.\n[1] 38 U.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench appeal side ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, ([2]) and dismissing the plaintiffs action with costs.\nThe action was for the recovery of $3,235.68, under a contract between the parties for lighting the streets by electricity in the Village of Saint Louis du Mile End, subsequently erected into a town municipality under the name of the \" Town of Saint Louis \" by Act of the Quebec Legislature, 59 Vict. ch. 55. The amount sued for consisted of three quarterly installments which fell due under the contract in January, April and July, 1900, and for which the municipality denied liability. The defendant, before pleading, confessed judgment in favour of the plaintiffs for $2,633.95, but the plaintiffs refused to accept this amount in satisfaction of their claim. The defendant then pleaded to the action, persisting in the confession and praying for the dismissal of the plaintiffs' action as to the balance of the claim, denying liability under the contract, alleging, that it had been executed in virtue of a simple resolution, whereas the municipality could act only by by-law. in such matters ; that no proper by-law had ever been passed in relation to the contract and that, consequently, the contract sued upon was null an4 void. The plea also set up non-performance of the obligations undertaken by the company, under the contract, in respect to the establishment. of a system of electric lighting in certain streets of the town, outages, inferiority of the system, operation etc. The plaintiffs answered, alleging that the contract had, been legally entered into, acquiesced in by the defendant and confirmed and validated by the statute above cited ; that the outages were inevitable resulting from vis major and that the defendant had admitted this fact and made settlements of accounts rendered in respect thereto.\nIn the trial court Mr. Justice Archibald found the facts in favour of the plaintiffs ([3]) ; held that the con-tract was valid and entered judgment in favour of the plaintiffs for the amount claimed less deductions for outages, with costs. The Court of King's Bench ([4]) reversed this judgment reduced the amount to the $2,633.97 (admitted by the confession of judgment), with $50 for costs and condemned the company to pay all costs incurred subsequently to the filing of the confession Justices Boss\u00e9 and Hall dissented from the latter judgment, from which the company now appeals.\nR. C. Smith K.C. for the appellants. The contract was intra vires of the Village of Saint Louis du Mile End ; Arts. 4, and 638, Quebec Municipal Code ; Art. 358 C C.; and it is an executed contract. The municipality could exercise its powers by mere resolution of the council; Arts. 460 464, 525, 616 Que. Mun. Code ; L\u00e9gar\u00e9 v. Town of Chicoutimi ([5]) ; Bernardin v.

It cannot say that the contract is valid as to part of the claim and otherwise a nullity. 20 Am. & Eng. Encyc. 1182 ; Simard v. County of Montmorency ([9]) ; Parent v.

Consequently, there can be no ground for the cancellation of the contract The resolution of the council to terminate the contract can have no effect.\nBisaillon K. C. and H. R. Bisaillon for the respondent. At the time of the contract the Municipal Code ruled as to the powers of the municipality and, under its provisions, (Arts. 451, 460, 464, 616, 638), it could act in such matters only by by-law.

([20]); Waterous Engine Works Co. v. Town of Palmerston ([21]) ; Art. 1214 C. C. In regard to the questions of fact, the quality and the quantity of light supplied to the town by the appellants were not what they should have been, according to the contract and the specifications annexed thereto. Their installations were imperfect and insufficient ; their materials poor and their operation faulty. The usual and necessary precautions against storms and atmospheric conditions were neglected by the appellants. There was no vis major sufficient to excuse them for the large percentage of outages nor for failing to comply with their obligations. The resolution in cancellation of the contract was consequently, fully justified and authorized under the resolutely clauses therein contained. The settlements made on the disputed accounts, from time to time, can have no effect upon the right of the municipality to put an end to the contract for cause assigned; they were not a waiver as to any other claims. So far as the executed portion of the appellants' obligations is concerned, it is covered by the sum for which the confession of judgment was made, and, as to the balance, the action must fail. We also refer to Armstrong v. Portage, Westbourne and North-western Railway Co. ([22]) ; Wigle v. Village of Kingsville ([23]) ; Young & Co. v. Mayor and Corporation of Royal Lamington Spa. ([24]) ; Hunt v. Wimbledon Local Board ([25]) ; Story on Contracts (5 ed.) par. 22.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an action by the appellants claiming $3,235.68, under a contract for supplying to the respondent municipality the lighting by electricity required for its streets. Before pleading, the respondent filed a confession of judgment for $2,633.97. Upon the appellants\u2019 refusal to accept such. confession of judgment in full satisfaction of their claim, the respondent pleaded that, as the said contract had not been authorized by a by-law, but simply by resolution of the municipal council, it was ultra vires, and that, therefore, the appellants' action could not be maintained ; reiterating, however, in the said plea, the confession of judgment for $2,633.97, and asking for the dismissal of the action only as to the difference between the demande and the amount for which judgment had been so confessed,\nThe judgment of the Superior Court maintained the action for the full amount demanded, less deductions for outages but the Court of King's Bench reversed that judgment upon the ground taken by the respondent, t1at the contract upon which the action was based was ultra vires of the municipality respondent, as it had not been previously authorized by a by-law, and dismissed the action as to $591.71, condemning the respondent, however, to pay $2,633.97 for which judgment had been confessed.\nThe appellants now appeal from that part of the judgment which deducted $591.71 from their claim. I am of opinion that their appeal should be allowed.\nThe confession of judgment and the judgment entered upon it stand unimpeached. It is, therefore, a matter of record, by that judgment, that the contract is one upon which the appellants are entitled to recover. A defendant who confesses judgment admits the plaintiff's right of action ; The V. Hudon Cotton Company v. The Canada Shipping Company ([26]) ; and the appellants could not have had a right to their action brought upon the contract if that contract had been ultra vires, so that the judgment against the respondent upon its confession is res judicata that the contract was not ultra vires and if it was not ultra vires for the $2,633.97, the amount of the judgment, it cannot be held ultra vires for the remaining $591.71.\nWhen the appellants refused to accept the confession of judgment, the respondent might have with-drawn it, but instead of doing that, persisted in it by the plea and a judgment was accordingly entered upon it in the appellants', favour. The respondent cannot and does not attack that judgment and it stands in full force. Art. 1245 C. C. The respondent was, therefore, debarred from further impeaching the validity of the contract and the judgment appealed from should have so determined.\nThe case of The Great North-West Central Railway Company et al. v. Charlebois et al. ([27]) reported in this court sub nom. Charlebois et at. v. Delap et al. ([28]) has no application. Far from impeaching the confession of judgment and the judgment entered upon it, as was done in that case, the respondent here asks that the judgment be affirmed.\nThe controversy raised by the respondent, upon the alleged non-fulfilment by the appellants of their contract relates merely to questions of fact upon which the two courts below have unanimously found against the respondent's contentions, a finding with which nothing in the case would justify us in interfering.\nThis appeal is allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court is restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Smith, Markey & Montgomery.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bisaillon & Brossard.\n[1] Q.

Q. \u2014Acquiescence \u2014 Motion to quash \u2014 River improvements \u2014 Continuing damages \u2014 Contract\u2014Protective works\u2014Discretion of court below \u2014Practice \u2014 Varying minutes of judgment \u2014 Costs.\nOwing to the condition of the locality and the character of certain improvements made for the purpose of increasing the water power at Chambly Rapids, in the Richelieu River, the parties entered into an agreement respecting the construction of dams and other works at the locus in quo and it was provided that the company should assume the responsibility and pay for all damages caused by \" flooding of land, bridges or roads, if any, as well as all other damages caused\" to the plaintiff d during or by reason of \" the constructions.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that, under the agreement, the plaintiff could recover only such damages as he might suffer from time to time in consequence of the floods at certain' seasons being aggravated by the constructions in the. stream and. that in the special circumstances of the case the courts below erred in decreeing the construction of protective works, inasmuch as the company was entitled to take the risks on payment of indemnity as provided by the contract.\nWhere a respondent, on an appeal to the court below, has failed to set up the exception resulting from acquiescence in the trial court judgment, as provided by article 1220 of the Code of Civil Procedure, he cannot, afterwards, take advantage of the same objection by motion to quash a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nOn an application to vary the minutes of judgment, as settled by the Registrar for reasons which had not been mentioned at the hearing of the appeal, the motion was granted, but without costs APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Ring's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was brought by the respondent, owner of certain water privileges and mills on the Richelieu River at Chambly Canton, against the company, which has power to erect dams and works on that river, and to expropriate private property for their purposes. The parties entered into an agreement as to the use of the water power at the point in question, the company agreeing that they would not expropriate any properties belonging to the plaintiff. The company was bound by its charter of incorporation to indemnify riparian proprietors for any damages which might be caused by the works constructed by them in the river for their purposes, but, by another agreement with the plaintiff, the company specially covenanted to indemnify the plaintiff for all damages that might be caused to his properties in consequence of the works constructed and to be constructed by the company, by the flooding of land, bridges or roads, and also all other damages caused to the plaintiff during or by reason of the construction of the dams and other works undertaken by them for the purpose of increasing and utilizing their water power at the Chambly Rapids, opposite the plaintiff's mills.\nThe company constructed certain dams and other works, at the point in question, which, the plaintiff alleged had the effect of flooding his lands, injuring his water power and otherwise causing him damages. He claimed $22.000 for damages and asked that the company should be ordered to demolish the works and to have protective works erected to prevent further damages to his properties. At the trial Mr. Justice Davidson was of the opinion that the plaintiff had suffered damages to the extent of $12,042, but, before pronouncing final judgment, ordered an expertise for the purpose of determining the extent and nature of the works which were necessary for the protection, in future; of the plaintiff's property from floods and the deflection of the outflow of the river caused by the dam in question and for further report as to how far the proposed protective works would do away with certain items of damage included in the said sum of $12,042.\nUpon the making of the expert's report, Mr. Justice Davidson, on the. 18th day of November, 1902, made his final judgment awarding to the plaintiff the sum of $9,247.75 with interest, and ordered and directed the defendants to construct certain protective works as therein set out.\nThis judgment was affirmed, with slight modifications, by the judgment now appealed from. The appellants now ask for the dismissal of the action, or, at any rate, that the order respecting protective works should be struck out and the damages reduced in respect to the items added by the Court of King's Bench, on appeal\nAt the hearing of the appeal, in the Supreme Court of Canada, the respondent moved to quash the appeal on the ground that, by the construction, or attempted construction of certain of the protective works, the company had acquiesced in the judgment appealed from and that their appeal could not now be asserted. This ground had been open to the respondent on the appeal in the court below but he had not there taken the objection by means of the exception provided by article 1220 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nR. C. Smith K.C. and Campbell K.C. for the appellants. Lafleur K. C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nGIROUARD J.\u2014In this case there is first to be disposed of a motion to quash the appeal upon the ground of acquiescence in the judgment of the trial court. The respondent has failed to take advantage of this exception before the Court of Appeal in accordance with article 1220 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He is too late do so now and the motion is rejected with costs.\nOn the merits we have only a few remarks to make. While recognizing the power of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, and in some cases its duty, to provide for the construction of protective works for the purpose of putting an end to further damages and of avoiding multiplicity of actions for the same causes, we do not think that this is a case where that power should be exercised.\nThe dam ordered by the court to be constructed in the Chambly Rapids is a difficult piece of work, involving the expenditure of a large sum of money, fixed by the experts named by the court at $20,993 ; it may be more, for, as we know, experts' estimates are seldom not exceeded in the execution. After the rendering of the judgment of the trial court, the appellants commenced to comply with its directions, but they soon had to stop the work done being carried away by the strong current. It was, no doubt, in view of these difficulties due to the locality and the character of the constructions that the building of the original dam and other works and the specifications were settled and agreed to by both parties. They proved to have been insufficient. The parties had foreseen this possible result and have agreed upon the remedy to be taken in such an eventuality. Clause 11 of the agreement says :\nThe said parties of the first part shall also be responsible for and shall pay all damages caused by flooding of land, bridges or roads, if any, as well as all other damages caused to the party of the second part during or by reason of the construction of said dam.\nWe believe that, under this clause, the respondent has only an action for the recovery of such damages as he may suffer from the works in question at any time, and especially in the spring, for it is admitted that it is generally during that season that floods may happen. The appellants prefer to run the risk of the money satisfaction or indemnity provided for in the contract rather than the more or less expensive and uncertain protective works ordered by the court. We believe that this agreement between the parties should be carried out. We will therefore, reform the judgment appealed from by striking out that part which provides for the construction of protective works.\nWe have also come to the conclusion not to admit the three items of $150, $350, and $347, which the Superior Court had also rejected and the Court of Appeal accepted, for no apparent reason, amounting altogether to $747.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs. The judgment appealed from is modified accor4ingly, and the judgment on the appeal from the interlocutory judgment of the 10th of June 1901 is reversed with costs on both appeals, against the respondent. The action of the respondent is maintained for $8,500 and interest from the date of the judgment of the Superior Court, 18th November 1902, and costs of suit incurred in said Superior Court less all costs of expertise which shall be paid by the respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs. Upon the argument of the appeal the attention of the court was not called to the fact that if the appellant succeeded in having the order for the protective works set aside the items of damage which had been struck off by reason of the contemplated works should be added to the damages awarded to the plaintiff, or a reference made to the courts below for some final adjudication with respect thereto. This point was first raised upon the settlement of the minutes of judgment and an application was subsequently made, on 31st May, 1904 to the full court* to vary the form of the judgment as pronounced and to increase the amount of damages to the $12,042 found by the trial judge.\nThe court having heard the parties by their counsel upon the motion to vary the minutes of judgment, as drafted by the Registrar, on the 1st June, 1904,* added a paragraph to the minutes reciting that, whereas three items of damages forming part of the statement or group of items referred to in the judgments of the Superior Court as u Group B., \" namely, item 2, for $3300 ; item 7 for $190 ; and item 12 for $1650 had not been finally passed upon, either by the Superior Court or the Court of King's Bench and inasmuch as they were considered as provided for and included in the protective works recommended by the experts, and it was ordered that the said three items should be referred back to the Superior Court to be investigated and adjudicated upon, the costs of such investigation and adjudication to follow the event. No costs were allowed on the motion as the question was not raised at the hearing of the appeal.\nMotion allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson & Hague.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Geoffrion, Geoffrion & Cusson.\n* PRESENT :\u2014Sedgewick, Girouard, Davies, Nesbitt and Killam JJ.\n"}

In an action for payment of calls S. swore that the stock was to be given to him in part payment for the good will of his business which the company was to take over. The promoter testified that the shares subscribed for were to be an addition to those to be received for the goodwill.\nHeld, that, though S. could, before incorporation, constitute the promoter his agent to procure the allotment of shares for him and give his note in payment, yet the possession by the promoter did not relieve the company from the duty of inquiring into the extent of his authority and, whichever of the two statements at the trial was true, the promoter could not bind S. by an unconditional application.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe material facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. The action was tried at Ottawa before Judge MacTavish sitting as a local Judge of the High Court of Justice, and resulted in a judgment against the respondent Sorley which was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The company then appealed to this court. McVeity for the appellants, referred to Nasmith v. Manning[1]; Denison v. Lesslie[2].\nFraser K.C. and Burbidge for the respondent, cited In re London Speaker Printing Co.[3]; In re Bishop Engraving & Printing Co.; Ex parte Howard[4]; In re Northumberland Avenue Hotel Co.[5]; In re Standard Fire Ins. Co.; Turner\u2019s Case[6]; In re Aldborough Hotel Co.[7]\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKILLAM J.\u2014This action was brought to compel the defendant, as an alleged holder of shares of the capital stock of the plaintiff company, to pay calls on such shares, and to pay a promissory note claimed to have been given by him for the first instalment required to be paid upon such shares.\nThe claim is that, by a memorandum in writing, dated and given to a promoter of the company before its incorporation and handed over to the company after incorporation, the defendant applied for the shares, and that, after the incorporation, they were allotted to him and calls duly made thereon. Notices of the allotment and of the calls are not disputed.\nThe promissory note was made in favour of the company. It was dated and delivered to the promoter before the company\u2019s incorporation, and was payable at a specified date before which the company became incorporated.\nIt is clear, upon principle, that, in contemplation of the incorporation of a proposed company, a person may effectively constitute an agent to apply on his behalf for shares of the stock of the company when it becomes incorporated, and to give a promissory note for the amount to be subscribed or any part thereof.\nIf the authority is, in fact, given and, before its withdrawal, the application is made and accepted and the note given, the effect must be the same as if the principal should make the application and give the note personally. And the authority may be given by the signing of the application and of the note and their delivery to the promoter to be handed over after the incorporation.\nI conceive it also to be clear that, if such an application and promissory note be signed and delivered, the authority to bind the signer need not be expressed but may be inferred from circumstances.\nNone of the decisions cited appear to me to be inconsistent with these views.\nBut the mere possession of instruments of this character, signed by another person, should not, of itself, be taken as giving or implying authority to apply for shares on his behalf and to deliver the note on account thereof. The company should still be required to inquire into the authority.\nUpon the defendant\u2019s statement of the facts, he signed the writings and gave them to Kelly as a step in a transaction by which the shares were to be acquired in part payment of the purchase money for the goodwill of the defendant\u2019s business.\nUpon Kelly\u2019s statement, the defendant was to take the shares in addition to those to be acquired by him for the good-will, and to pay up their amount in money.\nBut in neither view does it appear to me that it should be inferred that Kelly was authorized to bind the defendant by an unconditional application for the shares. In the first case, clearly, he would not be. In the second, the subscription would not be intended to be made independently of the proposed transfer of the business. If the defendant did intend to contribute this amount in cash to the capital of the company, it is not reasonable to suppose that he intended to do this if his own business was not to be taken over and the company was to become his business rival. Of course, if the authority had been expressed these considerations would be without weight; but the onus being upon the company to show implied authority, they are of importance.\nAs was said by Sir W. Page Wood L.J., in Rogers\u2019 Case[8]:\nThe course of the decisions has determined that to obtain a binding allotment there must be an application, an allotment, and a communication of the allotment. If, as in Shackleford\u2019s Case[9] there is a conditional application and an unconditional allotment, there is no contract.\nHere the defendant made no application personally. An unconditional application by Kelly, on his behalf, is not shown to have been authorized. The defendant\u2019s conduct, in attending the meetings and in receiving notices of the allotment and of the calls without objection, does not appear to me sufficient either as an admission of Kelly\u2019s authority or as an adoption of his application or as an acceptance of any offer to be inferred from the allotment. Everything is consistent with the view that he was treating all of these matters as a part of the transaction for the acquisition of his business by the company. See In re Aldborough Hotel, Company; Simpson\u2019s Case[10].\nLord Lurgan\u2019s Case[11], upon which the learned trial judge relied, does not seem to me to have any application to the case before us. Under the Companies\u2019 Act, 1862, Lord Lurgan became, in fact, a shareholder by signing the memorandum of association and by the registration of the company. He endeavoured to have his contract rescinded by shewing that it was induced by the misrepresentation of a promoter of the company. Here the question is whether the defendant ever contracted with the company to become a shareholder. The position taken by the Court of Appeal, that his transaction with Kelly did not, of itself, constitute a contract with the company, and could not be made so by any ratification, is beyond question. The argument before us was that the contract was made through Kelly\u2019s agency. This contention, also, is not sustained.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Taylor McVeity.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perkins, Fraser & Burbidge.\n[1] 5 Can.

Tanner v. Bissell (21 U.C.Q.B. 553), and Boley v. McLean (41 U.C.Q.B. 260) approved.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing the judgment of the trial court and declaring that an allowance for a road existed along the western boundary of Hawkesbury, located on the East Hawkesbury side of the boundary line, with the exception of certain places where eight specified lots had been granted by letters patent describing them as extending to the boundary line.\nThis action was brought for a declaration that a government allowance for a road existed between East Hawkesbury and Lochiel and the gores thereof, located in the boundary line between them. The question had previously been considered by a board of three County Court Judges upon a reference to them as arbitrators under the Municipal Act. A majority of the board having found that the plaintiffs failed to establish the existence of such allowance for a road, and having made their award accordingly, the Township of Lochiel appealed from the award, and upon such appeal, Chief Justice Meredith decided that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to try the question as to the existence of such road allowance and made an order directing the appeal to stand over until after the determination of an action for a judicial declaration which the Township of Lochiel should have liberty to bring, and thereupon the present action was instituted.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Ferguson, who dismissed the action and held that an original road allowance had been laid out across the gore of Lochiel adjoining the southerly boundary of Hawkesbury. He also found that no road allowance whatever existed along the remainder of the boundary in question, sometimes called the western boundary of Hawkesbury. On an appeal from that part of the judgment which held that there was no allowance for road along the western boundary of Hawkesbury, the finding respecting the southern boundary being left undisturbed, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, (Osler J. dissenting), allowed the appeal without costs, and declared that an allowance for a road existed along the western boundary of Hawkesbury, located on the Hawkesbury side, and of the uniform width of one chain measured at right angles to the boundary line, excepting upon and across the ends of eight different specified lots in Hawkesbury which were patented with particular descriptions extending to the boundary line. The plaintiffs now appeal. The questions at issue upon the present appeal are stated in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Killam.\nLeitch K.C. and O\u2019Brian for the appellant.\nMaclennan K.C. and Tiffany for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKILLAM J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario declaring that an allowance for a public road exists between the Township of Lochiel, on the one side, and the Township of East Hawkesbury, on the other, located on and along the eastern side of the boundary line, except upon and across certain specified lots in East Hawkesbury.\nThe action arose out of an attempt by the township of Lochiel, assuming to act under sections 622-4 of the Municipal Act of the Province of Ontario, R.S.O. (1897) c. 223, to compel the Township of East Hawkesbury, which is the adjoining township on the easterly side of Lochiel, to join with the Township of Lochiel in opening up of a highway upon an allowance for a road claimed by the last mentioned township to have been laid out or devoted to the purpose by the Provincial Government upon the original surveys of the township or by subsequent acts.\nThe council of the Township of Lochiel having passed a by-law for opening up such highway, to go into force upon the passing of a by-law in similar terms by the council of the Township of East Hawkesbury, and the council of the latter township having failed to pass such by-law, the matter was referred to arbitrators a majority of whom found that the Township of Lochiel had failed to establish the existence of the alleged road allowance; and upon a an appeal from their award to the High Court of Justice of the Province of Ontario, it was ordered that the appeal stand adjourned until the final determination of an action to be brought by the Township of Lochiel to determine the existence and location of the road allowance in dispute.\nThe statement of claim asked for a declaration that\na government allowance for a public road exists between the township of Lochiel in the county of Glengarry and the township of East Hawkesbury in the county of Prescott and between the respective gores of said townships, and that such Government allowance for a public road is located in the boundary line between said townships and the said gores thereof respectively.\nThe following plan indicates the respective positions of the townships of Lochiel and West Hawkesbury and the gores just mentioned: [Page 518]\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Ferguson on the 18th, 19th and 20th December, 1900, and he delivered judgment on the 21st of the following February.\nBy his judgment he declared that no public highway or allowance for road existed on the line between the townships of East Hawkesbury and Lochiel, but that an original allowance for a public road existed along the line between the gore of the Township of Lochiel, on the one side, and the Township and the gore of East Hawkesbury, on the other side.\nThe Township of Lochiel appealed against the finding that there was no public highway between the original townships. There was no appeal as to the finding of a public road along the gore of Lochiel.\nUpon the appeal the court was composed of five judges, one of whom, Mr. Justice Lister, died before the judgment was delivered. Osler J. was of the same opinion as Ferguson J.; Maclennan J. and Moss J. were of the opinion that there was a road allowance originally laid out between the townships of Lochiel and East Hawkesbury; Armour C.J. agreed with Ferguson J. that there was no road allowance laid out between these townships upon the original surveys, but held that by subsequent acts the Crown had made a road allowance between those two townships along the east side of the eastern boundary of the present Township of Lochiel. As, however, subsequent to the original surveys and before the acts referred to, grants had been made of certain lots extending up to the eastern boundary of the Township of Lochiel, the learned Chief Justice held that the road allowance did not extend across these lots. The result of these conflicting opinions is the judgment already referred to, excepting certain lots upon the line of the road allowance found by the court to exist in other respects. The Township of Lochiel forms part of a township originally laid out and partially surveyed about 1784 or 1785, under the name of the Township of Lancaster, provision being then made for its being composed of seventeen concessions only. The northerly and southerly boundary of the Township of Lancaster, as laid out, ran on a course N. 65\u00b0 (or 66\u00b0) E. the easterly and westerly upon the course S. 25\u00b0 E. Subsequently an addition was made, at the west end, of another concession, No. 18, and in the year 1818 the concessions from 10 to 18 were separated from the Township of Lancaster and formed into the present Township of Lochiel, the numbers of the concessions being made from 1 to 9.\nThe Township of Hawkesbury, now divided into East Hawkesbury and West Hawkesbury, was subsequently laid out fronting on the River Ottawa with the easterly and westerly boundaries upon a course N. 25\u00b0 E. The first and second concessions of this township were surveyed, commencing at the river Ottawa, before the year 1798. In the latter year, William Fortune, D.P.S., assisted by son, Joseph Fortune, laid out the balance of this township and partially subdivided it. Their field notes were put in evidence at the trial. Fortune began his survey in 1798 at a post which had previously been planted by him on the eastern boundary of the Township of Hawkesbury, at the rear of the second concession. He left there an allowance for road along the rear of the second concession, and then went on a course S. 25\u00b0 W. along the eastern boundary of the township, laying off seven additional concessions, putting a road allowance upon every alternate concession line, the last of these being placed upon the line between the 8th and 9th concessions. On reaching the point marked \u201cD\u201d on the accompanying plan, he turned westerly upon a course north 65\u00b0 W., in order, as he said in his notes, to intersect the eastern boundary line of the Township of Lancaster. Proceeding upon that line he laid off lots supposed to be in that concession until he reached lot No. 10, without having struck the eastern boundary of Lancaster and supposing it not to have been run. He then went back to lay out lots in the 3rd, 4th and 5th concessions. He was afterwards instructed\nto continue the concession lines of Hawkesbury to their full extent, with the divisional line between the Township of Longueuil and Hawkesbury\nand commenced the work on the line on the westerly side of the township then being laid out by him. He began this work at the rear of the first concession and proceeded upon a course S. 25\u00b0 W., marking off the concession lines at the west side of the township. After doing this he passed beyond the easterly boundary of Longueuil and along the easterly boundary of King\u2019s Land until he reached the point marked \u201cL\u201d on the plan, where he turned easterly upon a course S. 65\u00b0 E. until he came, as he said in his notes, to the line of the Township of Lancaster, bearing N. 65\u00b0 E., on lot No. 28, where he planted a post marked on the western side \u201cH\u201d for Hawkesbury and on the eastern side \u201cL\u201d for Lancaster. Then he measured on a course N. 25\u00b0 E. the depth of one concession, and ran the line between the 8th and 9th concessions, which struck the boundary of Lancaster again bearing N. 66\u00b0 E. on lot No. 21, where he again planted a post marked to show that it was on the boundary between the two townships. Similarly he continued the lines between the 7th and 8th and the 6th and 7th concessions to the boundary of Lancaster, striking it on specified lots in the 17th concession of that township. Afterwards he proceeded to what he called the northern corner of the Township of Lancaster, which would be at the point \u201cG\u201d on the accompanying plan. There he found an old post marked \u201c17-18\u201d and \u201ccommon\u201d and erected at the same point another post marked on the north eastern and north-western sides \u201cH.\u201d for Hawkesbury, and on the opposite sides \u201cL.\u201d for Lancaster. His two posts were subsequently found there in the year 1816 by Duncan McDonald, D.P.S., who was then completing a survey of a portion of the Township of Hawkesbury. A witness, William McKenzie; examined at the trial, told of seeing there three posts about forty-five years before the trial took place. After planting his post at the northern corner of Lancaster, Fortune proceeded to run what he called the eastern boundary of Lancaster upon a course S. 25\u00b0 E. In doing this he planted posts at distances of 104 chains and 12 links apart, going on until he intersected the southern boundary of the Township of Hawkesbury as previously run by him, at a distance of 1 chain and 3 links \u201cfrom a post marked 7 and 8 on the left of Lancaster line,\u201d and planted a post where the lines intersected, which post he marked on the eastern side \u201cH\u201d for Hawkesbury and on the western side \u201cL\u201d for Lancaster. Thence he proceeded to the rear boundary line of the 8th concession upon the easterly boundary line of Hawkesbury, and ran the line in rear of that concession until he struck again the easterly boundary of Lancaster at the point marked E on the accompanying plan, where he again planted a post marked on the western side \u201cL\u201d for Lancaster and on the eastern side \u201cH\u201d for Hawkesbury. In running up the line of the 8th concession he laid out and marked the various lots until he came to lot No. 14, upon which he struck the Lancaster line. He does not seem to have continued the division of 8 into the broken lots to the west of that point, but returned to the eastern boundary and laid out seven lots in the seventh concession, at which point his notes stopped.\nHe made out a plan shewing a complete subdivision of the Township of Lancaster, as thus laid out by him, into concessions and lots, putting around the township, including the portion where Lancaster projected into his rectangle, only single lines, and also leaving only single lines between the different concessions. The only parts in which he left the double lines commonly used by surveyors to indicate road allowances were between some of the lots into which the concessions were divided.\nWhen this plan reached the Department it was altered by indicating upon it a continuation of the Township of Lancaster by the addition of another concession, thus further projecting the Township of Lancaster into the Township of Hawkesbury.\nIn the year 1802 several patents were granted of lots in Hawkesbury along the eastern side of Lancaster, by which they were described as running to the boundary line of the Township of Lancaster.\nMr. Justice Maclennan was of opinion that there had been a previous survey of the Township of Hawkesbury before that of Fortune. With all respect, it appears to me, that in arriving at this conclusion, the learned judge was misled by the memoranda upon copies of the descriptions of lots in Hawkesbury near the boundary of Lancaster contained in the letters patent issued therefor, which were put in evidence. Upon a number of these copies were the words \u201cOrder in Council\u201d, with dates some of which were in the year 1797. The learned judge appears to have assumed that these dates were the dates of the issue of the letters patent; and the descriptions being by metes and bounds, he naturally inferred that there had been some previous survey upon which these de- scriptions were based. Looking at the documents, however, it appears to me that these dates were intended only to indicate the orders in council under the authority of which the officials were acting in issuing the letters patent which would be of subsequent dates. And referring to the list of such patents, which is found among the papers in the case, it appears that these patents were really issued after the year 1802, and one of them as late as the year 1829. Nothing has been produced from the records of the Department which shews that there had been any previous survey of any portion of the Township of Hawkesbury, except the first and second concessions, before Fortune\u2019s survey of 1798, which must, therefore, be treated as the original survey of the remaining portion of that township. It appears to me clear that Fortune laid out the Township of Hawkesbury abutting directly upon the northern and eastern boundaries of the Township of Lochiel, without any road allowance between them. His concession lines upon the north side, having reference to his notes, clearly came to the line of the 17th concession, and the southern boundary of the 9th concession and the line between the 8th and 9th were run to the line which he had laid out as the eastern boundary of Lancaster, and that line was run from the point where he found the post mentioned by him and planted another of his own, clearly on the north corner of the lot designated \u201ccommon\u201d and not at a distance of a road allowance therefrom. As to his conduct in marking off approximately the concession lines of Lancaster without making any allowances for roads, it is to be remarked that he was not concerned with finding the exact point at which the concession lines intersected the eastern line of the Township of Lancaster. He was marking that line merely for the purpose of enabling him to run the line of Hawkesbury at that part of the township, and although his plan gave no indication of the road allowances between the concessions of Hawkesbury, he had marked them down upon the ground, which would govern so far as they are concerned. No marks are found upon the ground to shew that Fortune left any road allowances along the eastern boundary of Lancaster. His plan indicates none. His field notes shew that he did not.\nWith reference to the point made by Mr. Justice Maclennan respecting the place at which Fortune, in tracing the eastern boundary of Lochiel, struck the southern boundary of Hawkesbury, and the distance which he found from the post upon the line between lots 7 and 8, in the 9th concession, the learned judge again bases his conclusion that an inference was afforded in favour of an intention to put a road allowance there, upon a similar error to that which has already been pointed out. He assumed that lot No. 8 had been patented in the previous year, whereas the patent was not issued until the year 1806.\nThe gore of Hawkesbury was surveyed by Joseph Fortune in the year 1816, and the gore of Lancaster by Angus Cattenach, in the year 1823. It is upon these later surveys, and not upon those of William Fortune in 1798, that the finding of the road allowance between Hawkesbury and its gore and the gore of Lochiel is based.\nAfter the year 1802 various lots in Hawkesbury, along the boundaries of Lancaster, were granted by letters patent from the Crown. In some of these patents the lands were described by metes and bounds with reference to a specified road allowance along the boundary between Lancaster and Hawkesbury, or \u201cin rear of\u201d one of the concessions of Hawkesbury. Upon close examination, however, it does not appear to me that so much weight should be given to these grants as has been given by the Court of Appeal.\nThe first of those to which importance has been attached in this respect was made in 1804, to Marjory McDonald and others, of lots 14, 17 and 18, in the 8th concession of the Township of Hawkesbury. These were described as going to within one chain of the eastern boundary of Lancaster. Two errors appear in the description of the lots in this patent. The point of beginning was stated as being at the north-east angle, and then, after proceeding to the south-east angle, the description turns eastward; and one boundary is specified to be the allowance for road in front of the 8th concession, whereas Fortune left no road allowance in front of the 8th concession.\nIn 1806 three grants of land were made to Cyrus Anderson, these being of lots 8, in the 8th and 9th concessions, and lot 9 in the 9th concession, and lots 24 and 25 in the 7th concession, of the Township of Hawkesbury. Lots 8 and 9 were specified to run to the allowance for road \u201cin the rear of the said concessions\u201d which would mean both 8th and 9th. And another boundary was specified to be \u201cthe allowance for road in front of the said concessions.\u201d Here again is an obvious error as no allowance for road had been left in front of the 8th concession. It is, then, not unreasonable to suppose that the reference to a road as in the rear of both concessions was a similar error. The description of lot No. 9, in the 9th concession, was also erroneous, as the width upon the front and the rear was made the same, 19 chains, whereas it is evident that the rear of the lot, being upon a diagonal line, would be much wider than the front; and if the reference to the road allowance as in the rear of lot No. 8 in the 9th concession arose through error, the other two patents of lot 9 in the 9th concession and of lots 24 and 25 in the 7th concession, being drawn at just about the same time, may have been drawn as they were through a similar error.\nIn 1809 a patent of lots 28, 29 and 30, in the 6th concession of Hawkesbury, was granted to Alexander McDonald, describing them as running to an allowance for road between Hawkesbury and Lancaster. In this patent also is found an error similar to that in the description of lots 8 in the 8th and 9th concessions, one boundary being made to be \u201can allowance for road in front of the said concession,\u201d where again no road allowance had been left.\nIn 1818 lot 32 in the 5th concession was granted to Alexander McDonald, it being described as running to an allowance for road on the eastern boundary of Lancaster. This lot abuts upon the line of the 18th concession, which had not been laid out at the time of Fortune\u2019s survey.\nIn 1830 lots 12 and 13, in the 9th concession, were granted to Charles Bethune, being described as running \u201cto the allowance for road between the townships of Lochiel and West Hawkesbury\u201d\u2014an evident error, as the lots were in East Hawkesbury and not in West Hawkesbury.\nIn 1832 a grant was made to George Mode of lots 34 and 35, in the 5th concession, and lot 36, in the 6th concession, which were described as running to the allowance for road between the townships of Hawkesbury East and Lochiel. These, however, abutted on the 18th concession of Lancaster, and almost wholly on its northern side, and not upon any line run by Fortune.\nIn 1837 a grant was made to Peter McLaurin, of lot 33 in the 5th concession, specified as running to the allowance for road between the townships of Hawkesbury East and Lancaster. This is in a similar position to the lots granted to Alexander McDonald.\nIn 1855 a grant was made to Roderick McRae of the west half of lot 16 in the 8th concession of East Hawkesbury, described as running \u201cto the allowance for road between the townships of East Hawkesbury and Lochiel.\u201d\nThese references appear to exhaust the cases of grants in Hawkesbury particularly referred to by Mr. Justice Maclennan in the Court of Appeal, except that of the grant to Anne McKay, of lot No. 1 in the 9th concession of Hawkesbury, made in 1829, erroneously assumed by the learned judge to have been made in 1797. This lot did not touch the boundary of the original Township of Lancaster at all, but was upon the southerly line of Hawkesbury, adjoining what is now the gore of Lochiel, where the original judgment of the court finds that there is in fact an allowance for road. One of the two grants in the Township of Lancaster, referred to by the learned judge, was of a lot in the gore. In the case of the other it is uncertain whether the allowance for road referred to was assumed to be on the east or on the west side of the line recognized as the boundary between the two townships.\nIt has been argued that, in speaking of the line of the Township of Lancaster, Fortune referred, or may have referred, to the line of a road allowance around the outside of the Township of Lancaster; but a consideration of his notes seem to me to leave no doubt that, in referring to the line of the township, he meant the mathematical line forming the boundary of the township itself, and not a road allowance. When he first struck that line going down from the north he specified the lot in Lancaster which he reached, and similarly for the other concession lines brought down from the north. The post which he found on the northern corner, as he called it, of the Township of Lancaster, having reference to these marks, was undoubtedly on the line of the township itself upon which the \u201ccommon\u201d lot abutted, and he carried that line down until he struck the line which he himself had surveyed as the eastern line of the Township of Hawkesbury. Evidently, the posts which he planted were on the eastern boundary of the township, and that placed where the rear line of the 8th concession was said to strike the eastern boundary of Lancaster was planted upon that line and not upon the outside of a road allowance. There is no indication of his having left a road allowance by marks upon the ground; his notes afford no evidence of any such allowance having been intended by him; they seem to me to be inconsistent with any such intention.\nIn February, 1789, before Fortune\u2019s survey of that year was made, a series of \u201crules and regulations for the conduct of the Land Office Department.\u201d was made by order in council.\nAmong these were the following provisions:\nX.\u2014The dimensions of every inland township shall be ten miles square and such as are situated upon a navigable river or water shall have a front of nine miles and be twelve miles in depth, and they shall be laid out and sub-divided respectively in the following manner viz:\u2014(See the note) and the Surveyor General\u2019s office shall prepare accurate plans according to the above particulars, which shall be filed in the council office to be followed as a general model, subject to such deviations respecting the site of the town and direction of the roads, as local circumstances may render more eligible for the general convenience of the settlers. But in every such case it shall be the duty of the surveyor-general and his agents or deputy surveyors to report the reasons for such deviations to the Governor or Commander-in-Chief for the time being with all convenient speed.\nNOTE\u2014The detail for the sub-division of townships, above alluded to, referring to diagrams to be filled in the council office is omitted.\nThe copies of model plans produced with the regulations shew rectangular townships, divided in different ways, and usually indicating reserves for different purposes.\nAround these townships, in all cases, are double lines. It is to be observed, however, that none of these reserves were made in Hawkesbury, and that, when Lancaster was reached, the rectangular form was broken in upon. It is possible that these circumstances formed the subject of a special report, although none has been produced.\nIt does not seem to me that, from these instructions and the model plan, it should be inferred, in view of the other circumstances, that road allowances were intended to be left on the eastern and northern sides of Lancaster where the rectangle was broken.\nMr. Justice Moss (now Chief Justice) thought it clear that it was the invariable practice of the Department, and of surveyors making surveys under the direction of the Department, to leave an allowance for road between adjoining townships. But, as Mr. Justice Osler pointed out, the Legislature has itself made provision for dealing with cases in which no such allowance was made. While this may not afford reliable evidence of the existence of such cases, it serves at least to throw some doubt upon the invariability of the practice.\nIf the learned judges in Ontario had been unanimously of opinion that there was such a well established practice in this respect that a presumption of its having been followed arose, this court would probably have accepted that view. But where three out of five of the judges who have dealt with this case have not felt that the circumstances warranted the presumption, it seems necessary for this court to deal with the appeal upon the actual evidence.\nIn the year 1826 a plan was made which was thereafter used in the Crown Lands Department as an office plan of the Township of Hawkesbury. Around the eastern, southern and western sides, and between Hawkesbury and Lancaster, were drawn doable lines apparently indicating the existence of road allowances. It has been suggested that there was in existence, between the date when Fortune\u2019s plan was returned to the Department and the making of this plan of 1826, another office plan shewing similar road allowances. This seems to me to be founded upon conjecture only. Upon Fortune\u2019s plan the names of parties were written upon a large number of lots as if to shew the names of patentees thereof. It seems to me not improbable that Fortune\u2019s original map was used for a considerable time in the office as the office plan. The road allowance apparently shewn on the plan of 1826 extends all the way along the eastern boundary of Lancaster cutting off from the boundary of Lancaster the lots which had been patented in 1802, as extending to the boundary line of Lancaster, along with all other lots along the boundary. If then any inference is to be drawn from this and similar plans of the existence of an intended boundary road along the east side of Lancaster, it would rather seem to be in favour of its being outside of all those lots and westward of the original eastern boundary of Lancaster, instead of being along the eastern side as declared by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and as contended for on the part of the Township of Lochiel.\nIn the year 1833 some of the inhabitants of the Township of Hawkesbury petitioned the Government for the completion of the survey of the 7th and 8th concessions of the Township, only a portion of which had been laid out on the ground by Fortune. The result was the employment of Duncan McDonald, D.P.S., who was instructed to survey the line between the 7th and 8th concessions from lot 9 to the boundary between the Townships of Lancaster and Hawkesbury, and the line from lot No. 1 to the said boundary between the 6th and 7th concessions.\nMcDonald was provided with a copy of a plan of the Township of Hawkesbury, and was recommended by the surveyor to pay \u201ca strict adherence to all original monuments\u201d and to make \u201can equal division of the unsurveyed spaces.\u201d McDonald then proceeded to survey the line between the 7th and 8th concessions, and that between the 6th and 7th concessions, leaving, as he stated in his notes, an allowance of one chain for a road between the townships of Lochiel and Hawkesbury.\nThe only patent shewn to have been issued after the date of that survey for any lot in the 7th or 8th concession, specifying a boundary upon an allowance for road between Hawkesbury and Lochiel, was that issued to Roderick McRae in March, 1855, for the west half of lot No. 16 in the 8th concession. The only other grant shewn to have been made after that date of any land in one of those concessions, was that of the east half of the same lot, made in 1895 to Finlay McAskill. The description in this last grant was not given by metes and bounds but only by the number of the lot.\nHaving regard to the decisions in Tanner v. Bissell,[1] and Boley v. McLean[2], it would seem that McDonald, being employed to survey only an old line, could not conclusively establish a road allowance along the boundary if none had been established by the original survey, although the adoption of his work might afford some evidence of an intention on the part of the Crown to dedicate as a highway portions left for the purpose upon such a survey. The conclusion which I reach is that no road allowance was left between the boundaries of the townships of Lancaster and Hawkesbury upon the survey of either, and that the evidence of the establishment of any such road allowance by the officers of the Crown, after those surveys, was too uncertain to warrant the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The burden was upon the Township of Lochiel to establish the existence of the road allowance and to offer evidence which would enable the court to come to some definite conclusion upon its location. It may be that, on account of the original placing of lots designated as \u201ccommon\u201d at the eastern end of the concessions of Lancaster, it was considered by Fortune, or by the Department afterward, that portions of the east lots could be used as a highway. But the plaintiff municipality has not sought to prove the existence of a highway on the Lancaster side of the boundary, and it does not appear that we would be justified, upon any surmise that may be suggested, in finding a road allowance upon that side.\nAs to the evidence afforded by the patents, it appears to me that the remark of Mr. Justice Ferguson was well justified, when he said, \u201cthey seem to me to shew only confusion on the subject.\u201d\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the original judgment restored, the plaintiff township to pay the costs both here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: O\u2019Brian & Hall.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.H.

I c. 14 (Imp.)\u2014Information for intrusion.\nThough there has been adverse possession of Crown lands for more than twenty years the Act 21 Jac. I ch. 14 does not prevent the Crown from granting the same without first re-establishing title by information of intrusion.\nJudgment appealed from (36 N. B. Rep. 260) reversed, Davies J. dissenting.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] refusing to set aside a verdict for for the plaintiff and order a new trial.\nThe defendant obtained a grant from the Crown of land of which the plaintiff had been in possession for 'more than twenty years, and the latter brought an action of ejectment and obtained the verdict sustained by the full court below. The only question raised on defendant's appeal was whether or not under 21 Jac I. ch. 14 the grant of the defendant was valid, the plaintiff's contention being that, before it could be issued, it was necessary for the Crown to regain possession of the land by information of intrusion which has always been the jurisprudence in New Brunswick. The statute as given in the text books and reports is shorn of its title, preamble and second clause, which are the key to its purpose and meaning. The statute in full is as follows:\n\"An Act to admit the subject to plead the general issue in informations of intrusion brought on behalf of the King's Majesty and retain his possession till trial.\n\"Where the King out of his prerogative royal may enforce the subject in information of intrusion brought against him to a special pleading of his title.\" The King's most Excellent Majesty, out of his gracious disposition towards his loving subjects, and at their humble suit, being willing to remit a part of his ancient and regal power, is well pleased that it be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same:\u2014That whensoever the King, his heirs or successors and such from or under whom the King claimeth, and all others claiming under the same title under which the King claimeth, hath been or shall be out of possession by the space of twenty years or hath not or shall not have taken the profits of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments within the space of twenty years before any information of intrusion brought or to be brought, to recover the same: that in every such case the defendant or defendants may plead the general issue, if he or they so think fit, and shall not be pressed to plead specially: and that in such cases the defendant or defendants shall retain the possession he or they had at the time of such information exhibited, until the title be tried, found, or adjudged for the King.\n\"And be it further enacted, that where an information of intrusion may fitly and aptly be brought on the King's behalf that no scire facias shall be brought, whereunto the subject shall be forced to a special pleading, and be deprived of the grace intended by this Act.\" 17 Ed. II. stat. I. c. 13.\nPowell K.C. for the appellant. Even if we assume, for the purposes of argument, that the respondent was in occupation of the land at the time the grant issued to the appellant, at common law the Crown could grant and the appellant could take the locus in quo. We submit that the rule, regarded either as existing at common law or by statute, that prevents a subject from alienating or his grantee from taking lands which at the time of the grant are adversely held by a third person, never applied to grants from the Crown of land of which the Crown had completed its title by obtaining possession in law. As to the means by which the King acquired, held and parted with his lands, see Encyc. Brit. (9 ed.) vo. \"Doomsday Book.\" As to rights subsequently accrued to the Crown, they were established by being made matter of record. 4 Co. 54 b. Where the King's right did not appear by record but was dependent upon extraneous facts, inquest of office was resorted to, which \"was devised by law as an authorative means to give the King his right by matter of record without which he in general can neither take nor part with anything.\" 1 Finch, L 423; Broom & Hadley's Com. vol. 3 p. 386; Chitty's Prer. ch. xii, p. 246; Scott v. Henderson[2]; Doe d, Hayne v. Redfern[3]; Doe d. Fitzgerald v. Finn[4]. Not only could the King acquire title to land by record alone, but he could also dispose of or alien his lands by record. Chitty's Prer. of the Crown 389; 3 Broom & Haldey 386; Finch L. 324; Jackson v. Winslow[5]. An intruder cannot oust the King but by matter of record; Co Litt. 277; Com Dig. Prer. D. 71; Wyngate v. Marke[6]; Louisburg Land Company v. Tutty[7], Goodtitle d. Parker v. Baldwin[8]. The contention that the statute of James deprives the Crown of the right to grant its land and its grantee to take under its grant when the land had been for twenty years in the possession of an intruder, has received such scant consideration from the courts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia that, if we except the judgment of Chief Justice Tuck, three or four pages at most of the reports contain all the judicial discussion of it. The judgments, the appellant submits, are really assumptions, ventured, so far as the judgments themselves shew, without any attempt to construe the statute itself. The English cases, with the exception of Doe. d. Watt v. Morris[9], never were considered by the judges, except by Chief Justice Teck, and even he did not have his attention called to either the case of the Atty. Gen. v. The Corp. of London[10] or Goodtitle d. Parker v. Baldwin (4.)|.\nThe legislature never could have intended the word \"possession\" in the statute of James I, ch. 14, to have any other meaning than its loose popular meaning. It cannot be construed as giving to that word the significance of legal possession, for in such case the statute could not apply at all to an information of intrusion, which only lies where the King had the possession in law, and his method of recovering possession was; as has been shewn, either by ejectment or by scire facias. The statute merely effects procedure and confers upon the intruder, in cases coming within the statute, no legal estate whatever. If it does create a legal estate, it is a legal estate entirely contingent upon the filing of an information of intrusion and cannot confer any right in possession until that contingency happens. If the intruder is out of occupation or possession of the land he has no right against any person who takes possession and cannot bring an action of ejectment against him. Goodtitle d. Parker v. Baldwin[11]; Doe d. Carter v. Barnard[12]; Brest v. Lever[13]; Nagle v. Shea[14]; Asher v. Whitlock[15], See also \"Law of Torts\" by Clerk & Lindsell (2 ed.) 310. The weight of authority is that the presumption of title from possession in an action of ejectment may be rebutted by shewing that the title is in fact in a third person. To an action of ejectment, jus tertii is a good defence.\nAnterior to 21 Jac. I. ch. 14, the King could grant, and his grantee took a good title in possession to, lands the title to which had once been perfected in him by possession without regard to the fact whether an intruder was in their occupation at the time of the grant or not. The statute of James relates solely to procedure and has made no change in the previous law whereby the King is placed under no disability to grant nor his grantee under any disability to lake what title the King has to his lands when an intruder has been in the occupation of them for twenty years. The case of Doe d. Walt v. Morris[16], cannot apply here as an authority for it merely decides that, owing to limitations in the procedure open to the King.(which limitations are by the provisions of the statute authorizing the sale in the particular case imposed upon his grantee), the intruder in that case could only be evicted from the granted land by an information of intrusion. That case proceeds upon a mistaken view of the remedies open to the King, and the King is not limited to evict an intruder from his land, It does not confer upon the intruder with twenty years occupation possession in law or any other estate in the land of the King. It can only confer an estate contingent upon the filing of an information and the finding of title in the King in the suit and dependent for its creation upon the act of the Crown in bringing a suit of information of intrusion. Even if does permit the intruder, after twenty years occupation of the lands of the King, to retain possession until dispossessed by an information of intrusion, the disability is one of remedy alone and when the grantee obtains possession in any way he is entitled to retain it. Title may be set up as a defense to a possessory action. An action of ejectment will not lie at the instance of an intruder, on Crown land against even a mere wrong doer, much less will it lie against the grantee of the Crown.\nAs to construction of statutes and authority of old decisions, we refer to Nagle v. Ahern[17]; Gwyn v. Hardwicke[18]; Pochin v. Buncombe[19]; Magistrates of Dunbar v. Duchess of Roxburghe[20]; Morgan v. Crawshay[21]; Tustees of Clyde Navigation v. Laird & Sons[22]; Feather v. The Queen[23]; Northeastern Railway Co. v. Lord Hastings[24]; Lancashire and Yorkshire Rway. Co. v. Mayor etc. of Borough of Bury[25]; Hamilton v. Baker[26]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson[27]; Caldwell v. McLaren[28].\nThe King's right to grant the land to the appellant and his right to take a title to it must stand or fall on the principles of the common law. And by the common law, whether based on legal fiction, as is generally accepted, or on broad constutional principle, as Story intimates, the well settled rule is that the Crown can grant its land when in the adverse occupation, or if any person prefers to call it such possession, of an intruder, no matter how long that occupation or possession may have continued.\nPugsley K. C. and Friel for the respondent. It has always been the recognized law of New Brunswick since the earliest settlement of the province, that where there has been adverse possession of Crown land for upwards of twenty years it is necessary for the Crown to establish its title by inquest of office before it can issue a valid grant. Doe d Ponsford v Vernon[29]; Smith v. Morrow[30]; Murray v. Duff[31]; Scott v. Henderson[32]; Smyth v. McDonald[33]. The law is understood to be settled by Doe d. Watt v. Morris[34].\nAs to our right to bring ejectment, we also rely upon the decisions in Brovme v. Dawson[35]; Revett v. Brown[36]; Cholmondeley v. Clinton[37]; Doe d. Harding v. Cooke[38].\nThe true reason for the passing of the Statute 21 Jac. I cap. 14 was not merely to change the law as to pleading, which would be a most immaterial thing, but it was to afford protection to the subject who had been in possession adversely to the Crown for upwards of twenty years The protection afforded him was that, before he should be disturbed in his possession, there should be an information of intrusion and the title should be tried, found or adjudged for the King. While the previous portion of the section provides that in the case of an information for intrusion the defendant may plead the general issue and shall not be pressed to plead specially, yet this is not the essential part of the provision. The essential part is that \"in such cases the defendant shall retain the possession he had at the time of such information exhibited, until the title be tried, found or adjudged for the King.\" The language of the section covers the case of other persons than the King claiming, and, although it is inartificially worded, the clear meaning is that, when there has been adverse possession against the Crown for upwards of twenty years, neither the King, nor any person claiming under him, shall be permitted to disturb the person in possession until after, upon an information of intrusion, the title has been found to be in the King. The statute was passed for benefit of the subject It was to protect the subject who had been in possession of land for over twenty years, against being disturbed in that possession until title had been asserted on behalf of the King and had been tried and determined. If, being out of possession for upwards of twenty years the Crown could be induced, as it might often be, improvidently to make grants to others, the effect would necessarily be to do away with the salutary object of the statute.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014This was an action of ejectment brought by the respondent to recover possession of a mill site and premises of which he and his predecessors in title had been in undisputed possession for over forty-five years. The appellant (defendant) claimed under a recent grant from the Crown, obtained on representations and under circumstances which, apart from his legal contentions, would not entitle him to consideration at the hands of the court if it was open to the court to consider them. As the appeal comes before us it raises legal questions only, and the first one is whether the statute of 21 Jac. I, ch. 14, places any and what limitations upon the Crown in the assertion of its right as against intruders who have been over twenty years in undisputed possession of Crown lands; secondly, if it does, can the Crown ignore that statute and give a grant of the lands to a third party and in this way enable the grantee without trial, finding or adjudication, to oust the intruder from possession. And, lastly, whether this court will reverse a series of uniform decisions in the Province of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which courts of those provinces for fifty or sixty years past have followed a decision of the English Court of Common Pleas and held that in cases of such possession by intruders for over twenty years the Crown could not issue a legal grant of the lands to a third party but was obliged first to proceed by writ of intrusion to have its right to possession found and adjudged. The appeal therefore, if allowed, will not affect alone the interests of the immediate parties but will overturn what has been frequently and uniformly decided by the courts of those provinces to be law and, may, as shown by Mr. Justice Hanington in his able judgment, be followed by most lamentable consequences in many parts of New Brunswick. With these, however, we are not to trouble ourselves but to rest content with expounding the law as we conceive it to be. The far reaching consequences, however, of such a decision as we are asked by the appellant to give has necessarily induced us to give to the appeal a great deal of close attention and research. The result has been, so far as I am concerned, to convince me that the judgment appealed from and the series of decisions which it followed alike in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were based upon sound law. On the first question, of the meaning and effect of the statute of James, we are not left to colonial authorities only. The case of Doe d. Watt v. Morris[39], decided by the English Court of Common Pleas as far back as the year 1835, is an authoritative and reasoned judgment (though perhaps not binding on us) on the very point. The unanimous judgment of the court was delivered by Tindal, C. J. and as this decision is the only English one upon the statute I cite from it as follows in order to show what was really there decided.\nReferring to the general and acknowledged principle of the common law that the King can never be put out of possession by the wrongful entry of a subject, the Chief Justice goes on to say:\nBut it is to the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 14, that reference must be more particularly made, in order to determine the exact position and rights of the Crown as to the inclosures which are the subject of this action, at the time of making this contract. And by that statute it is enacted, \"that wherever the King hath been or shall be out of possession by the space of twenty years, or shall not have taken the profits of lands, &c, within the space of twenty years before any information of intrusion brought to recover the same, in every such case the defendant may plead the general issue, and shall not be pressed to plead specially; and that in such cases the defendant shall retain the possession he had at the time of the information exhibited, until the title be tried, found, or adjudged for the King.\"\nNow, the inclosures in question having been made and continued for more than twenty years before the contract, and during the whole of that period the occupiers of the same having been in actual, though wrongful, possession, and no part of the profits thereof having been taken by the Crown within the last twenty years, it follows necessarily from the enactment of the statute, that if the Crown at the time of making the contract has been desirous to regain the possession in fact, it must have brought an information of intrusion; and that if such information had been brought, and the defendant had pleaded the general issue, the defendant would have been entitled to retain the possession which he then had against the Crown, \"until the title was tried, found, or adjudged for the KiDg.\" It was contended by Mr. Powell for the appellant that the Chief Justice's judgment, an extract from which I have just given, does not necessarily determine the substantial question whether the Crown could oust from possession by other means than by information for intrusion an intruder who had been for twenty years or more in actual possession of Crown lands. I should myself have had no doubt that the affirmative answer to the question must be drawn from the Chief Justice's reasoning. But if there was any doubt upon that point it seems to me to be removed by the concluding part of his judgment where he defines what the court did hold. He says:\nWe hold it unnecessary, therefore, to enter upon the discussion of the effect and operation of the statute of limitations upon the present action of ejectment, as we ground our judgment on the points of law before particularly mentioned; that the intruders, after twenty years' adverse possession, were protected even against the Grown itself, until a judgment in intrusion; that the commissioners were not empowered by the statute to sell any property of the Crown so circumstanced; and that there is nothing in this certificate of sale to shew that they intended so to do, even if they had the power.\nNothing could, in my judgment, be clearer or more definite on the very point on which this appeal turns, and I feel that I could not yield to the argument pressed by the appellant without over-ruling this decision in Doe d. Watt v. Morris[40]. In the part of his judgment previously quoted the Chief Justice had said:\nIf the Crown at the time of making the contract (which in the case at bar was issuing the grant to appellant) had been desirous to regain the possession in fact it must have brought an information of intrusion,\nand if brought, then, as he says, the\ndefendant would have been entitled to retain the possession which he then had against the Crown \"until the title was tried, found, or adjudged for the king.\" To my mind, nothing could be clearer than this and if it is the law the Crown could neither issue an effective grant or enter upon possession by its officers until it had successfully asserted its right on an information by intrusion.\nSince that decision was given in 1835, no case can be found in England where it has been questioned or adversely commented on. The case is cited with approval in all the editions of Shelford's Real Property Statutes down to the latest in 1900. The learned author says, page 142 of the edition of 1874:\nAlthough the King can never be put out of possession in point of law by the wrongful entry of a subject yet there may be an adverse possession in fact against the Crown. Therefore after such an adverse possession by a subject for twenty years the Crown could only recover land by information of intrusion. Consequently ejectment would not lie at the suit of the grantee of the Crown notwithstanding the rights of the Crown are not barred by the statutes of limitation.\nIf ejectment would not lie at the suit of the grantee of the Crown in such a case neither could he enter into possession as he did in this case and retain it as against the intruder having twenty years' possession, because such peaceable entry in order to be effective and change the legal possession can only be made by one legally entitled to possession. And as against an intruder having had twenty years' possession he is not entitled to such legal possession until it has been adjudged to and found for the Crown after and on the proper proceedings for intrusion. I cannot accept for one moment Mr. Powell's argument that the statutory right to retain possession until the Crown's right to regain it had been \"found and adjudged\" is a mere contingency beginning with the filing of an information and dependent for its creation upon the act of the Crown in bringing a suit of information of intrusion. Such a limited and narrow interpretation of the Statute of James is not only opposed to all the decided cases but is, in my judgment, directly opposed alike to the letter and the spirit of the statute. It would appear to me almost absurd to hold that the statutory right to remain in possession given to the subject who for twenty years had enjoyed it in fact was conditional upon the Crown bringing on information of intrusion and could be avoided by the Crown sending one of its officers to enter and take possession without form of law. Such a mode of repealing or avoiding in effect an Act of Parliament, passed for the benefit and protection of the subject, should not in my opinion be resorted to.\nThe redressing of injuries received by the Crown from the subject are, as is stated in the 3rd volume of Blackstone's Commentaries (marginal paging 257),\nby such usual common law actions as are consistent with the royal prerogative and dignity and as he cannot be disseized or disposessed of any real property which is once vested in him he can maintain no action which supposes a dispossession of the plaintiff such as an assize or an ejectment.\nThe notes to Lewis' edition of these commentaries say that this reasoning would not apply to proceedings in ejectment where the King would be, in fiction, only lessor of the plaintiff.\nBut while Cole on Ejectment, page 62, mentions expressly an information of intrusion as the method by which the Crown may recover lands, nowhere is it stated that the Crown can bring ejectment, nor was the research of the appellant's counsel able to produce any precedents for such a practice. It would seem to me therefore that the Crown's proper, if not only, remedy to recover possession of lands held by an intruder for over twenty years would be by information of intrusion. In Blackstone's Commentaries again at page 259 of same volume it is stated\nthat it is part of the liberties of England and greatly for the safety of the subject that the King may not enter upon and seize any man's possession upon bare surmises. These principles and practice affecting the assertion of the Crown's rights were far more important and vital in the days of King James I. than they are to-day. But applying them to the construction of the statute in question they confirm me in the opinion which I think prevailed with the Court of Common Pleas when delivering their judgment in Doe d. Watt v. Morris[41], that the statute intended to assure to the bond fide occupant for over twenty years of part of the Crown demesnes security of possession unless and until the Crown's title had been found and adjudged after trial of an information of intrusion.\nThe Statute of James it is argued was strictly one relating to pleading and practice. It is quite true that that statute does not take away the estate or rights of the Crown or give any statutory title to the intruder. But it did more than merely regulate the practice or procedure because it guaranteed and assured to the intruder the integrity of his actual possession until the legal proceedings had ended in an adjudication of title in the King. It properly defined and regulated the methods by which the Crown rights could be maintained and established and it limited that method to a mode of procedure which would enable the Crown to weigh and determine any equitable rights which the intruder might bring forward, guaranteeing him meanwhile in peaceable possession.\nIt is not therefore a question whether the Crown was to lose or the intruder to gain an estate, but simply whether under the statute of James the twenty years occupant could be turned out of his possession until the completion of the proceedings prescribed by that statute. If the argument of the appellant is acceded to that even if the Crown is limited in the assertion of its rights to the statutory procedure prescribed its grantee is not so limited the statute would virtually be repealed and what seems to me to be one of its substantive provisions, namely, the guarantee of the intruder's possession, annulled.\nThe question now before us has been frequently the subject of judicial discussion and decision in the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.\nIt first arose incidentally in Nova Scotia in 1843, in the case of Scott v. Henderson[42]. The question in that case was whether the Crown could give a grant at all of lands which were at the time in the actual possession of an intruder. The court was equally divided in opinion on the point. Chief Justice Haliburton and one of his associates held that any such grant would be void. But the case of Doe d. Walt v. Morris[43] was cited with approval by one or more of the judges who, while divided in opinion as to the particular point before them, did not seem to have any doubt on the question now before us or as to the meaning of Ch. J. Tindall's decision, or the effect of twenty years adverse possession.\nAfterwards, in 1863, the question came squarely before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in the case of Smyth v. McDonald[44], and was unanimously determined in the same sense as Doe d. Watt v. Morris (2). Sir William Young, the Chief Justice, and Dodd and Wilkins JJ. each delivered reasoned judgments on the point, and, so far as colonial judgments can settle any law, this question was supposed to be finally determined, and the decision of Smyth v. McDonald (3) has been accepted in that province as the law ever since.\nIn New Brunswick the same construction has always been placed upon the statute of James I. In the year 1843, in Doe d. Ponsford v. Vernon[45], the unanimous judgment of the court, then comprising Chipman C. J., Botsford, Carter and Parker JJ., was delivered by Ch. J. Chipman, who said:\nThe Crown * * having been so out of possession for twenty years anterior to the grant to the defendant in 1839, this latter grant by the operation of the statute 21 Jac. I. ch. 14, as expounded in the case of Doe d. Watt v. Morris[46] would not be valid without the Crown having first established its title by an information of intrusion.\nThe same question arose in the case of Smith v. Morrow[47], before a court consisting of Chief Justice Ritchie, afterwards Chief Justice of this court, and Allan, Weldon, Fisher and Wetmore JJ. and the court then held in the same way and to the same effect while at the same time most properly determining that\nthe possession necessary to prevent the Crown from granting or to prevent a grant actually issued from taking effect should be defined actual, continuous and unequivocal.\nAfterwards, in Murray v. Duff[48], in 1895, the Supreme Court again in a reasoned judgment reaffirmed the position it had continuously maintained as to the construction of the statute. The present Chief Justice Tuck and Mr. Justice Barker reviewed all the cases on the subject, and the decision of the court there it was supposed for ever settled the question so far as New Brunswick was concerned.\nThe case of Doe d. Fitzgerald v. Finn[49]. is cited by the appellant as being at variance with Watt v. Morris (2), and with the decisions following it of the courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. But while there is no doubt that Chief Justice Robinson took occasion in the course of his judgment in that case vigorously to criticise the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in Watt v. Morris (2), as to the meaning and effect of the statute 21 Jac. I., c. 14, his remarks were merely obiter as he based his judgment upon other and different grounds That case of Doe d Fitzgerald v. Finn[50] was decided not upon the construction of the statute of James but upon that of the provincial statute, know as the Heir and Deyisee Act, and of the proviso in the Ontario statute of limitations declaring that time should not run against a grantee of the Crown until he had received notice of the occupancy of the squatter claiming by possession. While there was no want of vigour in Chief Justice Bobinson's observations upon the English decison of Doe d. Watts v. Morris[51], neither was there the slightest doubt in his mind as to what that case really decided.\nThe Chief Justice, in that case, after quoting the proviso in the Ontario statute, goes on to say:\nUnder this proviso the grantee of the Crown would not lose his estate by a trespasser continuing upon it more than twenty years unless he could be shewn to be aware of such occupation. Can we then suppose that the legislature imagined that the Crown was to lose its estate by reason of an occupation under circumstances exactly similar? I think it reasonable to hold that the legislature have in this proviso recognized it as a principle that there cannot reasonably be said to be any dispossession of waste or ungranted lands of which no one claiming title has ever yet taken possession.\nBut no such proviso was ever introduced into the legislation of New Brunswick, and I venture to think, after a careful perusal of the judgments of the court of that Province that no legislature could be found there to adopt the principle which Ch. J. Robinson found embedded in the legislation of Ontario and upon which he decided the case now in review.\nBut the appellant contends that as he, in the absence of the respondent, entered and took actual possession, the latter could not even with proof of forty and odd years undisputed possession maintain an action of ejectment against him or any other person who was able to get into possession, and for this he cites the case of Goodtitle d. Parker v. Baldwin[52] and other authorities. I do not agree to any such proposition. If it was law it would in many cases effectually repeal the Statute of Limitations. The cases cited by the respondent are authorities for the well known law that a defendant in ejectment can defeat the plaintiff's action by proving a jus tertii even although he does not claim under such third person but not by asking it to be assumed. That was the point decided in Doed. Parker v. Baldwin[53] audit is on that point the case is cited in the text books. There the ejectment was for part of the Forest of Dean. The statute of Charles II. had declared the title of that forest to be in the Crown and to be inalienable and Lord Tenterden held that the statute of limitations then in force, of Geo. III., did not repeal this Statute of Charles II. That was not a case to which the Crown or its grantee was a party and of course the statute of James was not cited or invoked. It did not go further than hold that the presumption of title from possession may be rebutted in an action of ejectment by evidence shewing affirmatively that the right to possession is in a third party. If the appellant's contention on this point was maintained the startling result would be that as all lands in British Provinces were originally vested in the King no recovery in ejectment could ever be maintained against a wrong-doer by any one under a possessory title short of sixty years. Such a decision would most effectually operate practically to repeal the statute and would be directly contrary to a host of decided cases. See Cole on Ejectment, p. 298; Doe d. Harding v. Cooke[54]; Holmes v. Newlands (4). The statute of limitations in force when Parker v. Baldwin[55] was decided only barred the remedy but did not extinguish the title. The later statute of 3 & 4 Wm. IV., of which the New Brunswick statute is practically a copy, expressly in its 34th section extinguishes the title. Jones v. Jones[56].\nIt does not transfer the extinguished title to the possessor it is true, but it creates a statutory right or title in the possessor which he can invoke as against all wrong-doers. As is said in the notes in Smith's Leading Oases (1895) 10 ed. pp. 700-1\nSo that if he (the former owner) enter after that period (the statutory limitation) he is a mere wrong-doer as against any person who happen's to be in possession\nciting Holmes v. Newlands[57]; and again\nand this section seems to have the collateral effect of giving the tortious possessor a title against all the world after the lapse of the prescribed period.\nIn Doe v. Sumner[58], Parke, B. said that the effect of the statute is\nto make a parliamentary conveyance of the land to the person in possesssion after\nthe period of limitations has elapsed. And in Scott v. Nixon[59], Sugden, L.C. compelled an unwilling purchaser to take a title depending upon parol evidence of possession under the statute.\nThese remarks of course are applicable as between the claimant by possession and wrong-doers which the appellant would of course be unless his grant gave him a right to possession and they do not affect the Crown's rights of property which can only be extinguished by sixty years possession. But while it takes sixty years of possession to extinguish under the statute of limitations the title of the Crown, it only takes twenty years of such possession under the statute of James to stay the Crown from ousting an intruder on its lands until its title has been formally found and adjudged in the manner that statute prescribes.\nMr. Powell finally contended that even if his Crown grant was not good to enable him to maintain ejectment, still, that as a fact he had got possession and cannot be ousted. But in this I do not agree. The owner of land, it is true, who is entitled to the legal possession acquires that possession if he enters peaceably and is not obliged to resort to legal proceedings. But that assumes everything that is in dispute here. The plaintiffs suit is to eject appellant from a possession said to be unlawful. If my construction of the statute of James is correct, if the Crown could not give him a grant under which he would be legally entitled to enter and oust the intruder by ejectment, he certainly could not defeat the statute by walking upon the land in the owner's absence and asserting rights which the law only allows to owners legally entitled, to possession. Every plaintiff in ejectment must show a right of possession as well as of property and therefore the defendant need not plead the statute of limitations. Of course if the statute of James did not interfere with the Crown's right to possession even to the extent of providing that it could not be asserted as against one for twenty years in the possession in fact of the locus, then of course the Crown could grant and the grantee could bring ejectment or enter and take possession if he could do so peaceably. But that argument assumes everything in dispute.\nThere is one point more which I think the respondent can successfully invoke in this case, and that is that even if the decisions of the British Court of Common Pleas and the Supreme Courts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia upon the meaning and object of the Statute of James were not such as this court would have approved of had the question been one res integra still they are conclusive as showing at least that the true construction of the statute is very doubtful and in all such cases this court will hesitate long, I take it, before overruling such a series of provincial decisions as we have here, based upon an English decision which for over half a century has stood unquestioned and uncriticised in England, and which has down to this day been approved and adopted by some of the leading text writers of Great Britain. For my own part, even if I disagree with the conclusions of of these various courts, I would without hesitation adopt the rule followed by Lord Westbury, Lord Campbell, Lord Herschell and other great law lords in the House of Lords and refuse to introduce the precedent of disregarding a uniform interpretation of an old statute upon a question materially affecting property and constantly recurring, and which interpretation even though I was inclined to quarrel with it had been adhered to for so many years without interruption. Morgan v. Crawshay[60]; Gorham v. Bishop of Exeter[61]; and Lancashire and Yorkshire Rway. Co. v. Mayor etc. of the Borough of Bury[62] in 1889.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nNESBITT J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing the motion of the defendant below that the court set aside the verdict and finding of Mr. Justice Landry on the trial of the cause and pronounce a verdict for the defendant therein, and amend and give the postea and enter a verdict for the defendant and failing that to enter a non-suit and failing that that a new trial be granted.\nThe facts of the case are as follows:\nThis was an action of ejectment brought in the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick by the plaintiff below against the defendant below for the recovery of the possession of a small lot of land, containing about ten acres, situate in the County of Westmoreland, in the Province of New Brunswick.\nThe defendant below claimed the land as grantee from the Crown. The plaintiff below claimed the land as against the defendant below by virtue of the possession of those through whom he claimed. About fifty-seven years before the issuing of the grant by the Crown to the defendant, one Somers entered upon the lot in question and erected a mill thereon. From the erection of this mill down to the year 1892, Somers and those claiming under him remained in actual occupation of the land but without any right from the Crown. In 1886 the land was mortgaged to the plaintiff who in 1892 sold the property under a power of sale contained in the mortgage. About the time of the sale the holder of the equity of redemption left the property. The plaintiff claims to have entered into possession after the sale, but he did not remain in continuous occupation of the land and was not in occupation of it at the time of the grant from the Crown to the appellant. After the land was granted to the appellant, he, the appellant, entered into and remained in peaceable possession of the same, and this action was brought by the respondent to recover the possession. At the trial the respondent relied upon the common law and contended that, the respondent having been in adverse possession of the locus in quo, the Crown could not grant it, and he also relied upon the statute 21 James I. ch. 14, and contended that the Crown could not make, under the circumstances of the case, a grant of the land and that the appellant could not take any title thereto without the title haying first been tried in a suit by information of intrusion and found and adjudged to be in the Crown. The appellant claimed on the other hand, that the Crown could, at common law and under the statute, make a valid grant of the land, and that he under the grant made to him, was entitled to the land and to the possession thereof.\nThe case for the plaintiff, in the first instance, was founded wholly upon the claim of a presumption of title arising from long continued possession. The plaintiff called as a witness a Mr. Baker, an official of the Crown Lands Department of the province. On cross-examination, in answer to the question,\nThe lot was never granted, as a matter of fact until to the defendant?\nthis witness said:\nNo grant was ever issued till the Madison grant, that I know of.\nThe plaintiff himself testified that, when he first learned of the grant to the plaintiff, he went to the Crown Land Office.\nBeing asked,\nQ. Didn't you know by that provision that it takes sixty years to deprive the Crown of its title?\nhe said\nA. Every student at law learns that.\nQ. Then if you knew that you knew at that particular time you hadn't a good title, that the title was in the Crown?\nA. No I didn't, I didn't know anything about it. I never knew until that time that the grant had not issued.\nAt the time referred to the plaintiff was Commissioner of Public Works and a member of the Provincial Government of New Brunswick, and it is safe to infer that all the records of the Crown Lands Department would be open to his full examination.\nThis evidence is amply sufficient to rebut any possible presumption of a lost grant from the Crown, and also, as it seems to me, to afford proof that the records of the Department shewed no trace of any grant from the Crown prior to that made to the defendant, in 1895. If, then, prim\u00fb facie proof of the title of the Crown at the date of the making of that grant should be required it was sufficiently furnished.\nIt does not seem necessary to turn back to the old books for authority that the mere presence of an intruder upon the lands of the Crown imposes no bar upon the power of the Crown to make a grant.\nNo such limitation has been expressly contended for by counsel for the respondent. The expressions of opinion in its favour on the part of a former Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, in Scott v. Henderson,[63], are not now accepted in that province, the Supreme Court of which has decided, in the case of the Louisburg Land Co. v. Tutty[64], that the Crown could grant, notwithstanding the adverse occupation of a third party which has continued for a period of less than twenty years.\nIn Farmer v. Livingstone[65] this Court, on an appeal from Manitoba, held the plaintiff entitled to recover in ejectment upon a grant from the Crown made while the defendant was in actual occupation of the land. And in a subsequent case between the same parties, Farmer v. Livingstone[66], this Court also decided that the respondent's occupation did not even give him a locus standi to question the validity of the patent. See also Webb v. Marsh,[67]; The statute in question is as follows:\nAn Act to admit the subject to plead the general issue in Information of Intrusion brought on behalf of the King's Majesty and retain his possession till trial.\nWhere the King out of his prerogative royal may enforce the subject in Information of Intrusion brought against him to a special pleading of his title. The King's most Excellent Majesty, out of his gracious disposition towards his loving subjects, and at their humble suit, being willing to remit a part of his ancient and regal power, is well pleased that it be enacted; and be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same:\u2014That whensoever the King, His Heirs or Successors, and such from or under whom the King claimeth, and all others claiming wider the same title under which the King claimeth, hath been or shall be out of possession by the space of twenty years or hath not or shall not have taken the profits of any lands, tenements or hereditaments within the space of twenty years before any information of Intrusion brought or to be brought, to recover the same: that in every such case the defendant or defendants may plead the general issue, if he or they so think fit, and shall not be pressed to plead specially; and that in such cases the defendant or defendants shall retain the possession he or they had at the time of such information exhibited, until the title be tried, found, or adjudged for the King.\nThe early books touching upon the Statute of James are Viner in his Abridgement, Comyn in his Digest and Bacon in his Abridgement, and they only refer to the statute as a matter of practice. Viner refers to it in vol. 17, page 217, under the heading \"Statutes relating to Intrusions;\" Comyn refers to it vol. 7, page 81, under the heading of \" Pleadings\", and Bacon in title \"Prerogative\" E, page 102, under the heading \"Judicial Proceedings.\" And a note to Dyer, page 238, cited by Robinson C.J. in Doe d. Fitzgerald v. Finn[68], says:\nThe whole effect of the statute is, the subject is allowed to plead the general issue and retain possession till trial.\nThe first case upon the statute, so far as the reports show, is Goodtitle d. Parker v. Baldwin[69], a case which has apparently escaped the notice of the different courts and counsel who have considered the statute. The land in this case formed part of the forest of Dean. One of the pieces had been in the possession of the lessor of the plaintiff, his father and mother, for upwards of sixty years, and all of them had been in their possession for upwards of forty years, without any interference on the part of the Crown. The defendant, in some way which does not appear, became possessed of the lands, and the lessor of the plaintiff brought ejectment to remove him from the possession. Bayley J. at the trial left it to the jury to presume that the possession had been with the license of the Crown, as being the only way to account legally for their respective and adverse possessions, and the jury found for the defendant. Wigley, counsel for the plaintiff, on motion for a new trial relied on, among other points, the statute of 21 Jac. I., ch. 1. Ellenborough C.J. delivered judgment for the court in favour of the defendant and refused the motion for a new trial. He made no special reference to the Act, but said, among other things,\nthat the plaintiff must recover against the defendant by the strength of his own title and not by the weakness of the defendant's title.\nThe judgment of the court, since the point was taken, would indicate that the court was of opinion against the statute having any application in favour of the plaintiff and is an express decision in favour of the defendant in this case.\nThe next case (1835) is that of Doe d. Watt v. Morris[70]. The head note is as follows:\nHeld, that the conveyance of a manor by the commissioners of woods and forests on the part of the Crown, did not entitle the purchaser to maintain ejectment against the possessor of land inclosed from the waste of the manor, more than twenty years before the conveyance, without leave of the Crown. I cite the head-note as shewing what the learned reporter conceived to be the point actually decided, and because such an entirely different view has been taken by various courts of what that case did actually decide.\nWhat was actually decided was that the Commissioners had not purported to sell the lands and that the statute could not be read as authorizing the Commissioners to sell a right of recovery or any land the Crown was not in possession of. In fact Chief Justice Tindal would seem to imply in the most unmistakable language that, if the grant had been from the Crown direct of the very land, it would have been treated as an assignment of the prerogative right to bring an action to obtain possession, and there is no hint that the title of the Crown was gone or that, if an action was not necessary to obtain possession, the Crown could not have taken possession peaceably.\nThe next reported case is Attorney-General v. Parsons[71] in 1836. It grew out of the case of Doe d. Watt v. Morris.[72]. The lessor of the plaintiff having failed in the ejectment suit, an information of intrusion was exhibited in the name of the Attorney-General, to eject the intruder. Part of the head-note is\nthe tide of the Crown to lands of which it has been out of possession for twenty years may be tried in the information of intrusion itself and need not be first found by inquest of office, the only effect of the statute 21 Jac. I., ch. 14, being to throw the onus of proving title in the first instance on the Crown.\nAccording to the report in Meeson & Welsby the defendant's cousel claimed that the statute enabled the defendant, where the King had been out of possession for twenty years, to retain the possession from the expiration of the twenty years until the title was tried, found or adjudged for the King, and, therefore, an office was necessary. Lord Abinger, in reply, stated that,\nwhereas at common law the defendant was put to show his title on the record, the statute says he may in such case throw the onus probandi on the Crown.\nAbinger C. B., in giving judgment, said:\nIt means only that the onus is thrown on the Crown to prove its title in the first instance. The defendant shall not be bound to plead his title specially where he has had twenty years possession without disturbance; in that case the Crown stands in the same situation as a subject.\nAlderson B. said:\nwhere the defendant pleads not guilty or non intrusit though the Crown prove the intrusion, he is entitled to hold the possession until the Crown also proves title.\nThe case of The Attorney-General v. Parsons is also repored in the Law Journal,[73], where the judgment of the court is given as follows:\nThe object of the statute is simply to provide that, after a possession of twenty years, the defendant shall not be bound to set out his title by a special plea, which otherwise he would have been bound to do. The proof of title in that case is thrown upon the Crown, and even though the King prove an intrusion, yet the defendant shall hold possession unless the title of the Crown be proved. There is no need of any distinct proceedings.\nWhile it is true that in this case the point before the court was whether an inquest of office should be held or not, yet the language of the judges is inconsistent with their entertaining the idea that the statute went further than merely prescribing procedure. It is more than inconsistent, it is impliedly an absolute repudiation of the claim put forward for the defendant that the King is disseised by the statute. What is the point of the defendant's contention that the King's title should first be established by office found? It is this, that if the King was disseised an information of intrusion would not lie, as possession in the King is the essential condition of the action, and as the statute had in the counsels view disseised the King it was necessary that the King should re-establish his title and reclothe himself with possession by office found before the information of intrusion could be legally exhibited. The reply of the court must be taken in connection with the contention. When the court says in reply to the argument that an inquest of office must first be brought,\nthat the object of the statute is simply to provide that after a possession of twenty years the defendant shall not be bound to set out his title, etc.\nit necessarily, by implication, negatives the claim that the statute disseizes the King. In the case of Attorney-General v. The Corporation of London[74], in 1850 the question of there being a substantive right conferred by the statute came up and was decided by Lord Cottenham. The Corporation of London in its answer set up, as a specific ground for resisting discovery that to compel the discovery would be to violate the spirit and intention of the statute 21 Jac. I. ch. 14 (of which it claimed the benefit), and a subversion of the common law right and principle that the claimant of any estate of freehold shall recover by the strength of his own title and shall have no right to a discovery of the title by which such estate is held Lord Cottenham said, on page 258:\nNow it is said that the statute of King James, as pleaded in the answer, gives a party against whom the Crown is litigating an advantage different from that which belongs to every other defendant. I do not at all so understand it. The object of the statute was to put a party who was contesting with the Crown in the same situation as a party who was contesting with any other plaintiff; but here in equity the Crown and subject always were on the same footing and they are on the same footing now there was no evil, therefore, to be remedied. At law, however arising from technical reasoning, there was a great injury accruing to a defendant, in litigation with the Grown. The Crown's title was taken to be proved unless a contrary title was set up and pleaded. That was a privilege which the Crown maintained against the defendant at law; but no such privilege has ever been asserted here, nor am I at all aware of there being any different rule, as far as discovery is concerned, applicable to a suit between the Crown and a subject and a suit between ordinary parties.\nIn Williams & Yates \"Law of Ejectment\" (1894), at p. 7, I find:\nThe Crown may recover possession of lands by an information of intrusion exhibited by the Attorney General\nciting Manning's Practice, page 189, and Cole's Ejectment, page 162, and stating that:\nThe defendant to an information of intrusion cannot plead the general issue but must specially plead his own title unless the Crown has been out of possession for more than twenty years and then the onus is on the Crown to prove its title.\nI find in Shelford on Real Property Statutes[75] the rule to be that\nejectment would not lie at the suit of the grantee of the Crown although the rights of the Crown are not varied by the statute of limitations.\nWe are of course in this case not troubled by this consideration since the grantee of Crown is in possession and the intruder on the Crown's land seeks to recover in ejectment against such grantee.\nIn Ontario, in 1844, the case of Doe d. Fitzgerald v. Finn[76], settled the construction of the statute for that province. The conclusions reached in this case are as follows: The Statute of James is simply a regulation of procedure. Before the statute the King could make an effective grant of the land of which he had acquired possession without regard to the fact that an intruder was in possession at the time of the grant. The statute did not change the law in this respect, and the grantee of the Crown takes the King's title including the possession and may evict the intruder by an action of ejectment. This judgment has been acted on and recognized as law in Altorney General v. Stanley[77]; Reg. v. Sinnott,[78].\nThe respondent relied in the court below on the judgment in Doe d. Watt v. Morris[79] in 1835; the opinion of Bliss J. in Scott v. Henderson,[80] in 1843; the judgment of the court in Smyth v. McDonald,[81] in 1863; the judgment of the New Brunswick court in Doe d. Ponsford v. Vernon,[82] in 1843; the judgment of the New Brunswick court in Smith v. Morrow,[83] in 1872; and the opinion of Chief Justice Tuck in Murray v. Duff[84] in 1895.\nTurning to the New Brunswick cases, the first is Doe d. Ponsford v. Vernon, (6). So far as the report shews, the statute was not discussed by counsel on either side. The court of its own motion referred to Doe d. Watt v. Morris (3). The facts of the case are peculiar:\u2014In 1784 the Crown granted Lot No. 33 to Egbert and others. Sometime after this grant and before the year 1786 the Crown granted Lot No. 39 in the rear of Lot No. 33, to Brundage and Coombs. The description in the grant of No. 33 was very loose. Followed literally, it would stop short of No. 39, and be about fifty acres too small. In 1786 the Crown granted to Shaw a piece of land adjoining Lot No. 33 and by the description Lot No. 33 was recognized as extending back to Lot No. 39. In 1787 the Crown granted another lot adjoining to Beaman and the description in this grant also recognized Lot No. 33 as extending back to No 39. In 1839 the Crown granted \"Lot A.\" to the defendant, describing it as lying between lots No. 33 and No. 39. The jury found that a lot No. 33 extended back to Lot No. 39, and that the locus in quo was included in the prior grant. The following extract contains all of the judgment which treats of the Statute of James:\nThe case may be considered in another point of view. The Crown must be deemed at least out of possession to the extent of the Egbert grant as recognized in the Shaw and Beaman grants, and having been so out of possession for twenty years anterior to the grant to the defendant in 1839, this later grant by the operation of the statute 21 Jac. I. ch. 14 as expounded in Doe d. Watts v. Morris, (I) could not be valid without the Crown first having established its title by an information of intrusion.\nIn considering this dictum it must be remembered that, as far as appears from the report, the point involved was not argued before the court below; that the opposing authorities were neither cited to, nor considered by, the court and that the dictum was not a statement by the court of its own opinion but was a casual observation as to the holding in Dos d. Watt v. Morris[85].\nThe next New Brunswick case is Smith v. Morrow[86], an action of trespass in which the plaintiff was an intruder, who claimed to have twenty years possession of the land before the Crown granted it to the defendant. The action was for trespass for the defendant cutting on the land after he, the defendant, got the grant. The plaintiff, on the trial, requested Weldon J. to leave the question of his possession to the jury, which the judge refused to do. The verdict having been found for the defendant, the plaintiff moved for a new trial.\nAllen J. delivered the judgment of the court After stating the facts of the case, and the plaintiff's contention. that the Crown could not make a grant without office found, he proceeded as follows: To prevent the Crown from granting, or to prevent a grant actually issued from taking effect, the possession should be denned, actual, continuous and unequivocal, and wholly opposed to mere isolated acts of trespass on the Crown's estate without visible limits or effect. To hold that mere acts of locating on the wilderness lands of the Crown, and this too without clearly apparent bounds, would be sufficient to prevent the Crown from granting without office found, would, in my opinion, be most unreasonable and disastrous. The majority of the court think there was evidence of acts of possession by the plaintiff and those under whom he claims, outside of the Kimball grant, for the period of twenty years, which ought to have been submitted to the jury.\nIt was taken for granted by the court and the counsel for the defendant that the Crown was incapacitated from granting land which, for twenty years, had been in the occupation of an intruder. The statute was not discussed at all, and the only question before the court was whether there was evidence of there being acts of possession which should have been left to the\nThe last New Brunswick case is Murray v. Duff[87]. This case was one of trespass also. The decision of the court did not go on the effect of the statute of James, and the Chief Justice was the only judge who expressed an opinion upon it. He based his judgment chiefly on Doe d. Watt v. Morris[88]. and he summed up his views of the decision in that case in these words:\nBefore leaving Doe d. Watt v. Morris (2) I desire to say that in my opinion it is in that case distinctly held that, after twenty years possession against the Crown, the effect of 21 Jac. I. ch. 14, was to disable the King from granting the estate until the title had been found by office; that the right of the Crown in such case was nothing more than the right to file an information of intrusion, a right that could not be assigned or, at all events, only by words expressly granting it. In other words the court decided, under the circumstances stated in the special case, that the right of maintaining an action of ejectment is barred by the statute of limitations, 21 Jac. I. ch. 14. The Chief Justice's view, I think, was erroneous as it was not held by Chief Justice Tyndal that the effect of the statute was to disable the Crown from granting the estate, but that, to evict an intruder after the Crown had been out of possession for twenty years, the Crown must file an information of intrusion.\nTurning to the Nova Scotia cases, the case of Scott v. Henderson[89] was not a case under the statute of James, although the statute was considered in it. Halliburton C J., and Haliburton J. were of the opinion that the statute contained nothing which would deprive the King of the right of granting his lands if he had the right to do so before the passing of the Act. Hill J. expressed no opinion on the effect of the statute upon the King's power to grant land. Bliss J., on page 143, expressed the opinion that the statute had broken in upon the common law principle and recognized an adverse possession against the Crown after twenty years, in which case he claimed the Crown could not now grant without first proceeding against the intruder.\nThe case of Smyth v. McDonald[90] did really decide squarely that the statute disables the Crown from granting. The facts of this case brought it within the statute of James. Young C.J., at page 280 of the report, said:\nDoe d. Watt v. Morris[91], if not precisely in point, is nearly so, and the defendants having twenty years possession between themselves and their ancestors were protected by the statute.\nBliss J. simply concurred in the opinion that the judgment of the court should be for the defendant who was the intruder. Dodd and Wilkins JJ. disposed of the question in a very few lines, holding that the grantee of the Crown, the then plaintiff, could not take the land by the grant, as the King was out of possession and could not grant it.\nIt is clear that title cannot be acquired against the Crown in a less period than sixty years, and that, until such title is acquired, the intruder has only a right to claim that he must be evicted by an information of intrusion, and I cannot see that the effect of our holding that a wrong construction has been put upon the statute of James by the courts of New Brunswick would have the effect of doing more than saying to an intruder upon Crown property, you must be in possession for sixty years before the title of the Crown is extinguished: The intruder's possession is not acquisitive but merely extinctive, and the Crown's title is not extinguished by a less period of possession than sixty years.\nThe chief ground urged was the disturbance of title. I think the cases establish that, where the construction of a statute is involved, the plain words of the statute must be given affect to. See particularly the case of Hamilton v. Baker[92]. In 1859, The Glantanner[93] was decided by Dr. Lushington. In 1865, he approved of this case and made it the basis of the decision in The Mary Ann[94]. In 1868, Sir Robert Pillimore approved of The Mary Ann (3) in The Feronia[95]. In 1877, the Court of Appeal accepted without comment and acted upon the preceding case, the court consisting of James, Brett and Amphlett L.JJ.; In re Rio Grande Do Sul Steamship Co.[96]. In 1883, Sir Robert Phillimore, when the case of The Mary Ann (3) was questioned before him, expressly approved of it and referred to the fact that it had been treated as settled law in the then last edition of Maude and Pollock on \"Merchant Shipping.\" In 1886, Sir James Hannen, in the case of The Ringdove[97], thought that the reasoning of Dr. Lushington was not altogether satisfactory to his mind, but he followed the case. In 1889, the case of Hamilton v. Biker[98] came before the House of Lords and Lord Halsbury, L.O., Lord Watson and Lord McNaghten unanimously overruled the cases of The Glentanner[99] and The Mary Ann[100] and did so, notwithstanding the fact that the practice of the Admiralty Court had followed the decisions from the time they were given, a period of thirty years.\nThe ground was taken before the House that the results of overruling the old decisions would be disastrous, and whether right or wrong it was too late for even the House of Lords to interfere. Lord Macnaghten said:\nI am sensible of the inconvenience of disturbing a course of practice which has continued unchallenged for much a length of time and which has been sanctioned by such high authority, but if it is really founded upon an erroneous construction of an Act of Parliament there is no principle which precludes your Lordships from correcting the error. To hold that the matter is not open to review would be to give the effect of legislation to a decision contrary to the intention of the Legislature, merely because it has happened, for some reason or other, to remain unchallenged for a certain length of time.\nSee also Caldwell v. McLaren[101]; Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway Co. v. Mayor, etc., of Borough of Bury[102]; North Eastern Railway Co v. Lord Hastings[103]; Trustees of Clyde Navigation v. Laird & Sons[104]; Gwyn v. Hardwicke[105].\nIn the present case Barker J. said:\nIt is, I think, to be regretted that so important a question, and one upon which there has been such a diversity of opinion, among judges, should not have received more consideration than it apparently has in this province. * * * I must adhere to what I said in Murray v. Duff,[106] that, after so long a lapse of time, the question should be considered as settled in this province, at all events until a court of appeal shall decide otherwise.\nGregory J. said;\nI think, too, that it would be very doubtful, if the case was presented now for the first time, if I would have taken the view that has been adopted by the court in the past, and which seems now to be accepted as the Jaw, until some high court shall say that there was error in the former judgments.\nLandry and McLeod JJ. also intimated doubts of the correctness of the conclusion. Hanington J. alone supported it upon principle.\nThe law upon the point in question should be the same for all the portions of Canada in which the law of property is based upon that of England. It should require a case of an extraordinary character to induce this court to feel itself precluded by local decisions from applying to a particular part of the Dominion a construction of the law which seems to it properly applicable to all of such portions.\nIn this country, where intruders may take possession of most valuable Crown properties and remain in possession for many years enjoying the fruits of their intrusion without any knowledge on the part of the Crown, I think it would be most dangerous to introduce any limitation upon the sixty year term. It is to be assumed that, in cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick where intruders have settled upon land of the Crown and made improvements, and have not acquired a title by a sixty years' possession, the Crown will take into consideration all the circumstances before granting a title to the land to a third party. If further relief is necessary it is for the legislature to supply.\nI think that, in this case, the Crown could grant the land and, the grantee having obtained possession, the plaintiff cannot maintain ejectment against him, and that the verdict should be set aside and a verdict entered for the defendant with costs in this court and in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Powell, Bennett & Harrison.\nSolicitor for the respondent: James Friel.\n[1] 36 N.

C. R. 245) reversed. Appeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] in favour of the suppliant.\nIn 1897 the government of Canada proceeded to change the route of the Cardinal Canal, between the village of Cardinal and the St. Lawrence, from the south to the north side of the village with the result that both ends of the village were bounded by the new canal and the only bridge was in the centre. The suppliant's property being at one end he claimed damages by reason of depreciation in value and also because he could only get to the adjoining district by means of the drawbridge which was a longer, less convenient and, on account of a railway running over it, a dangerous route. The Exchequer Court awarded him $1,200 as compensation and the Crown appealed.\nChrysler K. C. for the appellant. By the closing of the street, the suppliant suffers in common with all the residents of the village but there is no injury peculiar to himself or his property and it is only for such injury that he can recover. Attorney General v. Conservators of the River Thames[2]; Lyon v. Fishmongers Co.[3]; Powell v. Toronto, H. & B. Railway Co[4].\nThe cases in England decided under the Railway Clauses Act 1845 are not in in pari materia as that Act provides for greater compensation that our Expropriation Act. The Lands Clauses Act more nearly resembles ours and the decisions on the latter are strongly against the suppliant. See Cowper Essex v. Local Board of Acton[5].\nThe learned Counsel cited also Re Birely and Toronto H. & B. Railway Co.[6]; Town of Toronto Junction v. Christie[7]; East Freemantle Corporation v. Annois[8]. Maclennan K. C. and Maclennan for the respondent The Municipality could not have closed the highway without compensation to the suppliant and consequently the government could not. In re Publishers' Syndicate; Paton's Case[9]; Falle v. Town of Tilsonburg[10].\nThe suppliant would have a right of action irrespective of the statute if the work had been done by a private person and that gives him the some right now. Caledonian Railway Co. v. Walkers Trustees[11]; Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[12].\nThe cut-off of suppliant's land is not too remote to entitle him to compensation. Caledonian Railway Co. v. Walker's Trustees (3); Beckett v. Midland Railway Co.[13]; McQuade v. The King[14].\nThe judgment of the Court- was delivered by:\u2014\nNESBITT J.\u2014I do not think that there is such an irreconcilability between the more recent authorities as a first perusal of them would suggest. The earlier causes proceeded upon the principle stated by Lord Cranworth in Ricket v. The Directors, &c. of the Metropolitan Railway Co.[15], at page 198, where he says:\nBoth principle and authority seem to me to shew that no case comes within the purview of the statute, unless where some damage has been occasioned to the land itself, in respect of which, but for the statute, the complaining party might have maintained an action. The injury must be actual injury to the land itself, as by loosening the foundation of buildings on it, obstructing its light, or its drains, making it inaccessible by lowering or raising the ground immediately in front of it, or by some such physical deterioration. Any other construction of the clause would open the door to claims of so wide and indefinite a character as could not have been in the contemplation of the legislature. This rule was considered too narrow in the case of the Caledonia Railway Co. v. Walkers Trustees[16], at page 296.\nI think that the real test is that suggested by Lord Cairns in McCarthy's Case[17]:\nThe proper test is to consider whether the act done in carrying out the works in question is an act which would have given a right of action if the works had not been authorised by Act of Parliament. I do not pause to consider whether or not, if the question was now to be decided for the first time, it is not a test somewhat narrow. I accept that test as being the test which has been laid down and which has formed the foundation for the decision of so many cases before the present.\nSuch definition of the right to compensation which was suggested by Mr. Thesiger, in his argument in the case of the Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy (2), was accepted by the Lord Chancellor (Lord Cairns) and Lord Chelmsford and Lord Hatherley as one which may reconcile the cases which have come before the courts upon this delicate point of law. That definition was as follows:\nThe principle to be deduced from a consideration of all the cases is this, that where by the construction of works there is a physical interference with any right, public or private, which an owner is entitled to use in connection with his property, he is entitled to compensation if, by reason of such interference, his own property is injured. The word \"physical\" is here used in order to distinguish the case from cases of that class where the interference is not of a physical, but rather of a mental, nature, or of an inferential kind, such as those of a road rendered less convenient or agreeable, or a view interfered with, or the profits of a trade, by the creation of a new highway or street, diminished in the old one.\nI think a great deal of the confusion has arisen under the cases by seizing upon language which has been used without confining such language to the actual decision in the case, and to the special facts upon which that decision is based, making it necessary in nearly all of the cases to draw a sketch of the locality, as described, in order to see just what has been decided. I cannot do better to illustrate this than to refer to Ricket's Case[18] which was so carefully analysed by Lord Selborne (Lord Chancellor) in Walker's Case[19], at page 281.\nThree cases were relied upon by the learned judge in the court below as establishing that an interference with a public right will give rise to a cause of action, and where that is taken, sustain a claim to compensation under the statute. These cases were Chamberlain v. West End of London & Crystal Palace Rway. Co.[20]; McCarthy's Case[21], and the Caledonian Railway Co. v. Walker's Trustees (2).\nA critical examination of Chamberlain's Case (3) will shew that the road immediately in front of the claimant's property was changed so that the claimants had to go down a set of stairs to reach the deviation road, and it was expressly found that the real estate, as real estate, had been somewhat depreciated in value.\nIn McCarthy's Case (4), the decision, as I understand, went upon the ground that the claimant had two highways, one a metal highway, and the other a water highway, and as put by Lord Hatherley, no one would suggest that if the water highway had lain on one side of his property and the metal highway on the other, and if the water highway had been obstructed opposite to his premises he would not have had a cause of action apart from the statute, and it could make no difference that the metal highway and the water highway were immediately contiguous to each other.\nIn the Walker's Trustees Case (2), Lord Watson, at page 303, when speaking of the rule laid down by the Lord Chancellor (Earl Cairns) in the McCarthy Case[22], and adopted by all the law lords in that case, said as follows:\nThe rule thus formulated does not apply with precision to the law of Scotland, which does not, in cases like the present, recognize that distinction between the remedies by action and indictment upon which the test is founded. But that which satisfies the test, that which gives a right of action in England, has been defined in the case of McCarthy as well as in previous decisions. When an access to private property by a public highway is interfered with, the owner can have no action of damages for any personal inconvenience which he may suffer in common with the rest of the lieges. But should the value of the property, irrespective of any particular uses which may be made of it, be so dependent upon the existence of that access as to be substantially diminished by its construction, then I conceive that the owner has, in respect of any works causing such obstruction, a right of action, if these works are unauthorized by Act of Parliament, and a title to compensation under the Railway Acts if they are constructed under statutory powers.\nIn this case all the evidence shows is that the suppliant, in common with all others, is cut off from one access to Prescott, by what is known as the old highway, but all other methods of access or egress to or from the village remain the same, and the Government, under the Expropriation Act, section 3, sub-sec. f., substituted another road in lieu thereof, so that the suppliant still has access to Prescott, although by not so convenient a road. This is an inconvenience which he suffers in common with all the other persons desiring to use that portion of the highway which is cut off I do not think that any case can be found which, under the English law, would hold that for such an obstruction the plaintiff could himself maintain an action. I think the remedy being by indictment, it is absolutely clear, from all the authorities, that mere inconvenience of a person, or loss of trade or business, is not the subject of compensation.\nIt was urged that because the substituted road was constructed with a swing bridge, which, owing to the traffic in the canal, sometimes caused delay, that this gave rise to a claim, but I think that is answered by the circumstances, first, that this arises from the subsequent use of the canal, not from its construction, and secondly, that it is an inconvenience which the suppliant may suffer more often than others, yet it is an inconvenience common to the whole public.\nThe evidence makes it quite plain that the reason the witnesses said that the property was depreciated in value is because it is less convenient as it is a somewhat longer road, and parties are held by the opening of the bridge, and also because railway tracks are upon the bridge, which of course is not an item which can be considered in this case.\nI do not find that any of the English authorities extend the rule to cover cases where there may be said to be a general depreciation of property because of the vicinage of a public work. And Walker's Trustees Case[23], which goes further than any case upon the subject, is, as I have pointed out, put upon the special grounds of the dependence of the property upon the existence of the access, so that the cutting of it off diminished its value irrespectively of any use to which it might be put. To extend the rule, which has been widely laid down in cases where damage is occasioned to a person by any public works which have been constructed by an Act of Parliament for the purposes of public improvement, so as to embrace cases where the person injured is being injured as one of the public, and not to confine it, as it has been confined, to persons whose land has been injuriously affected, as land itself would be in this country, would be to unduly hamper the prosecution of public works and the consequent development of the country.\nIt was never intended that where the execution of works, authorized by Acts of Parliament, sentimentally affected values in the neighbourhood, all such property owners could have a claim for damages. In most of our large cities values are continually changing by reason of necessary public improvements made, and if, although no lands are taken, everybody owning lands in the locality could, by reason of the changed character of the neighbourhood or interference with certain convenient highways, claim compensation by reason of a supposed falling of the previous market value of property in the neighbourhood, it would render practically impossible the obtaining of such improvements. I think the property in this case is not so dependent upon the existence of the access which was so cut off as to constitute an injurious affection within the authority of the statute. I do not think that there is substantially much difference between the various Expropriation Acts which were referred to. The real question is whether or not the claimant could have maintained a cause of action at common law for damages occasioned by the obstruction. I see no real distinction between the effect which the closing up of the nine mile road south of the canal, and the opening up of the new road across the swing bridge, had upon the value of the suppliant's land, and its effect upon all the lands in the village of Cardinal, between the two canals and the point just mentioned. The suppliant's land suffered no special damage distinguishable from that which all these special lands suffered. Mayor of Montreal v Drummond[24]; Bell v.

The contract would have been fulfilled if the vessel had arrived at Fort William in time to load under the conditions which might be supposed to exist on arrival.\nJudgment appealed from (6 Ont. L.R. 432) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe question for decision on this appeal is sufficiently shown by the above head-note and the facts are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies.\nBorden K.C. and Hodgins K.C. for the appellants. The undertaking to load within a fixed time is an absolute engagement, for non-performance of which the charterer is liable no matter what are the impediments he encounters.

Raymond & Reid[12]; Scrutton on Charter parties, 4 ed. p. 244.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Davies.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting).\u2014I would allow the appeal. I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This is an action brought by the appellants, owners of the steamer Midland Queen, against the respondents, the charterers of such steamer, to recover $4,590 for loss of freight through alleged failure to load the steamer within the time specified in the charter with a cargo of grain from the elevators in Fort William. The respondents counterclaimed for $10,000 on the ground that it was the appellants who were in default as they had not complied with what the respondents claimed was their contractual duty under the charterparty of placing their steamer in a position to be loaded at the elevator within the time limit of the charter.\nThe learned trial judge found that the steamer had complied with her owners\u2019 contractual obligation when the vessel was at the pier in Fort William ready to load although she was unable to reach the elevators where she alone could take in her cargo. He held that the stipulation as to time was in terms unconditional, and that the steamer having reached Fort William and notified the respondents of its readiness to receive the cargo it had done all it was bound to do and the unconditional contract of the charterer at once attached. He accordingly found for the ship-owners for the full amount of his lost freight and dismissed the charterer\u2019s counterclaim.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the judgment was reversed mainly on the ground stated in Chief Justice Moss\u2019s reasons for judgment that the ship-owners had not complied with their contractual obligation to bring their steamer to the elevators at Fort William which must be held to be the understood place between the parties where, according to custom and usage at Fort William, the vessel was to load. That court accordingly (Mr. Justice Maclennan dissenting) dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim and allowed the charterers $50 as and for nominal damages under their counterclaim. From this latter judgment the ship-owners appeal to this court.\nThe point on which our decision must turn is a narrow one and not absolutely free from doubt, but after a careful examination of the numerous cases cited and much consideration of the able arguments presented at the bar, I am of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct and that this appeal must be dismissed.\nThe contract of charter is contained in three short telegrams which passed between the agents of the parties, as to which there is, so far as the main question is concerned, no important dispute. In order that these telegrams may be understood I may premise that Playfair was the manager of the appellant company; that Read, one of the Grand Trunk Railway officials, was acting in the matter of obtaining a charter for the steamer as the agent of Playfair\u2019s company; and that Crowe, who was not connected with either the appellant or respondent company, was the secretary-treasurer of another elevator company dealing in wheat and respondents contended acted in this matter as agent for respondents. Mr. Crowe\u2019s position, however, was only important in a subsidiary view of the case which I do not find it necessary to discuss. The telegrams read as follows:\nTELEGRAM\u2014READ TO CROWE. (PART 12.)\nMONTREAL, November 23.\nPlayfair confirms charter Queen, Fort William to Goderich, loading about December 2nd, weather, ice, permitting four and a half cents bush., confirm.\nA.F. READ.\nTELEGRAM\u2014CROWE TO READ. (PART 13.)\nTime 12.36 p.m. From Winnipeg, 23, 11, 1901.\nWe confirm Midland Queen, four and half, Goderich, load Fort William, on or before noon, fifth December.\nG.R. CROWE.\nLETTER\u2014READ TO CROWE. (PART 14.)\nMONTREAL, November 23.\nPlayfair wires confirming charter to you of steamer Queen, to load at Fort William before noon December 5th, to Goderich, at four and a half cents per bushel. Please say who she is to be loaded account of and to whom captain will apply for grain. The elevators at Fort William were owned and controlled by the C.P.R. Co., over which neither of the parties to this contract had any control.\nThe steamer Midland Queen left Midland for Fort William on the afternoon of Saturday, November 30th, and arrived there on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 3rd, being the last boat to arrive seeking a cargo that season. That left ample time to load provided the steamer had the right of way but unfortunately some eight vessels were ahead of her. She was tied up to the pier and although there is some dispute about the facts it must be held for the purposes of this appeal that her arrival was reported by her captain to the superintendent of the elevators there and to Mr. Reese, the respondents\u2019 agent on the same afternoon she arrived. The captain immediately telegraphed to his owners and informed them that there were eight boats ahead of him and that it was impossible to load before Saturday or Sunday. The steamer remained in the procession of vessels leading to the elevators until 10 o\u2019clock on the 5th December when, the vessels ahead of her being loaded, she was ordered under the shoots or spouts of the elevators to receive her cargo. The respondents had her cargo ready in the elevators to load on the 4th December, but how long before that date is not in evidence. As it was manifest that the steamer could not then be loaded before noon of the 5th, the time limit of the contract, the captain, acting under orders from his owners whose insurance expired at noon of same day (unless the vessel had then sailed on her voyage), refused to go under the elevators and sailed for home without her cargo, leaving port in time to save her insurance.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario held, I think, rightly, that, by the true construction of the contract of charter, the vessel was to be fully loaded by the time specified, noon on the 5th December, and not merely started loading, and that if she had in other respects complied with her contract she was not bound to wait for her load after that time. It was strongly pressed by Mr. Aylesworth that if the ship abandoned her contract on the time limit being reached and the charterer showed himself at that time ready and able to go on with the loading of a cargo which the vessel refused to receive, the ship owner could not recover his full freight but only the real and substantial damage he could show he actually sustained by any delay beyond the hour, and that at any rate he was bound to go on receiving cargo until the last minute of time. These questions, however, which go altogether to the quantum of damages recoverable on the view I take of the case, are unnecessary to be considered. In the final analysis the questions upon which the case must turn are simply whether, to initiate liability of the charterer to load under the terms of the charter-party, the ship had performed her part of the contract when she had reached and reported herself at the port of Fort William in a reasonable time to permit of her being loaded before noon of the 5th, and whether the named place to load in the contract must be read and considered as the place of loading which is by the usage and custom of the port intended by the name and at which alone loading could take place. Mr. Borden freely conceded that Fort William, mentioned in the contract as the place of loading, did not mean the harbour of that name as defined and delimited by statute or as understood geographically. He agreed that the name of the place or port mentioned in the charter party must be taken in its commercial sense which may well differ from its strict legal or geographical meaning. As Mr. Carver states it on page 644 of his book on Carriage by Sea (ed 1900):\u2014 The word \u201cport\u201d in the charter party must be construed by reference to the meaning commonly given to it by merchants and ship-owners. The extent of the particular port, as understood by them, is not necessarily, or ordinarily, determined by its legal definition for fiscal or like purposes or even by geographical considerations. Its extent in a commercial sense is rather shown by such considerations as the safety afforded for shipping, the convenience for loading and unloading, the usages of the place with regard to anchoring, loading and discharging, and the area over which those matters are regulated by the authorities having jurisdiction in the port.\nI conceive this must necessarily be the proper rule of construction and once it is adopted, once the name of the port or harbour of loading is agreed to be a conventional one signifying not a legal place or a geographical one but one as understood by merchants and shippers determinable by considerations respecting places of loading and unloading, it leads, in my opinion, logically to the conclusion stated by Lord Esher, then Brett L.J., in the rules he formulated for the construction of charter-parties in the well known case of Nelson v. Dahl[13], Those rules are fairly summarised by the editors of the 1901 edition of Abbott on Shipping, at page 392. The first one is stated as follows:\nLay days begin to run where a port is named in the charter-party when the ship is at the usual place of discharge in that port cr if there is more than one usual place of discharge at that place of discharge which the charter designates.\nThe same rule is of course applicable to loading. But the specific language used by Lord Esher is clearer and certainly more definite. He says, page 582, speaking of a charter-party which names a port generally at which to load:\nHe (the ship-owner) cannot place his ship at the disposition of the charterer so as to initiate the liability of the latter as to the loading until the ship is at the named place or the place which is by custom considered to be intended by the name; as if a larger fort be named the usual place in it at which loading ships lie. And again at page 584, in speaking of unloading the ship and the respective rights of the ship-owner and charterer, he says:\nBut in the absence of his (the ship-owner\u2019s) right to place the ship only as \u201cnear to the named place as she can safely get\u201d (and of course this refers to the ship-owner\u2019s contractual right as in the charter-party His Lordship was then considering) the ship\u2011owner\u2019s right to have the charterer\u2019s liability to unload, initiate, does not commence until the ship is in the named place.\nIn other words, as I understand it, the named place if a larger port be expressed having within it a usual or customary place of loading the latter will be held to be the meaning of the contract and he must go there with his ship before he can initiate the liability of the charterer to load and he cannot excuse himself by the presence of physical difficulties such as other ships having priority of passage preventing him reaching the place, or by prohibitory orders of the port or dock authorities. The case of Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin & Co. went by way of appeal to the House of Lords[14] and the decision of the Court of Appeal was affirmed. I cite this decision in the House of Lords for the proposition that, if a ship agrees to go to a certain dock or other similar place, she does not fulfil her engagement by merely going to the gates of the docks, and the fact that she is refused admission to the docks because they are full is no excuse for the ship nor is any duty cast upon the charterer of procuring her admission.\nIn giving judgment, at page 42. Lord Blackburn says:\nThe plaintiffs contended in the court below that by such a charter party as this the merchant undertakes to procure the ship admission into the docks. Neither the Master of the Rolls nor the judges in the Court of Appeal took this view of the charter party, and it was not much urged at your Lordship\u2019s Bar. I think it is clear that it is untenable. The legal effect of the contract, in my opinion, as far as regards the ship-owner is, that he binds himself that his ship shall (unless prevented by some of the excepted perils) proceed to the dis- charging place agreed on in the charter party. That is, in this case, the Surrey Commercial Docks (which must, I think, mean inside the docks), with an alternative (as stated in the charter party) \u201cor so near thereto as she may safely get and lie always afloat.\u201d\nAnd on page 58 Lord Watson says:\nThe appellants maintained that there can be no impossibility within the meaning of the contract unless the vessel is stopped by an impediment which is both physical and permanent; bat I greatly doubt whether, in any fair construction of the charter party, it is necessary that the obstruction should be of a purely physical character; and I also doubt whether there be any foundation in fact for the appellant\u2019s contention. The exclusion of the Euxine from the Surrey Docks in August, 1877, was owing to a rule made by the statutory authorities entrusted with the administration and control of the dock. It is not suggested that the rule was in excess of their powers, or that it was not capable of being legally enforced. And I am opinion that an order emanating from the proper authority, which, if disregarded, would lead either to the dock gates being shut against the vessel or to her being turned summarily out of the dock if she did get into it, does in reality constitute a physical obstacle.\nThe decision in Davies v. McVeagh[15], as explained in Tharsis Sulphur & Copper Co. v. Morel Brothers & Co.[16], is not in conflict with this decision, and, if in conflict, must be considered as overruled.\nIf my construction of this contract is correct, if the ship-owner\u2019s obligation was to bring his vessel to the customary or usual place of loading at Fort William in such a reasonable time as would permit of her being loaded before the expiration of the time limit and if he failed to do so, then the reciprocal obligation on the part of the charterer never arose or attached. The evidence in this case establishes, and it was not contended otherwise, that the elevators by usage and custom are the only places in Fort William where grain can be laden aboard a vessel. There is no other place, way or method in that port at which or by which ships can be loaded. They are the only places, therefore, at which the charterer undertook to do his part, and his contractual obligation does not arise unless and until the ship is ready for him there. The fact that she is prevented from getting there by the prior presence of other ships or by the action of the harbour or dock authorities does not matter. The reason which might prevent him from fulfilling his contractual duty of having his ship ready at a particular place to receive her cargo cannot impose upon the charterer an obligation which only could arise Tinder the contract when the ship owner had the ship ready for him at that place. Here at Fort William are no series of docks or piers; here are no different methods of loading steamers; here is only one place at which and one method by which vessels can be loaded and these are at the elevators and by means of the shoots or spouts. \u201cLoading at Fort William\u201d can therefore have one and only one meaning and that is loading at the elevators at Fort William. These facts were well known to all the parties to the contract and there cannot, in my judgment, be any doubt of their intentions. Then, if this conclusion is correct, cadit quaestio; the Midland Queen, by fastening herself to the quay or pier in the long procession of boats leading to the elevators, did not fulfil her part of the charter party any more than did the vessel in the case of Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin & Co.[17] which contracted to go to the \u201cSurrey Commercial Docks\u201d, fulfil hers by going to the entrance or mouth of the docks.\nA good deal was said about the fact that the time specified in the contract being a definite one many of the cases cited having reference to lay days, etc., were inapplicable or distinguishable, and I think that is so. But the presence or absence of a time limit cannot affect the interpretation to be given to the contract so far as the place where the ship owner is bound to have his vessel ready for cargo is concerned. Once that is conceded to be the elevators and it is shown he had not his vessel there all doubt ceases and the question of time limit becomes irrelevant. The definite time mentioned throws no greater risk or duty upon the charterer in this view than upon the ship. The loading was a mutually reciprocal act to be performed by both parties. One provided the grain in the elevator ready to pour down the shoots when the hold of the vessel was placed below them, but the ship owner had to put his vessel there to receive the grain in such reasonable time as would enable her to be loaded if the grain was there already for her, and so we come back to the question with which I started, whether under the contract as construed with respect to the proved custom and usage of loading vessels at Fort William the ship was obliged to be ready to receive her cargo at the elevators a reasonable time before the expiration of the time limit so as to enable the loading to be finished in time. If so there has not been any default on the charterers\u2019 part. He had as proved the cargo all ready to load as soon as the ship was ready to receive. He is not responsible for the delay in the arrival of the steamer at the port, nor for the obstacles which after her arrival prevented her reaching the spot where alone she could load and where custom and usage determined the time and manner of her loading. Other important questions arising out of the alleged lateness of the steamer\u2019s arrival at the port and as to the question of damages which, if entitled at all to receive, she should recover, and questions as to the effect of the elevator regulations upon his contract, become unnecessary to decide and I do not touch upon them. I agree with the decision of the Court of Appeal that the defendants are entitled to nominal damages on their counterclaim, and I therefore think that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting).\u2014This case appears to me, under the authorities, to be within a very narrow compass. I agree that the parties must be taken to have contracted with reference to the port at which the loading was to be done and its customs. I think it clear that, apart from the fixed time for loading, a reasonable time would be allowed, as in the case relied on by my brother Killam,[18] but there the point is expressly made that\nthere was no engagement by the freighters to load the vessel within any particular time.\nHad there been such an engagement there must have been a breach of it and the freighter would have had himself to blame for contracting to perform what was impossible The fixed time would have been inconsistent with the circumstances. However, here the parties did not and could not know but that when the boat arrived she could go to the spot for loading, and the shipowner took his chances of perils of the sea, etc., and contracted she would be at Fort William in time to load, and the freighter took his chances of the interference of the elevator authorities through their rules and agreed to the fixed time for loading, an agreement which cannot possibly be given effect to unless you read into the contract words limiting the freighter\u2019s liability such as \u201cprovided the C.P.R. can give you your turn in time\u201d or \u201cprovided the wheat you are taking is not in any elevator already engaged in loading other boats\u201d contingencies the freighter must provide against. See Scrutton\u2019s Charter Parties, (4ed.), p. 242; Anson on Contracts, (7 ed.), p. 323; Abbott on Shipping, (14 ed.), 372; Good & Co. v. Isaacs[19], per Kay, L.J., at page 562, where he distinguishes that case on the ground that it is not one where the charter stipulated for a fixed time. It seems to me clear that when the vessel arrived at Fort William she completed her part of the contract as it was impossible for her to know the spot of loading until she arrived there and received orders from the shipper after he received information from the C.P.R. This seems to me to entirely dispose of the suggestion that the vessel must go under the elevator spout in order to fulfil her contract and to be ready to take her share in the loading. There must be some definite point where, as a matter of law, the boat, at the time she leaves Midland, must be bound to go in order do fulfil her contract. That point cannot be a shifting one. It cannot be that it would fulfil her contract to report at elevator A., when her load, as a fact, was at elevator B. or C., a third of a mile or a mile away There must be some definite spot so that the vessel can legally tender herself at a definite point and say, \u201cI have fulfilled my contract and am here ready to take my cargo,\u201d and where a court could say that she had arrived. Suppose there were fifteen or twenty elevators at Fort William, as there probably will be in the next few years, at any one of which the C.P.R. would be entitled to say to the Dominion Elevator Company, we propose having you take your load at number one or number fifteen, as the case might be, can it be suggested that a ship-owner must go to each one of the twenty and tender before he can be said to have completed his right to claim loading by the shipper? This seems to be so unless the contract is held to be fulfilled by his arrival at the port of Port William, and information to the defendant company that he is there ready to receive his orders to go whatever spot they may designate.\nThe Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal evidently was of opinion that the contract had to be changed by reading into it the term \u201cat the usual place\u201d. That is not the contract and the court has no right to make a new one for the parties, and, even if so read, which \u201cusual place\u201d is meant?\nThen, as to whether the plaintiff was bound to arrive in such time that the ship would have precedence over other ships, that she would be certain to receive her cargo before noon, I think such a construction would entirely destroy the effect of the time limit. The cases seem to be quite plain that that would be the rule where there was not a definite time for loading the cargo, but the authorities all seem to establish that, as I have pointed out above, where there is such a definite time fixed, that is an absolute contract to have the loading finished within such time, and the shipper takes the risk of any causes that he might have provided against.\nI think that if the ship-owner had failed to report at Fort William at an hour which would have enabled the loading to take place, that he, in the same way, would have been responsible under the contract, although the delay might have taken place from stress of weather or anything happening to the ship, if the ship-owner did not see fit to provide for such exceptions. He was bound to perform his unconditional contract to get to Fort William in time to report a sufficient length of time beforehand to enable the vessel to be loaded, and so, in the same way, the shipper, under such a specified time limit, was bound to have his grain ready to load notwithstanding it was rendered impossible by circumstances over which he had no control. I agree with the judgment of Mr. Justice Maclennan on both these points. I do not think that the Dominion Elevator Act is applicable. I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with the variation that there is to be a reference to ascertain the difference between the expense of the return trip from Fort William to the home port, and what would have been the expense had the freight been earned by the vessel going to Goderich and thence to the home port.\nKILLAM J.\u2014This action was brought by a ship-owning company upon a contract, claimed to have been made by telegraphic communication between a Mr. Crowe, of Winnipeg, Manitoba, acting on behalf of the defendant company, and a Mr. Read, of Montreal, representing the plaintiff company, for the supplying of a cargo of grain to be carried from Fort William to Goderich by the steamer Midland Queen.\nThe transaction was initiated by an offer of the vessel by Read to Crowe for her last trip in the season of the year 1901. As satisfactory arrangements were not made between them Crowe turned the offer over to the defendant company and became the medium through whom the alleged contract was made. There was some contention on the part of the defence that any contract which was made was between the defendant company, through its own officials, and Crowe, as representing the plaintiff company. But it appears to me that the view taken by the courts in Ontario was correct, that in the communications Crowe was authorised to act and did act as the agent of the defendant company and formed a binding contract on its behalf with the plaintiff company.\nThe respective rights and liabilities of charterer and ship-owner, under a contract of this kind, were well expressed by Brett, L.J., in Nelson v. Dahl[20]. At pages 581, et seq., he is reported as saying:\nThe first right of the ship-owner is the right of placing his ship at the disposition of the charterer so as to initiate the liability of the latter, whatever it may be, to take his part as to loading. In every case it seems to me that it is a condition precedent to such right of the ship-owner to place his ship at the disposition of the charterer for such purpose that the ship should be at the place named in the charter-party as the place whence the carrying voyage is to begin, and that the ship should be ready to load, so far as the ship\u2019s part of the operation of loading is concerned. The place so named may give a description of a larger space, in several parts of which a ship may load, as a port or dock; or it may be the description of a limited space in which the ship must be in order to load, as a particular quay, or a particular quay berth, or a particular part of a port or dock. * * * The further right of the ship-owner as to the loading is, of course, his right to insist on the liability of the charterer, whatever that may be, which attaches when and after the ship is duly placed at his disposition. The liability of the ship-owner as to the commencement of the loading depends on the particular form by which he has bound himself to place his ship at the disposition of the charterer for that purpose. He must do so \u201cwith all convenient speed,\u201d or \u201cwith all possible despatch,\u201d or \u201cimmediately, unless prevented by enumerated accidents,\u201d or \u201cwithin a reasonable time,\u201d according to his agreement in each case. * * *\nThe primary right of the charterer as to the loading under a charterparty in ordinary terms seems to me to be that he cannot be under any liability as to loading until the ship is at the place named in the charterparty as the place whence the carrying voyage is to begin, and the ship is ready to load, and he, the charterer, has notice of both these facts; when these conditions are fulfilled the liability of the charterer begins. The extent of that liability depends on the form as to it of the charterparty. If there be no undertaking that he will load the ship at all events within a specified time, he will be bound to use reasonable diligence to do his part towards the loading according to the terms or meaning of the charterparty; that is to say, \u201cwith all possible despatch\u201d or \u201cwith usual despatch\u201d or \u201cwith the customary despatch of the port,\u201d or \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d But whenever in the charterparty it is agreed that a specified number of days shall be allowed for loading, and that it shall be lawful for the freighter to detain the vessel for that purpose a further specified time on payment of a daily sum, this constitutes a stipula- tion on the part of the freighter that he will not detain the ship for the purpose of loading beyond those two specified periods. This is the principle laid down in Ford v. Cotesworth[21]. If the ship in such case is detained beyond the specified lay days, the charterer must pay demurrage or damages in the nature of demurrage, though the delay in loading has occurred from causes wholly beyond the charterer\u2019s control.\nThese statements of the law are fully supported by the cases to which the learned Lord Justice referred See Randall v. Lynch[22]; Brereton v. Chapman[23]; Kelt v. Anderson[24]; Brown v. Johnson[25]; Tapscott v. Balfour[26].\nThe principle on which the decisions were based, where the time for loading or discharging was expressly limited, was that the expression of the term implied the duty to give up the ship on its expiration. See Randall v. Lynch22. But, as pointed out by Lord Blackburn in the House of Lords, upon appeal from the judgment in Nelson v. Dahl, sub nom, Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin & others[27], cases of that kind, deciding when lay days commence, have no direct bearing on a case like the present.\nAs stated in Abbott on Shipping (14 ed.) at p. 373.\nIf a charterparty makes no express provision for the time to be allowed the merchant for loading or discharging, the law will imply that the parties intended that a reasonable time should be allowed for these operations. Questions have arisen as to whether reasonable time is to be measured by reference to the circumstances which ordinarily exist or to the actual circumstances at the time of the performance of the obligation. It is now settled that the latter is the true measure, provided that the delay complained of is attributable to causes beyond the control of the party on whom the obligation rests.\nSee, also, Scrutton on Charter Parties (5th ed.) p. 520; Burmester v. Hodgson[28]; Rodgers v. Forresters[29]; Ford v. Cotesworth[30]; Postlethwaite v. Freeland[31]; Hulthen v. Stewart & Co.[32]\nIn Randall v. Lynch[33], the charter party provided for discharge of the ship at the London opcks and that forty days should be allowed for unloading, loading and again unloading, to commence at the port of beginning of the voyage and to continue in London from the day of reporting at the Customs House, with a further allowance of ten days demurrage at a stipulated price per day. On account of the crowded state of the docks the discharge was not completed until after the expiration of both the lay days and the demurrage days. It was held by Lord Ellenborough that the charterer was liable for the detention, and this view was upheld by the court en banc.\nThe case of Rogers v. Forresters29 came on for trial subsequently before the same learned judge, when it was found that the charterparty provided merely that the freighter should be allowed the usual and customary time to unload the ship at the port of discharge. The ship entered the docks on the 25th of August and was reported the following day. On the 31st August the cargo was bonded by the defendant and he was ready to receive it if it could then be unloaded, but on account of the crowded state of the docks at the time much delay ensued. If the duty had been immediately paid, instead of the cargo being bonded, the discharge might have been made much sooner. Lord Ellenborough considered that, as it was shown that the usual and customary time to unload such a cargo was when the ship obtained a berth, by rotation, and the cargo could be discharged into the bonded warehouse, and as, though the cargo might have been landed if the duties had been immediately paid, the bonding system was usual and customary, the charterer was not in fault, but that he had unloaded the ship in the usual and customary time for that purpose at the port of discharge.\nThis view was supported in Ford v. Cotesworth[34], and Postlethwaite v. Freeland[35].\nIn the present case we have not the advantage of a formal charterparty in terms of recognized meaning. There are merely fragmentary telegrams from which to infer the various terms of the contract. In dealing with such a case we should act, I think, upon the principles stated by Lord Watson in Dahl v. Nelson, Donkin and others[36]. at p. 59:\nI have always understood that, when the parties to a mercantile contract, such as that of affreightment, have not expressed their intentions in a particular event, but have left these to implication, a court of law, in order to ascertain the implied meaning of the contract, must assume that the parties intended to stipulate for that which is fair and reasonable, having regard to their mutual interests and to the main objects of the contract. In some cases that assumption is the only test by which the meaning of the contract can be ascertained. There may be many possibilities within the contemplation of the contract of charterparty which were not actually present to the minds of the parities at the time of making it, and, when one or other of these possibilities becomes a fact, the meaning of the contract must be taken to be, not what the parties did intend (for they had neither thought nor intention regarding it), but that which the parties, as fair and reasonable men, would presumably have agreed upon if, having such possibility in view, they had made express provision as to their several rights and liabilities in the event of its occurrence.\nHere, the ship was to load at Fort William on or before noon on the 5th of December. I agree with the construction placed upon the word \u201cload\u201d in the courts below, that the loading was to be completed, and not merely commenced, by the hour named.\nOn behalf of the plaintiff company it is argued that, on account of the limit of time stipulated for, the only liability of the ship owner was to have the ship at the port of Fort William and notice thereof given to the representatives of the defendant company at that place. It is quite incorrect to speak of this as a case of an engagement to load \u201cwithin\u201d a fixed time. The end, but not the beginning, of the period is fixed. It is evident that something more must be implied in such a contract. It must be admitted that the ship should have arrived in sufficient time to enable the shipper to load her by the stipulated hour. And the real question is whether the shipper was to be ready, at all events and under any circumstances which might be found to exist at the time, to load the ship immediately upon notice of her arrival, and within the time which would be necessarily occupied by the act of loading only; or whether the ship should have arrived in time to reach the particular loading place where she could receive her cargo and be there loaded, notwithstanding delays due to the crowded state of the dock.\nWhere a contract requires a ship to go to a particular port for loading, the ship must proceed to the usual place of loading in that port, though, in general, not necessarily to the particular berth or spot where the loading is to be actually carried on. Brereton v. Chapman[37]; Kell v. Anderson[38]; Nelson v. Dahl[39].\nThe view taken by the Court of Appeal was that, having reference to the state of affairs and the ordinary course of business at Fort William, the ship would not be at the place of loading to which it was the duty of the ship owner to take her until she arrived at the very elevator and under the very spout or spouts from which the grain was to be placed in her. It does not appear to me that, having regard to the authorities upon contracts of this kind, this duty was thrown absolutely upon the ship-owner. The ship arrived at the port of Fort William on the afternoon of the 3rd December. She proceeded to the only dock or wharf in the port and was there tied up. It appears to me that she had then reached the place of loading, within the meaning of the authorities, as distinguishable from the particular berth or spot at which she was to load. But, on the other hand, I do not think that the ship owner\u2019s duty was fulfilled by placing the ship in that position in sufficient time only to enable the shipper to have her taken at once, irrespective of the circumstances found to exist, to the particular spot for loading and have her filled on or before noon of the 5th December. If there had been but one elevator or one berth or spot in the port at which the ship could be loaded, probably the view taken by the Court of Appeal would be the correct one; but there were three elevators, to any one of which the ship might be assigned for loading.\nThe only practicable method of loading the ship, and the only one in the contemplation of the parties, was by discharging the grain through spouts from the elevators. The number and positions of the elevators were in the knowledge of both parties when the contract was made. It was usual, at the time of year, to find the dock crowded with vessels, and both shippers and ship-owners striving to get out as many cargoes as possible before the close of the season. This, also, was within the knowledge of the parties. The elevators at the port were owned and controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Under the regulations of that company, each ship seeking to be loaded at one of the elevators was obliged to take its turn in order of arrival at the dock No exception to this rule was admitted, except in the case of vessels known as \u201cliners\u201d, to which class the plaintiff\u2019s vessel did not belong. This rule, also, was well known to both the parties. It appears to me that, under such circumstances, it is unreasonable to imply that the shippers agreed, or intended to agree, or would have agreed, to have the ship loaded immediately upon her arrival, irrespective of the number of ships awaiting cargoes.\nIt does not appears that, when the telegrams constituting the contract were exchanged, the officers of the defendant company were aware of the exact position of the Midland Queen, or at what it was possible for her to be at Fort William in readiness to receive the cargo contracted for. In one of the preliminary telegrams from Mr. Head to Mr. Crowe, Read offered the ship to be \u201cloading about December 2nd\u201d. In a letter of the same date, written by the manager of the plaintiff company from Midland, Ontario, to Mr. Crowe, it was stated that the ship had left Midland on the previous day and was going right back there, and that if all should go well the ship should be at Fort William to load about the 1st of the month. This letter is not clearly shewn to have been communicated to the defendant company before the alleged breach of contract on the 5th December, and certainly its contents were not within defendant company\u2019s knowledge when the telegrams passed. However, even that letter did not say where the ship was going at the time, and it appears from it that, in the view of the plaintiff company\u2019s manager, it was expected that she could reach Fort William by the 1st December. Thus, there was nothing in the circumstances to lead the defendant company to believe, when the telegrams passed, that the situation of the ship was such that she could not reach Fort William sufficiently soon to allow of a reasonable time for any delay due to the crowded state of the dock. The offer of her to be \u201cloading about December 2nd\u201d was calculated to suggest the contrary.\nThe decision which appears to come nearest to the present case was that in Harris v. Dreesman.[40] In that case, it was shewn that the master of a vessel had agreed to proceed to a particular colliery and take on board a cargo of coal. Before the charterparty was signed both parties knew that the colliery was not at work, an accident having happened to a steam\u2011engine, and both were told that the engine would be repaired in a short time, and that the vessel would be loaded in her turn within a few days after the colliery got to work again, which was expected to be in the middle of the next week. Work was not resumed at the colliery as soon as the colliery agents had estimated would be the case. The result was delay in the loading of the ship. The shipper had no control over the colliery. It was held that the shipper was entitled to a reasonable allowance of time for the steam-engine to be repaired and the colliery got to work, and that, if the vessel was loaded within a reasonable time thereafter, the shippers were not liable, but that they would be liable for any greater delay than could be reasonably expected for the repair of the engine and the starting of work at the colliery.\nWhen the Midland Queen arrived at Fort William eight vessels were in advance of her awaiting cargoes. These were loaded with expedition, each vessel moving up towards the elevators as one made room for her. The result was that the vessel immediately in advance of the Midland Queen completed her loading at the elevator nearest the mouth of the port on the morning of the 5th December, too late to admit of any considerable cargo being placed upon the Midland Queen before noon of that day. The Midland Queen was then at a distance of about 100 feet from the nearest elevator, in which, however, there was only a small quantity of grain left. At the next elevator another ship was receiving her cargo, and room would shortly have been made there for the Midland Queen after taking in the grain that was left in the first elevator. This state of affairs was not unusual at that time of year. It was a state of affairs that should reasonably have been contemplated by the parties. There does not seem to have been any delay on the part of any one, plaintiff, defendant or railway company, from the time of the arrival of the Midland Queen at Fort William until room was made for her at the first elevator. The defendant company sought to induce the officials of the railway company to load the Midland Queen in advance of her turn, but was unable to do so.\nUpon some evidence given by Mr. Crowe as to the understood practice in the grain trade, it was contended that the shipper had the option, under the contract, to load at Fort William or to send the ship to a certain elevator at Port Arthur, which was another port near by, to be loaded; and it was argued that it was the duty of the shipper to do this if a load could not be furnished at Fort William in sufficient time to insure the fulfilment of the contract. No reliance seems to have been placed upon this evidence in the courts below, as sufficiently indicating a practice binding upon the parties. The action of the master of the ship and the defendant company and their Port William agent seems to indicate that none of them contemplated this course as being open, except by fresh agreement. It appears to me that this element should not be taken into consideration in this case.\nIn my opinion, it was a condition precedent to the liability of the defendant company to procure the Midland Queen to be loaded on or before noon of the 5th December, that she should arrive at Fort William in reasonable time to allow this to be done, having reference to the state of affairs which the parties should reasonably have expected to exist upon her arrival. The circumstances that did exist in the present case were only such as were usual at that season, and such as the parties must naturally have comtemplated as likely to exist. In Postlethwaite v. Freeland[41], Lord Selborne L.C. said:\nDifficult questions may someties arise as to the circumstances which ought to be taken into consideration in determining what time is reasonable. If (as in the present case) an obligation, indefinite as to time, is qualified or partially defined by express or implied reference to the custom or practice of a particular port, every impediment arising from or out of that custom or practice, which the charterer could not have overcome by the use of any reasonable diligence, ought (I think) to be taken into consideration.\nAs the ship was in default in not arriving in reasonable time to obtain her load by the stipulated hour of the 5th December, and again in departing unloaded without sufficient excuse, it appears to me that the Court of Appeal was justified in reversing the judgment for the plaintiff company, and in holding it liable for breach of contract. Upon the grounds stated in the Court of Appeal, I agree that substantial damages should not have been allowed. I would dismiss the appeals with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McMurrich, Hodgins & McMurrich.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Barwick, Aylesworth, Wright & Moss.\n[1] 6 Ont.

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nTitle to lands\u2014Grant from Crown\u2014Description\u2014Navigable waters\u2014 Floatable streams\u2014Inlet of navigable river\u2014Implied reservation\u2014 Crown domain\u2014Public law\u2014Construction of deed \u2014 Evidence \u2014Estoppel \u2014 Waiver.\nBy the law of the Province of Quebec as well as by the law of England, no waters can be deemed navigable unless they are actually capable of being navigated.\nAn arm or inlet of a navigable river cannot be assumed to be either navigable or floatable, in consequence of its connection with the navigable stream, unless it be itself navigable or floatable as a matter of fact.\nThe land in dispute forms part of the bed of a stream, called the Brewery Creek, which was originally a narrow inlet from the Ottawa River (dry during the summer time in certain parts), the waters of which passed over certain lots shown on the survey of the Township of Hull and granted by description according to that survey to the defendants' auteur, in 1806, without any reservation by the Crown of those portions over which the waters of the creek flowed. Under that grant, the grantee and his representatives have ever since without interference on the part of the Crown had possession of the lands on both sides fo the creek and of the creek itself. The erection during recent years of public works in the Ottawa River has caused its waters to overflow into the creek to a considerable extent at all seasons of the year. In 1902 the City of Hull obtained a grant by letters patent from the Province of Quebec of a portion of the bed of the creek as constituting part of the Crown domain, and brought the present action, au p\u00e9titoire, for a declaration of title,. the Attorney-General intervening for the province as warrantor.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, (see Q. R. 24 S. C. 59) :\u2014\n1. That as the Brewery Creek was neither navigable nor floatable in its natural state the subsequent overflow of the waters of the-Ottawa River into it could not have the effect of altering the natural character of the creek.\n2 That as there was no reservation of the lands covered with water in the original grant by the Crown, in 1806, the bed of the creek passed to the grantee as part of the property therein described, whether the waters of the creek were floatable or not.\n3. That the uninterrupted possession of the bed of the creek by the grantee and his representatives from the time of the grant with the assent of the Crown was evidence of the intention of the Crown to make an unqualified conveyance of all the lands and lands covered with water situated within the limits designated in the grant of 1806.\nAPPEALS by the plaintiff and the intervenant from a. judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District. of Ottawa, (Curran J.) ([1]) by which the action and the intervention were dismissed with costs.\nThe action was brought by the City of Hull to recover possession from the defendants of a portion of the bed of Brewery Creek an arm or inlet of the Ottawa River claimed under grant from the Crown in the right of the Province of Quebec, dated on the 2nd of April, 1902. The Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec intervened in the suit for the purpose of maintaining that this grant to the city had been validly made the lands granted forming part of the public domain as being a portion of the bed of a navigable or floatable stream.\nThe defendants claimed the bed of the creek under title from the late Philemon Wright to whom letters patent issued on the 3rd of January, 1806, granting to him together with other lands the lands on both sides of the creek described by metes and bounds according to the original survey of the Township of Hull, reserving therefrom merely the mines of gold and silver therein and power to make and use roads, ways and passages over said lands and to take stop, divert, and use all such rivers, streams, ponds and bodies of water as might be necessary for working and improving said mines, the said defendants and their auteurs having been in possession of the property in dispute as owners, under such title, ever since the date of the last mentioned grant.\nThe creek in question as it existed at the time of the grant, in 1806 and for many years afterwards, was a narrow inlet from the Ottawa River which ran dry, in many parts, during the summer, but during recent years the erection of dams and other improvements in the Ottawa River has caused an overflow of its waters into the creek to a considerable extent at all seasons of the year. By the judgment of the Superior Court, (Curran J.) ([2]) the plaintiff's action and the intervention of the Attorney-General were both dismissed with costs. The present appeals are asserted against the judgments of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, on appeals taken respectively, by the plaintiff and the intervenant, unanimously affirming the judgments rendered in the trial court.\nCannon K. C. Assistant-Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec, for the intervenant, appellant The creek in question retains the character of the navigable stream of which it forms a part. Consequently, its bed never passed to Philemon Wright or his representatives in the absence of specific conveyance by apt words in the grant of 1806. The bed of the creek continued to form part of the Crown domain up to the date of the grant in 1902. The Crown was, at that date, still seized of the bed of Brewery Creek, in the right of the Province of Quebec, (art. 400 C.C.,) and the grant then made was valid and effectual to pass the title to the City of Hull. The adverse possession of the defendants and their auteurs cannot avail against the Crown. Art. 2213 J.C. The Crown was not a party to any of the deeds, suits or proceedings heretofore made or taken in regard to the titles under which the defendants claim ; therefore there can he neither chose jug\u00e9e, waiver nor estoppel to operate as against the Crown.

Ann. art. 1351 nos. 1164-1173.\nThe Ottawa River has been declared navigable on many occasions, notablv in the recent case of Hurdman v. Thompson ([3]). which affected that stream at the very point where its waters flow into Brewery Creek. We refer to the authorities cited in that case and also to 1 Daviel, \" Cours d'Eau \" (ed. 1845) nos. 40, 41 ; 3 Proudhon, \" Domaine Public \" no. 758 ; 1 Graudry, \" Domaine \" p. 119 ; Troploug \" Vente \" No. 332 ; Pothier \"Vente\" No. 251; Duranton \"Vente\" No. 235 ; Dalloz Rep. vo.

Its width varies from 130 feet to 600 feet ; its surface velocity is 155 feet per minute. Men and horses have been drowned in it Several bridges, each several hundred feet long span its bosom. Except for these bridges citizens dwelling on opposite banks cou1d not communicate with each other unless they used boats.\nIn England, no stream is navigable which does not feel the effects of thetide. There, the Ottawa,the St. Maurice, the Ohio the Missouri, would not be deemed navigable. This expains such decisions as Earl of llchester v. Raishleigh ([4]). The decision in The Queen v. Robertson {[5]), (at p. 119) has little weight, because the stream in question there was, undoubtedly, neither navigable nor floatable and its bed belonged to the riparian proprietors. There, also, the grant was of an immense stretch of territory, while, in this case, the metes and bounds of the land granted as lot three in the third range of Hull are particularly described. The remarks of Cockburn C.J. in Marshall v. Ulles-water Steam Navigation Co. ([6]) quoted at page 119 of the Robertson Case (2), refer to private streams, and not to public, navigable waters. The remarks of Strong C.J. at pages 517, 519 and 521 of the Fisheries Case ([7]), refer to non-navigable waters; and the question treated at pages 562 and 563 by Girouard J. is whether or not the Dominion or the province is the owner of the beds of our rivers. This also was the question raised in The Queen v. Moss ([8]), and there is not one word in the judgment of the Privy Council in the Fish sties Case ([9]) which is at all germane to the issues here.\nThe long possession invoked by the respondents can have no effect as against the Crown.\nOur codifiers refer to none but French authorities under art. 2213 C. C. In fact our writers call the imprescriptibility of Crown lands a privilege enjoyed by the lands and governed, of course, by the same law as governs the ownership of the latter. Against the decision of Chad v. Tilsed ([10]), we would quote L'Etat v. Cie. des Forges d'Audincaut, a decision of the Court of Appeal at Besan\u00e7on, reported in Dalloz, Rec . Per. (1890) part 2 p. 29 ; Fuzier-Herman, Code Civ. Ann. Supp. art. 538, no. 258.\nAs to the use of the word \"rivers,\" in the grant of 1806 where a reserve for the purpose of working gold or silver mines is expressed, we answer that associated words take their colour from each other, that is, the more general is restricted to a sense. analagous to the less general. See Merlin, Rep. vo. \"Majorat\" sec. v.; Barthel v. Scotten ([11]). The use of the word in such a vague and general manner cannot be held to refer to navigable and floatable streams but should be confined to such bodies of inland waters as are neither floatable nor navigable. Moreover, if Brewery Creek is included, the Gatineau River likewise formed part of that grant, for we find that the waters of that mighty stream, which flows diagonally through the township, divides. many of the lots, leaving a part on either shores\u2014lot one in the fourth range, for instance. It may, moreover, be remarked, that the word ''rivers\" is not to be found in the granting clauses of the letters-patent of 1806.\nAylen K.C. for the respondents. \"Brigham\" or \"Brewery Creek,\" the subject of dispute appeass to have been, when the Township of Hull was erected and the grant made to the late Philemon Wright in 1806, a very small stream. Starting from the Ottawa River on lot 3 in the third range of the Township of Hull, it flowed through lot 3 in the third range and again reached the Ottawa River at lot one (1) in the fourth range. Before the dams and improvements were constructed, some 25 years ago, in the Ottawa River east of the mouth of the creek there was in this creek, in ordinary high water, about six inches, or somewhat more, of water. At the mouth of the creek, in those days, there was a bed of boulders which were higher than the ordinary high water, but which were flooded to a considerable extent in extreme high water. A stone bridge on the road leading from Hull to Aylmer crossed this creek a short distance north of the north shore of the Ottawa River and the boulders seem to have extended south of this bridge pretty much over all the eastern portion of lot 316 of ward one, and the western portion of lot 323 of ward two, as shown on the official plan of the City of Hull, filed of record. Previous to the construction of the improvements in the Ottawa River, that part of the creek north of this bridge was supplied with water by two or three small rivulets which flowed through the boulders, to which reference has just been made. The evidence shews that, until the erection of the improvements in question in the Ottawa River this area so covered with boulders and through which the rivulets flowed, could be crossed on foot without difficulty in ordinary high water. The rivulets were not of sufficient extent to prevent a person crossing this area on foot. The evidence further establishes that before the time of such improvements, on more than one occasion within the memory of the witnesses that were examined, this creek was entirely dry, and that any part of that portion claimed by the present action could be crossed on foot without difficulty. The evidence also shews that, before the construction of the improvements, the creek was chiefly used by farmers for the purpose of watering their horses while going to and coming from market and that, after the spring freshets had passed, a man could jump in most places across the creek where so used.\nSome 25 years ago, extensive improvements were made in the Ottawa River in connection with the mills at \" Chaudiere Falls \" and the lumbermen and riparian proprietors, east of Brewery Creek, extended dams from the north shore of the Ottawa River to the south shore and by this means raised the level of the water in the Ottawa River, and, as a consequence, in Brewery Creek, to the extent of between 4 and 4\u00bd feet. The result of such improvements, as far as Brewery Creek is concerned, is that there is presently, in ordinary stages of the water about 4 feet 6 inches of water more than there was before the improvements in question were made. This increase of water has, of course, greatly widened the bed of the creek immediately north of the bridge on the Aylmer Road and, to secure water to operate an axe factory the creek was dammed at Brewery Bridge (close to the locus in dispute) with stop-logs to regulate the depth of water on the south side of Brewery Bridge and between Brewery Bridge and the Ottawa River. By this means sufficient water-power was maintained for the operation of the axe factory on the property purchased by the City of Hull. This channel has been during the last 25 years, greatly enlarged and deepened enabling a larger volume of water to enter Brewery Creek. It will be necessary to bear in mind this change in the depth of water in Brewery Creek secured in the manner above explained.\nIt must be conceded that, in 1806, His late Majesty, George III, had as much right to grant the bed of Brewery Creek to the late Philemon Wright as His Majesty, Edward VII., had to grant similar properties, in 1902, to the City of Hull. The respondents further submit that the bed of Brewery Creek was granted in more express terms to the late Philemon Wright in 1806 than the Province of Quebec assumed to grant it to the City of Hull, in 1902.\nThe decision of Mr. Justice Maihiot in Thompson v. Hurdman ([12]) at pages 246 and 248, properly construed is in favour of the contention of the respondents. In the present case, moreover, it has been found as a fact by the judgments under appeal that the Crown had acquiesced for nearly a century in the construction given to the grant of 1806 by the late Philemon Wright his heirs and those holding from and through them, and in their possession in conformity therewith during such period. In addition to this acquiescence the numerous unconditional and unrestricted admissions of the Crown contained in the public records and in-subsequent grants further establish that such interpretation of the grant of 180 was correct.\nThis little creek flowing from the navigable river and returning to it again can not be properly referred to as an arm or branch of the river. To be properly described as an arm or branch of a navigable river such a stream must in the first place be included within the extreme banks of the river as generally recognized, and it must, m the second place, be of considerable dimensions and either navigable or floatable itself as a matter fact Glover v. Powell ([13]) ; The King v. Montague ([14]) per Bayley J. at page 602 ; Mayor of Lynn. v. Turner ([15]) per Mansfield C. J.; Rowe v. Granite Bridge Corporation ([16]) per Shaw, C. J, at page 347; 2 Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law, p. 827, vo. \"Arm of the Sea\" ; 21 Am. & Eng. Encycl. p. 428, vo \"Navigable Waters.\" See also Dalloz vo. \"Eaux\" No. 61; Bell v. The corporation of Quebec ([17]), per Dorion C. J. at pages 108 and 109 ; and at pages 91-94 of the report in the Privy Council ([18]).\nThe title to the bed of the creek actually passed to the late Philemon Wright under the grant of 1806, even if the said creek were proved to have been then navigable or regarded as part of a public liver. No more express grant could possibly be made of it than that contained in the description of lot 3 and the other terms of the grant of 1806, which must be construed according to the usual meaning of the words therein contained, and no reservation being made, the grantor must be presumed to grant all that he could grant within the area described. Lord v. Commissioners for the City of Sydney ([19]) at pages 497, 498. and 499 ; The Queen v. Robertson ([20]), at pages 95, 96, 97, 98, 127, 128 ; Broom's Legal Maxims (7 ed.) p. 401.\nIt is submitted that where rivers are navigable in parts and non-navigable in parts, only those portions thereof which are actually and profitably navigable should be regarded and treated as navigable rivers, especially as regards the riparian owners. The Queen v. Robertson ([21]), per Strong J. at page 130 ; United States v. The Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co. ([22]). Even in navigable parts of rivers and lakes, the riparian rights of a person owning lands bounded by such rivers or lakes, extend to the point of practical navigation. Illinois Central Railway Co. v. The State of Illinois ([23]) at pages 436 and 445-447.\nAt any rate, the right to use the water flowing over the bed of Brewery Creek passed to the late Philemon Wright as an accessory of the lands over which it flowed. The rights of the riparian proprietor either to the use of the water or of the land over which it flows cannot depend on the place from which the water comes. Art. 414 C. C. ; remarks by Cockburn C.J. as cited in Robertson Case (1) at page 119 ; The Fisheries Case ([24]) ; The Queen v. Moss ([25]).\nThe City of Hull, in 1901, instituted an action against respondents' immediate auteur, Nancy Louisa Wright, claiming one-half of Brewery Creek within the area in question in this case, under a title which was traced back to the grant of 1806. Three courts decided against the City of Hull in that case and ordered a bornage according to the respective rights of the City of Hull and respondents' auteur and, this being a real action, the judgments referred to are conclusive and binding upon the Crown as well as the City of Hull and constitute res judicata both as to what constitutes Brewery Creek and as to the extent of the rights of the parties therein. Art. 1241 C. C. : Pothier \" Obiigations, \" Nos. 894, 895 and 896 ; Dalloz, Supp. art. 1351 ; Nos. 9180, 9184, 9185. The City of Hull in electing to prosecute that suit, after it obtained the grant of 1902, is now barred and estopped from invoking the benefit of the grant of 1902.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014It could not but be conceded by the appellants that if, as found by the two courts-below, Brewery Creek, the watercourse in question, is neither navigable nor floatable, they are out of court. For, in that case, it unquestionably formed part of the grant to Philemon Wright, in 1806, and, consequently the letters patent of 1902 conveyed no title to the City of Hull. The Massawippi Valley Railway Co. v. Reed. ([26]).\nNow the evidence is overwhelmingly in support of the findings appealed from. No one, before the appellants, has ever seriously contended that such a small stream, across which a child could throw a stone and which, before the works that have been erected in the Ottawa River in the interest of the lumber trade could have been crossed on foot and was even dry in certain places during part of the summer, is as a matter of fact a navigable or floatable river.\nThe appellants' alternative contention, rejected by all the judges in the courts below, that though not navigable in fact this creek, being an arm of the Ottawa. River itself a navigable river, it is therefore to be considered, in law, as being a navigable stream cannot prevail. By the law of the Province of Quebec, as-well as by the law of England, a river is not deemed to be navigable unless it is actually capable of navigation. The King v. Montague ([27]) ; Mayor of Lynn v. Turner ([28]) ; Bell v. City of Quebec, ([29]) affirmed in the Privy Council ([30]) ; Rowe v. Granite Bridge Corporation ([31]) ; Adams v. Pease ([32]) ; Glover v. Powell ([33]) ; Hubbard v. Hubbard ([34]) ; Healy v. Joliette and Chicago Railroad Co. ([35]) ; The Robert W. Parsons ([36]).\nThis is a question of public law ([37]) and the opinions of the modern text writers, upon whom the appellants rely on this part of their case, are based upon ordinances and decrees of the executive authority which are not in force in the Province of Quebec. Daviel, Vol. 1, Nos. 40-41 Plocque, L\u00e9gisl. des Eaux, Vol. 2, No. 7 ; S. V. 1850, 2,617 ; Guyot, Rep. v. Rivi\u00e8re.\nI would further be of opinion, with the Superior Court and the majority of the Court of Appeal, that whether this creek is floatable or not the letters patent of 1806 included the bed of it as part of the land within the limits of the lot granted to Wright. To read out of these letters patent the bed of this creek is to find therein a reservation thereof which the Crown did not make and must be held not to have intended to make by the very fact that it did not make it, and left Wright and his representatives in possession for nearly one hundred years, under the authority of these letters patent. The grant to Wright without reservation, is an express grant of every inch contained in the lots granted, covered with water or not. If it had been intended to exclude out of it this Brewery Creek, the land granted would have been described as bounded by the banks of the said creek on each side of it For, if it is floatable, its banks are part of the public domain; art. 400 C. C.\nThe appellants' quotations from Troplong and Pothier in support of the proposition that\ndans la mesure de la contenance il ne faut pas confondre les chemins publics et les rivi\u00e8res navigables qui traversent ou bordent le fonds vendu, ni les bords de lamer qui viennent les joindre ; car toutes ces choses faisant partie du domaine public, sont \u00e9videmment plac\u00e9es en dehors des stipulations des parties \u00e0 moins de conventions contraires,\nhave no application whatever. Of course if A sells to B say 100 acres of land to he taken out of a larger extent of territory belonging to A, B is intitled to 100 acres of land that previously belonged to A and A must be held to have sold only what belonged to him. That is all that these commentators say. But they do not say, and could not have said that if A sells to B all the land he owns within described limits, every inch of the land that belongs to A within these limits does not pass to B.\nI would dismiss the two appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant, the Attorney-General for Quebec: L.

Wright, (respondents' auteur) and also for an injunction to restrain the mis en cause from the construction of certain buildings and improvements upon the locus in quo. An interim injunction was granted, as prayed, by Lavergne J. and, on the commencement of other constructions at the point in dispute by the city, an injunction was also applied for by the respondents.

The Court of Review, at Montreal, affirmed these judgments and, on further appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada on 26th May 1902 affirmed the decisions of the said courts with an addition to the motifs as well as to the dispositif of the judgment of the Superior Court (Archibald J.) of the 30th of November, 1901, to the effect that the present respondents, who were also defendants in that action had, furthermore, a acquired the ownership of lot No. 95, including the locus in quo) by the thirty years prescription.''\nSubsequently, a provincial land surveyor, appointed by the court, made a survey in situ of the properties in dispute and reported his proceedings to the court suggesting a boundary line. Thereupon, the respondents moved to reject portions of the surveyor's report as being inconsistent with his instructions for the location of the boundary and the findings in the judgments in respect to the title and, also, to have the report varied and the boundary line located in accordance with the judgments. The present appellant also moved to reject the line suggested in the report and to have another boundary line adopted. On a re-inscription before Mr Justice Archibald, for the hearing of these motions and upon the issues as to costs which had been reserved, the appellant's motion was dismissed, the respondents' motion was maintained and it was ordered that the boundary line should be located as set out in detail in the judgment pursuant to the former judgments. This latter judgment also adjudicated finally as to the costs in respect to the injunctions and the principal action. On appeal, the judgment of Mr. Justice Archibald was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench and the City of Hull now asserts the present appeal.\nAylen K.C. for the motion. The chief question at issue is in respect to the adjudication as to costs and, consequently, no appeal can lie. Moir v. Village of Huntington ([1]); Schloman v. Dowker ([2]); McKay v. Township of Hinchinbrooke ([3]). The other question at issue is simply as to the location of the boundary which had been finally settled by the judgments on the principal action, affirmed by this court on 26th May, 1902. There cannot be any appeal from the present judgment which is merely an order in execution of the former judgment of the court. Gully v. Ferdais is ([4]).\nForan K.C. contra. The present appeal calls in question the title to all the land lying upon either side of the proposed location of the boundary line which may be claimed or held by either party. There cannot he chose jug\u00e9e on this point by the former judgment; it was not in simili materi\u00e2 and could not and did not make any final disposition as to the boundary line ; that has been done now for the first time by the judgment appealed from. In the case of Cully v. Ferdais ([5]) the question was as to a servitude only, a right of way which had to be localized, therefore, that case does not apply. We rely upon the decisions in Chamber land v. Fortier ([6]); McGroey v. Leamy ([7]); and Stuart v. Moll ([8]). We also refer to 20 Laurent no. 29; 3 Garconnais (1 ed.) p. 239 no. l3 and 8 Aubry & Rau, 369.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTASCHEREAU C.J. \u2014 (Oral.)

JUSTICE KILLAM, IN CHAMBERS.\nCriminal law\u2014Jurisdiction of magistrate\u2014Criminal Code sec. 785 \u2014 Constitutional law\u2014Constitution of criminal courts.\nBy sec. 785 of the Criminal Code any person charged before a police magistrate in Ontario with an offence which might be tried at the general sessions of the peace, may, with his own consent, be tried by the magistrate and sentenced, if convicted, to the same punishment as if tried at the general sessions. By an amendment in 1900(63 Vict. ch. 46) the provisions of said section were extended to police and stipendiary magistrates of cities and towns in other parts of Canada.\nHeld, that though there are no courts of general sessions except in Ontario, the amending Act is not, therefore, inoperative but gives to a magistrate in any other province the jurisdiction created for Ontario by sec. 785.\nThough the organization of courts of criminal jurisdiction is within the exclusive powers of the provincial legislatures, the Parliament of Canada may impose upon existing courts or individuals the duty of administering the criminal law and its action to that end need not be supplemented by provincial legislation.\nAppeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Killam in Chambers refusing a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe appellant Yancini was charged with the crime of theft before the Police Magistrate at Fredericton, N.B., and having elected to be tried summarily he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary. Application was made to a judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for a writ of habeas corpus on the two main grounds: 1. That as by sec. 785 of the Criminal Code, as amended by 63 Vict. ch. 46 a summary trial can only be had for an offence triable at a court of general sessions of the peace such section is inoperative, there being no such court in New Brunswick. 2. That the Dominion Parliament cannot give jurisdiction to a provincial court to try criminal offences the power to constitute a court of criminal jurisdiction being given only to the legislature.\nThe application for the writ was referred to the full Court in New Brunswick by which it was refused[1]. A similar application was then made to Mr. Justice Killam of the Supreme Court of Canada, in chambers, who also refused the writ, and this appeal was taken from his decision.\nOn March 21st, Crockett, for the appellant, applied to have a day fixed for the hearing, but the Supreme Court of Canada ordered the case to stand until notice of hearing was served on the Attorney-General for New Brunswick and the Attorney-General for Canada. Notices having been served as ordered, the hearing took place on the 27th of April, 1904.\nCrockett for the appellant, referred to the facts of the case as stated above and in the judgment now reported and relied upon the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, sec. 91 par. 27; sec. 92 par. 14; sec. 101; secs. 539, 540 of the \"Criminal Code\" and the decisions in Ex parte Wright[2]; Ex parte Flanagan[3]; Peirce v. Hopper[4]; James v. The Southwestern Railway Co.[5]; and In re County Courts of British Columbia[6].\nNewcombe K.C. Deputy Minister of Justice, for the Attorney-General for Canada. The question at issue in the case of The County Courts of British Columbia (6) affected merely the powers of the provincial legislatures respecting the constitution maintenance and organization of provincial courts and for defining their territorial jurisdiction. In that case it was decided that the \"Speedy Trials Act\" was not a statute conferring jurisdiction but an exercise of the power of Parliament regarding criminal procedure. See remarks by Strong J. at page 454 of the report. The Criminal Code Amendment Act, 1900, consequently, is not inoperative but gives to magistrates in cities and towns in all the other provinces of Canada the same jurisdiction as that created for Ontario by sec. 785, imposing a duty for the administration of the criminal law without any need of supplementary provincial legislation. We also refer to Reg v. Toland[7] at page 509; Valin v. Langlois[8]; Lefroy's Legislative Power in Canada, p. 510; and In re Liquor License Act, 1883[9].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014This is an appeal to the court from an order of Mr. Justice Killam refusing an application for an order nisi for a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe prisoner was charged before the Police Magistrate of the City of Fredericton, on the 18th January, last, with the theft of two binocular glasses, of the value of $50.00; one revolver value $15.00, to get her with several articles of jewelry, the property of one Captain Kemmis-Betty, an officer of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Infantry, stationed at Fredericton. He consented to be tried by the Police Magistrate, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years imprisonment in Dorchester Penitentiary, with hard labour. He was placed in custody in the said penitentiary on the 21st January and is now detained there under his\n[Page 624\nsentence. An application was made before Mr. Justice Landry, of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, for his discharge under the Habeas Corpus Act. That learned judge referred the question to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick which court dismissed the application. Subsequently application was made to Mr. Justice Killam of this court, as above stated.\nTwo contentions were made before us by counsel for the prisoner to shew that he was illegally sentenced. 1. Because the prisoner was not charged before the magistrate with an offence for which he might be tried by a Court of General Sessions of the Peace, which was a condition precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction purporting to be conferred by section 785 of the Criminal Code of Canada, under which the said, magistrate acted. 2. Because section 785 of the Code, as amended by the Act of 1900, chpater 46 is ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada, and there was no good or sufficient legislation of the Province of New Brunswick to make its provisions operative or effective in that province.\nWe are of opinion that neither of these contentions can be sustained. As to the first ground, by section 782 the expression \"magistrate\" in the Province of New Brunswick, means and includes any police magistrate acting within the local limits of his jurisdiction. Then, section 785 provides that if any person is charged in the Province of Ontario before a police magistrate with having committed any offence for which he might be tried at a Court of General Sessions of the Peace, such person may, with his own consent, be tried before such magistrate, and may, if found guilty, be sentenced by the magistrate to the same punishment that he would have been liable to if he had been tried before the Court of General Sessions of the Peace. Section 783 provides that whenever any person is charged before a magistrate with having committed theft, the magistrate may hear and determine, subject to the further provisions of the Act, the charge in a summary way.\nBy the amending Act of 1900, a sub-section was added to section 785 as follows:\n2. This section shall apply also to police and stipendiary magistrates of cities and incorporated towns in every other part of Canada' and to recorders where they exercise judicial functions.\nWe are of opinion that that gives the magistrate in provinces and territories, other than in the Province of Ontario, the same jurisdiction to try the crime of theft as a Court of General Sessions in Ontario has to try the offence in that province.\nThe contention that inasmuch as there is no Court of General Sessions of the Peace in New Brunswick the amending Act is inoperative and that it can only relate to a province where such a court exists would entirely frustrate the object of Parliament. I do not know anywhere in Canada, outside of Ontario, where there is a Court of General Sessions of the Peace or any similar court, except in the cities of Montreal and Quebec, in the Province of Quebec, and if it had been the intention to limit the operation of the amendment to the places mentioned, the only amendment necessary would be to have changed the first line of section 785 by substituting for the words \"in the Province of Ontario\" the words \"in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\"\nIn addition to this, it does not appear whether the prisoner was convicted under section 785 or section 789, which section applies to the whole of Canada, and which, as much as section 785, gives ample authority to the magistrate to make the conviction complained of. As to the second point in our view the Dominion Parliament can, in matters within its sphere, impose duties upon any subjects of the Dominion, whether they be officials of provincial courts, other officials, or private citizens; and there is nothing in the British North America Act to raise a doubt about the power of the Dominion Parliament to impose new duties upon the existing provincial courts, or to give them new powers; as to matters which do not come within the subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, or to deprive them of jurisdiction over such matters. (Lefroy on the Legislatative Powers in Canada, page 510.)\nThis statement of the law is mainly founded upon the celebrated decision of this court in Valin v. Langlois[10] where it was held that the Dominion Controverted Elections Act (1874) was not ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament, and whether or not the Act established a Dominion court, the Dominion Parliament had a perfect right to give to the courts of the respective provinces and the judges thereof the power thereby created, and did not, in utilizing judicial officers and establishing courts to discharge the duties assigned to them by that Act, in any particular invade the rights of the local legislatures; and the majority of the court, Ritchie C.J. and Taschereau and Gwynne JJ, held that that Act established a Dominion court as authorized by section 101 of the British North America Act.\nThe question is most fully treated by Mr. Justice Taschereau, now Chief Justice of this court, and it is unnecessary now to do more than refer to that opinion. The judgment of this court, in that case, was affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upon the grounds stated[11].\nThis court again affirmed the same principle in Attorney-General v. Flint[12], which, however, related to a jurisdiction imposed by the Parliament of Canada upon the imperially created Court of Vice-Admiralty, in Nova Scotia.\nWhere once the Parliament of Canada has given jurisdiction to a provincial court whether superior or inferior, or to a judicial officer, to perform judicial functions in the adjudicating of matters over which the Parliament of Canada has exclusive jurisdiction, no provincial legislation, in our opinion, is necessary in order to enable effect to be given to such parliamentary enactments.\nOn these grounds, we think the application for a writ of habeas corpus in the present case should be refused.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] 36 N.

And it is not exclusive where other parties lumbered on the land continuously or at intervals, during any portion of such period. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] maintaining the verdict for the plaintiff and refusing a new trial.\nThis was an action brought by the appellant as plaintiff in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick for the recovery of the possession of a quantity of saw logs claimed by the appellant to be his property upon the ground that they were cut upon certain lands of the plaintiff situate in the Parish of Sackville, in the County of Westmoreland, known as the Dickie lot.\nTo this the defendant pleaded\u2014\n1 That he did not take the logs.\n2. That the logs were the property of Sylvain P. LeBlanc.\n3 That neither the lands nor the logs were the property of the plaintiff.\nUpon these pleas issue was joined and the case was tried at the Westmoreland circuit in July, 1902, and resulted in a verdict for the defendant.\nThe plaintiff moved before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to set aside such verdict and for a new trial, and that court after consideration refused the motion, whereby the verdict was confirmed, against which last mentioned decision this appeal is taken.\nThe action, although nominally a personal one, involved the trial of the title as between the parties to the lands where the logs were cut. These lands formed part of the lot situate in the Parish of Sackville known as the Dickie lot, which lot is part of a large tract of wilderness land known as the \"Sackville Eights.\"\nBoth parties gave evidence of possession by those through whom they claimed, that on plaintiff's part beginning in 1851 and that for defendant going back ten years earlier. The plaintiff, however, claimed title through a deed from a squatter followed by tunning lines and enclosing the land.\nPowell K. C. and Teed K. C. for the appellant This being an action of replevin the bunden of proof is on the defendant.\nThe defendant's possession at the best consisted of isolated acts over a small portion of the lot and was not continuous. This could never give him title to any part of it. Sherren v. Pearson[2].\nThe plaintiff, on the other hand, had an exclusive and continuous possession of nearly all the lot for over twenty years and the conveyances made from time to time had confirmed his title. Bentley v. Peppard[3].\nPugsley K. C. and Friel (Masters K. C. with them) for the respondent. Defendant having pleaded non cepit the plaintiff must prove the wrongful taking. Graham v. Wetmore[4].\nPlaintiff having gone into possession under a deed from one who had no title and which did not convey by metes and bounds his subsequent running of lines added nothing to the strength of his position. Harris v. Mudie[5].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. In form the appellant's action is in replevin for alleged unlawful taking of logs by the respondent upon a lot of land called the Dickie lot. but in substance the controversy is as to the title to the said lot Neither the appellant nor those through whom he claims nor the respondent have any documentary title to this lot. The question is one of possession, and of course, as such, a question of fact and peculiarly within the province of the jury. Now, there was ample evidence to warrant the findings of the jury in favour of the respondent. And with these findings, approved of as they were by the learned judge, who presided at the trial and by the court in banco unanimously, we would not be justified in interfering.\nI agree in the reasoning of the Chief Justice of New Brunswick.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014Concurred.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action of replevin brought by the appellant against respondent to obtain possession of certain logs alleged by plaintiff to have been cut upon lands claimed as his and described in his declaration by metes and bounds.\nThe defendant, in addition to pleading non cepit, by his fourth plea denied that the lands and premises or the logs or any of them were the property of the plaintiff.\nThe logs after having been cut, hauled and made into merchantable timber by defendant must then be presumed to have been his property and will be so held against all the world but the real owner or some one legally entitled under him to their possession. The onus in this case lay upon the plaintiff to prove that he was such real owner, and the main question for our decision is whether or not he has satisfied such onus. The defendant in his pleadings and at the trial raised other issues claiming himself to be the owner of the lands from which the logs were cut. It may well be that the evidence does not support such a claim, but even if it must be held unproved, that does not help the plaintiff who only can recover if and when he has proved a legal title, either by conveyance or possession to the lands in dispute. If he failed to prove such title he cannot recover however weak defendant's title may be to the lands in dispute. Neither party pretended to have a good documentary title. Both claimed to have acquired title by possession.\nChief Justice Tuck in delivering judgment states the facts as follows:\nThe action is one of replevin. It was tried at Dorchester, in the County of Westmoreland, in July, 1902, before Mr. Justice McLeod, and after many days' trial resulted in a verdict for the defendant. Although in form the action is for alleged unlawful taking of logs, the property of the plaintiff, yet, in substance, the trial was concerning the title to land where the logs were cut This land is situate at Sackville, in the County of Westmoreland, and forms a part of what is known as \"Sackville Rights.\" The lot immediately in question in this action consists of seven hundred acres, and is known as the \"Dickie\" lot. It is claimed, on the part of the plaintiff, that the land in dispute is part of a large tract of land which probably more than fifty years since was run out by John Dickie and continued in Mr. Dickie's possession until 1867. He sold certain lots or shares in it, and in that year he conveyed the remainder to David H. Calhoun, who there owned a mill property. It is also claimed on behalf of the plaintiff that, during Dickie's ownership and control, he exercised the usual acts of ownership over the property without interference. That so long as David H. Calhoun owned the property, he continued to operate upon it for logs in the usual way. That in 1881 David H. Calhoun conveyed this property, with other timber lands and his mill property, to his sons, Thomas B. Calhoun and Clement Calhoun. That they went into possession and cut logs in the usual way. In 1885 the whole property became vested in the plaintiff. That since the last named time the title has remained in him and lumbering operations have been carried on, under his control or on his behalf, down to the present time.\nIn the fall of 1901 the defendant cut logs on the Dickie lot, being the land in question. Those are the logs to get possession of which the writ of replevin was issued, and this action is defended by LeBlanc, who claimed title to the property in question.\nOn the other hand the defendant says that there is ample proof upon which a jury could find, that there were acts of possession on the part of the French settlers, as they are called, running back from a period of sixty years. That they had this land in occupation since 1842, and down to 1867 they were not interfered with in their occupation. That it is not pretended there was an act of ownership by Dickie further back than 1851. The plaintiff and those through whom he claimed had at different times cut trees and carried on lumbering operations on different parts of this tract of land which plaintiff claimed. It was not pretended by the plaintiff's counsel that they had proved anything more than a title by constructive possession under the Statute of Limitations. There was no continuous occupation by the plaintiff or his predecessors in title of the general tract of land said to be within the boundaries of his deeds much less of the special 700 acres here in dispute, or any part of it. Nor, as I understand, was it contended that there was any such possession as, in the absence of the deeds under colour of which plaintiff claimed, would have extinguished the true owner's title and given a title to the plaintiff by possession. What was contended for was that those through whom plaintiff claimed were first in possession and that from their possession such as it was a seisin in fee might or should be presumed. To my mind it is perfectly clear under the evidence that there was not such possession as under the statute extinguished the true owner's title and gave a statutory one to the plaintiff unless indeed it is held that the existence of the deeds give to the isolated and intermittent acts of possession relied on, such as surveys and lumbering in the winter months, cutting out roads to haul the lumber and so forth, a legal effect alike as to the continuity and to extent entirely different from the effect which would be given to such acts in the absence of the deeds. The plaintiff in his factum submits that \"the question to be decided really is who was first in possession?\" He argues that \"if Dickie was first in possession of the land the law would presume him to be seised in fee and that the case should then be governed as if the plaintiff and those through whom he claims were in possession under the best of documentary titles.\" Such an argument assumes two conditions as premises. First, that constructive possession as distinguished from actual possession is good enough to enable the possessor to claim the presumption of a \"legal seisin,\" and secondly, that such possession need not be continuous but may be gathered from intermittent and isolated acts. I agree that seisin in fee may and will be presumed from evidence of the actual possession of a house, field, close, farm or messuage. But I cannot find any authority for extending the application of any such presumption to large tracts of wilderness lands which may be held in constructive possession, nor do I think it can on principle be so held. It is the actual possession which justifies the presumption. The very basis from which it arises is absent in the case of constructive possession only. When and while actual possession is in a man seisin will be presumed to the extent of his actual possession or occupation. But the moment he ceases actually to possess or occupy, that moment the presumption ceases, and it does not arise at all with respect to lands of which there is no actual possession or occupation or beyond the bounds of such actual possession or occupation. To my mind, therefore, the question is not whether those through whom the plaintiff or defendant claimed first trespassed upon and temporarily occupied the disputed lands or a part of them, but the onus of proof being upon the plaintiff whether with respect to the lands off which the trees in question were cut (or the block of such lands contained within the colourable title deeds) he has shewn such open, notorious, continuous, exclusive possession or occupation of any part of such lands as would constructively apply to all of them, and operate to extinguish the title of the true owner and give plaintiff a statutory one. The nature of the possession necessary to do this in the absence of colourable title was fully considered by this court in the case of Sherren v. Pearson[6]. It was there decided that isolated acts of trespass committed on wild lands from year to year will not, combined, operate to give the trespasser a title under the statute.\nIn the carefully reasoned opinions of the judges in that case statements on the point are made which do not seem to leave the matter open to any doubt. Chief Justice Ritchie formally approved of the law as laid down in Doe d. DesBarres v. White[7], and at page 585 goes on to say:\nTo enable the (trespasser) to recover he must show an actual possession, an occupation exclusive, continuous, open or visible, and notorious for twenty years. It must not be equivocal, occasional or for a special or temporary purpose.\nAnd in another place he says,\nthe trespasser to gain title must as it were \"keep his flag flying over the land he claims.\"\nStrong J. and Fournier J. concurred. Taschereau J. (now the Chief Justice of this court, said (pp. 594-5):\nThe fact that the wrongdoer or trespasser supposes he has a claim or title to the land does not alter the character of his acts. His unfounded belief cannot diminish or destroy the legal claims of the true owners or deprive them of their right to treat him as a wrongdoer in entering on their land. The effect to be given to repeated entries upon the land, or acts of user or possession, depend largely upon the nature of the property. What might be sufficient evidence in the case of cultivated lands to go to a jury would not constitute any evidence in those of wilderness lands. If the property is of a nature that cannot easily be protected against intrusion, mere acts of user by trespassers will not establish a right.\nOwners of wilderness or wooded lands lying alongside or in rear of other cultivated fields are not bound to fence them or to hire men to protect them from spoliation. The spoiler, however, does not by managing without discovery even for successive years to carry away valuable timber, necessarily acquire, in addition, title to the land. The law does not so reward spoliation. Henry J. said, (page 592):\nNumerous acts of trespass only amount to so many acts of disseisin; when a man trespasses on the land the true owner ceases to have full possession for the time being; but the moment the trespass is at. an end the trespasser's disseisin is at an end and the complete possession is again in the actual owner. It is therefore required that the party should not only take possession, not only disseise the owner, but that he should continue that disseisin so as to amount to an ouster, and that ouster maintained for the statutory period. That can only be done by some act of possession not merely by a temporary disseisin, and it must be over every inch of land of which the party claims possession.\nNow, in my judgment, the possession necessary under a colourable title to oust the title of the true owner must be just as open, actual, exclusive, continuous and notorious as when claimed without such colour, the only difference being that the actual possession of part is extended by construction to all the lands within the boundaries of the deed but only when and while there is that part occupation. And before it can be extended it must exist and is only extended by construction while it exists. It may be that a person with colourable title engaged in lumbering on land would be held while so engaged and in actual occupation of part to be in the constructive possession of all not actually adversely, occupied even if that embraced some thousands of acres within the bounds of his deed. But it is clear to my mind that if and when such person withdraws from the possession of the part by ceasing to carry on the acts which gave him possession there he necessarily ceases to have constructive possession of the rest. His possession in other words must be an actual continuous possession, at least of part.\nWhen the lumbering ceased in the spring of the year and actual occupation of any part of the lands ceased, then as a necessary consequence all constructive possession ceased with it. As was said by Mr. Justice Burton in Kay v. Wilson[8]:\nBut in both cases (that is one entering with and one without colour of title) an actual, visible occupation or possession of some portion of the land is necessary for the full period of twenty years,\nand, I add to that, a continuous possession.\nThe character and nature of the possession, the extent of which is sought to be broadened and lengthened by construction so as to cover lands not in actual possession, must not, however, be equivocal. It must possess those characteristics which have been determined to be essential to a possession claimed by a squatter as against the true owner, that is it must be open, exclusive, continuous, so notorious that the claimant may be said to \"have his flag flying over it.\" Can the intermittent and isolated acts of cutting down trees in winter constitute alone such a possession?\nIn the case at bar it is not and could not be contended for a moment that there was any actual, visible, continuous and exclusive possession of any part of the lands within the boundaries of plaintiff's deeds by himself and those through whom he claims. On the contrary the defendant and those settlers under whom and with whose authority he cut the trees on the land had obtained and, since the building of the brush fence in 1869, or 1870, had retained the possession of the land enclosed by the fence. It may well be true that each party cut trees at times off these lands. Chief Justice Tuck who delivered the leading judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick said with respect to the findings of the jury:\nIt is not necessary that I should refer in detail to the questions put by the learned judge and the answers of the jury. They found that prior to 1850 or 1851, the old settlers were in possession of the whole of the tract of land known and spoken of in this suit as the big block, and they exercised ownership over it, claiming and treating it as their land, and what they did were not individual acts of trespass; that the settlers of the Gould settlement prior to the survey made by John Dickie had possession of, and exercised ownership over that portion of what is called the Dickie lot in this suit to the northeast of the Calhoun Portage road, so called, and within the line where the brush fence spoken of in this suit now is, claiming and treating it as their lands; that John Dickie, David H. Calhoun, Thomas B. Calhoun and Clement Calhoun did not, nor did any of them, go into possession of the lot down to the time the property was sold and conveyed to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff after the lot was sold and conveyed to him did not go into possession of the whole of the lot, and exercise ownership and use the whole of the lot as his own; that the brush fence was put around the big block, so called, by the Gould settlers about 1869 or 1870; that when Dickie made the survey of that lot there were old roads used by the settlers, around that portion of the land on the Dickie land northeast of the Calhoun Portage road, which is claimed by the defendant to be comprised in the big block, and six of the jurors say that when the brush fence was put around it followed old roads then in existence around the big block.\nThe evidence is very voluminous, somewhat difficult in parts to understand and very conflicting. It was submitted to a jury by Mr. Justice McLeod in a charge as to which no exception is taken. The learned judge submitted some twenty-eight questions to the jury and all were substantially answered in defendant's favour. The trial judge concurred with the rest of the court in refusing to disturb the verdict. Amongst other important statements made in the considered judgment of the trial judge, Mr. Justice McLeod, is the following:\nThe jury found, first that the Bonhomme Gould settlers, (of whom defendant was one) had had possession long prior to 51 and exclusive possession and exercised acts of possession, and found the lines were the old lines that ran around it at the time, and in about 1869 or 1870 a brush fence was put around and which they found followed the old lines, and also found neither Dickie or Calhoun or plaintiff ever had exclusive possession.\nThere was evidence on which they could find Bonhomme Gould had possession. In the case of Estabrooks v. Breau there was the same of evidence, although they themselves might not come to the conclusion, yet there was evidence to warrant the jury in finding as they did, and I think under that charge we could not disturb the verdict.\nOn the other hand the jury also found neither the plaintiff nor Calhoun nor Dickie ever had entire possession, and I think there was ample evidence to warrant that finding. So we find both branches in favour of the defendant and therefore I think the verdict should not be disturbed.\nFor my own part, I do not say that the evidence given was sufficient to give a statutory possessory title to either of the parties. The issues of fact are not which of the parties was first in possession. It is simply whether or not the plaintiff has complied with the onus which lay upon him of proving a good title to possession in himself.\nThe case is one between two conflicting claims neither of which may be perfectly good. A similar case Estabrooks v. Breau[9] was tried in the courts of New Brunswick in 1874 respecting a portion of this very land. The defendants' title there was the same as that of defendant here. The court there held that\nas between parties without title each seeking to make a title for himself the court will not interfere with the finding of a jury unless clearly and unequivocally wrong.\nI agree with that decision and see no ground upon which this court should interfere with such a verdict as that rendered here approved of by the trial judge and supported by the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick.\nI would summarise the main reasons I have advanced as follows: The onus of proving title under the pleadings lies on the plaintiff and unless he satisfies that he must fail. He did not pretend to have a good legal documentary title but one gained by constructive possession under colour of title. To gain such a title by constructive possession it was essential that he should prove an open, notorious, exclusive and continuous possession of at the very least a part of the lands described in his deeds. So far from the evidence shewing such continuous, notorious and exclusive possession in the plaintiff it was, even if all of plaintiff's evidence is accepted, simply intermittent and isolated acts of lumbering on parts of the land, and which were suspended altogether in the summer months. Such evidence was entirely wanting in that essential element of a continuous occupation of at any rate part of the lands claimed and so far from being exclusive was found by the jury, on conflicting evidence, it is true, but which was for them to decide on, to be for many years back in the defendant.\nEvidence that a party claims land by possession either with or without colour of title is not sufficient when it merely establishes that the claimant used the lands in the same way and for the same purposes as an ordinary owner would. A true owner of lands is not bound to use them in any way. He may prefer to leave them vacant. While they are vacant he still retains the legal possession, and he only ceases to be in legal possession when and during the time that he is ousted from it by a trespasser or squatter, who has acquired and maintained what the law holds to be an actual possession. If the squatter claims to have ousted him by constructive possession he must prove a continuous, open, notorious, exclusive possession of at least part of the lands the whole of which he lays claim to under his colourable deed.\nThe appeal therefore should, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I agree in the dismissal of the appeal.\nKILLAM J.\u2014After a very careful examination of the evidence in this case, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Neither plaintiff nor defendant established a title to the logs in question, either directly or by ownership of the land on which they were cut. The real question was whether or not the plaintiff had a technical possession of land and logs, which enabled him to recover the logs from the defendant who could show no better title.\nAfter a long and expensive trial the defendant had a verdict, which the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refused to disturb.\nIt is clear that this court should not interfere unless it finds the argument against the verdict to be of an overwhelming character.\nIt is not a case of a prim\u00fb facie title to be inferred from possession, but a case of a plaintiff who, upon his own showing, has no title to land or logs, asserting a technical right, upon a claim of a merely constructive possession which for thirty years has been actively disputed by the defendant and his associates, and which has never been effectively established in fact.\nI quite accede to the plaintiff's contention that the jury were wrong in finding that the Bonhomme Grould settlers had any possession of the locus in quo prior to or at the time when Dickie and his associates assumed to lay out and appropriate the block of land subsequently known as the Dickie lot. Upon this point the evidence shows no more than a series of trespasses in cutting hay upon the meadows, or wood from the forest. And there is nothing whatever to warrant the conclusion that the old roads used by the settlers for hauling wood and hay were made or used as boundaries evidencing possession of the lands enclosed within them.\nDown to the time of the construction of the brush fence, found by the jury, upon evidence warranting the finding, to have been built in 1869, there was nothing to indicate an actual attempt to take possession of any part of the disputed territory by these settlers or to warrant a finding of possession by them.\nOn the other hand, the evidence was such as to amply warrant a finding by the jury that neither Wood, Palmer nor Dickie was in possession of any portion of the tract when Wood and Palmer conveyed to Dickie, and he to David Calhoun, in 1867. The basis of the original attempt at appropriation of this unoccupied wild land was in claims to \"wilderness rights\" by Benjamin Scurr, Jabez Palmer and William Sears. None of the counsel were able to inform us what was meant by this expression. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that it designated any right recognized either by law or by custom. It was certainly open to the jury to reject it as evidencing any real bona fide claim of right.\nThe attempted description by metes and bounds in the conveyance by Sears to Wood was of a very vague character. On one side the boundary was by \"wilderness lands.\" No courses or distances were given by which to trace the real boundaries intended to be assigned.\nDickie says that \"he used to go in once in a while to see about it\"\u2014about twice in a summer, and that he sold some ship timber from it to one Dickson, who made a road into the property and cut and took away the timber. Upon Dickie's evidence, Dickson took off the timber in two winters, about 1860. Wood, also, sold off some timber.\nThere is no evidence of any continued occupation or use of the tract by Dickie, Palmer or Wood extending to 1867, when it was conveyed to Calhoun.\nUpon the evidence of Thomas B. Calhoun, his father did enter upon active operations upon the property immediately after the conveyance to him, and carried these on continuously over the whole property until he conveyed to his sons in December, 1881, and they pursued the same course while they held it and afterwards for the plaintiff Wood down to the time of the cutting of the logs in question.\nHis evidence by itself made a fairly strong case of a real possession which would be carried by construction to the boundaries given by the deed to David Calhoun.\nBut Thomas Calhoun is still an interested party and it was open to the jury to distrust the reliability of his testimony either on that ground or on that of possible defects of memory as to the events of thirty years.\nSo far as I can find, no other witness corroborated Thomas Calhoun's statement that, from the commencement of his operations, in 1867, his father cut from the portion of the lot enclosed in 1869 within the brush fence.\nThomas Eadon, who cut under contract with David Calhoun from the very beginning and got out timber for him continuously for some fifteen years thereafter, and who placed the first camp upon that portion of the land, gave no such evidence. Upon his testimony and that of other witnesses, the erection of that camp and any attempt at actual continuous occupation by Calhoun of any part of the territory within that enclosure occurred after the erection of the brush fence. From the very initiation of such an attempt Calhoun was met with remonstrances and resistance by the settlers. The brush fence was evidently erected as a sign that he was to go no farther in that direction.\nThere was abundant evidence that these settlers who claimed to have previously held possession of a certain tract, and to have confirmed this by enclosing it within the brush fence, continued from the time of its erection to cut timber, logs, poles and firewood over the tract until the cause of action arose, and this without active interference between the years 1874 and 1900. There was, also, evidence that the Calhouns, at times during this period, purchased from these settlers logs and timber known by the purchasers to have been cut on a portion of the Dickie lot included within the brush fence, without previous authority. In 1873 and 1874, several of the settlers transferred their claims to what they called the \"company lot\" to one Teakles who had a mill in the neighbourhood. In 1875 Jeremiah McManus began taking out logs upon the so-called \"company lot\" for Teakles, and in 1876 Teakles transferred his claims to McManus who continued thereafter, from time to time, until about 1896, to take logs from the land and cut them up at his mill, to the knowledge of the Calhouns and without any interference by them. McManus says that he took poles from the lot as late as 1900.\nIt was certainly open to the jury to find that the settlers and McManus had as much actual possession of the locus in quo from 1869 until the commencement of the action as the Calhouns or the plaintiff.\nThe main ground upon which, as I understand, the plaintiff relies is that John Dickie and Mariner Wood respectively, and then David Calhoun, and then his sons, and then the plaintiff himself, took actual possession of a portion of the whole lot now claimed by the plaintiff, including the locus in quo, under conveyances describing the property by metes and bounds, and continued one after the other in such actual use and occupation of, at least, parts thereof as the nature of the property admitted, and that this possession thus gained extended, by construction of law, to the bounds set by the conveyances, and was continuous.\nAs already intimated, the evidence of any continued actual occupation by Mariner Wood or John Dickie was of a very vague character. The principle of constructive possession of a tract of wild land, unenclosed and not separated from adjoining land of the same character, by entry upon and actual possession of a portion, under colour of title to the whole tract, has received its development chiefly in the United States, where, it seems to me, it has been carried, in many cases, to extreme lengths.\nTo some extent it has been accepted in the Courts of the Provinces of Canada. See Cunard v. Irvine[10]; Doe d. Baxter v. Baxter[11]; Ferrier v. Moodie[12]; Dundas v. Johnston[13]; Davis v. Henderson[14]; Mulholland v. Conklin[15]; Heyland v. Scott[16]; Harris v. Mudie[17].\nIn the American and English Encyclopaedia of Law, (2 ed.) vol. 1, p. 824, the principle is thus stated:\nAn entry into possession under a conveyance from a person having colour of title is presumed to be made according to the description in the deed, and his occupancy is construed as possession of the entire lot where there is no actual adverse possession of the parts not actually occupied by him.\nAt page 868, the following is said:\nTo entitle a claimant under colour of title to the benefit of the doctrine of constructive possession, there must be a bond fide reliance upon the merely apparent title as being good and valid. Therefore if the instrument constituting colour of title was obtained by fraud on the part of the grantee, or with a knowledge by him that it conveys no title, he cannot have the advantage of an entry under colour of title.\nAnd on page 869:\nThe question of what is good faith in a person claiming under colour of title in one of fact for the jury.\nIn the Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure, 1 Cyc. 1125, the principle is rather more widely stated:\nThe general rule is well settled that where a party enters, under colour of title, into the actual occupancy of a part of the premises described in the instrument giving colour, his possession is not considered as confined to that part of the premises in his actual occupancy, but he acquires possession of all the lands embraced in the instrument under which he claims. This is true although the land is not actually enclosed, and though the tract may be divided by a river running through it.\nAgain, page 1134:\nActual possession of a part of the land under colour of title will not draw to it constructive possession of the balance, unless such colour of title is also accompanied by claim of title co-extensive with the boundaries.\nIn Wright v. Mattison[18], Daniel J., delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States, said:\nThe courts have concurred, it is believed, without an exception, in defining \"colour of title\" to be that which in appearance is title, but which in reality is no title. They have equally concurred in attaching no exclusive or peculiar character or importance to the ground of the invalidity of an apparent or colourable title; the inquiry with them has been, whether there was an apparent or colourable title, under which an entry or a claim has been made in good faith.\nAgain he said, p. 59:\nDefects in the title may not be urged against it as destroying colour, but, at the same time, might have an important and legitimate influence in showing a want of confidence and good faith in the mind of the vendee, if they were known to him, and he believed the title, therefore, to be fraudulent and void. What is colour of title is matter of law, and when the facts exhibiting the title are shewn, the court will determine whether they amount to colour of title. But good faith in the party in claiming under such colour is purely a question of fact, to be found and settled as other facts in the cause.\nIn Dundas v. Johnston[19], Draper C.J. said, p. 550:\nWhen, therefore, a person without any title, or without any real or bond fide claim of title (though erroneous), entered upon any such lot, clearing and fencing only a portion thereof, I do not understand upon what principle this wrongdoer can be deemed to have taken and to be in possession of the whole of such lot.\nIn Davis v. Henderson[20], Wilson J. said, p. 352: I think, although the learned judge drew a marked distinction between the position and rights of a squatter as opposed to that of a person claiming a right which he believes and asserts he has, and upon which he enters and occupies, there was no misdirection, for he put the defendant's claim upon its proper basis.\nAnd Morrison J. said, (p. 358.)\nAfter the best consideration, in my judgment, if a person takes possession of a wild and partly cleared lot of land, consisting of one or two hundred acres, as the case may be, by virtue of a paper-title which he purchased and acquired from one whom he believed to be the rightful owner, and if for twenty years he occupies and deals with the cleared and uncleared portion of the lot in the same way that a rightful owner would deal with it (instancing various acts) such acts would be evidence to go to the jury that for such period the person so living on and so dealing with the land was in actual possession of the whole one hundred or two hundred acres.\nAnd then (p. 359), after a citation.\nThe latter part of the quotation goes far to qualify the preceding portion, and I think it shews that that learned judge would have held that, if the occupier of the cleared portion was bond fide in possession as the owner of the whole lot under a title invalid, but under which he went into possession and remained there, believing it to be good, it would be evidence to shew that he was claiming and was in actual possession of the whole.\nIn Shepherdson v. McCullogh[21], Armour J., after referring to the doctrine of presumption of possession of all the lands described in a conveyance derived from possession of part, said, p. 597:\nIt is not for me to say whether this principle is well founded or not, or whether it should have been or should be extended beyond the case of a person in actual pedal possession of land under a conveyance which he honestly believed, and was justified in believing, conveyed to him the true title to the land.\nAnd in Harris v. Mudie[22], Burton J., said p. 420:\nThe doctrine of constructive possession can obviously have no application to the case of a trespasser.\nAnd, p. 427:\u2014 But it has no doubt been treated as settled by a long current of authorities as the general rule that, when a party having colour of title enters in good faith upon the land professed to be conveyed, he is presumed to enter according to his title, and thereby gains a constructive possession of the whole land embraced in his deed.\nAnd again, p. 428.\nUnder a good deed his possession would be co-extensive with the boundaries given in the deed, and under one which proves for some reason to be defective, although as against the true owner he is a trespasser, his entry would give him a right to maintain trespass against any one making a subsequent entry without right. But how can that apply to a trespasser entering without colour of right? His possession, so as to maintain trespass, must be an actual possession. What pretence would there be for his maintaining trespass against a person who had entered and cut timber upon woodland beyond his enclosure?\nWhen a person so enters under a mere mistake as to his rights, purchasing or intending to purchase under what he believes to be a good title as from one whom he believes to be the heir-at-law or devisee under a will, or under a deed from a married woman defectively executed, or a forged deed, there is no good reason why his entry should not, as in the case of a valid deed, be co-extensive with the supposed title, and come within the class of cases intended, in my opinion, to be protected by the statute; but it must in every case be a bond fide claim, and ought not lightly to be extended to a purchaser from a squatter or other person having no title, where the party has neglected to ascertain from the registry office, as he can always do in this country, whether the land has been patented, and who is the registered owner; and clearly not to cases where he knows the grantor has no title.\nThe opinions which I have formed are that the person relying upon this doctrine must enter under a real, bond fide, belief of title; that, while in many cases it may be proper to assume this belief, yet circumstances may often warrant a jury, without direct evidence of want of such belief, in finding that the party knew or strongly suspected that he had acquired no real title; and that, in such cases, a jury is warranted in treating the party as in no better position than a mere trespasser, acquiring no possession of any land which he does not take into his actual and effective occupation.\nHere I cannot think that the jury were bound to treat Dickie and his associates, or Mariner Wood, as having colour of title, or as being in possession, actual or constructive, of any part of the land. I think, too, that the jury could not be said to have erred if they imputed to David Calhoun, when he entered upon the land, full knowledge of the unreallity of the title conferred by the conveyance to him and full consciousness that he was but continuing a wrongful appropriation, or if they refused to recognize that he acquired possession of any portion until he reduced it to actual occupation.\nThe jury were warranted in refusing to accept the view that Calhoun entered upon any part of the tract enclosed within the brush fence until after it had been erected. When he did assert any rights over it others were doing the same. Whether or not the facts warranted the belief that these others had acquired any better possession than himself does not seem to me important.\nAll it appears to be necessary to say is that, if the evidence satisfied the jury that Calhoun never effectively asserted his claim or acquired any actual, exclusive possession, they were not bound by any rule of law to find a technical possession in him, and the case for a presumption of fact in favour of such a possession was not so overwhelmingly strong that the verdict should be disturbed.\nAnd it appears to me that the jury were not bound to treat the younger Calhoun or the plaintiff as occupying any better position. Of course, as years went on, as transfers were repeated and the land actually occupied and used, the claim of right would grow apparently stronger. It would be difficult, if there were no adverse claim actively asserted, to impute absence of good faith or of colour of title to the younger Calhouns, and still more difficult to impute such to a mere mortgagee, as this plaintiff originally was. But adverse claims to possession and the title were being actively asserted during the whole period from 1869 to 1900. Under such circumstances I do not think that the jury should be held to have been bound, whether as a matter of law or of fact, to find that any of the Calhouns or the present plaintiff acquired a possession of the locus in quo which entitled any of them to say that, while we had no title to the land, we had a possession which entitled us to maintain an action such as the present against those claiming adversely but shewing no better title than our own.\nUpon a view of the whole case, I think that it cannot be said that there was no reasonable hypothesis upon which the findings of the jury against any possession on the part of the plaintiff, necessary to maintain the action, could be properly based. It seems to me, therefore, that the verdict cannot properly be disturbed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: M. G. Teed.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Henry R.

By the said Act, the Corporation of the City of London was empowered, by and through the agency of the Water Commissioners for the City of London, and their successors, to design, construct, build, purchase, improve, hold, and generally maintain, manage and construct waterworks, and all buildings, matters, machinery and appliances therewith connected or necessary thereto, in the City of London, and parts adjacent, as thereinafter provided.\nThe said commissioners, and their successors, were declared to be a body corporate, under the name of \u201cThe Water Commissioners for the City of London,\u201d and to have all the powers necessary to enable them to build the waterworks thereinafter mentioned, and to carry out all and every the other powers conferred upon them by the said Act.\nIt was, by the said Act, declared to be lawful for the said commissioners, their agents, servants and workmen, from time to time, and at such times after the passing of the said Act as they should see fit, and they were thereby authorized and empowered, to enter into and upon the lands of any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, in the City of London, or within fifteen miles of the said city, and to survey, set out, and ascertain such parts thereof as they might require for the purposes of the said waterworks; and also to divert and appropriate any river, pond of water, spring or stream of water therein as they should judge suitable and proper, and to contract with the owner or occupier of the said lands and those having a right in the said water, for the purchase thereof, or of any part thereof, or of any privilege that night be required for the purposes of the said Water Commissioners; and in case of any disagreement between the said commissioners and the owners or occupiers of such lands, or any person having an interest in the said water, or the natural flow thereof, or of any such privileges as aforesaid, respecting the amount of purchase or value thereof, or as to the damages such appropriations should cause to them, or otherwise, the same should be decided by three arbitrators, to be appointed as thereinafter mentioned, namely, the commissioners should appoint one, the owner or owners should appoint another and such two arbitrators should within ten days after their appointment, appoint a third arbitrator; but in the event of such two arbitrators not appointing a third arbitrator within the time aforesaid, the judge of the county court of the County of Middlesex should, on application by either party, appoint such third arbitrator; in case any such owner or occupier should be an infant, married woman, or insane, or absent from this province, or should refuse to appoint an arbitrator on his behalf, or in case such land or water privileges might be mortgaged or pledged to any person or persons, the judge of the county court of the County of Middlesex, on application being made to him for that purpose by the commissioners, should nominate and appoint three in different persons as arbitrators; the arbitrators to be appointed, as hereinbefore mentioned, should award, determine, adjudge and order the respective sums of money which the said commissioners should pay to the respective persons entitled to receive the same, and the award of the majority of the said arbitrators in writing should be final; and said arbitrators should be, and they were thereby, required to attend at some convenient place at or in the vicinity of the said city to be appointed by the said commissioners, after eight days\u2019 notice given for that purpose by the said commissioners, there and then to arbitrate and award, adjudge and determine such matters and things as should be submitted to their consideration by the parties interested and also the costs attending said reference and award; and each arbitrator should be sworn before some one of Her Majesty\u2019s Justices of the Peace in and for the said County of Middlesex, or alderman of the said City, well and truly to assess the value or damages between the parties to the best of his judgment; and, the Justice of the Peace or alderman before whom the said arbitrators, or any of them, should be sworn, should give either of the parties requiring the same, a certificate to that effect: provided always, that any award under this Act should be subject to be set aside on application to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench or Common Pleas, in the same manner and on the same grounds as in ordinary cases of arbitration in which case a reference might be again made to arbitration, as thereinbefore provided, and that any sum so awarded should be paid within three calendar months from the date of the award, or determination of any motion to annul the same, and in default of such payment the proprietor might resume possession of his property, and all his right should thereupon revive, and the award of the said arbitrators should be binding on all parties concerned, subject as aforesaid.\nThe 17th Section of the said Act provides that the Commissioners and their officers shall have the like protection in the exercise of their respective offices and the execution of their duties, as Justices of the Peace now have under the laws of this Province.\nThe 31st section of the said Act provides that if any action or suit be brought against any person or persons for anything done in pursuance of the said Act, the same shall be brought within six calendar months next after the act committed, or in case there shall be a continuation of damages then within one year after the original cause of such action arising.\nThe appellants, the Water Commissioners for the City of London, erected a dam across the River Thames at a point about four miles below the City of London, and about four miles below the mill of the respondent. The dam was built to pen back, appropriate and ob- struct the flow of the said river for the purpose of carrying out the duties of the Water Commissioners and as a part of their system for supplying water to be used by the inhabitants of the said City, as authorized by \u201cThe London Waterworks Act, 1873,\u201d and the \u201cThe London Waterworks Amendment Act, 1878,\u201d passed by the Legislature of Ontario in the 41st year of Her late Majesty\u2019s Reign, chapter 27. This dam was completed in the early part of the year 1879, and has ever since been maintained and used by the appelants, the Water Commissioners for the City of London, for the uses and purposes aforesaid.\nOne Burleigh Hunt, was, by an Act of the said Legislature authorized to erect and maintain a dam across the said River, at a point about half a mile below the said dam of the appellants, The Water Commissioners for the City of London, and over forty years ago a dam was there erected by him under authority of the said Act, and the same has ever since been maintained by him, and his successors in title.\nAt the time of, and at least six years before, the erecby the appellants of their said dam, there was erected and placed across the said River, at a distance of about two and three-eighths miles from what is known as \u201cThe Forks,\u201d at the junction of the two branches of the River Thames, and a point a short distance up stream from the appelants\u2019 said dam, another dam known as \u201cGriffith\u2019s dam,\u201d which was of a height equal to the said dam erected by the appellants, and the said Griffith\u2019s dam was, at the time of the erection of the dam now complained of, acquired by the said appellants.\nThe respondent alleged that he had been damaged by back water at his mill caused by the damming of the River by the said dam and claimed to recover such damages, and to restrain the appellants, by injunc- tion, from continuing to dam back such water to his injury.\nThe Commissioners now appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal by which the injunction granted at the trial and the reference as to damages were maintained.\nAylesworth K.C. and Meredith K.C. for the appellants.\nHellmuth K.C. and Ivey for the respondents.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting).\u2014The above defendant corporation were, by 36 Vict. c. 102, created a body corporate for the purpose of erecting and maintaining waterworks to supply the city with water. Section 5 of the Act is as follows:\n5. It shall and may be lawful for the said commissioners, their agents, servants and workmen, from time to time, and at such times hereinafter as they shall see fit, and as they are hereby authorized and empowered, to enter into and upon the lands of any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, in the City of London, or within fifteen miles of the said city, and to survey, set out and ascertain such parts thereof as they may require for the purposes of the said waterworks; and also to divert and appropriate any river, pond of water, spring or stream of water therein as they shall judge suitable and proper, and to contract with the owner or occupier of the said lands, and those having a right in the said water for the purchase thereof, or of any part thereof, or of any privilege that may be required for the purposes of the said Water Commissioners; and in case of any disagreement between the said commissioners and the owners or occupiers of such lands, or any person having an interest in the said water, or the natural flow thereof, or of any such privilege as aforesaid, respecting the amount of purchase or value thereof, or as to the damages such appropriation shall cause them, or otherwise, the same shall be decided by three arbitrators, etc., etc.\nThe rights of the parties depend to a large extent upon the proper interpretation that is to be given to the powers of expropriation in that section contained. The injury complained of was an obstruction to the plaintiff\u2019s mill and the overflow of his land by reason of the penning back of the water of the River Thames thereon, such penning back having been occasioned by a dam built by the appellants across the River Thames, some miles below the respondent\u2019s property. That there was an obstruction to the respondent\u2019s property, and more or less substantial injury occasioned thereby was, upon sufficient evidence, found by the trial judge, which finding was confirmed by the Court of Appeal, and should not now, in my opinion, be disturbed.\nThe dam referred to was not built for the purpose of obtaining a supply of water for the use of the citizens of London, but only for the purpose of creating a water power with which to drive certain machinery necessary for the distribution of water obtained from springs and streams other than the Thames River in the vicinity of the city. The powers of expropriation set out in section 5 are as follows;\u2014\nThe commissioners are empowered\nto enter into and upon the lands of any person * * * and to survey, set out and ascertain such parts thereof as they may require for the purposes of the said waterworks, and also to divert and apppropriate any river, pond of water, spring or stream of water therein as they shall judge suitable and proper, and to contract with the owner or occupier of said lands and those having a right in the said water for the purchase thereof or of any part thereof, or of any privilege that may be required for the purposes of said water commissioners.\nThe only verbs in this quotation which can possibly refer to the case before us are \u201center\u201d and \u201cappropriate,\u201d and the contention of the appellants is, and always has been, that although they did not either intentionally or otherwise pen back the waters of the river upon the respondent\u2019s land, yet if, as a matter of fact, they had done so, then that was an \u201cappro- priation\u201d by them under the statute, and that therefore the remedy was not by action but by means of the arbitration provided for in the section. I am strongly of the opinion that this occasional and intermittent injury not intended or contemplated by the commissioners when they erected the dam in question, cannot in any sense be considered as an appropriation of the property injured or of any water privilege which the respondent had. The act of appropriation, it seems to me, must be something done fn pursuance of a plan formed by the authority appropriating. There must be a mental process resulting in a determination to do a positive act. There must be an exercise of volition and that volition completed by an act of appropriation. In other words, one cannot appropriate a thing involuntarily. Then the word \u201cappropriate\u201d involves in it the idea of the taking away from one his property or his right in property so that he thereafter ceases to have it, and the person so appropriating succeeds him in the exclusive enjoyment of that particular property or right. Expropriating statutes the world over generally make provision for two things, first, the taking of property, and secondly, the injurious affection of property.\nIn the present case this ordinary and necessary principle has been most signally departed from. There is no provision authorising the injurious affection of land, a thing which is absolutely necessary in order to make that injurious affection other than tortious, nor is there any provision authorising compensation to be paid to persons whose lands are not appropriated but only injuriously affected.\nAnother consideration in this connection appears to me to have great force. The section being considered authorises the commissioners to appropriate any river, spring or stream of water and to contract with the owner or occupier for the purchase thereof of any part thereof or any privilege that may be required. The contention has been made that the overflowing of the respondent\u2019s land and the obstruction to his mill were an appropriation of what is called a water privilege, and a water privilege was stated at the argument to be land covered by flowing water which was physically suitable for the generation, conservation and distribution of motive power. Now, in what sense have the Commissioners in any way appropriated the respondent\u2019s water privilege or any part of his water privilege? Appropriation, as I have suggested, means the taking of dominion over, or the conversion to one\u2019s own use of the property of another. Have these Commissioners appropriated to their own use, that is to their exclusive use, and become the sole users and possessors of the respondent\u2019s water privilege or any part of it? The very question answers itself. This water privilege has never been appropriated nor taken, it has only been obstructed and interfered with. It was exclusively possessed and used by the respondent. The interference with his privilege was not an assumption of ownership, but simply a trespass. For my part, I do not see how the appellants could do what is complained of here without appropriating to themselves the whole of the water privilege or a definite portion of the area over which the water flows. They cannot make themselves co-users with the owners of any privilege or right which they may think it necessary to acquire.\nBut however this may be, there is, I think, another conclusive reason why this section does not cover a case like the present. If it had been part of the scheme of the commissioners at the inception of their undertaking to use the water of the Thames for culinary and other purposes for which water is usually supplied to cities, then they might have had power under the general words of the section to first appropriate from the riparian proprietors the stream itself. They had power to take water wherever it might be found within a radius of 15 miles from the city, and to distribute that water as provided for in the Act, but it seems to me that they had no power to dam the river Thames for the mere collateral purpose of obtaining motive power that motive power being, without difficulty, obtainable by means of steam. The Legislature, it seems to me, never contemplated the giving of such authority to the appellants. If they require machinery or power for the purpose of conducting their works and distributing water when collected through pipes throughout the city, they must buy that power in the same way as the rest of His Majesty\u2019s subjects.\nThe case of Simpson v. South Staffordshire Waterworks Co.[1] is interesting in this connection. There the Lord Chancellor (Lord Westbury) held that a waterworks company authorized to take a field or part thereof for the purpose of making a tunnel, were restrained from taking part of the field for the purpose of making a well and erecting pumping machinery thereon.\nSee also Bentinck v. Norfolk Estuary Co.[2] and Galloway v. Mayor of London[3].\nA persual of the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the North Shore Ry. Co. v. Pion[4] is most helpful in the consideration of the present case. The questions involved there are substantially the same as here. The Act in this case was apparently somewhat modelled after the Railway Act which was in question in that case, and the prin- ciples there asserted by Lord Selborne are to my mind conclusive here and justify the judgments of the courts below. It is true that in that case damages were allowed to be given as for a permanent injury to the plaintiff\u2019s land, but the judgment suggests that had the plaintiff, instead of asking for damages based upon the principle, asked for a demolition of the company\u2019s works, or an injunction restraining the railway company from interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s access and egress to the river, that also would have been a proper remedy.\nAs to the contention that notice of action was required pursuant to sec. 17 of the appellant\u2019s charter, and to ch. 88 sec. 14 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, it is sufficient to refer to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Mr. Justice Maclaren upon that point, in which he cites authorities to shew that the statutory notice is not necessary where an injunction is sought, although damages at the same time be claimed.\nThe judgment below orders the taking of an account of the damages suffered by the respondent for six years before the commencement of the action. It is not at all clear that this judgment is not right but counsel for the respondent at the argument expressed willingness that the account should be taken for those damages suffered within the six calendar months next previous to the action as the action had been brought not so much for the purpose of obtaining compensation for the injuries complained of as to prevent the usurpation of the appellants from ripening into a prescriptive right.\nWith this variation of the judgment, I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. DAVIES.\u2014I agree substantially with the judgment of my brother Nesbitt. At the close of Mr. Hellmuth\u2019s able argument, however, I felt grave doubts whether the statutory powers given to the Water Commissioners were couched in language sufficiently broad to enable them to divert and appropriate the rivers and waters within the prescribed district by damming them up and back and thus to generate power with which to force these and other waters through their mains to and through the City of London. Was the work complained of done for the purpose of carrying out, and as part of, the system of supplying water for the use of the citizens?\nI think it was, and that the Water Commissioners were, therefore, acting within their powers. It is not contended that if the waters so penned back were utilized as part of the supply provided for the city, the dam and works of the Commissioners would be beyond their statutory powers. Nor is it, as I understand, contended that they could not use the waters partly to generate power to enable them to supply the city provided the waters so supplied were part of the same waters as those penned back. What was argued was that these waters have been penned back by the dam and flash boards for the sole purpose of generating power to supply other waters than those penned back to the city.\nIt is true that, so far, other waters have been distributed to the citizens by means of the power generated at this dam. But these very waters of the Thames may be so distributed any day and by means of the power which the penning back of the Thames by the dam enables the Commissioners to generate.\nThe appropriation of the waters in advance of the time when they may reasonably be expected to be required would only be an act of prudence. I think it would be an altogether too strict a construction to put upon the Act to say that it permits the Commissioners to divert and appropriate streams and rivers and waters within a prescribed area for the maintenance, management and conduct of waterworks in the City of London only and while they use the waters so diverted and appropriated exclusively for distribution in the city or among its inhabitants, but that the whole scheme would become illegal if any part of the waters were utilized in generating power to distribute the waters of the same stream or river or any other stream or river through the city. But the argument against the exercise of the powers must go that for.\nI fully agree with what was said, that where compulsory powers are given to a corporation of this kind, they cannot be invoked to cover merely indirect or incidental or collateral purposes. Their use can only be justified when shewn to be substantially and wholly for the purposes and objects for which the Act was expressly and obviously passed. Such powers cannot be invoked to support or defend other or different objects or purposes than those contemplated by the Act.\nI think it can fairly and reasonably be said that the Water Commissioners in this case are not abusing their powers in using them as they have done here for the sole purpose of carrying out the object for which they were constituted, namely, the distribution of water in and through the city and in generating the power necessary to enable them to effect that object. The Water Commissioners are not a corporation established for private gain but one constituted for a necessary public purpose, and their charter should receive such reasonable and proper construction as is essential to the carrying out of the plain purposes of the Act. Once that difficulty is surmounted, I can have no serious doubts as the extent of the powers conferred on the Commissioners. I need not repeat the words of the fifth section. They seem to me to be broad enough and clear enough not only to enable the Commissioners to purchase or expropriate any lands within the prescribed area \u201crequired for the purposes of the waterworks,\u201d but also and further so to divert and appropriate any waters being in or upon or flowing through the lands so expropriated or taken as they may judge reasonable and proper. They were not to use these waters simply and only as an owner of lands could use the waters flowing through them. In such case no special legislation would be required. But they were authorised to divert or use them in any way and to any extent they might think reasonable and proper. Of course, proper precautions were taken that in any user by them of waters beyond the user which the law allows a riparian proprietor, they should pay injured parties all consequent damages.\nIt has been argued that a strict construction must be placed upon the words \u201cdivert and appropriate.\u201d I know no special reason why this should be done or why the ordinary and reasonable construction necessary to give them their proper and effective meaning in the relation in which they are used should not be given to them. I think the damming back and setting apart of the waters for a particular use and purpose having direct bearing upon the purposes of the corporation is such an appropriation.\nAs to the argument that there were certain conditions precedent to the exercise of the compulsory powers given by the Act, I am unable to agree with it.\nThe cases cited of Jones v. The Stanstead, Shefford and Chambly Railroad Company[5]; The North Shore Rail- way Co, v. Pion[6]; and Corporation of Parkale v. West[7], are controlling authorities as to how these compulsory powers or statutes should be construed. In the two latter cases it was held that, under the statutes there in question, the filing of the plans and the taking of the prescribed means of ascertaining and paying the damages were as much conditions precedent to the exercise of the powers authorising the \u201cinjurious affection of lands\u201d as to the taking of lands themselves. But it is perfectly plain from the reasons given for their judgment by the judicial committee, if indeed authority was needed for the proposition, that such conclusion depended entirely upon the language of the statutes before them in those two cases, and that cases may occur where damages may arise from the execution of authorized works, which damages could not be foreseen and, ex necessitate, could not be paid before the execution of the works. The probability of such cases occurring seems to me so certain that the legislature may well be taken to have had it in mind when legislating in this case.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Pion\u2019s Case[8], the Earl of Selbourne said, at page 626:\nIn both cases alike, (that is Pion\u2019s Case8, then under consideration, and West\u2019s Case[9], the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s property was a necessary, patent and obvious consequence of the execution of the work.\nNow, the statute before us does not make any specific act, such as filing of plans or ascertainment and payment of damages or any thing else beyond \u201cthe survey, setting out and ascertaining of the lands required\u201d a condition precedent to the exercise of the compulsory powers. It was plain that the damages which the exercise of the compulsory powers might cause must, in many cases, while a consequence of the execution of the works, be \u201cneither a patent nor an obvious consequence of such execution,\u201d and be only capable of being ascertained after the execution of the works. They are such damages as were in the mind of the Judicial Committee when they said in Pion\u2019s Case,8 at page 627.\nIt may well be that the statute gives the right of compensation for damages of a different kind which, at the time when the company had to give its notices and take the other necessary steps to enable it to execute its works, could not be foreseen, a different rule must be applicable, by necessary implication from the provisions, on the one hand, entitling the land owner to compensation, and authorising, on the other hand, the construction of the works.\nNo one can read the evidence in this case without being satisfied that, if the plaintiff has sustained damages, as the trial judge has found, they were damages which were certainly neither patent nor obvious at the time of the construction of the appellants\u2019 works, but which (assuming their existence) happened subsequently to the building of the works in question and as an unforeseen consequence of those works.\nThe duties of the several parties committing and sustaining the injuries were to take the statutory steps to have the damages assessed. The works constructed by the defendants, being legal works under the statutory powers, cannot be interfered with by injunction.\nNor, on the other hand, do I think that the plaintiff has lost his right to have his damages assessed. The right to maintain the works, on the one hand, and the right to have the damages caused by those works assessed, on the other, co-exist. Such damages are capable of being estimated once for all and should be so estimated and adjudged.\nI agree with the finding of the trial judge, confirmed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the defendants have not gained any right by prescription to dam back the waters of the river upon the plaintiff, as claimed by them. To gain such right there must be shown to have been a continuous exercise of the acts relied on through some definite portions of each and every year for a consecutive period of twenty years. I fully agree that no such evidence has been given.\nHolding as I do that the appellants\u2019 works in the River Thames were constructed under and by virtue of their statutory powers and that any injuries or damages caused to the plaintiff thereby were legalised injuries, the damages for which he had a right to have assessed under the fifth section of the Act, I am clearly of the opinion that neither the seventeeth nor the thirty-first sections of the statute apply. It is quite clear to my mind that the latter section, limiting the time within which an action may be brought against the commissioners for things done by them in pursuance of the Act, can have no relation to proceedings taken by them expropriating lands or water privileges under the fifth section. In this I also agree with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. But I see no reason whatever why any damages suffered by the plaintiff should not now and once for all be assessed by arbitrators to be appointed under the fifth section of the Act and, if we had the power in this action to grant a mandamus for the appointment of such arbitrators, I would certainly do so. As however, we cannot do this, we must leave the parties to their rights under the setion referred to and no doubt proper steps will, at once, be taken to have the damages assessed.\nNESBITT J.\u2014This case turns upon the construction which is to be placed upon the Act for the construction of waterworks for the City of London. The first section empowers the Water Commissioners to construct, build, purchase, improve, hold, and generally maintain, manage and conduct waterworks. The fourth section gives power to employ engineers and others, and to rent or purchase such lands, buildings, waters and privileges as in their opinion may be necessary to enable them to fulfil their duties under this Act. The fifth section authorises the Commissioners to enter into and upon the lands of any person in the City of London, or within fifteen miles of the said city, and to survey, set out and ascertain such parts thereof as they may require for the purposes of the said waterworks, and also to divert and appropriate any river, pond of water, spring or stream of water therein, as they shall judge suitable and proper, and to contract with the owner or occupier of said lands and those having rights in the said water for the purchase thereof, or any part thereof, or of any privilege that may be required for the purposes of the said waterworks. In case of any disagreement between the said Commissioners and the owners or occupiers of said lands, or any person having an interest in the said water or the natural flow thereof, or any such privilege as aforesaid respecting the amount of purchase or value thereof, or as to damages such appropriations shall cause to them or otherwise, the same shall be decided by three arbitrators.\nWhat substantially was done was, the Commissioners, having purchased the land on either side of the river, about five miles below the city, erected a dam with stanchions for flashboards, which flashboards were inserted at certain seasons in order to raise the water in the dam.\nThe plaintiff, who was the owner of the mill privilege, some five miles above the dam, in the river, complains that the placing of the flashboards in position at times injures him in backing water in his raceway. The courts have held, and I believe some of my learned brethren are very strongly of the opinion, that what has been done is not within section five of the Waterworks Act; that that Act simply enabled the Commissioners to enter upon any land within the city, or fifteen miles thereof, and to divert or appropriate water within the area of the lands entered upon, which lands must be paid for either by agreement or under arbitration proceedings, and that this is made plain by section six which provides that the lands, privileges and water, which shall be ascertained, set out or appropriated by the Commissioners, for the purposes thereof, as aforesaid, shall thereupon and forever thereafter be vested in the Corporation of the City of London and their successors, and as the mill privilege of the plaintiff was never ascertained, set out or appropriated, that the defendants are simply wrongdoers and trespassers upon his legal right to the natural flow of the water. If this construction of the section is correct I think that the judgment cannot be disturbed for any of the reasons urged. I do not think the Commissioners can be protected under the 17th section of the Act nor do I think that the thirty-first section would limit the damages to the period of six months; and I think that it is a case that, notwithstanding the remedy by injunction may seem a very drastic one, yet the plaintiff would be entitled under the authorities to such remedy, nor do I think the defendants can ask the court to define by its judgment to what point the water may be raised, as they must be at the risk, if they are wrongdoers, in anything they do which may prejudice the plaintiff.\nIn my view, however, the fifth section does apply I think the word \u201cappropriate\u201d is used in the sense of \u201csetting aside for the purposes of,\u201d and the Commissioners, if they are so advised by their engineers, would be entitled to appropriate the waters of the river by the erection of a dam and the setting aside of a large pond or reservoir for waterworks purposes, and I do not think that the water need necessarily be taken from such pond for the purposes of distribution in the city either for drinking, fire, manufacturing or street purposes, but that as part of the design of a waterworks system the Commissioners would be entitled to say, we deem it the best system to appropriate the waters, in the way I have described, in order to create power for the utilization of other waters, as power is as necessary to a waterworks system as a supply of water or pipes to carry it in, and if the design of the Commissioners involves the notion of an appropriation of the water of the river by setting it aside in the mill-pond or reservoir, and if the necessary result of creating that mill-pond is to back the water, then, any person injured in the natural flow or in any privilege affected by the backing, is damaged by such appropriation and entitled to compel the Commissioners to pay damages under section five for such appropriation so causing damage.\nOtherwise I do not think effect can be given to the language of section five which plainly contemplates purchase money for such property acquired and damages caused to other property by such acquisitions and subsequent user.\nIt is to be observed that the disagreement may arise in reference to the amount of purchase or value which is the case where appropriation has taken place, or it may arise as to the amount of damage such appropriation shall cause, and I do not think that can be read as only applicable to the actual appropriation which the commissioners may have attempted to set out or ascertain. Such a construction would be a strained one as it must necessarily have occurred to the framers of the Act that in case the commissioners went on, say, above the plaintiffs mill privilege, and appropriated the water of the river, which they would be entitled to do, that the only person to be paid would be the person upon whose land the commissioners entered to so divert or appropriate. That diversion or appropriation would be lawful. The person upon whose land they entered would be a person who would be paid but, under the construction of the Act I have referred to, the plaintiff who would be a person entitled to the natural flow and entitled to a mill privilege would have no remedy.\nThe commissioners could answer him, \u201cwhat we have done is a lawful act. There is no provision in the Act for injurious affection of property and we are not liable to you.\u201d This would seem a most curious result and one most unlikely to be contemplated by the framers of the Act. Of course it is settled law that the legislature could give the right of appropriation without payment of compensation either for taking or injurious affection, but where a construction can possibly be placed upon an Act to avoid such consequence it should be done.\nIt seems plain to me that in the illustration I have given the plaintiff could immediately have compelled, by mandamus, an arbitration, as being a person interested in the natural flow of the water, or in a privilege, and as being damnified by the appropriation of the water of the river made by the commissioners. If it is true that the appropriation could lawfully take place above the plaintiff, how can any different construction be supposed because the appropriation took place below, the necessary consequence of which is the damming back of the water on the plaintiff and the interference therefore with the natural flow and the partial destruction of his privilege. In such case it seems to me reasonably clear that he was a person entitled to compel arbitration and that his remedy was under the Act.\nA clear distinction must be drawn between a case like the present where, if my construction is correct, the act which is complained of was itself lawful, but the result of the act not obviously causing damage, and a case where certain conditions precedent are necessary upon the part of the person authorized before entry can be made upon the land of the person complaining, that is cases where it is obvious laud must be taken or injury done.\nThis is a case where, it is true, there has been an appropriation of the plaintiff\u2019s mill privilege, an appropriation of his rights to the natural flow of the water, but that appropriation has taken place as a necessary result of a lawful appropriation further down the stream and is more in the nature of an injurious affection than of an actual appropriation by the commissioners, but in whichever way it is viewed it seems to be within the Act.\nIf a railway company is authorized to construct a railway and to enter upon lands, first filing plans, etc., then, as shewn by such cases as West v. The Village of Parkdale,[10] and Pion v. North Shore Railway Co.[11] such filing of plans, etc., is a necessary condition precedent, and otherwise the act is unlawful and plaintiff can claim demolition of the works, or may have his damages assessed once for all as for permanent works, and so in this case if what has been done were treated as an original appropriation of the right of the plaintiff to the natural flow of the river, there would be great force in the argument that there had been non-compliance with the conditions precedent under the Act, namely, the entry upon the land and the surveying, setting out and ascertaining the parts required for the purposes of the waterworks, and that as such had not been done the plaintiff could at any time within the period of the Statute of Limitations treat the works so appropriating his privilege or right to the natural flow of the water as a trespass and require its demolition.\nAs I have pointed out this, however, while in a sense an appropriation, is rather a necessary result flowing from a lawful appropriation further down the river, and the plaintiff is a person damaged by such appropriation and a person who did not seek the remedy under the Act.\nKILLAM J. (dissenting).\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be dismissed. It appears to me that the statutes did not authorise the commissioners to do what they have done. They were empowered to divert and appropriate rivers and streams. Leaving entirely aside the question of the right of the commissioners to use their special statutory powers for the purpose of procuring the power to operate their works, as distinguished from the acquisition of the water to be supplied, it seems to me that they were not authorised to pen up, or keep or store, the water acquired for any purpose in such a manner as to injure others. They were further given power to acquire, either by purchase under contract or by compulsory method, lands or water privileges. They have not acquired or sought or attempted to acquire the plaintiff\u2019s lands or water privileges. They have merely committed occasional acts causing him injury, and they threaten and intend, unless prohited by judicial authority, to continue the commission of such acts.\nUpon the remaining points I agree with the conclusions of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.*\nSolicitor for the appellants: Thomas G.

In proceedings by the Crown for forfeiture the evidence was conflicting as to the position of both vessels at the time of seizure and the local Judge in Admiralty held that the evidence did not establish that the vessel seized was in Canadian waters at the time. On appeal by the Crown:\nHeld, Taschereau C.J., dissenting, that, as the \"Petrel\" was furnished with the most reliable log known to mariners for registering distances and her compass had been carefully tested and corrected for deviation on the morning of the seizure; as the \"Kitty D.\" and the two tugs in her vicinity at the time whose captains gave evidence to shew that she was on the American side carried no log nor chart and kept no log-book; and as the local judge had misapprehended the facts as to the course sailed by the \"Petrel,\" the evidence of the officers of the \"Petrel\" must be accepted and it established that the \"Kitty D.\" had been fishing in Canadian waters and her seizure was lawful.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the local judge in Admiralty, Toronto division, in favour of the owners of the respondent vessel.\nThe \"Kitty D.\" was seized on Lake Erie by the Government cruiser \"Petrel\" for fishing north of the boundary line and an action was brought by the Crown in the Court of Admiralty to have her declared forfeited. The action was tried before Judge Hodgins' local judge in Admiralty for the Toronto district, who decided that the Crown had not proved that the vessel was on the Canadian side at the time of the seizure and he ordered that she be delivered up to the owners.\nThe following are the reasons given by the local judge tor his judgment:\n\"The question in this case is whether a seizure of the United States fishing boat, \"Kitty D.\" by the Dominion Cruiser \"Petrel\" on the 3rd July last for alleged fishing was made in Canadian waters, north of the international boundary line.\n\"Captain Dunn of the cruiser stated that he left Port Dover on that morning at 6.30 o'clock and directed his officers to take the course to clear Long Point by S. E. by S. \u00bc S., which was the usual course in calm weather, but owing to the variation of the compass the true course would be represented by E. by N. 7-8 N. That he set the log when they were immediately abreast of the Long Point light-house, from which he was approximately about five eighths of a mile; that after registering five knots he turned the \"Petrel\" on her course down the lake and ran down the boundary line E. by N. \u00bd N., and that shortly before noon the second officer came and told him there were two tugs, one of which was nearly directly ahead, a little to the port, and the other away to the north of the boat; that he turned to the one on the north which was about two miles off and made a crescent towards the northwest for about ten minutes and then south-west and signalled her to slack speed, and so overtook and seized her. The distance of these different crescent courses was not stated.\n\"The other witnesses for the Crown were, first officer Inkster, who stated that the \"Petrel\" left Port Dover at 6.30 o'clock that morning; that the usual course in calm weather was S. E. by S. \u00bcS.; that he was on the bridge until 8 o'clock, when she was steering E. by S. \u00bc S. from Port Dover, and that they passed Long Point about eight-thirty at the distance of about half a mile.\n\"Second officer McPherson corroborated the first officer as to the course of the \"Petrel\" on the 3rd July, except as to the steering E. by S. \u00bc S.\u2014he making it S. E. by S. \u00bc S. He also said that he could not tell whether they were south or north of the International boundary line; and he estimated that they were about one-half mile from Long Point when the log was set, which, he says, is the usual distance, though it might vary several hundred yards.\n\"The seamen who steered the \"Petrel\" on that day were also examined. Slade said that when he took the wheel the vessel was steering S. E. by S. \u00bc S, thus confirming second officer McPherson, but when asked the nature of the turn from S. E. by S. \u00bc S., he gives the course E. by N. \u00bd N. He admitted that he had only been a mariner for one season, and had not much experience in steering, and that he was not known in marine circles as a 'wheelsman,\" and that this was the first time he had steered from abreast of Long Point out to the boundary line.\n\"Campbell said that when he took the wheel at 10 o'clock the \"Petrel\" was steering E. by N. \u00bd N. and that he continued her on that course; that he had never steered a boat until this summer. Neither of these sailors knew anything about a compass prior to their going on the \"Petrel\" last April.\n\"Captain Spain gave evidence that he came to Port Colborne on the 8th July and hired the \"Golden City\" and steered out into the lake to see if he could find the nets of the \"Kitty D.\" which were reported to have been left in the lake, and that he was accompanied by Captain Jones of the \"Kitty D.\" and Mr. Dechert, one of the owners. He suggested that Capt. Jones should take the wheel, but the captain of the \"Golden City\" did not give it to him. Jones then offered that if he were taken across to Dunkirk and could start from there, as he knew that course, he could find the \"Kitty D's\" nets, and he described to Captain Spain the kind of buoy attached to the nets of the \"Kitty D.\" Jones' offer was, however, declined and the \"Golden City\" returned, after failing to find the place where the \" Kitty D's\" nets had been set. Captain Spain further stated that the \" Petrel\" left Port Colborne on the following morning at 6 o'clock, and that he instructed Captain Dunn to go to Long Point and take the course he had reported to him he had taken on the 3rd July, S. E. by S. J S. for five miles out; that after steaming out for about five miles from Long Point he said they got to about a mile and three-quarters north of the boundary line, and owing to not having allowed for the over-registering of the log the \" Petrel \" was a little further out than that. He also estimated from Captain Dunn's report that the place of seizure was nine and three-quarter knots from Lapp Point on the Canadian shore; and he showed that the British chart made Lapp Point ten and one-half miles from the boundary line, though the real boundary line there is 11\u00bd miles. According to his estimate the \"Kitty D.\" was f- of a mile north of the Canadian side of the boundary line, to which he would add, on the statement of Captain Jones, that the place of the \"Kitty D's\" nets was \"five minutes north,\" a further \u00be of a mile\u2014making in all 1\u00bd miles north on the Canadian side. But he admitted that he could only give the distances approximately.\nThe only witnesses for the Crown who gave evidence of the locality of the seizure were Captain Dunn and Captain Spain, the latter only estimating the locality of the seizure by the report made to him by Captain Dunn.\n\"The following may be taken as a fairly condensed summary of the defendants' evidence as to the seizure of the \"Kitty D.\" on the 3rd July: \u2014\n\"Jones, her captain, said that he started from Dunkirk about five o'clock that morning, and steamed out for about an hour and five minutes N. by W. \u00bd W. to where he had set his nets east by south on the 2nd July; that the buoy of his nets was about 9\u00be miles from Dunkirk, and that his ship was seized by the \"Petrel\" at that distance from the United States shore. He also steamed out on the \"Desmond\" on the 7th on the same course, 9\u00be miles, and found his nets and that one of the corks was then taken off with the owners' mark, \"R. & D.\" on it, and that all the nets remained out until the 26th July, when they were taken up except one, which he left, and he asserts that he was fishing at the time of seizure on the United States side of the boundary line, and so stated to the captain of the \"Petrel.\"\n\"Dewitt, one of the hands on board the \"Kitty D.\" said they left Dunkirk about five or half past or six o'clock, and steamed out into the lake for somewheres in the neighbourhood of an hour. He also said that about the end of July he saw the \"Kitty D.\" buoy and fished around it.\n\"Helwig, the captain of the tug \"Lucy,\" said that on the 3rd July he was out from Dunkirk about nine or ten miles lifting his nets; that he was a little to the north of the \"Kitty D.\" with his outer net; that he saw the \"Petrel\" go to the westward and seize the \"Kitty D.\"; that on the 4th July he found that the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets, which had been set on the 3rd had crossed his, which he had previously set on the 2nd July north and south; that his most northerly nets were a mile to the north of the \"Kitty D's\"; and he is positive that the \"Kitty D.\" was in United States waters at the time of seizure, and that his outer (north) buoy was also in the same water.\n\"Connor, the engineer of the \"Lucy,\" said that on the 3rd July they were about a mile north of the \"Kitty D.\" and saw the seizure; that their nets had been set on about the 2nd July north and south, and that in lifting them on the 4th they found that the nets of the which had been set on the 3rd had crossed the \"Lucy's \"; that their outer buoy was about a mile north of the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets. He also said that it took him about thirty minutes to get to his inside buoy, and that his nets extended out 3\u00bc or 4 miles and made their distance from Dunkirk about 7 or 8 miles. And he also said that at the time of seizure the \"Kitty D.\" was in United States waters.\n\"Captain Howison of the United States navy, who had been sent by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to investigate the case, said that on the 27th July he left Dunkirk on the United States Revenue Cutter \"Fessenden,\" preceded by the tug \"Desmond,\" to show him the locality of the \"Kitty D.'s\" buoy; that they found it and had two corks taken off marked \"R. & D,\" and on returning to Dunkirk he logged the distance from the \"Kitty D.'s\" buoy, which he found to be 9\u00bd statute miles. He further stated that the International boundary line is about 11\u00bd miles from Dunkirk, and a little over two miles north of the western buoy of the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets. He also added that from where he found the buoy he could see the American shore, but not very well the Canadian shore.\n\"Mr. Harvey, consul for the United States at Fort Erie, went out from Dunkirk on the \"Desmond\" on the 7th July to the western boundary buoy of the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets, Captain Jones of the 'Kitty D.\" and others being with him; that the time going out was one hour and six minutes; that he logged the distance, which was found to be 9\u00be miles; that he took off a cork with the initials of the owners, \"R. & D.\" on which he put his own initials, and produced it at the trial; that in returning to Dunkirk it took one hour and seven minutes, and that the log showed 9\u00be- miles from where the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets were found.\n\"Donnelly, the captain of the \"Desmond\" said he was setting nets on the 3rd July, and saw the \"Kitty D.\" while about a mile south-east of the \" Desmond\"; that he was then about seven or eight miles from Dunkirk. He saw the \"Kitty D.\" seized. He further said that he went out on the \"Desmond\" on the 7th July, with Mr. Harvey, Captain Jones and Mr. Ryan, one of the owners of the \"Kitty D.,\" to take the distance from the shore to the \"Kitty D.'s\" buoy, and found the buoy, and took off one of the cords with \"R. & D.\" on it; that the distance from Dunkirk to it was 9\u00be miles, and that the time occupied was one hour and six minutes; and that on logging back the distance they found it the same.\n\"Burns, captain of the fishing tug \"Charm,\" also went out on the \"Desmond\" on the 7th July and found the buoy of the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets less than one-eighth of a mile of 9\u00be miles distance from Dunkirk, and took off a cork marked \"R. & D.\" He also said that the place where they found the buoy was about 2\u00bd miles on the United States side of the boundary line.\n\"Jones, on being recalled, stated that when he took Captain Howison out they went to the most northerly buoy of the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets.\n\"Dechert, one of the owners, who went out with Captain Spain on the \"Golden City\" on the 8th July, and on the \"Petrel\" on the 9th July to find the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets, stated that they were unable to find their locality on both occasions.\n\"From the above it will be seen that the weight of evidence as to the place of seizure of the \"Kitty D.\" is with the defence.\n\"But there are also incidents to be taken into consideration which seem to be material to the decision. In taking the turn into the lake from Long Point on the 3rd July, Captain Dunn stated that the rounding of the \"Petrel\" might increase the outward distance from Long Point by say 200 yards, and it might throw the ship out of her bearings that much, and that the turning might fluctuate from 200 to 500 yards off Long Point, which would seem to throw doubt as to the locality where the turning to the international boundary line actually took place; and to this he added that in taking a course along the international boundary line there would, of course, be some deviation from a straight course to the right or left\u2014a fact which it is reasonable to assent to, seeing that the vessel was proceeding on a liquid highway and out of sight of any distinctive land-mark on the shores, and on this day through an atmosphere described in the log book 'wind, light baffling to calm; heavy thunder squall with rain,' and by several witnesses as, cloudy, raining, misty; weather thick, kind of squally, rainy weather, quite a storm came up that day.'\n\"Then with these atmospheric difficulties there was the inexperience of the seamen in the practice of steering a ship, and their recent acquaintance with the points of a ship's compass, which leaves it somewhat doubtful as to their knowledge of its deviations, and especially, as it came out in the evidence, that the change of a quarter of a point in a compass would make a difference of a mile and a half right or left in a vessel's course over a distance of some thirty miles. \"Add to this the fact that the buoy of the \"Kitty D.'s' nets was a red pole, ten feet high, with an oil-skin flag at the top, then a piece of a pair of overalls, and next below a piece of shirt, which, neither on the search of the \"Golden City\" on the 8th, nor the search of the \"Petrel\" on the 9th July, was discovered\u2014 although the course of the \"Petrel\" on the 9th July is said by Captain Dunn to have been precisely the same as that taken by the \"Petrel\" the day he captured the \"Kitty D.\"\n\"It has been well said by Judge Black of the Quebec Admiralty Court that 'statements as to time and distance in maritime cases are probably more or less erroneous.' And Sir Wm. Scott when dealing with the evidence of estimated distances at sea in the case of the 'Twee Gebroeders'[1] at page 163 says: 'An exact measurement cannot be easily obtained, but in a case of this nature, in which a court would not willingly act with an unfavourable minuteness towards a neutral state, it will be disposed to calculate the distance very liberally.' And this conclusion was approved by the United States Admiralty Court, 'Soult v. L'Africaine\"[2], at page 205. For, as Sir William Scott afterwards said[3] on page 338: 'It is scarcely necessary to observe that a claim of territory is of a most sacred nature. In ordinary cases where the place of capture is admitted it proves itself,' but he adds that it is otherwise when it happens in places where it is contended that no right exists, and then, the facts on which the right depends must be competently established.\n\"These cases affirm the doctrines of International Law, which have been truly stated in Bar's Private International Law, page 1067-8:\n'In the case of any real doubt the decision must be against the subjection of a ship to a territorial sovereignty. The hull of the ship presents at once to the mind the notion of the subjection of that ship to the law of her own flag. We cannot regard that subjection as removed unless some sensible and unmistakable cause for its removal has intervened. Any other determination of the question would involve legal relations in uncertainty and confusion.\n'On land-locked lakes surrounded by several states the same principles as regulate the application of territorial law on dry land must rule, in so far as there are distinct boundary lines recognized. The well-known rule for fixing these is that the centre of the lake determines them, just as in the case with rivers. But if there is a condominium of the surrounding states, we are forced to consider a ship in matters of civil law, while she is on a voyage on the lake, as a part of the territory from which she hails, just as we do in the case of a ship upon the high seas. As regards contentious jurisdiction there is a question about arresting a ship, but this expedient seems not to be desirable, because it might easily be abused, and would be exceedingly apt to lead to a small warfare of jurisdictions.'\n\"On the facts disclosed in the evidence, and aided by the authorities cited, I must find that the locality of the \"Kitty D.\" fishing on 3rd July last was not within the Canadian waters on the north of the international boundary line in Lake Erie, and that her seizure on that day by the cruiser \"Petrel\" cannot be sustained, and that an order do issue for her restoration to her owners.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\"Toronto, December 3rd, 1903.\n\"Since disposing of this case the counsel for the Crown has moved for a certificate under sec. 15 of the Act respecting Fishing by Foreign Vessels, R. S.C. ch. 94, that there was probably cause for the seizure of the \"Kitty D.'' on the 3rd July last. That section provides that if such certificate is issued the owners 'shall not recover more than four cents damages, and shall not recover any costs, and the defendant shall not be fined more than twenty cents.' But I think section 20 of the Act relieves me of the responsibility of considering whether such a certificate should issue or not; for that section declares that 'the Act shall apply to every foreign ship, vessel or boat in or upon the inland waters of Canada.' My finding on the evidence was that this foreign ship, \"Kitty D.\", was not 'in or upon the inland waters of Canada' at the time of her seizure, and I must therefore hold that such finding negatives the statutory power to grant the certificate moved for.\n\"By rule 132 of the General Rules in Admiralty Cases it is provided that costs are to follow the event, and under that rule the owners are entitled to their costs of this action against the Crown.\nNew combe K.

It seems to me impossible to reverse the findings of fact of the court below without disbelieving the evidence of witnesses whom the judge who has heard them has believed. Now, I can see nothing in the case that would justify us in doing so. Then the judgment about to be rendered is based upon a question of fact raised for the first time in this court, and upon which, had it been directly raised at the trial, evidence might have been brought to affect it and elucidate it.\nI am of opinion, with deference, that this should not be done.

An appellant has no right so to ask us to act as a court of first instance.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The \"Kitty D.\" was an American tug boat engaged in fishing in Lake Erie in the year 1903. On the 3rd day of July of that year about mid-day she was seized by the Canadian cutter \"Petrel\" for fishing in Canadian waters, some two miles north of the boundary line. The line is not marked by buoys or otherwise across the lake, and the question for our determination was solely one of fact. Was the tug \"Kitty D.\" at the time she was engaged with her nets in fishing on the 3rd July, and when a few minutes afterwards she was captured by the cruiser \"Petrel,\" as she was running away south from her nets, on the Canadian or American side of the line? The contention on the part of the Crown was that the evidence shewed the nets and the tug boat to have been at least two miles north of the line, while for the defence it was contended that they were at least two miles south of the boundary and in their own waters. The differences are not reconcilable on any theory of mistakes of memory or misjudgment of distances on the part of the seizing officers, but can be accounted for possibly if the singular error with regard to the course sailed by the \"Petrel\" that day which seems by the report of the trial judge's decision to have been adopted by him was once accepted. I am inclined to think that the trial judge reached the conclusion he did very largely because of the error respecting the course of the \"Petrel\" with which his judgment opens He says that Capt. Dunn stated\nthat he left Port Dover on that morning (3rd July) at 6.30 o'clock and directed his officers to take the course to clear Long Point S. E. by S. \u00bc S. which was the usual course in calm weather, but owing to the variation of the compass the true course would be represented E. by N. 7-8 N.\nThis unfortunate mistake has arisen from the trial judge confounding the course E. by N. 7-8 N. which is stated by Capt. Dunn to be the true course when running down the lake parallel to the boundary, with the course which he evidently thought she followed from Port Dover past Long Point towards the boundary line and before and until she turned down the lake. Comparing the charts produced in evidence with the concurrent testimony of all the witnesses for the Crown who could speak upon the point that the course the \"Petrel\" took and followed from Port Dover past Long Point towards the boundary line was S. E. by S. \u00bc S. the error with which the learned judge starts of upwards of 7 points in the course is a fatal one. If the learned judge was correct in that and the officers of the ship wrong, he might well have distrusted their conclusions as to their position in the lake some five hours afterwards. I also think the learned judge was led to look with doubt upon the testimony of the ship's officers by a discrepancy which be thought existed between their statements as to the course of the ship from Port Dover to the boundary line. The captain stated the course to be S. E by S. \u00bc S. The first officer, Inkster, and second officer, McPherson, both corroborated this and the seamen who were at the wheel confirmed it. No doubt was attempted in the argument at bar to be thrown upon a fact so clearly and indisputably proved. The printed record however in one part of officer Inkster's evidence omits the first letter S. and makes him say in one place that at 8 o'clock the course of the ship was E. by S. \u00bcS. It does not appear whether the error was one of the printers or stenographers but the context of officer Inkster's evidence makes it quite patent that the omission of the letter S. on that line of the printed record was a mistake. The difference between the two courses is 4 points and if the course E. by S. \u00bc S. had been the course followed, the steamer would have gone almost directly away from Long Point to the eastward and not towards the boundary line at all.\nThe learned judge in a later part of his judgment seemed to entertain grave doubts whether the position of a vessel on a lake could be determined with any degree of accuracy by its officers under the circumstances that accompanied the short voyage of the \"Petrel\" on the 3rd. After referring to Capt. Dunn's statement that the turning of the vessel might fluctuate from 200 to 500 yards off Long Point which the judge remarks\nwould seem to throw doubt as to the locality where the turning to the international boundary line actually took place\nthe trial judge goes on to say: And to this he added that in taking a course along the international boundary line there would of course, be some deviation from a straight course to the right or left a fact which it is reasonable to assent to seeing that the vessel was proceeding on a liquid highway and out of sight of any distinctive land-mark on the shores, and on this day, through an atmosphere described in the log book as \"wind light baffling to calm; heavy thunder squall with rain\" and by several witnesses as cloudy, raining, misty, weather thick, kind of squally, rainy weather, quite a storm came up that day.\nThen with these atmospheric difficulties there was the inexperience of the seamen in the practice of steering a ship, and their recent acquaintance with the points on a ship's compass, which leaves it somewhat doubtful as to their knowledge of its deviations, and especially, as it came out in the evidence, that the change of a quarter of a point in a compass would make a difference of a mile and a half right or left in a vessel's course over a distance of some thirty miles.\nI merely quote the above extract to shew that the trial judge evidently was under the impression that when a vessel sails on \"a liquid highway out of sight of any distinctive land-mark on the shores\" and is steered by men at the wheel whose knowledge of the deviations of the compass is somewhat doubtful, the course of such vessel may well be accepted as erratic and uncertain. But, as we know, sailors who steer ships are not supposed to know anything of the compass' deviation or to act on such knowledge if they do possess it. They simply steer the ship by the points shewn on the compass before them and under the direction of an officer. The captain of the ship when making up his run, either from the log or observation or both, in determining and marking his position on the chart makes the proper allowance for the deviation and variation of his compass. If the unfortunate wheelsman had to make the necessary allowances for deviation when steering, pitiable indeed would be the captain's position when he came to determine the ship's location. I have thought it desirable to call attention to what I conceive to be cardinal errors in the trial judge's assumption of the facts in order to shew that his conclusions were not based upon any questions arising out of the demeanour or credibility of witnesses, matters which would be peculiarly within his province and with a decision upon which an appeal court would not interfere.\nThe question, it appears to me, we have to decide, is whether or not the evidence satisfies us beyond reasonable doubt that the \"Kitty D.,\" at the time of her seizure was in Canadian waters, and had been immediately before her capture fishing there. We have had the advantage of having had the evidence for and against the Crown subjected to able criticism, and careful comparison and collation. So far as the direct evidence for the Crown is concerned, it would, if accepted, seem to leave no room for doubt as to the positions of the cruiser and the tug when the latter was seized. The direct distance across the lake at the point of seizure is 22\u00bd miles and the boundary line running through the middle of the lake would be 11\u00bc miles from the Canadian shore. At the time and place of seizure there was no land in sight, and it was therefore necessary to establish the position of the cruiser by reference to the courses and distances which she had sailed from the land.\nThe \"Petrel\" had sailed from Port Dover on the morning of the 3rd July, and had taken her usual course towards the boundary S. E. by S. \u00bc S., passing Long Point light at a distance of about \u00bd a mile, and with the light bearing directly abeam had set her patent Negus log to indicate the distance run from that point. It is not disputed that the Negus log is one of the most approved logs known to mariners for the purpose of registering distances sailed.\nAll these patent logs have to be corrected from experience. The \"Petrel's\" log had been carefully tested and corrected and found by actual experience and measurement to over register 2\u00bc knots in every 40 knots.\nLikewise her compass had been carefully tested and corrected for deviation and the variation in the locality, of course, was known.\nIn fact the \"Petrel's\" compass carried a quarter of a point westerly deviation and the variation was 3.30 degrees.\nThe \"Petrel\" then, according to her officers, having set her log with Long Point light abeam, on her compass course S. E. by S. \u00bc S. continued that course until her log registered 5 knots, which brought her 1\u00be miles to the north of the boundary line.\nAt this point she turned to run down eastwardly parallel with the line within Canadian waters, and her compass course was as usual from there E by N. \u00bd N., which course she continued until her log registered 27 knots from the turn, making in all 32 knots from Long Point light.\nArrived at this point the \"Kitty\" D.. was sighted fishing about 2 miles to the northward of the Petrel, and a pursuit took place which ended in the capture of the former.\nThe pursuit lasted at full speed of both vessels for 10 minutes, the courses steered by the \"Petrel\" during that time beginning with a northwest course and changing to westward until, at the point of the capture, the \"Petrel\" was steering W. by N. a course considerably to the northward of that which the \"Petrel\" had sailed down the lake. The place of fishing, of course, was still further north.\nThe wind during the voyage of the \"Petrel\" down the lake was light, baffling to calm from the southeast. The effect of this wind if any would have been to set the \"Petrel\" further into Canadian waters during her voyage down the lake.\nThere were no currents or other conditions to affect the course of the \"Petrel\" on her voyage.\nImmediately after the seizure Captain Dunn says he laid down the true position upon his chart, having regard to the courses and distances sailed. This chart, which is Exhibit 5, is a chart issued by the United States Government, and shows the boundary line at the point in question somewhat south of the middle of the lake. According to this chart, which was in use on the \"Petrel\" the seizure took place two miles north of the boundary.\nThe soundings at this point as shewn by the chart gave 15\u00bd fathoms, and upon taking the soundings subsequently to verify the position it was found that they corresponded absolutely.\nCommander Spain says that when on board the \"Petrel\" using the same compass and log, on the 9th July following the seizure, he verified the position as stated by Captain Dunn, starting from Long Point and running the same courses and distances.\nHaving thus arrived at the point of seizure, Commander Spain steered directly to the nearest Canadian land, to which he approached within three quarters of a mile, being as near as the vessel could go\u2014the distance so sailed being 9 knots by the \"Petrel's\" log.\nThe place of seizure is, therefore, established by his evidence to have been precisely 9 knots according to the \"Petrel's\" log, plus f of a mile, from the Canadian shore. Making the correction mathematically for error in the \"Petrel's\" log:\n9 knots of \"Petrel's\" log = 8.52 true knots.\n8.52 knots = 9.79 statute miles.\n9 79 statute miles (being the distance logged) plus \u00be of a mile (being the distance from land) = 10.54 miles. The seizure, therefore, if his premises are accepted, took place \u00be of a mile, as nearly as may be, north of the middle of the lake, which is the boundary line.\nThe \"Kitty D\" had run according to her own admission about a mile towards the American shore from where she was fishing previous to the seizure.\nAccording to Captain Dunn, she had run considerably further, because when the pursuit began the \"Kitty D.\" was about 2 miles to the northward of the \"Petrel,\" and the pursuit lasting ten minutes ended by the seizure only 2\u00bd points north of the \"Petrel's\" course coming down the lake. Upon the most favourable conclusions for the defence therefore, accepting the accuracy of the courses and distances run by the \"Petrel\" from Port Dover that morning, the fishing took place 1\u00be miles within Canadian waters.\nAt the hearing I was much impressed with the argument presented by Mr. German with respect to this exact location and the corroborative evidence the Crown had offered in Captain Spain's test, Mr. German submitted that accepting the evidence of Captains Spain and Dunn with regard to this distance the result shewed that the \"Petrel\" was at the place of capture well south of the boundary line instead of about a mile north of that line. This however is erroneous and is caused mainly by omitting to allow mathematically for the error in the \"Petrel's\" log proved by Captain Dunn. I have made the necessary correction in this respect and have shewn that, assuming the courses and distances proved by the officers of the \"Petrel,\" to be correct the seizure was \u00be of a mile or more north of the boundary. I see no reason whatever to justify this court in declining to accept the evidence of Captain Dunn and his officers Inkster and McPherson. With respect to Slade and Campbell, the wheelsmen, they steered the ship as ordered and always with one of the officers standing by to see that the course was correctly kept. It is not a question of their being a few hundred yards north or south of where they believed themselves to be. It is a question of from 4 to 6 miles on a short run of 32 miles and to throw over this mass of evidence unless some very strong doubts are thrown upon its accuracy by some proved facts would, in my opinion, be impossible.\nNow the facts upon which we are asked to disbelieve or not to accept the evidence for the \"Petrel\" are the statements of Capt. Jones and Dewitt, one of the hands of the tug seized, and of Captain Hellwig of the fishing tug \"Lucy\" and Thomas Connor, her engineer. This latter tug was near the \"Kitty D.\" at the time and also steamed away, or, as the witnesses say, \"ran away\" southward towards the boundary line, the moment the thunderstorm cleared up and shewed her the cruiser. Capt. Donnelly, of the tug \"Desmond,\" is also referred to as confirming the evidence of the other witnesses respecting the place of fishing. I have very carefully gone over the evidence of each of them. The locality of the seizure is variously stated by them to have been from 6 to 9\u00be miles from Dunkirk depending upon uncertain estimates of time, distance and speed. These tugs did not carry or use any log, or chart or keep any log book. The witnesses relied entirely upon their memory and judgment as to time, distance and courses. When out of sight of land, as they admittedly were on the occasion of the seizure, it must be apparent that their judgment would often be at fault, and that the best they could do would be to form an approximate judgment, the accuracy of which would depend largely upon experience and might vary with the interest the witness had. Mr. German argued that because when seized Capt. Jones stated that he felt quite sure he was within his own waters, the statement made at the moment ought to be accepted as some evidence of his bona fide belief. But even if it was so accepted bond fide belief would not alter actual facts and the very fact that every one of the tugs in the vicinity including the \"Kitty D.\" and the \"Lucy\" started full steam southward apparently to escape from the cruiser is strong evidence against even the existence of such bon\u00e2 fide belief. In this connection I noticed a statement made by Dewitt the seaman aboard the \"Kitty D.\" He was asked:\nQ. Were there many other fishing tugs out in the lake at that time?\n\u2014A. Yes. There was quite a lot of others around there.\nQ. Any further out in the lake than your boat?\u2014A. Yes. One was outside of us, to the north of us, one or two of them.\nQ. One or two of them were out to the northward of the \"Kitty D.\"?\n\u2014A. Yes, when the \"Petrel\" saw us I would say there was one to the north of us, it must have been a couple of miles. We were wondering why the \"Petrel\" didn't go and seize them; he could have got them all right.\nNow why would they wonder the \"Petrel\" did not go and seize the tug to the north if they thought themselves in American waters? Mr. Grerman, however, relied chiefly upon the positive testimony respecting the locality in which the nets of the \"Kitty D.\" were found by the witnesses who went out with Capt. Jones on the 7th July, Capt. Donnelly of the tug \"Desmond,\" Capt. Burns of the tug \"Charm,\" and American Consul Harvey and Capt. Harrison, who went out on the 26th July.\nIt is not necessary, however, in my judgment, to discredit the testimony of any one of these gentlemen as to what they saw or was shown to them on either of these occasions. Their testimony is not inconsistent with the fact that the \"Kitty D.\" had set out her nets and was fishing on the 3rd July in Canadian waters. The nets so set out by her on the 3rd may well have been removed before the 7th and set south of the line, or, as seems much more probable, in fact almost certain from the evidence, the \"Kitty D.\" had two sets or gangs of nets, and the gang of nets seen by and shown to the witnesses on the 7th and 26th, and which were not taken up until after the latter date, were those which were set on the day before the seizure. As to the removal of the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets which were set by her on the day of the seizure, it seems to be explained by Thomas Connor, the engineer of the \"Lucy,\" who said, in answer to Mr. German:\nQ. You say that when you saw the \"Petrel\" seize the \"Kitty D.\" you took up what nets had been set on the 3rd?\u2014A. It was the \"Kitty D.'s \" nets that she set on the day she was seized.\nQ. On the 3rd July you saw the \"Petrel seize the \"Kitty D.\"?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. At that time had you set any nets from the tug \"Lucy\"?\u2014 A. These nets that she crossed ours were set on the 2nd July.\nOf course it was not essential to the case for the Crown to prove the removal of these nets, but to appreciate the full significance of this statement of the witness Connor, it must be remembered that the \"Lucy\" had not set her nets on the morning of the seizure. She was \"getting ready to do so,\" as her captain says, but had not got them out. The nets that were out were those set by the \"Kitty D.\" and left behind her when she steamed away, and it was these nets the \"Kitty D.'s\" \"nets that she set on the day she was seized \"that the \"Lucy\" \"took up.\" But they did not cross the nets set out by the \"Lucy\" on the 2nd, away to the south. That fact stated by Connor would sufficiently account for the inability of Captain Spain in the \"Golden City\" to find them on the 7th, four days after the seizure even with such assistance as Captain Jones of the \"Kitty D.\" gave. Connor does not answer question 95, put to him by Mr. German, whether at the time he saw the \"Petrel\" seize the \"Kitty D.\" they had set any nets from the tug \"Lucy.\" He gives what might seem an irrelevant answer. But Captain Hellwig, of the \"Lucy,\" puts that important and vital question at rest. His evidence as to what he did and did not do when he saw the \"Petrel\" is as follows:\nQ. When the \"Petrel\" came along and seized the \" Kitty D.\", did you put all your nets down?\u2014A. I started in for the south shore.\nQ. When you saw the \"Petrel\"?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Before you saw her had you set any nets?\u2014A. I was getting ready to start.\nQ. Had you put any nets down before you saw the \"Petrel\"?\u2014 A. No.\nQ. But you were getting ready and were going to put them down? \u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And when you saw the \"Petrel\" you steamed for the south side? \u2014A. Yes.\nQ. As fast as you could go?\u2014A. No.\nQ. What is your speed?\u2014A. Seven and a half; but we can go eight or nine miles.\nQ. What steam did you carry then?\u2014A. One hundred and ten pounds.\nQ. Are you the master of your boat?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What is her name?\u2014A. The \"Lucy.\"\nQ. You were at the wheel, I suppose, when you started for the south side?:\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Did you come back to where you were setting those nets that day?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Did you set your nets that day?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Afterwards?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. At what time?\u2014A. After 12 o'clock, we started.\nQ. It was about 12 o'clock that the boat was seized?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. How far did you run toward the south shore?\u2014A. I should judge about a mile.\nQ. Did you see the \"Petrel\" take the \"Kitty D.\" in tow?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And steam away for the Canadian side?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You saw her do that?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Then you went back to this place and put your nets down?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You put your nets down from where you had run to?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. In what direction?\u2014A. South.\nQ. You went south putting down your nets?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That was after they had taken the \"Kitty D.\" away to the Canadian side?\u2014A. Yes. Q. Whereabouts from where you began to put your nets down was it they seized the \"Kitty D.\"\u2014A. A little to the west\u2014about a mile\u2014not a mile.\nQ. A little to the north?\u2014A. It might have been a trifle, but not much.\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. A mile where?\u2014A. About a mile from where I was setting the nets to where the \"Kitty D.\" was seized.\nThen the further evidence of Hellwig, shows beyond reasonable doubt to my mind, first, that each tug has two sets of nets, and secondly, that the set put out by the \"Kitty D.\" on the day she was seized was not the set which crossed Hellwig's. He says;\nQ. In the setting of the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets east and west did they come in contact at all with your nets that were set north and south?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Were they across yours or were yours across the \"Kitty D.'s\"?\u2014A. They were across the gang I had set the 2nd day of July; and I went across them with the gang I was setting on the 3rd; I had two sets.\nI admit other parts of his evidence do not seem consistent with this, but when it is recollected that he had not put out his nets on the day of the seizure until after the \"Kitty D.\" had been seized, and after he had run away he judged a mile to the southward, it does not seem to leave room for doubt that both tugs had two sets, that the \"Lucy's \" set put out on the 2nd were crossed by a set of the \"Kitty D.'s\" put out on the same day, or at the utmost on the early morning of the third, and that both of these were within American waters and were again crossed by the second set of the \"Lucy's\" nets put down, after she had seen the \"Kitty D.\" captured on the third, and had herself escaped into her own waters. The second set serves to explain and make consistent the evidence of all the officers and men who speak of the place where they saw the \"Kitty D.'s\" nets on the 7th and 26th. There was no suggestion on the part of either Jones or Dewitt of any crossing of the nets of the \"Kitty D.\" put out just before the capture. The \"Lucy's\" nets were not put out till after the capture and after she had run away to the southward and was satisfied she was in her own waters.\nOn the whole I am of the opinion that no room for reasonable doubt exists as to the fact of the \"Kitty D.\" having been engaged in fishing in Canadian waters on the morning of the 3rd July and being in those waters at the time of her capture. I think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed with costs, and judgment of condemnation of the tug \"Kitty D.\" her tackle, apparel and appurtenances awarded with costs.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davies which I have read, and would only add that it appears to me the case is another illustration of the clash of scientific accuracy with human guess work. Either ships can be and are run by the improvements of modern science so that a captain can tell where he is without the sun, or all our boasted advances are naught. If compasses and logs, &c, are to be defeated by the judgment or estimate or guess of interested fishermen, poaching is made easy.\nKILLAM J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Louis Kinnear.\nSolicitors for the respondents: German & Pettit.Supreme Court of Canada\n[1] 3 Rob. 162.\n[2] Bee's Admiralty Reports 204.\n[3] 3 Rob. 336.\n[4] [1899] A.

For the purposes of the contract wires were strung on a telegraph pole and fastened with tie wires the ends of which were uninsulated. R., an employee of the Ottawa Electric Co., was sent by the latter to place a transformer on the same pole and, in doing so, his hands touched the ends of the tie-wire by which he received a shock and fell to the ground being seriously injured. To an action for damages for such injury Ahearn & Soper pleaded that R. had no right to be on the pole and was a trespasser, and on the trial, their counsel urged that the work he was doing was connected with the lighting of a building in the city. The Court of Appeal held that this defence was established and dismissed the action.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, (6 Ont. L.R. 619) that the counsel\u2019s address did not indicate that the building referred to was not one of those to be illuminated under the contract and the evidence did not shew that R. was not engaged in the ordinary business of his employers and the case should be re-tried, the jury having failed to agree at the trial.\nA rule of the Ottawa Electric Co. directed every employee whose work was near apparatus carrying dangerous currents to wear rubber gloves which would be furnished on application. R. was not wearing such gloves when he was hurt.\nHeld, that the mere fact of the absence of gloves was not such negligence on R.\u2019s part as would warrant the case being withdrawn from the jury; that as to Ahearn & Soper, R. was not bound by said rules; and that though his failure to take such precaution was evidence of negligence he had a right to have it left to the jury and considered in connection with other facts in the case.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court which refused to enter judgment for either party on findings of the jury who did not agree on a verdict.\nThe facts are stated as follows by Mr. Justice Osler in the Court of Appeal.\n\u201cThe facts lie in small compass. The defendants, electrical contractors and engineers, contracted with the Government to light the Government Buildings on the occason of the visit of the Duke of York to Ottawa in September, 1901, and they arranged with the Ottawa Electric Company to supply them with the necessary power. For the purposes of their contract the defendants carried two wires along Wellington Street and connected them with the equipment in the Departmental Block. At the south west corner of Wellington and O\u2019Connon Streets there are two poles between 6 and 7 feet apart, one belonging to the Great North Western Telegraph Company, the other to the Ottawa Electric Light Company. The former carried telegraph and telephone wires only, and on it at a considerable distance below the wires, and about 29 or 30 feet from the ground, the defendants placed their wires which were about sixteen inches apart, and were attached to the usual glass insulators on the ends of small side blocks or wooden projections nailed diagonally to the pole. The wires were tied or fastened to these insulators by common wire which was not itself protected by any insulating covering. The projecting ends of the tie wire were two or three inches long. The defendant Soper said that their wires were put up with the knowledge of the telegraph company, but could not be sure of their permission had first been asked or not. These two wires were the only ones on that pole carrying the electric current, the only live or danger wires, and they were intended to be and were taken down as soon as the defendants\u2019 contract had been carried out. About 24 feet from the ground there was fastened to the pole a cross arm, whether put there by the defendants\u2019 men, or the telegraph company does not appear. Shortly after the defendants\u2019 wires had been put up, the Ottawa Electric Company, in the course of their own business, sent three of their men, one of whom was the plaintiff, to put up a transformer for the purpose of carrying a current for electric lighting into Victoria Chambers or some adjacent building on Wellington Street. The evidence leaves it to be inferred that this was put up in some way on the G.N.W. Telegraph Company\u2019s pole, but there is no detail of the manner in which it was accomplished or how the connection with Victoria Chambers was made, except that the transformer was hoisted by means of a block and tackle tied to the G.N.W. pole, about five feet above the cross arm. Having served the purpose the tackle was being taken down, and the plaintiff was standing on the cross arm engaged in untying the rope when in some way he received a shock which threw him to the ground and caused the injuries he complains of.\nA.E. Fripp and D\u2019Arcy McGee for the appellants.\nRiddell K.C. and Harold Fisher for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and SEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial. DAVIES J.\u2014This action for damages sustained by plaintiff was one brought against the respondents for negligence in the manner in which they affixed certain electric wires to a pole of the North-West Telegraph Company, in Ottawa, along which wires they had contracted with their co-defendants, the Ottawa Electric Co., to transmit the electric current to enable them (Ahearn & Soper) to illuminate the outside of the Parliament Buildings during the visit of H.R.H. The Prince of Wales. The trial judge left three questions to the jury, two of which they answered in favour of the plaintiff, leaving the one as to his contributory negligence unanswered. The trial judge treated the neglect of the jury to answer this question as a disagreement and discharged them. Both parties appealed to the Divisional Court asking for judgment, the plaintiff on the two findings and the defendant for dismissal of the action.\nThe Divisional Court held that the trial judge was right, that judgment could not be entered on the findings for the plaintiff nor could the action be dismissed. Thereupon the defendants applied for and obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, conditional on their admitting the finding on the question of contributory negligence to have been for the plaintiff.\nThe Court of Appeal gave judgment for the defendants and dismissed the action on what, I think, was clearly shown to us on the argument to have been a misapprehension of the facts. That court proceeded upon the ground that it had been proved that the plaintiff was a mere trespasser in going up the North West Telegraph pole to affix a transformer to that pole, and that being such a trespasser the defendants owed no duty to him to take care that their wires strung on this post were so strung in a careful and safe manner. The learned judge who delivered the judgment of the court appealed from stated that there was a misapprehension of the facts on this point by the Divisional Court and goes on to say:\nThe putting up of the transformer had nothing to do with the defendant\u2019s business. It was put up by the Ottawa Electric Co., solely in connection with their own business arrangements for supplying light to Victoria Chambers. This indeed was stated by counsel for the plaintiff in opening the case to the jury and there is in fact nothing to connect the work which the plaintiff was doing with the defendants.\nMr. Fripp in argument before this court strenuously contended that these assumed facts upon which the Court of Appeal based its judgment were inaccurate and not justified by the evidence.\nA careful examination of the evidence has satisfied me that he is correct, and that it would not be a legitimate inference from it to assume that Randall in placing the transformer on the poll was there as a mere trespasser and not, as contended by the plaintiff, in order to transform or supply the power of the Ottawa Electric Co. to the wires of the defendant. If the latter was the purpose for which plaintiff placed the transformer on the pole, or if it was necessary to be put there for the purposes of Ahearn & Soper, then plaintiff was legally there as one of the workmen of the Ottawa Electric Co., in connection with their contract with defendants, and so being was entitled to have from defendants the exercise of proper skill and care in relation to the manner in which they strung their wires on the post, and to hold them responsible for damages caused by want of such care and skill, to which he had not, by his own negligence, contributed. My understanding of the facts which are not at all clear in the evidence on this crucial point of plaintiff\u2019s presence on the pole, accords with that reached by the Divisional Court, and I assume also by the trial judge; and as I also concur with that court in its statement of the law that the bald fact of the absence of gloves on the plaintiff\u2019s hands at the time of the accident was not of itself sufficient to withdraw the case from the jury, however cogent it might be as evidence of contributory negligence, I think a new trial should be had. That single fact of the absence of gloves must be taken and weighed in connection with all the other facts of the case, which might or might not according to circumstances as between plaintiff and defendants between whom there was no contractual relation with respect to gloves, convince or fail to convince a jury of such negligence. Standing baldly by itself it is not conclusive.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and the Court of Appeal and a new trial had, the costs of the first trial and of the appeal to the Divisional Court to be costs in the cause.\nKILLAM J.\u2014This is an action brought in the High Court of Justice for Ontario by an employee of the Ottawa Electric Co. against that company and the present respondents, Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., to recover damages for an injury received by the plaintiff. At the time the accident occurred the plaintiff was engaged in untying from a pole a rope which had been used to hoist up a transformer of the Ottawa Electric Co. to a place on the pole. The injury was caused by the plaintiff\u2019s falling to the ground from the pole, a distance of some thirty feet or more. Ahearn & Soper, Ltd. is an incorporated company carrying on business as electrical contractors and engineers. This company had a contract with the Dominion Government to light Government Buildings in Ottawa in September, 1901, and they arranged with the Ottawa Electric Co. to supply them with the necessary power. For the purposes of their contract Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., carried two wires along Wellington Street. At the corner of Wellington and O\u2019Connor Streets, these two wires were fastened upon a pole belonging to the Great North Western Telegraph Co. at a short distance from which was another pole belonging to the Ottawa Electric Co. The former pole was used to carry telegraph and telephone wires only. Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., fastened their wires to the Telegraph Co\u2019s pole by a common iron wire tied round insulators. The tie wires were not insulated, and had ends projecting two or three inches from the insulators. For some reason which is unexplained the plaintiff and other employees of the defendant company placed the transformer upon the pole of the Telegraph Co., and plaintiff, in untying the rope mentioned, appears to have put his hand upon one of the wires of Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., where it was fastened to the pole, and thus touched the uninsulated tie wire. The result was that he received a shock which caused him to unloosen his hold and fall to the ground.\nBy the rules of the Ottawa Electric Co., shewn to have been known to the plaintiff, it was provided:\n1. Employees must always bear in mind that their occupation is a dangerous one, but no employee will take any risk of injury other than that which is necessarily incident to his particular work.\n2. Every employee whose work is near the live wires or with apparatus carrying dangerous currents shall, whenever there is any possibility of receiving a shock, wear rubber gloves; such gloves will be furnished on application, and no excuse will be accepted for neglect to wear them.\nThe evidence also showed that it was the rule to treat all wires as \u201clive wires,\u201d that is, as carrying currents strong enough to injure. Randall was wearing no gloves when he received the shock.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Meredith, with a jury. The case was submitted to the jury only as against Ahearn & Soper, Ltd. Three questions were submitted by the learned judge to the jury. These questions and the answers of the jury were as follows:\n1. Was any negligence of the defendants Ahearn & Soper, Ltd. the approximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury?\u2014A. Yes.\n2. If so, what was such negligence? State fully and plainly.\u2014A. By using uncovered tie wires, and careless construction of tie wires.\n3. Might the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary care, have avoided his injury?\u2014No answer was given to the third question.\nThe learned judge treated the case as one of disagreement on the part of the jury, and discharged them. Both parties then moved before a divisional court for judgment, when the court dismissed both motions. Application was then made by Ahearn & Soper, Ltd. for special leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, and the leave was given upon the condition that the case should be treated as if the jury had answered in favour of the plaintiff the question as to contributory negligence submitted to them, and as if judgment had been entered in favour of the plaintiff upon this and the other findings and Ahearn & Soper, Ltd. were appealing from that judgment. The Court of Appeal decided that Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., were entitled to judgment, and dismissed the action. They considered that the plaintiff had failed to prove any negligence on the part of Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., towards the employees of the Ottawa Electric Co., as in their opinion the plaintiff was a mere volunteer, a person on the pole without any license or authority, and also that the evidence showed that the plaintiff was the author of his own wrong, and to have brought his injury on his own head by the omission to employ the usual means of protection against danger from electric shock. The evidence did not disclose distinctly what authority Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., had for using the pole of the Great North Western Telegraph Co. Mr. Soper, an officer of Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., being asked:\u2014\nDid you have to get permission from the Great North Western Co. to string your wires on their poles? It was done with their knowledge, I suppose?\nsaid:\nYes, but I am hazy as to whether I asked their permission or not.\nNo other evidence was given of any authority on their part to so use the pole.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Divisional Court, Sir Wm. Meredith C.J. said:\nThe transformer which the plaintiff had been engaged in putting up, the appliances for raising which he was taking down when he was injured, as I understand the testimony, was put up by the Ottawa Electric Co. under their contract with the Ahearn Co. to supply the electric current for the line which the latter Company had put up, and whatever may have been the position of the plaintiff as between him and the owner of the pole, as between him and the Ahearn Co. it must, I think, be taken that he was using the pole under circumstances that made the duty of the Ahearn Co. towards him as great at least as it would have been had the plaintiff been an employee of the owner of the pole and had been engaged in doing the work upon which he was engaged for that owner.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Osler said:\nIf the transformer had been put up by the Ottawa Electric Co. under their contract with the defendants in order to supply the power to their wires, as the judgment below assumes, there would be no difficulty in affirming the existence of a duty towards the workmen of the Electric Co. to take care that their wires were put up in a safe and careful manner * * It is, however, stated in the reasons of appeal and was again stated before us and not denied, that there is a misapprehension in the judgment on this point, and that the putting up of the transformer had nothing to do with the defendants\u2019 business. It was put up by the Ottawa Electric Co. solely in connection with their own business arrangements for supplying light to Victoria Chambers. This, indeed, was stated by counsel for the plaintiff in opening the case to the jury, and there is in fact nothing to connect the work which the plaintiff was doing with the defendants. With all respect for both the courts below, it appears to me that both were alike under misapprehension in respect of this matter. There appears to be nothing in the evidence to suggest that the transformer was put up for any purpose of Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., or in any way connected with the supply to that company of electric current. On the other hand, there seems to be an equal lack of evidence as to the purposes for which the transformer was to be used by the Ottawa Electric Co., although, I admit, the prima facie presumption is that it was for the purpose of the Ottawa Electric Co. alone. The remarks of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in opening the case to the jury are set out in the appeal book. After stating that Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., had a contract with the Dominion Government to light the Parliament Buildings upon the occasion referred to, and that they had contracts to light other buildings in close proximity thereto, the learned counsel said (referring to Randall):\nHe was sent to put up a transformer, that is a box, the effect of which is to reduce the current from one wire so as to carry a similar quantity of current into a building near the Victoria Chambers.\nBut there seems to have been nothing in the address of the learned counsel to indicate that the transformer was to be used in connection with the lighting of Victoria Chambers, or whether the building referred to was or was not one of those which he stated Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., were lighting under their contract. By their statement of defence Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., alleged that Randall at the time of the accident was a trespasser who had climbed upon the pole from which he fell without authority or right to do so. Mr. Soper was asked: \u201cYou say in your statement of defence that the plaintiff Randall was a trespasser on this pole. What do you mean by that?\u201d, and he replied: \u201cI mean he was not our employee.\u2019\u2019 The printed case gives no indication that the defendants, Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., raised any objection at the trial to Randall\u2019s right to recover on the ground of his being in the position of a trespasser only. The learned judge in charging the jury pointed out the difference between the duty which Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., would have owed to the public generally if they had left the wires on or near the ground, and the duty which they owed to any person likely to be upon the pole at a distance sufficiently near to the point of attachment to receive a shock. In this connection he said:\nBut when placed high up on these poles it is entirely different. There they knew it would be a man of experience, a man who knew the danger of these wires, and a man who ought to take care and avoid apparent dangers, and a man who, in his own interests, ought to take care, would be working there. * * And you are to say whether they did anything which was a want of ordinary care to a person of experience going there.\nNo objection appears to have been made to the charge of the learned judge or to his leaving to the jury the question of negligence on the part of Ahearn & Soper, Ltd. While it appears to me that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be assumed that Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., had their wires rightfully upon the pole in question, yet I think that under the circumstances the action should not be dismissed upon an assumption that the plaintiff was upon the pole without authority.\nThen, upon the question of contributory negligence, I am of opinion that it cannot be said that the evidence is so clear against the plaintiff that the question should not have been left to the jury. As between himself and Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., the plaintiff was not bound by the rules of the Ottawa Electric Co., although his neglect to employ an ordinary precaution was strong evidence of negligence on his part. Alfred Dion, Superintendent of the Ottawa Electric Co., gave the following evidence:\nQ. Was it his duty to wear gloves at any such work like this?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. At any rate it was his duty to wear gloves?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Could the accident have happened had he worn gloves?\u2014A. Very unlikely.\nNo stronger evidence was given of the efficiency of the protection afforded by the use of gloves. Of course the plaintiff would see that these wires of Ahearn & Soper, Ltd., were used for the purpose of carrying a strong electric current, and he would also be aware of the danger of finding a strong current on any of the wires of the Telegraph Co. or Telephone Co. through contact with wires carrying high current. But it appears to me that there was still a question for the jury such as the third question left to them by the learned judge at the trial.\nIn my opinion, then, the court of Appeal was not warranted in disturbing the order of the Divisional Court dismissing the applications of both parties for judgment.\nI would allow the appeal with costs, and discharge the order of the Court of Appeal, with costs in that court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fripp, Henderson & McGee.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Murphy & Fisher.\n[1] 6 Ont.

King, (1904) 34 S.C.R. 710\nDate: 1904-05-04\nJohn Bellamy Miller (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nElizabeth King, Administratrix of the Property of Peter King, Deceased (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1904: March 23; 1904: May 4.\nPresent: Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau C.J. and Sedgewick, Girouard, Davies and Killam JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nM., proprietor of iron works, had built an engine in the course of business, and while it was standing on a railway track in the workshop a heavy dray standing near owing to the horses attached being startled was thrown against it whereby it was overturned and killed a workman at a bench three or four feet away. On the trial of an action by the administratrix of the workman\u2019s estate the jury found that the accident was due to the negligence of M. in not having the engine properly braced.\nHeld, that this finding was justified by the evidence and M. was liable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation for injuries Act (R.S.O. [1897] ch. 160.\nHeld also, that the accident did not occur through a defect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises with, intended for or used in the business of the employer.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe husband of the respondent at time of his death was a machinist, 52 years of age, and had been working in the appellant\u2019s establishment for about a year.\nThe works of the appellant are situate on the esplanade, Toronto, and occupy a space of about 400 feet by 400 feet, and are for the manufacture of engines, castings and other machinery. The particular shop in which the accident happened is a large place.\nRunning from north to south at the east side of the shop is a space 14 feet wide with a large door of same width for entrance, and occupied by a railway track, on which railway cars are taken into the shop for the purpose of loading and taking away machinery, and the space being level is also used by waggons or drays as a roadway for the same purpose. Over this space or roadway a travelling crane extends from the shop, for the purpose of lifting machinery on to the railway or waggons. Close to this roadway and running westward in length with tube some fifty or sixty feet altogether, a dredge engine had been built, preparatory to being shipped to British Columbia. The engine itself, apart from the tube, was about ten feet long, four feet wide and five or six feet high, larger at the top and centre than at the bottom, but how much does not appear. It weighed four or five tons, and had been erected where it was for about three months. Each end rested on a piece of timber about twelve inches square and was supported in addition by timbers against flanges at the side.\nThe deceased was on the day of the accident, and had been for some time, working at a bench running along the north wall of the shop and some three or four feet from the engine. A large lorry or waggon belonging to the defendant Colville, who had a general contract with appellants for carriage of goods, had been backed into the shop for the purpose of taking away a retort to the Gas Company\u2019s works. The waggon and horses backed down the roadway and past the engine in question, and was there loaded on the roadway with the retort under the superintendence of one Dowie in the employment of and representing the person for whom the retort had been made, and who had sold it to the Toronto Gas Company. The retort extended over the edge of the waggon a foot or fifteen inches, but there was room for it to pass the engine. The waggon had been loaded, when suddenly the horses started, from what cause does not appear, and going forward swerving to the left, the engine in question was struck by the waggon and thrown over upon the deceased.\nThe trial took place at Toronto before Mr. Justice Meredith and a jury in September, 1902.\nQuestions were submitted to the jury which with their answers are as follows:\n1. Q. Was Peter King\u2019s death caused by a mere accident not attributable to the negligence of any one?\u2014A. No.\n2. Q. If not was the proximate cause of it the negligence of the defendants or either of them?\u2014A. Yes.\n3. Q. If so, which?\u2014A. Miller.\n4. Q. And what was the negligence? State fully and plainly.\u2014A. Improper bracing of engine.\n5. Q. Did King voluntarily incur the risk of the injury he suffered so far as the defendant Miller is concerned?\u2014A. No.\n6. Q. Might King by the exercise of ordinary care have avoided the injury?\u2014A. No.\n7. Q. Assess the damages?\u2014A. Widow King $1,000; invalid daughter, Bessie, $200.\nUpon these findings judgment was entered by the order of the learned trial judge in favour of the plaintiff against the appellant Miller for $1,200 and the costs of action, and the action was dismissed as against the defendant Colville with costs.\nThe appellant thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and his appeal was by an unanimous judgment of the court on the 14th day of September, 1903, dismissed.\nThe appellant\u2019s appeal now is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nRiddell K.C. and G.L. Smith for the appellant. The finding of the jury that the engine was improperly braced is against evidence and that is the only negligence imputable to the defendant.\nThis court will set aside improper findings though affirmed by an intermediate court of appeal. Montgomerie & Co. v. Wallace-James[1]; Cowans v. Marshall[2]; Wood v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co[3].\nThe engine was not machinery \u201cconnected with, intended for or used in the business of the employer\u201d under the workmen\u2019s Compensation for Injuries Act[4] sec. 3; Griffiths v. London and St. Katharine Docks Co.[5]; Rudd v. Bell[6].\nAylesworth K.C and E.B. Stone for the respondent. The fact that the engine was overturned was evidence that it was not properly supported. T. Eaton Co. v. Sangster[7].\nIt was a defect in the premises under the Act and also negligence at common law.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nDAVIES J.\u2014Without expressing any opinion whatever upon the possible liability at common law of the defendant, a liability which was not charged upon the pleadings and was in no wise in issue at the trial, I concur in the conclusion reached by the Court that the defendant is liable under \u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation for Injuries Act\u201d for the negligence of the superintendent under whose orders the engine was braced and supported. There cannot be, in my opinion, any reasonable doubt that the findings of the jury are justified by the evidence as to this inefficient shoring up or bracing of the engine. It was the duty of the superintendent, considering the position in which the engine was placed, alike with respect to the bench where King was working and to the roadway along which heavy loads were constantly being hauled from the factory, to see not only that the bracing was sufficient to support the inherent weight of the engine and the probable forces the workmen engaged in its construction might bring against it, but also that it was sufficient to securely support the engine against any shock it was reasonably likely to receive from the drays and loads being hauled past it. That it was not so braced the result sufficiently proved, and that the defendant\u2019s superintendent ought to have provided against such a shock as the engine received is, under the circumstances of this case, in my opinion quite clear. As a matter of fact the evidence shewed that between the end of the engine where struck by the loaded dray and the load on that dray there was only a space of about five inches. Of course a very slight swerve of the horses was sufficient under these conditions to press the load against the engine. The impact seems to have been slight but it was sufficient to overturn the engine and cause the death of the unfortunate man King. I think this danger of contact between the loaded drays and the engine where placed was one which the defendants\u2019 superintendents were under the circumstances reasonably bound to consider and provide against, and that for their neglect to do so the defendant is under the statute liable for the damages resulting.\nI am, however, clearly of the opinion that the facts do not shew or constitute any\ndefect in the condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant, buildings or premises connected with, intended for, or used in the business of the employer, within the meaning of the Act. The engine overturned was not part of the ways, works, plant or machinery of the workshop. It was an article in process of manufacture or construction for sale and could not be held either with respect to its location or to its bracing to constitute such a defect as the statute was intended to cover, and for which the master or owner was to be held liable.\nI think on the ground I have stated above the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae & Green,\nSolicitors for the respondent: Stratton & Hall.\n[1] [1904] A.C. 73.\n[2] 28 Can.

K. Laflamme K.C. for the appellants.\nLabrie for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une action possessoire au sujet d'une petite lisi\u00e9re de terre sise sur la cote de Gasp\u00e9, d'une valeur insignificante, de quelques piastres seulement; mais tant que le loi n'aura pas limit\u00e9 le droit d'appel dans ces cas l\u00e0, soit en consid\u00e9rant la valeur de l'immeuble ou ce qui serait peut-\u00eatre plus pratique en soumettantces proc\u00e9s aux juges depaix du district comme en France, sans appel si ce n'est pour, erreur de droit ii faut s'altendre \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats parfois surprenants, toujours ruineux. Quelque soit leur pauvret\u00e9, les parties se passionnent, et les avocats, les amis et de premiers succ\u00e8s aidant, elles finssent par gravir toutes les juridictions du pays. Ici, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Gasp\u00e9 (de Billy J.) jugea en faveur de la demanderesse. La Cour de R\u00e9vision (Routhier et Langelier JJ., Andrews J. diff\u00e9rant) renversa ce jugement qui fut finalement r\u00e9tabli \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel. Ce n'est donc pas sans h\u00e9sitation, et seulement apr\u00e8s avoir acquis la ferme conviction qu'il y avait erreur dans son jugement, qu'\u00e0 notre tour, nous sommes unanimement arrives \u00e0 la conclusion de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour de R\u00e9vision.\nLa demanderesse est propri\u00e9taire d'une terre sur la c\u00f4te de la Gasp\u00e9sie, \u00e0 quelques milles du roc de Perc\u00e9, born\u00e9e en front \u00e0 la mer et coup\u00e9e ou born\u00e9e \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents endroits par une petite rivi\u00e8re navigable au moins \u00e0 son embouchure, qui se d\u00e9charge dans la mer, pr\u00e9cisement \u00e0 l'endroit o est situ\u00e9e la lisi\u00e8re de terre en litige. Le plan suivent produit dans la cause donne une id\u00e9e assez exacte de la situation des lieux. La lisi\u00e8re de terre se trouve pr\u00e8s du pont entre les lettres A. B. C. F. [Page 719]\nDepuis un temps imm\u00e9morial los p\u00eacheurs de la localit\u00e9 d\u00e9chargent leurs poissons sur cette lisi\u00e8re de terre et ancrent leurs barques dans cette rivi\u00e8re, en bas et en haut du pont, passant, aller et retour, sur cette lisi\u00e8re do terre qui \u00e9tait en dehors de la cl\u00f4ture du champ de la demanderesse, no fat jamais enclose et \u00e0 quelques pas do distance donnait communication ouverte au chemin du roi de la c\u00f4te Des t\u00e9moins appellent cette lisi\u00e8re do terre une esp\u00e8ce do commune, d'autres un chemin public pour se rendre \u00e0 la. rivi\u00e8re, y prendre do l'eau, layer, descendre on se rendre aux barques etc. La cl\u00f4ture do travers qui la s\u00e9pare de son champ exist\u00e9, dit-elle, dans son t\u00e9moignage, depuis cent cinquante ans. Bref, le public \u00e9tait en possession de ce petit terrain, non pas \u00e0 titre de simple tol\u00e9rance mais comme \u00e9tant dans l'exercice d'un droit. Jamais permission ne fat demand\u00e9e, si ce n'est r\u00e9cemment par quelques-uns pour avoir la paix, apr\u00e9s le commencement des travaux du gouvernement ou le barrage du terrain an chemin du roi. Le plus grand nombre ne voulut pas se soumettre \u00e0 cette exigence et d\u00e9molit le barrage comme \u00e9tant une nuisance publique La demanderesse connaissait si bien les droits du public qu'elle posa une barri\u00e8re dans le but avou\u00e9 par elle d'y baisser passer les p\u00eacheurs et la public en attendant la d\u00e9cision du conseil do la municipalit\u00e9 qui no fut jamais donn\u00e9e.\nIl importe peu de savoir, \u00e0 cette phase de la cause, qui est le propri\u00e9taire de ce petit terrain, si c'est la demanderesse dont le titre couvre toute sa terre jusqu'\u00e0 la mer, ou la Couronne qui, comme repr\u00e9sentant le public, est propri\u00e9taire des rivages, lais et relais de la mer, des rades et des rivi\u00e8res navicables et flottables et d'un chemin de h\u00e2lage ([1]). Il est \u00e9galement inutile de rechercher s'il y a en donation ou dedication en faveur du public ou non. Ce qui est certain c'est que la demanderesse n'avait pas la possession annale requise par la loi, c'est-\u00e0-dire, une possession paisible, publique et non \u00e9quivoque ([2]) et pour cette raison, et uniquement pour cette raison nous sommes d'avis de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour de R\u00e9vision. Mr. le juge Routhier, qui a prononc\u00e9 le jugement de cette cour, r\u00e9sume la situation sur cc point dans des termes Si clairs que nous croyons ne pouvoir mieux faire que de reproduire ses observations :\nL'immeuble dont la possession est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e est un petit terrain en forme de triangle on de jib, comme les t\u00e9moins, qui sont des p\u00eacheurs et des marins l'appellent. Son \u00e9tendue est de 60 pieds de longueur, dit le jugement, 78 pieds de largeur \u00e0 un bout et 36 \u00e0 l'autre bout. Il longe la petite rivi\u00e8re de l'Anse \u00e0 Beaufils, comt\u00e9 de Gasp\u00e9, dans sa longueur et il touche dans sa plus grande largeur au chemin du roi a l'autre bout \u00e0 la mer et du c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re il joint le terrain de la demanderesse\nLa premi\u00e8re condition requise pour r\u00e9ussir dans cette action possessoire,\u00e9tait une preuve suffisante de possession de cc terrain pendant an moins Un an, possession ayant tous les caract\u00e8res exig\u00e9s pour la prescription.\nOr cette preuve de possession fait d\u00e9faut. La demanderesse a bien prouv\u00e9 qu'elle poss\u00e9dait le terrain lot n\u00b0 241 du Cadastre du Canton de Perc\u00e9 et que d'apr\u00e8s son titre ce terrain serait born\u00e9 \u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re; mais sa possession a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9e par une cl\u00f4ture s\u00e9parant son terrain du jib en question.\nIl est incontestable d'apr\u00e8s la preuve qu'elle n'a jamais poss\u00e9d\u00e9 ce triangle qui \u00e9tait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la gr\u00e8ve de la rivi\u00e8re. Et pourquoi n'en avait-elle pas pris la possession? 1. Parce que c'\u00e9tait d\u00e8s l'origine, de facto sinon de jure un chemin public, la continuation du chemin du roi, fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 par tous ceux qui allaient \u00e0 la mer ou au bord de la rivi\u00e8re chercher du poisson ou du varech? 2. Parce que cc terrain, ouvert \u00e0 la circulation du public, \u00e9tait s\u00e9par\u00e9 du terrain de la demanderesse par une cl\u00f4ture; 3. Parce que jusqu'\u00e0 il y a 4 ans, ce terrain \u00e9tait la gr\u00e8ve de la rivi\u00e8re et que les grandes mar\u00e9es l'inondaient.\nIl est prouv\u00e9 que cette rivi\u00e8re est navigable \u00e0 cet endroit, et m\u00eame un peu plus haut, et qu'elle est flottable sur une plus grande longueur. Or, l'art. 400 C. C. faisait de sa gr\u00e8ve une d\u00e9pendance da domaine public et, cons\u00e9quemment, la demanderesse ne pouvait en avoir la possession. Aussi admet-elle dans son t\u00e9moignage que son champ a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 borne \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture\nNi elle-m\u00eame, ni ses auteurs n'ont jamais pr\u00e9tendu emp\u00eacher le public de vaquer sur ce terrain, et n'en ont jamais, avant l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, r\u00e9clame Ta possession. Pourquoi la demanderesse la r\u00e9clame-t-elle maintenant? C'est que la nature du terrain est bien chang\u00e9e. Le gouvernement, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des p\u00eacheurs, y a fait construire une jet\u00e9e qui \u00e9largit ce terrain et le d\u00e9fend contre la mer; de sorte qu'au lieu d'\u00eatre comme autrefois, une gr\u00e8ve que les grandes mers lavaient c'est un terrain que la mer ne couvre plus et qui est bord\u00e9 par un quai.\nMais, s'imagine-t-on que le gouvernement a fait ces travaux pour agrandir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la demanderesse?\nEvidemment non. Les t\u00e9moins des deux parties le reconnaissent, \u00e7a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour permettre aux barges des p\u00eacheurs d'entrer dans la rivi\u00e8re, d'accoster au quai et d'y d\u00e9charger leur poisson, qu'ils y viennent chercher par ce chemin ouvert au public depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial\nOr, si la demanderesse r\u00e9ussissait dans ses pr\u00e9tentions, les p\u00eacheurs ne pourraient plus arriver \u00e0 la jet\u00e9e o\u00f9 sont amarr\u00e9es leurs barges et o\u00f9 leur poisson est d\u00e9charg\u00e9.\nL'appel est donc accord\u00e9 mais sans frais devant cette cour et devant la Cour d'Appel, auxquels M. le Soliciteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Lemieux, l'un des avocats des appelants, a gracieusement\u2014et avec raison dans les circonstances\u2014renonc\u00e9 en faveur de la demanderesse\nLe jugement de la Cour de R\u00e9vision est donc r\u00e9tabli purement et simplement.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants; Auguste Beaudry.\nSolicitor for the respondent : D.

S.C.R. 340). Subsequently, upon default to furnish such security, the opposition was dismissed. On appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench affirming the order for the dismissal of the opposition;\u2014\nHeld, that, under the circumstances, the order dismissing the opposition was the only one which could be properly made, and that the merits of the former order could not be reviewed on appeal from the final judgment.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming an order of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, dismissing the appellants opposition with costs.\nThe appellants filed an opposition afin de charge to the seizure and sale of the property of the defendant under execution at the instance of the respondents and, upon such opposition, an order was made ([1]) requiring the opposants to furnish security that the lands seized, if sold by the sheriff subject to the charge, should realize sufficient to satisfy the claim of the execution creditor. On an appeal, it was held that this order was merely an interlocutory proceeding and not appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada ([2]). The opposants failed to furnish the necessary security and, upon the plaintiff's motion, the Superior Court, consequently, dismissed the opposition with costs. The Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirmed the dismissal of the opposition and the opposants sought an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the merits of both orders.\nMacmaster K.C. and Lemieux K.C for the appellants (Desaulniers K.C. with them). The proceedings were irregular and to the prejudice of the opposants. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure were disregarded or misapplied in such a manner as to deprive the opposants of their right to have the lands sold subject to their lease-charge. There should have been an adjudication upon the validity of the charge before imposing, upon the opposants, the duty of furnishing security. Arts. 724,726 C. P. Q.; art. 2073 C. C.; Bastien v. Desjardins ([3]) per Lacoste C.J. The proper procedure would have been according to the provisions of arts. 644 et seq., 731 and 132 C. P. Q. and arts 1663 and 2128 C.C. We refer to Lachaine v.

C.\nAngers K.C and DeLormier K.C. for the respondents. The opposants had both actual and constructive notice of our priority of registration and have suffered no wrong. The present appeal can be asserted only from the last judgment. The interlocutory order became chose jug\u00e9e and it is impossible, now, to raise objections to it. 2 Boncet, des Jugements, 151; Toussignant v. County of Nicolet ([6]); North British & Mercantile Insurance Co. v. Marsan dit Lapierre (3).\nArt. 726 C. P. Q. does not apply to this proceeding; it is ruled by arts. 3 and 651 C. P. Q. On matters of procedure the decisions of the provincial courts ought not to be disturbed. The charge could not be admitted and security asked for at the same time.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed.\nThe judgment of 30th September, 1902, ordering the appellants to give security, having been affirmed by the Court of Appeal, the Superior Court, upon the appellants' faillure to give the security so ordered, when the case came up de novo upon the respondents' motion to consequently dismiss the appellants' opposition, was bound to grant the said motion as it did on the 19th of May, 1903. And, likewise, when the case came up again before the Court of Appeal, that court could not but hold, as it did by the judgment now appealed from, that the Superior Court had committed no error when it had simply acted in accordance with the judgment rendered upon the first appeal.\nNow, if the Court of Appeal has rendered the judgment that it had in law to give, the appellants' attempt to shew error in that judgment necessarily fails, and if there is no error in it they cannot expect us to reverse it. They seem to be under the impression that, because the first judgment ordering them to give security, was not appealable to this court, Desaulniers v. Payette ([7]), they can now ask us, upon this appeal from the last judgment, to review that first judgment. But that cannot be. As we have often said, an interlocutory judgment that cannot be appealed from is res judicata. But it is not merely because a judgment is res judicata that it is appealable, as the appellants would contend.\nThe policy of the statute is, as a general rule, to allow but one appeal in each case, and that only from the final judgment ([8]). The rules of the Code of Civil procedure, upon appeals from the Superior Court to the Court of King's Bench, have no application to appeals from the Court of King's Bench to this court. The judgment in this case ordering security to be given was not a final judgment and we could not entertain that appeal therefrom that was brought by the appellants. The last one, now appealed from, dismissing appellants' opposition upon their refusal to give such security, is a final judgment and we have jurisdiction over this appeal therefrom, but we must dismiss the appeal because the judgment is the only one that the court a quo could, in law, possibly give.

Owing to some inaccuracy in the lay agreement a new lay agreement was executed at the same time as the mortgage. The mortgage provided for payments at earlier dates than the lay agreement, and was not read over to the defendants, who were unable to read and had requested that it should be read over to them. In an action on the mortgage evidence was given that a document signed on that date was represented to be in terms similar to the lay agreement as first drawn but it might, possibly, have been the new lay agreement that was thus spoken of, and it appeared that, although the defendants became aware of the difference in the terms of payment mentioned in the mortgage and complained of this to the plaintiffs' agent, they continued to work on the lay, assuming that the altered terms of payment would not be insisted upon.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, Sedgewick and Killam JJ. dissenting, that there was not sufficient evidence of acquiescence in the altered terms of payment and that, as the evidence shewed that defendants were illiterate and the mortgage had not been read over to them on request, and they had been misled as to its contents, they could not be bound by its altered provisions as to the payments. APPEAL from the judgment of the Territorial Court of Yukon Territory in banco, affirming the judgment of Craig J., at the trial by which the plaintiffs' action was maintained and the counter-claim of the defendants dismissed with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions at issue on the appeal are stated in the above head-note and the judgments now reported.\nNoel K.C. for the appellants.\nAylesworth K.C. for the respondents.\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting).\u2014For the reasons stated in the written judgment of my brother Killam I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD and Davies JJ. Concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nNESBITT J. The authorities are clear that where a party executing a document cannot read or write except to sign his name, even when the document is in his own language, it is held not to be executed where there is either, (a) a request that the document shall be read by the party putting it forward, which is refused, or (b) where it is misread, or (c) where the contents are misrepresented.\nIn this case I have read the evidence relating to the execution of the mortgage several times and my mind is irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that the mortgage, differing as it does in the most material particular from the lay agreement, was not explained, as to that particular, to the defendants, but, on the contrary, it was represented to them, and they believed, that it Complied with the terms of the lay agreement I am greatly influenced in coming to this conclusion by the evidence of Mr. Gosselin, the agent of the plaintiffs, who says that there was no idea of receiving payment except out of the clean-ups from the dumps, and that the agreement as to payment under such circumstances at a date when it was, practically, physically impossible that the payment could have been made from the clean-ups, was the first one of the kind he had ever seen in the territory.\nIt is further to be observed that the lay agreement provided specifically, first, for the retention, absolutely, of fifty per cent of the product of each wash-up, and, secondly, for the retention, out of the fifty per cent, (a) of the then existing indebtedness, and (b) any further indebtedness from the defendants to the plaintiffs for future supplies. It was urged that in December the defendants became aware of the terms of the mortgage and, subsequently, went on and received supplies under its terms, and, therefore, must be held to have ratified it or to have acquiesced in its provisions. The defendants both swear that when the terms of payment, the first day of May, first came to their knowledge, they declined to go on with the work, and said they would have to throw up the whole job, but that Mr. Grosselin, the plaintiffs' agent, stated that the plaintiffs would not insist upon such a term and induced them to go on with their work, and. I think that the language of Lord Chancellor, in Morse v. Royal ([1]) is applicable. In that case the Lord Chancellor said:\u2014\nAs to the doctrine of confirmation, it stands upon several authorities; where a man having been defrauded, with complete knowledge chooses to come again in contact with the person who defrauded him; abandons his right to abrogate the contract; and enters into a plain, distinct transaction of confirmation. But when the original fraud is clearly established by circumstances not liable to doubt, a confirmation\n[Page113]\nof such a transaction is so inconsistent with justice, so unnatural, so likely to be connected with fraud that it ought to be watched with the utmost strictness ; as an act, done with all the deliberation that ought to attend a transaction, the effect of which is to ratify that which, in justice, ought never to have taken place.\nWe think that there was an agreement to give a mortgage to secure the further advances, but there was no bargain for an alteration of the terms of payment provided for in the lay agreement, and we think it would follow that, under the taking of accounts prayed for by the counter-claim, the plaintiffs on the argument were now entitled to payment for large advances, and we refer the whole question of taking accounts and the claim for damages under the counter-claim back to be tried and disposed of by the courts below. All costs of the previous trial and of the proceedings in the court below and in this court of the appellants, defendants, to be payable forthwith out of the moneys in court with power to either party to apply with reference to such moneys and full power of amendment to dispose of all questions which may arise out of the counter-claim,\nI would refer to Thoroughgood's Case ([2]); Rex v. Longhorn ([3]) ; Owens v. Thomas ([4]); Murray v. Jenkins ([5]) ; Addison on Contracts, (9 ed.) 114 and following; and to Jones Slacker Co. v. Green ([6]).\nKillam J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Territorial Court of the Yukon Territory. The action was brought upon a mortgage of chattels, for the appointment of a receiver and manager of a mining claim and chattel property connected therewith, and for payment of the mortgage moneys in the manner claimed by the plaintiffs. The plain-\n[Page114]\nTiffs, a husband and wife, had a mining claim in the Yukon Territory; they entered into an agreement with the defendants, Letourneau and Bernier, by which the latter were to work the claim for a certain time upon shares. To give effect to their arrangement the parties entered into an agreement in writing, called in the case a \"lay\" agreement. By this document the plaintiffs leased the mining claim to the defendants from the 10th day of September, 1901, until and including the 1st day of September, 1902. The document required the defendants to pay over to the plaintiffs all gold as fast as it was realized from the claim, and the lessons were to retain one half of the gross amount and pay the remainder to the defendants. It was also provided that the defendants should purchase certain machinery from the plaintiffs, to be paid for by the retention of the amount of the purchase money out of the defendants' share of the gold that had been paid over to the plaintiffs. It was also provided that the plaintiffs should have the right to retain out of the defendants' share of the gold sufficient to repay to the plaintiffs the sum of $40,000, being the amount of the defendants' indebtedness to the plain-tiffs for certain groceries, provisions and supplies. It was further provided that the plaintiffs should also have a right to retain out of the defendants' share of the gold to be extracted during the wash-ups during the spring of the year 1900, or such other wash-ups as might take place during the year, sufficient gold to reimburse the plaintiffs for all debts for supplies to be thereafter furnished by the plaintiffs to the defendants. At or about the same time at which this agreement was made, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants executed an indenture of mortgage by which, after reciting that the defendants had applied to the plaintiffs for advances of goods and supplies to enable\n[Page115]\nthem to carry out the terms of their lay agreement, and that the plaintiffs, on the faith of the security given or to be given by the mortgage, had agreed to provide such advances of goods and supplies, provided that they should not be bound to advance in all more than $20,000 in value, and provided that the terms of credit for any such goods should not in any case extend beyond the first day of May, 1902, the defendants mortgaged to the plaintiffs all of the defendants' share in and to the dump and dumps extracted during the life of the lay agreement, and the gold and gold dust extracted from such dump or dumps, and all gold and gold dust to be extracted from the claim in any manner whatever during the terms of the lay agreement, and also all groceries, provisions, fixtures, machinery, etc., on the claim, to secure payment of all moneys which should become payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs on or before the first day of May, 1902, with certain interest.\nBy the original statement of defence the defendants alleged that it was agreed between the plaintiffs and the defendants that all the money due on the mortgage was to be paid after each clean-up, until the full debt should be satisfied, during the continuance of the lay agreement, and the defendants put in a counterclaim alleging that they mortgaged all their interests in the claim and in the dumps thereon to secure future advances from the plaintiffs, and that by a subsequent agreement the amount due under the mortgage should be paid after each clean-up until the full mortgage money was satisfied, and that the lay agreement would end on the first day of September, 1902, and the mortgage would become due on that date. Subsequently the defendants put in an amended statement of defence and counterclaim by which they set up that on the 28th September, 1901, it was agreed between the\n[Page116]\nplaintiffs and the defendants that the defendants were to give a mortgage on the dump or dumps to be extracted under their agreement, and on all gold or gold dust to be extracted there from, and all the groceries, supplies, machinery, etc., for the sum of $20,000, to secure all or any advances made by the plaintiffs to the defendants, the mortgage to be payable out of the proceeds of the lay agreement coming from each wash-up, and the mortgage to become due and payable on the first September, 1902; that the plaintiffs were authorized to draw up a mortgage upon those terms, and the plaintiffs did draw and produce to the defendants for their signature a form of mortgage pretending that it contained the terms of the agreement just alleged, and that it was payable as so agreed, and falsely represented to the defendants that the mortgage was only payable from their share of the proceeds of the claim as washed up by them and would not be due until the first September, 1902, and that the defendants need not read the paper as it only contained the terms of such agreement, and the defendants relied upon the false representations made by the plaintiffs as to the terms of such mortgage, and signed it, having full trust and confidence in the plaintiffs, which was the mortgage now sued on.\nThe defendant (Bernier) gave evidence which, upon its face, very full bore out the allegations of this amended statement of defence. Apparently he meant to swear that the particular document which embodied the mortgage was signed by the defendants upon the representation that it contained only similar terms to those of the lay agreement, and that\nMr. Carbonneau induced them to sign it without having it read to them, claiming to be in a hurry.\nLetourneau gave evidence of having been induced to sign some document on the representation that it\n[Page117]\nwas in terms similar to those of the lay agreement He, Letourneau, said that he first heard of the mortgage in question in December, 1901, and that he did not know until December that there was a mortgage.\nIt is clear, upon the evidence, which after one document had been drawn up and signed as embodying the lay agreement, another document was drawn up and signed by the parties which was either a copy of the original or varied slightly there from.\nUpon Letourneau's evidence, it is quite open to believe that the document, to which he refers as having been signed by him upon the representation that it was similar to the lay agreement, was this second agreement. Both Letourneau and Bernier were illiterate men whose native language was French, but who, to some extent, understood English, though unable to read it. One cannot rely, under these circumstances, with any great confidence upon the accuracy of statements by either of them that the document which they signed upon the representation that it embodied the same terms as the first lay agreement, was the mortgage rather than the second copy of the lay agreement.\nMrs. Charbonneau gave evidence of a preliminary discussion before the documents were signed, in which the mortgage was distinctly agreed upon, and in which it was agreed that it should be made payable at any rate before the first day of August, 1902.\nBernier does not deny that there was to be a mortgage.\nUpon all the evidence, it seems very clear that the hypothesis that the defendants were induced to sign a mortgage, not knowing that it was such, but on the faith of the representation that it was a copy of the lay agreement and believing that it was a lay agreement only, is not open. Gosselin, who acted as bookkeeper\n[Page118]\nand agent of the plaintiffs, gave some evidence which seems to me to be rather confused. The learned judge who tried the cause said that he placed very great weight upon Gosselin's evidence, which he seemed to be the only witness who was at all clear. I am not able to place so great reliance upon Mr. Gosselin's evidence. He did speak of the signing of the second lay agreement and admitted that there was at that time a representation that it was similar to the former one; but he said, also, that Charbonneau explained that there were the two documents, the lay agreement and the mortgage. He also said that he did not pay Very particular attention to what occurred.\nIf the evidence of the defendants as to the alleged misrepresentation which induced them to sign the mortgage were clear and upon its face reliable, I would think that Mr. Gorstein\u2019s evidence went a long way to corroborate it. But, upon the evidence as a whole, I am not satisfied that any such representation was made with reference to the mortgage, or that the defendants were misled into signing a mortgage upon different terms from those understood by them to be contained in the document. It is true that it could not have been expected at the time that, before the first May, 1902, sufficient would be realized out of the claim to pay these additional advances; but still it was competent to the plaintiffs to refuse those advances except upon the terms that the amounts therefore were to be deemed payable on the first day of May so as to enable the plaintiffs to enforce the security if circumstances should appear to render it advisable. Certainly, a misunderstanding in this respect might easily have occurred between the parties, or the defendants might easily have been induced to sign a document embodying these terms without having really agreed to them. But the execution of the do\n[Page119]\ncomment was prime facie proved by proof of the defendants' signatures, which are admitted by them, and I am unable to find sufficient in the evidence to warrant the inference that the defendants were misled or executed a document embodying different terms from those which they understood it to embody.\nThe defendants claim that, in December, 1901, or January, 1902, they learned of the contents of the instrument of mortgage and, as soon thereafter as possible, made objection to Gosselin respecting the terms of payment, claiming that the money was only to be paid as realized out of the claim. Gosselin does not dispute this absolutely he admits that there was some question raised by the defendants, though he does not remember exactly what it was. He, however, gave them certain assurances, as they say, which induced them to go on as before.\nPossibly, if there had been misrepresentation, the continuance of the defendants under the circumstances would not be sufficient to prevent their now disputing the mortgage.\nThe Carbonneaus left the Yukon Territory in October, 1901; they returned about the middle of April, 1902, and had conversations with the defendants between that time and the commencement of this action, on or about the 27th May, 1902. Both the plaintiffs deny that, before the commencement of the action, they heard of any complaint respecting the terms of payment of the mortgage, and the defendants did not pretend that they made any such com-plaint to them. It must be assumed, then, that no such complaint was made, which strengthens my distrust of the defence, as does, also, the course of the pleading.\n[Page120]\nI think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Noel, Noel & Ledieu.\nSolicitors for the respondants: M.

In an action by the assignee of C. for a declaration that the city held the lands in trust and for re-conveyance of the same to him, under the proviso on breach of conditions, it appeared that about one-sixth of the land had been left in its natural state, \"virgin forest,\" but that the remainder had been cleared and made fit for \"ordinary athletics, Scotch athletics\" although not suitable for games or sports requiring \"nice\" level ground. It appeared, also, that the road had been built but that, as population did not increase in the vicinity, the grounds were not in demand for athletic or exhibition purposes, they had not been used and had become somewhat covered with undergrowth of chaparal and bracken.\nHeld, Sedgewick J. dissenting, affirming the judgment appealed from, that there was no such breach of the trusts as could warrant a declaration of forfeiture under the provisoes of the deed of conveyance.\nPer Killam J.\u2014Had there been a breach of trust, the resulting forfeiture could have been decreed in favour of the assignee of the grantor. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in banco,[1] affirming the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin, at the trial, dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe questions in issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nTravers Lewis and Smellie for the appellant.\nChrysler K C. and Hammersley K.C. for the respondent.\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting).\u2014 I dissent from the judgment of the majority of the court on the ground that the evidence discloses a breach of the conditions upon which the land to be used as a park was conveyed to the city. The city held the land subject to these conditions and, the breach having been committed, it continued to hold the land in trust for the grantor and is obliged to re\u2014convey it to him or his assigns.\nGIROUARD J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought by one Clark against the City of Vancouver claiming a declaration that the defendant held certain lands in trust for him and should convey the same to him.\nThe plaintiff claimed as the assignee of his uncle, one E. J. Clark, who had conveyed the lands in the year 1889 to the city in fee simple \"as and for the purpose of a park or public recreation place.\"\nThe clauses of the deed containing the trusts upon which the lands were to be held and upon which the plaintiff claimed to have the lands re-conveyed to him were as follows:\n1. That the said lands forever hereafter, while the same shall remain vested in the said corporation, its successors and limited assigns upon trust as aforesaid, shall be used continuously and only as and for the purpose of a park or public recreation place, and that games and athletic sports of all kinds may be permitted thereon, and also the holding of fairs, industrial and horticultural displays, exhibitions of natural products, manufactures, machinery or works of art, or for any other public purpose which shall be for the benefit of the citizens of the said City of Vancouver.\n2. Provided nevertheless and it is hereby agreed and declared that nothing herein contained shall authorize the use by the said corporation, its successors or limited assigns, of the said lands for the purpose of a general market for the sale of any horses, cattle, sheep, swine, or other animals, nor for the purpose of a general market for the sale of produce, fish or other commodities, for the purpose of any manufactory, or manufacturer's business, nor for any purpose, object matter or thing whatsoever, which would, could or might cause a nuisance to either the public generally or to any person or persons resident for the time being in the vicinity of the said lands and premises.\n3. And upon further trust and condition that the said corporation, its successors or limited assigns, shall within twelve months from the first day of January, A.D. 1890, clear off stumps, roots, and plough, harrow and level off same, according to the natural contour of said ground, and seed down same, and shall and will within twenty\u2014four months from the said first day of January, A.D. 1890, build a road leading to said ground and shall forever thereafter, while the said lands and premises shall remain vested in the said corporation, its successors or limited assigns, upon trust as aforesaid, maintain the same in such fit, proper and good condition as aforesaid, according to the true intent and meaning of these presents.\nMuch learning was displayed in the argument at bar as to the right of the plaintiff, as assignee of the grantor, E. J. Clark, to maintain this action even if there had been such a breach of the trusts or conditions of the deed to the city as would work a forfeiture of the estate of the latter, and the judgment of the majority of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was based upon that ground. The counsel for the City of Vancouver also contended before us that the plaintiffs' assignment was void as contravening the law against champerty. I do not, however, find it necessary to consider either of these grounds of defence as I fully agree with the main conclusion reached by the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Martin, that the action should be dismissed for want of merits.\nThe trial seems to have proceeded and much of the evidence to have been given under a misapprehension of the true meaning of the deed of conveyance from Clark to the city, a misapprehension which the learned trial judge himself seems partly to have shared and which was adopted by the counsel for the appellant in the argument at bar. That misapprehension was that the trust deed required the lands to be prepared and levelled so as to be suitable for all athletic sports and that the whole of it had necessarily to be cleared of the trees growing thereon.\nA reference, however, to the terms of the trust will shew that its main purpose was to provide \"a park or public recreation place\" for the citizens of Vancouver, and that while the second clause prohibited general markets for the sale of animals or produce from being held, or the user of the park for the purposes of a manufacturing business or other uses which might cause a nuisance, games and athletic sports of all kinds and the holding of fairs, industrial and horticultural displays and exhibitions, etc., were expressly mentioned as \"to be permitted\" as also\nany other public purpose which shall be for the benefit of the citizens of the said City of Vancouver.\nThe main object and purpose of the grounds, however, were the providing \"a park or public recreation place\" for the citizens and a very wide discretion was necessarily vested in the city as to the purposes for which they would allow the park to be used. These facts need only be stated to shew how absurd was the contention that it was the duty of the corporation to denude the place of all trees and to remove all traces of the virgin forest. As a matter of fact the evidence shewed that at a cost of some $5,000 the corporation had, within the time specified in the trust deed, caused a road to built to the park and five-sixths of the ground, which was very gravelly, to be \"cleared, grubbed, harrowed and seeded down\" and \"the large stones, the boulders, all taken off.\" Either through a mistake as to the boundaries or from what I would call the exercise of a prudent and well grounded judgment, the remaining one-sixth of the grounds were allowed to remain in its original condition as \"virgin forest.\" I am at a loss to understand how the grounds could fairly and reasonably be said to have been maintained as a park or place of \"public recreation\" if it had been entirely denuded of trees. I think the proportion left as virgin forest a reasonable and proper one and that no just construction of the trust deed required this forest to be entirely destroyed.\nThe evidence of Tracy, the city engineer, and of Fraser, the contractor, shews that as to the rest of the ground\nall the trees and stumps and everything had been taken off it (and) that it was cleared down to the natural grade or contour of the ground,\nthat there are no hollows or abrupt lumps on it and that, owing to its \"natural contour\" or slope, the ground while suitable for \"ordinary athletics, Scotch athletics\" was not suitable for cricket or games requiring a nice level and could only be made so at enormous expense which of course the city was not bound to incur. Fraser also proved the making, opening and grading of a road to the park from the city, one and a quarter miles in length as required by the trust deed.\nPopulation has not grown up around or in the neighbourhood of the park, and there being no demand for the grounds for athletic or exhibition purposes, they have been allowed to remain as they were \"cleared, grubbed, harrowed and seeded down\" until they have been covered with a growth of bracken which it would take a couple of days to remove.\nTo hold that this is a breach of the trusts of the deed from which a declaration of forfeiture should be made would be to my mind unjust and contrary alike to the language and intent of the deed.\nThe donor, Mr. Clark, at or about the time he gave the park to the city being the owner of a large tract of land of which the six acres given for a park formed a small part, duly registered a plan of his estate showing the park grounds and afterwards sold and disposed of all his other lands surrounding the park to third parties, all the sales having been made with reference to that registered plan. He refused to pay and has never paid any part of the $1,000 which under the terms of his deed he agreed to pay to the city towards the expenditure it was obliged to incur on the ground or pretext that the city had not carried out the trusts of the deed, and now he or his nephew, the assignee, claims that the park itself has been forfeited to him under a strict and, as I think, improper construction of the terms of his trust deed. I think the evidence shews that the city has at a very large expenditure substantially fulfilled its trust, and while the growth of population has unfortunately not met the expectation of either party a careful perusal of the evidence has convinced me that the merits of the case are all with the defendant and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J. also concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nKILLAM J.\u2014It appears to me that the learned judges in British Columbia erred in treating this case as one in which there was a question of a condition broken. The conveyance was to the \"corporation, their successors and limited assigns,\" with habendum to\nthe said corporation, their successors and limited assigns, to and for their sole and only use forever, subject nevertheless to the reservations, limitations, provisoes and conditions expressed in the original grant thereof from the Crown and particularly subject nevertheless also to the trusts, provisoes, conditions and agreements hereinafter declared and contained, concerning the same, that is to say: etc. etc.\nNone of the subsequent clauses provide for the determination of the estate thus conveyed, except by reconveyance. But, in certain events, the corporation was to hold the property in trust for the grantor in fee and to reconvey to him, his heirs or assigns. The word \"limited\" before \"assigns\" seems meaningless. The legal estate passed absolutely to the corporation, with a trust to arise upon a contingency and an agreement to convey to the cestui que trust. I cannot appreciate the difficulty in the way of the enforcement of the trust and of the agreement, by a court of equity, in favour of a transferee, if they are such as would have been enforced in favour of the original grantor. The doctrine of the invalidity of conveyances of lands in adverse possession of another and the statute, 32 H. VIII. c. 34, can have no application to such a transaction. The question whether, upon its terms and in view of the surrounding circumstances, the conveyance to the plaintiff would be held invalid in equity as being champertous or as savouring of champerty, is entirely different.\nAs the city accepted the conveyance and expended a large sum upon the property, and as the claim is one, in effect if not in form, of a forfeiture, the case should be treated strictly. The plaintiff should be confined to the allegations in the statement of claim, and strict proof should be required of him.\nThe following were among \"the trusts, provisoes, conditions and agreements\" of the conveyance: 1. That the said lands forever hereafter, while the same shall remain vested in the said corporation, its successors and limited assigns, upon trust as aforesaid, shall be used continuously and only as and for the purpose of a park or public recreation place, and that games and athletic sports of all kinds may be permitted thereon, and also the holding of fairs, industrial and horticultural displays, exhibitions of natural products, manufactures, machinery or works of art, or for any other public purpose which shall be for the benefit of the citizens of the said City of Vancouver.\nPar. 2 prohibited the use of the property for certain specified purposes.\nPar. 3. And upon the further trust and condition that the said corporation, its successors or limited assigns shall, within 12 months from the first day of January, A.D. 1890, clear of stumps, roots and plough, harrow and level off same according to the natural contour of said ground, and seed down same, and shall and will, within twenty-four months from the said first day of January, A.D. 1890, build a road leading to said ground, and shall forever thereafter, while the said lands and premises shall remain vested in the said corporation, its successors or limited assigns, upon trust as aforesaid, maintain the same in such fit, proper and good condition as aforesaid, according to the true intent and meaning of these presents.\nThe clause relied on as providing for the arising of the trust in favour of the grantor and the right to a reconveyance was as follows:\nPROVIDED always and it is hereby declared that the grant and conveyance hereby made is so made upon the express trust and confidence that in the event of the said corporation, its successors and limited assigns, failing to comply with the trusts and provisions expressed and contained in the third paragraph hereof within the period thereby limited for that purpose or in case of their due compliance therewith then afterwards in the event of any breach, non-performance or non-observance of any of the trusts and conditions herein contained for the space of twelve months and notwithstanding any prior breach or breaches for the space of twelve months of any of the trusts and provisions on the part of the said corporation, their successors or limited assigns, to be by them observed and performed which may have been overlooked or waived by the said grantor, his heirs or assigns, then and immediately thereafter the said corporation, its successors and limited assigns, shall hold the said lands and premises in trust for the said grantor, his heirs and assigns and to be reconveyed to him and them accordingly, but neither of the parties hereto, nor their heirs, successors or assigns shall have any claim against the other of them for any loss, costs, damages or expenses arising out of the trusts provisoes and conditions herein contained or in respect of any matter or thing arising out of the premises.\nThe allegations in the statement of claim of the circumstances entitling the plaintiff to be treated as a cestui que trust and to have the land conveyed to him were as follows:\n4. The defendants failed to perform the trusts and conditions following, namely: The defendants did not, within twelve months from the first day of January, 1890, clear the said hereditaments of stumps and roots and did not plough, level and harrow the same according to the natural contour of the ground and did not seed down the same, and did not, within twenty-four months from the said first day of January, 1890, build a road leading to the said hereditaments, and if they did build a road they did not maintain same according to the true intent and meaning of the condition in that behalf.\nThese are limited to non-performance of the stipulation for clearing the land of stumps and roots, and ploughing, levelling, harrowing and seeding it within the prescribed time, and to an alleged failure to build and maintain the road provided for. As counsel for the plaintiff interprets the third paragraph the maintenance of the road was not stipulated for. And I agree with this view. The words \"maintain the same,\" as counsel admits, did not relate to the roads, but to the lands.\nThis consideration, however, appears unimportant, as I am of opinion that it is not sufficiently shewn that the corporation did not, within the meaning of the deed, clear the land of stumps and roots, or plough, harrow, level off or seed the same within the prescribed period, or build or maintain the required road.\nThe onus was upon the plaintiff to make clear and strict proof in some of these respects. I cannot think that, in requiring the land to be cleared of stumps and roots, the grantor intended that all trees were to be cut down. Ornamental trees are properly considered to be appropriate, and even necessary, in a public park. It appears to me that the corporation could properly have preserved such trees as might be considered fitted for the purpose.\nAnd it seems impossible to believe that the grantor intended that every square inch of the property should be ploughed, harrowed and sown. Flower beds, ornamental shrubs, walks, rockeries, grottoes, arbours, would be appropriate and customary. Some of the purposes for which the land could be used would involve the erection of buildings or structures more or less substantial.\nFurther, some portion or portions of the property might be appropriately kept in its wild state. If suitable portions existed this would constitute an attraction and be of benefit for the purposes of an ornamental park or public resort.\nIt was not made incumbent upon the corporation to put the property in a fit condition for being the scene of every kind of game or athletic sport. These were merely specified purposes for which the corporation was authorized to use the property. This was not obligatory, any more than the use of the land for fairs, exhibitions, or other particular public purposes. All of this was left to the discretion of the corporation, the grantor giving merely general indications of his objects and desires.\nIt was shewn in evidence that the corporation did clear, level (so far as the ground permitted), plough, harrow and sow nearly all of the land. It left some portion or portions wholly or almost wholly untouched, principally a triangular piece in one corner. The plaintiff's surveyor estimated the uncleared portion at 1.256 acres out of 6.858, or between a fifth and a sixth of the whole. Of an area, specified to be 1.123 acres, he said:\nThat has has never been cleared at all; it is virgin forest, as it has originally grown; fir, cedar and other timber.\nThe surveyor admitted that there was a difficulty about the lines in the locality and that he could not be sure that his survey was absolutely accurate. Some of his evidence was as follows:\nQ. Will you guarantee your surveys correct?\nA. No, I guarantee nothing in 264 A, but I can arrive at a close approximation.\nQ. Therefore you cannot guarantee the line being out a few yards distance, or not?\nA. No, I do not propose to guarantee any survey in 264 A, with absolute accuracy, but a close approximation I can give.\nI add the following extract from the evidence of the city engineer:\nQ. You know this Clark's Park, don't you?\nA. I know the place.\nQ. Look at that plan. Does that show fairly how much has been cleared, and how much has not?\nA. I think that is about it, as near as I can tell; the surveys are very indefinite; in that district, I could not say positively; I have gone over it and that is very nearly\u2014\nThe only description of the uncleared portion which the evidence affords is that it is \"virgin forest,\" whether ornamental or appropriate to be thus left, whether containing stumps and roots, other than those of growing trees, we do not know. Having reference to the difficulty in the surveys we cannot be certain of the exact proportion so left.\nIn my opinion the evidence is too meagre to warrant a finding that the corporation failed to fulfil the terms of the conveyance, according to a reasonable interpretation of them. Much had to be left to the discretion of the civic authorities in designing the park, and it does not appear that it was not put in a condition which would have been warranted in the exercise of that discretion.\nSubsequent lack of care in the maintenance of the park was not alleged in the statement of claim, and should not, I think, be considered upon this evidence.\nI would dismiss the appeal, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wilson, Senkler & Bloomfield.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hamersley & Godfrey.\n[1] 10 B.

The name of E. & Co. had been forged to said note which the bank had discounted. Two days after the notice was mailed at Toronto the proceeds of the note had been drawn out of the bank by the payees.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (7 Ont. L.R. 90). Sedgewick and Nesbitt JJ. dissenting, that on receipt of said notice E. & Co. were under a legal duty to inform the bank, by telegraph or telephone, that they had not made the note and not doing so they were afterwards estopped from denying their signature thereto.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Mr. Justice Osler as follows:\n\u201cThe plaintiffs are indorsees of a promissory note for $2,000, dated 14th August, 1900, purporting to be made by the defendants, payable four months after date to the order of the Thomas Phosphate Company, and indorsed by them to the plaintiffs. \u201cThe defendants deny the making of the note and allege that if it purports to be signed by them the signature is a forgery.\n\u201cThe plaintiffs reply that, even if the signature is a forgery, the defendants are estopped from denying that it is in fact their signature.\n\u201cThe facts may be very briefly stated.\n\u201cOne Wallace was the manager of, and perhaps interested in, a business carried on by Walter C. Bonnell under the name of the Thomas Phosphate Company, which previous to the 14th August, 1900, had done some banking business with the plaintiffs. On the 15th August, Wallace procured the note now sued on to be discounted by the bank for the Phosphate Company and the proceeds were placed to the company\u2019s credit. On the 15th and 16th August checks were issued by the company against the proceeds of the deposit and other small deposits, payment of which left a balance to their credit at the close of business on the 15th of $1,611.55; on the 16th of $1,355, and on the 17th of $84.\n\u201cOn the 15th the bank sent a memo. to the defendants, who reside in Montreal, in the following terms: \u2018Toronto, August 15th, 1900. You will please take notice that your note for $2,000, to the Thomas Phosphate Company falls due at this bank on the 17th December, 1900, and you are requested to provide for the same. A.P., Assistant Manager. To Messrs. Ewing & Co., Montreal.\u2019\n\u201cThis was received by the defendants on the 16th August. To the bank they made no response and took no notice of the memo., but between themselves and Wallace an active correspondence by telegram and letter was kept up, beginning on the 16th August and ending on the 5th of December; on the defendants\u2019 side at first asking for an explanation before advising the bank,\u2019 and then urgently insisting on the note being taken up; while Wallace\u2019s letters are filled with the usual regrets and excuses for his conduct, and vain promises to settle the note and relieve the defendants\u2019 anxiety.\n\u201cThe defendants appreciated the gravity of the situation, warning Wallace by telegram and letter on the 16th August that \u2018the Phosphate Company have no note of ours,\u2019 and that \u2018before advising the bank of this thought it better for you that we should ask you what it means,\u2019 and that \u2018we have to act promptly and to advise the bank at once to save ourselves.\u2019 On the 21st, that \u2018the only way out of it is for you to take it\u2014the note\u2014up, and that at once,\u2019 and that \u2018contrary to advice received we have held off for a day before notifying the bank.\u2019 On the 23rd, that \u2018our lawyers told us distinctly that we ought at once to advise the bank, in fact to do so the night we wrote to you. We are now going against their advice. For God\u2019s sake fix it at once, else we don\u2019t know how the thing will end.\u2019 And on the 25th in a similar strain, repeating the warning they had received from the lawyers and adding, \u2018what can we do? We want to protect ourselves. So far we have only been protecting you, and to-morrow we must know something definite, as we cannot longer run the risk we are doing.\u2019 On the 22nd October: \u2018By our silence we may now be responsible, but this responsibility we should certainly dispute, and you know the only way we could dispute it\u2014but it would be a vile job.\u2019 On the 4th December the plaintiffs wrote defendants a formal letter advising them that they were the holders of a note made by them dated 14th August, 1900, and payable at their branch office on the 17th instant, and requesting defendants to provide for the same. The defendants wrote to Wallace on the 5th December enclosing a copy of this letter, \u2018which we certainly cannot let go unanswered. We have protected you as long as was possible, but must now protect ourselves. We have decided, however, not to reply to this till Monday the 10th instant, thus giving you as long a time as possible, but on that day unless, &c., we will certainly write the bank denying the note.\u2019\n\u201cOn the 10th they did so and advised Wallace, \u2018We have replied to the bank that we have not given such a note.\u2019\n\u201cThe bank manager said that the note came into the bank\u2019s possession on the 14th August, 1900; the discount was not agreed upon till the 15th; that Wallace, i.e., the Phosphate Company, was at once entitled to draw against the proceeds which were placed to his credit before the memo. of the 15th was sent to the defendants; the bank did not treat that as a letter to which they required or expected an answer before giving credit; they sent the letter of the 4th December in consequence of Bonnell having come in and asked them to find out if the note was all right. If they had received on the 17th August such a letter as the defendant wrote them on the 10th December they would have refused to do \u2018any further business with the account.\u2019\n\u201cHe said that Wallace had left the country \u2018about the time the note matured,\u2019 but whether before or after he did not know. The action was not brought until the 23rd of November, 1901.\n\u201cThe learned trial judge found that the note was a forgery by Wallace, but that the defendants were estopped by their conduct from setting this up, and he gave judgment against them for the full amount of the note.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal affirmed said judgment and the defendants appealed to this court. H.S. Osler K.C. for the appellants. When the notice was received on August 16th, the appellants were under no legal obligation to notify the bank as they then could only suspect forgery. When they knew it for a fact the proceeds had all been paid out and the bank was not prejudiced by their silence, Bigelow on Estoppel (5 ed.) p. 595: Viele v. Jadson[2]; McKenzie v. British Linen Co.[3]\nAylesworth K.C. and Milliken for the respondents, referred to Richardson v. Dunn[4]; Wiedemann v. Walpole[5].\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting)\u2014On Thursday, 16th August, 1900, Ewing & Co. (a Montreal firm), received through the post office from a Toronto bank, a notification as follows:\nTORONTO, Aug. 15, 1900.\nYou will please take notice that your note for $2,000, to the Thomas Phosphate Co. falls due at this bank on the 17th December, 1900, and you are requested to provide for the same.\nA.P., Asst. Mgr.\nThe firm had not made any such note, had not authorized it, knew nothing of it, and had no connection or dealings with the Thomas Phosphate Company; and the question presented for decision is: What legal duty towards the bank was imposed upon Ewing & Co., by the receipt of the notification?\nIt is contended that the firm ought immediately to have correctly conceived the whole Toronto situation,\u2014to have divined that the bank had discounted the note (although all they were told was that it was payable at the bank); to have surmised that although the note had been acquired by the bank yet that some of the proceeds were still in hand; and to have infer- red that an immediate letter or telegram to the bank would enable it to retain some of the money.\nUpon such fact and assumption is based the assertion of a legal duty to send the letter or telegram, and a breach of that duty has by the judgment appealed from been declared to have the same effect as if Ewing & Co. had actually signed the note.\nIt is not proved that a letter would have been of any service to the bank. Ewing & Co. received the notification on Thursday, but at what hour of the day I do not know. Mr. Pepler (the bank officer) says that he would \u201creasonably have expected an answer to his notification on the morning of Friday\u201d, but he evidently assumes (1) the infallibility of the course of post, (2) prompt delivery at the Montreal end, and (3) the continued presence in their office of one or both of the members of the Ewing & Co. firm. From a question put to the witness by counsel for the bank I would gather that under certain circumstances a letter mailed in Montreal would not \u201cin course of post\u201d arrive in Toronto until the second day thereafter.\nWe do not know at what hour the mail ought to have arrived in Montreal; at what hour it did arrive; at what hour the notification was received at the office of Ewing & Co., or at what hour it was opened and read. We are uninformed, 100, as to the time of day at which the Montreal mail for Toronto closed. And we are therefore unaware of the amount of time which the firm had within which to determine its course of action with reference to circumstances so unusual as to be outside the experience of almost every business man.\nI am not prepared to say that a merchant must be held (by estoppel) to have signed a promissory note, merely because seeing amongst his letters a notification of a transaction with which he has nothing to do, he does not instantly withdraw attention from his own affairs, no matter how pressing they may be, estimate correctly the danger that somebody else may be in, and fly to the rescue. It has been urged that as a letter might have been too late to save the bank, Ewing & Co. should have sent a telegram, and we have been invited to declare the law to be that without knowing the existence of any pressing necessity for electrical activity, without even knowing that the bank owned the note, Ewing & Co. must pay it because they did not send a telegram, the cost of which the bank would probably have refused to provide had the necessity for it not been apparent to them, that is had the circumstances been at all less peculiar than they happened to be.\nMoreover, although Mr. Pepler tells us that he would have expected an answer on Friday morning, he does not say at what hour, and 11 o\u2019clock might have been too late to be of any use to him or his bank. Four cheques of the Phosphate Company\u2019s were paid on that day, and the first of them completely exhausted the discount of this note.\nI find it, therefore, impossible to say that Ewing & Co. neglected the performance of any duty; or that if they had, even within a few hours, replied to the bank\u2019s notification, the reply would have been of any avail to the bank.\nFor the present I express no opinion upon the question of duty to make any reply whatever to such a notification as we have here; but I desire to say that I am not satisfied that any such duty exists. If it does, then a breach of it would result not only in estoppel, but (in the alternative) in an affirmative action for damages for breach of the duty, and such an action has never yet been heard of. What precisely is this duty to warn of impending danger? I am not under a legal obligation to tell a man that his house is on fire, or that there is gunpowder in a keg upon which he is knocking out his pipe ashes; I am not bound to tell him that there is a gold mine on the farm which he is selling to me at a farm price; or that the machinery which he is bargaining for will not do the work which he expects of it. I am under no duty to tell a banker that the note which he is discounting is a forgery, if my name does not appear upon it. And I am not convinced that the law is otherwise, or that there is any good reason why it should be otherwise, merely because it is my signature and not that of some other person which has been forged. No doubt the remedy by estoppel would be available against me in the latter case and not in the former, but I am not speaking now of remedy, but of legal duty to warn against danger or damage, and I see as much duty in the one case as in the other.\nThere is this distinction between the two cases (and in my view the confusion in the law arises from its neglect) that when it is my signature that is on the note my conduct may amount to an adoption of it, (I would not say a ratification, but an adoption of it,) whereas such a contention would be almost impossible (as against me) were the signature that of some one else.\nI would suggest, therefore, omission (in such cases as that in hand) of the idea of duty and fix the attention upon the question of adoption, as in the case of adoption by a company of an agreement made in its name but prior to its incorporation. And I would scrutinize the proved conduct with a view of ascertaining, not whether there has been a breach of admittedly very ill-defined duty, but whether there has been an adoption of the signature. The more satisfactory of the cases in which estoppel to deny signature has been affirmed will yield the same result by the method which I suggest, and there is here and there in the authorities a recurrence to adoption as the true effective principle. For example\u2014Lord Colonsay said in Boyd v. Union Bank[6] (quoted) in McKenzie v. British Linen Co.[7],\nwhen a party is shewn a bill and makes no objection, and allows the creditor to remain in the belief that it is his signature, he has incurred a ground of liability through the loss incurred by that adoption. That principle might apply even though he was not shewn the bill which is the subject of discussion.\nSee also pp. 92, 99, 109, 110 of the McKenzie Case,7 where the same principle is appealed to; although I must say that the whole case does not leave an impression of any very clear appreciation of the distinction between estoppel, ratification, and adoption.\nIn the present case I see nothing which can be construed into adoption. Clearly Ewing & Co. had no intention of becoming liable on the note, although they seem to have had grave doubts as to what the law would make of the matter. And it is equally clear that the bank did not rely upon the adoption, but upon the genuiness of the signature.\nAlthough, therefore, I would allow the appeal altogether yet I think it proper to add that in no case would I agree that the bank should recover from Ewing & Co. more than it had lost through the firm\u2019s neglect.\nAdmitting, for the moment, the existence of duty to repudiate, the damages for breach of that duty are surely the amount which the bank lost by the absence of the repudiation. But it is said that because the bank sued upon the note and succeeds upon the breach of duty, it is very much better off than if it had sued directly for the breach of duty. I cannot agree to that. (I refer to Ewart on Estoppel ch. 16, where the subject is treated at length). The bank admits that $645, out of the $2,000, was gone before they could, by the first possible mail, have received warning from Montreal, but nevertheless they have recovered against Ewing & Co. that amount as well as the remaining $1,355.\nUpon the same principle if they had only lost one dollar through Ewing & Co. they would have made them pay the other $1,999.\nJudgment for the whole sum would have been quite unobjectionable if Ewing & Co. had adopted the signature: but it cannot be right when their liability proceeds upon breach of duty.\nIt is said, with a show of reason, that the whole amount ought to be adjudged because the holding is that Ewing & Co. are estopped from denying that the note is theirs; that it is therefore theirs; and that they must of course pay it. Estoppel is always based upon change of position, and I do not see why it should be enforced further than necessary to reestablish the status quo ante. Estoppel shuts out the truth in order to do justice. Beyond that it should not go. In some cases no doubt, the previous situation cannot be reproduced, for example where the estoppel effects change of ownership in property. Even in these the law may eventually work out some method of making legal awards correspond to damage done. But there can be no difficulty in such cases as the present, nor any necessity for adding to legal anomalies one which would declare that the amount to which a plaintiff shall be entitled depends entirely upon the form of his pleading: Sue upon a note, when your real cause of action is breach of duty to warn of danger, and you will get $2,000.00. But sue for the breach of duty directly, and you will get $1,355.00 only.\nLord Lyndhurst in Hume v. Bolland[8] at page 138 said:\nIf your situation is not altered you cannot maintain an action. If it is altered must not the amount of damages to be recovered depend upon the extent to which it is altered?\nAny other doctrine would be anomalous and mischievous. (See the question discussed in Ewart on Estoppel, pp. 194-5)\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014We have given to this case all the attention which its importance demanded. It was fully discussed and the written opinions pro and con were duly considered. It has no precedent in this country and it can hardly be said that the few decisions rendered abroad are exactly in point. They are fully reviewed by my learned colleagues, and in the few remarks I propose to make I do not intend to refer to them. The question involved is one altogether of law. The fact that we have not been able to give an unanimous assent to the judgment of the two courts below shows that it is not free from difficulty.\nSpeaking for myself, I cannot satisfy my mind that when a business man, familiar with banking operations, their meaning and scope, is informed, according to banking usages, that his name is being used as maker of a note in a bank, evidently for cash credit either already made or to be made, he is under no obligation to reply promptly, at least within a reasonable time, that it is used without his authority, or even that it is a forgery. It is argued that there is no business relation between him and the bank to create such a duty. I believe, on the contrary, that business relation exists, created without his knowledge, it is true, by force of circumstances, but the introduction of his name, even if unwarranted or forged, brought him into contact with the bank and created business relationship which can end only by repudiation or payment in due time. In such a case every merchant or business man owes some duty to his fellow members of the commercial community. Is he not under obligation to cause no damage by his fault or negligence, either by acts of commission or omission? I have always been under the impression that this elementary principle was held sound in every country, in England as well as everywhere else. I cannot conceive that the appellants ought not to be punished for the omission to do something which a fair and reasonable man, guided by those considerations which regulate the conduct of commercial and even ordinary human affairs, would do. This punishment may in some cases, and always in countries governed by the civil law, consist only in the payment of damages, but according to English law forms an estoppel, which prevents the wrongdoer from disputing his liability for the full amount of the claim, for he is presumed to have acquiesced in it. The rule may look harsh and arbitrary, but I must confess that it is highly moral and eminently healthful and salutary. The appellants at least have no excuse for complaining of the severity of this law. They knew that their duty was to give a prompt reply, namely, on the 16th August, and I should say both by letter and by telegraph or telephone, even if it would cost them a few cents, for the law does not take notice of trifles. De minimis not curat lex. The evidence shows that if they had done so, the loss would have been only partial. Not only were they in fault for not answering the bank, but also, and perhaps more so, for concealing what they knew of the forgery. Their lawyer advised them at the very first to repudiate their signature. They themselves, by telegraph and letter, informed the forger on the 16th of August that they would act at once. They did not do so for a few months; they kept silence with the bank till a few days before the maturity of the note. Why they broke it at such a late hour, when nothing could be done by the bank to protect its position, it is impossible to imagine, if the contention of the appellants be correct that there was no duty for them to speak. They had some reason to expect that the forger would be able to make the loss good; the Thomas Phosphate Company might materialize and come to his assistance, and consequently they limited their exertions to save him, if possible; but, as is usual in similar cases, they were doomed to disappointment and became the victims of their misplaced confidence and exaggerated kindness. They must suffer for the consequences of their conduct, which amounts to fraud in law, for their inaction or action\u2014either word meets the case\u2014is a fraud in law. With the judges of the two courts below, the majority of this court have come to the conclusion that they are estopped from setting up the forgery of their signature, and that they must pay the full amount of the note.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I would have been well content to rest my judgment in this appeal upon the able and clear reasons given by Osler J. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal from which the appeal is taken. As, however, there is a difference of opinion amongst the members of this court I have thought it well to add a few observations of my own. The facts of the case are not in dispute and are stated by Osler J. as follows: One Wallace was the manager of, and perhaps interested in, a business carried on by Walter C. Bonnell under the name of the Thomas Phosphate Company, which, previous to the 14th August, 1900, had done some banking business with the plaintiffs. On the 15th August, Wallace procured the note now sued on to be discounted by the bank for the Phosphate Company and the proceeds were placed to the company\u2019s credit. On the 15th and 16th August checks were issued by the company against the proceeds of the deposit and other small deposits, payment of which left a balance to their credit at the close of business on the 15th of $1,611.55; on the 16th of $1,355, and on the 17th of $84.\nOn the 15th the bank sent a memo. to the defendants, who reside in Montreal, in the following terms; \u201cToronto, August 15th, 1900. You will please take notice that your note for $2,000 to the Thomas Phosphate Company, falls due at this bank on the 17th December, 1900, and you are requested to provide for the same. A.P. Assistant Manager. To Messrs. Ewing & Co., Montreal.\u201d\nThis was received by the defendants on the 16th August. To the bank they made no response, but between themselves and Wallace an active correspondence by telegram and letter was kept up, beginning on the 16th August and ending on the 5th of December; on the defendants\u2019 side at first asking for an explanation \u201cbefore advising bank\u201d and then urgently insisting on the note being taken up; while Wallace\u2019s letters are filled with the usual regrets and excuses for his conduct, and vain promises to settle the note and relieve the defendants\u2019 anxiety.\nOn these facts two questions arise; first, was there any imperative duty on the part of the appellants, Ewing & Co., on the morning of the 16th August, when they received the above letter or notice from the bank, to at once notify the bank that the note was not genuine? And, if not, did such imperative duty arise at any time afterwards, and, if so, when? The appellants strongly contend that at no time did such imperative duty arise but that if they were wrong and it did arise it did not do so until after the 20th or 21st August when they had a personal interview with Wallace who then practically confessed the forgery to them. I am quite at a loss to follow the reasoning which, assuming the duty to exist at all, would postpone it till the 20th or afterwards. It seems to me that if there is a duty at all that duty arose immediately on receipt of the notice from the bank of the 15th August. If, under the circumstances, there was any room for reasonable doubt as to the genuineness of the signature, or any reason to believe that a mistake had been made in the notice which inquiries would clear up, the appellants would have been entitled to the necessary time to make proper inquiries. But it does not appear to me that any such doubts or room for doubts existed. Both William Ewing and James H. Davidson, the only members of the firm of Ewing & Co., were examined at the trial and they both state that they neither of them ever authorized any other person to sign the firm\u2019s name to any note; that they never used or gave any accommodation paper in their business or signed any blank notes, and that the note in question was a forgery. They knew they had never given or authorized the giving of such a note as the bank had advised them of, and the only reason given for not immediately notifying the bank was that given by Mr. Ewing, that he thought it might be a draft made on them and not a note. I cannot myself accept this as the true explanation. The notice says nothing about a draft and does not use any language from which a business man could fairly believe a draft was intended. If it was a mere draft that was intended and not an acceptance of a draft, a notice would not have been sent by the bank but the draft itself would have been forwarded for acceptance. The appellants knew it could not be an acceptance any more than a note for they had never signed nor authorized the signing of either, and the fact that in the telegram sent by them that day to Wallace, the managing clerk of the Phosphate Company, and also in the letter confirming that telegram, they make no reference to any draft or to the pos- sibility of there having been any such mistake made\u2019 but speak of the document held by the bank as a note, and repudiate the fact that the Phosphate Company held any note of theirs, satisfies me that they were not under any doubts or delusions on the subject at all. However, be that as it may, they got a telegraphic answer from Wallace that evening at 6.14 p.m., which could leave no possible doubt in their minds that the document was a note and not a draft, and that it was in the hands of the bank and was, as they knew, a forgery. Assuming for the sake of argument that Ewing & Co. were justified in waiting till they had received Wallace\u2019s answer, they knew on its receipt that the bank, respondent, was in possession of a note of theirs which they must have known was forged for $2,000, and which they had been formally \u201crequested to provide for\u201d at maturity. A whole day had been lost in making a useless inquiry. But even assuming that the duty to notify the bank of the forgery did not arise until the receipt of Wallace\u2019s telegram, what was to have prevented this notice being then sent either by telephone or telegraph. The counsel for the appellant contended that assuming the duty existed or arose on the receipt of the telegram from Wallace, it would have been discharged by the writing of a letter in the ordinary course of mail on the following day the 17th, which could not if written and posted in business hours reach its destination until the 18th when it would be useless as all the proceeds arising from the discount of the forged note had then been paid out by the bank. But I cannot accept any such proposition as that put forward by the appellants\u2019 counsel. Given the existence of an imperative duty; given the fact that it did not arise till after the receipt of Wallace\u2019s telegram, after business hours on the evening of the 16th; I ask on what principle can it be discharged or fulfilled by mail alone. Is there any magic in the \u201cmail\u201d which makes it alone the proper vehicle for transmitting business information? Is there any reason why, the ordinary mail or post having been missed, resort should not be had to the telegraph or in some circumstances the telephone? Between the cities of Montreal and Toronto there existed telephonic and telegraphic communication as well as mail. Is it to be held by the courts that in the present day, where such a proportion of business is carried on by means of the telephone and telegraph, that, in a matter of urgency and moment involving some thousands of dollars, and where a few hours delay might be fatal, resort must not be had to one or other of the speedier methods of communication but must be confined to the mail alone? Is it reasonable that business customs and habits in a matter of this kind should be ignored? I do not think so and am satisfied that if the imperative duty existed at all it should have been discharged on receipt of the bank notice and if delay was sought to get information from the suspected forger then, at the expiration of that delay, notice should have been given to the bank, either by telephone or telegraph, which would have reached them on the morning of the 17th and while the larger part of the proceeds of the note were still lying in the bank and subject to its control.\nMr. H.S. Osler, in his argument for the appellant, laid much stress upon the form and character of the notice sent by the bank to Ewing & Co. and urged that too much importance had been attributed to it by the Court of Appeal. I pass by all technical criticism as to its form and looking at its substance I find it furnishes Ewing & Co. with all possible information they could require as to date, amount, due date, payee, maker, etc., of the note, winding up with a request that they should provide for the same. Nothing is wanting to inform them that a note professing to be theirs was in the hands of the bank and was being treated by them in the ordinary business way as a genuine note, and that the bank looked to them for payment. They knew it was a forgery. As between them and the bank their knowledge was exclusive. Instead of imparting it to the bank on receipt of its letter or notice they enter into prolonged telegraphic, written and personal communications with the forger lasting up to within a few days of the note falling due, when, in reply to the usual notice requesting payment, they, for the first time, repudiate the note. From their silence after the first notice sent them the bank naturally assumed the genuineness of the note and acting on that very natural assumption paid out the larger portion of the proceeds of the discount of the note, all of which would have been saved to them had Ewing & Co. on the 16th, or on the beginning of the business hours of the 17th, given them the information they should have given.\nAgain it is said that this is a suit to prevent a man from speaking the truth and to compel him to pay a note he never made nor authorized. But the answer is simple. The very basis of the doctrine of estoppel is that a man may by his representations or by his silence or his conduct towards his fellow man, if followed by the latter\u2019s consequent loss, prevent himself from setting up that to be true which he had induced another to believe was false or vice vers\u00e2. There would be no wrong in compelling a man to pay a note he had never signed or authorized if he by his representations, or silence, or conduct had led another to part with his money in the belief that the note was genuine.\nThen comes the important question whether there was any duty in the matter at all on the part of Ewing & Co. to give information to the bank of the forgery when they received the notice of the 15th August. It is argued that as there was no business relationship existing between the bank and Ewing & Co. at the time such as that between a bank and one of its ordinary depositors or customers so there was no duty to respond to the bank\u2019s notice. It is true that such a relationship did exist between the parties in the case of the Leather Manufacturers\u2019 Bank v. Morgan[9]. In that case it was laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States that where cheques had been drawn by the plaintiff, a customer in the bank, and after having been fraudulently altered had been paid by the bank and charged up against the plaintiff, if the alterations might have been discovered by the latter by the examination of his pass book and advised of in time to enable the bank to take certain action which might have prevented it sustaining loss and this had not been done he would be estopped from claiming for the sums paid out on the altered cheques. The basis on which the doctrine of estoppel rests is discussed in this case at great length and the rule laid down by Parke B. in Freeman v. Cooke[10], approved of, namely that\nif whatever a man\u2019s real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would take the representation to be true, and believe that it was meant that he should act upon it, and did act upon it as true, the party making the representation would be equally precluded from contesting its truth; and conduct, by negligence or omission when there is a duty cast upon a person, by usage of trade or otherwise, to disclose the truth, may often have the same effect.\nBoth parties profess to rely upon this rule in this case though I cannot find that any one of the limitations mentioned in it express or suggest the existence of the relationship of banker and customer or similar relationship as necessary to create the duty the neglect of which imposes the liability. It speaks of a neglect of duty cast upon a person by the usage of trade or otherwise to disclose the truth. I fail to appreciate the argument which would confine this duty to cases where such relationships already exist as those between banker and customer or seller and buyer. It does seem to me that in a country like Canada where such a large proportion of its business is carried on by credit evidenced by drafts and notes which are discounted by one or other of the chartered banks of the country the usages of trade which create the duty apply to all persons engaged in trade who are notified of the holding by one of these banks of a note or draft professing to be theirs. I cannot believe that such a duty would exist as between the bank and Ewing & Co. if the latter was a regular customer of the former and would not exist otherwise. It seems to me the duty naturally arises out of the usages of trade as they exist. Banks do not confine their discounts to those of their own customers only. It is known to every one engaged in trade that a large part of the bank\u2019s business consists in the discounting for its customers of commercial paper professing to be that of other merchants or traders. And when a business man receives such a notice from a bank as Ewing & Co. did in this case, if such notice contains information of a forgery and fraud being practised upon a bank, in the unauthorized use of the name of the person or persons notified, the latter are bound by every principle of justice and right dealing between man and man, and in accordance with the usages of trade, within reasonable time to give the bank notice of the fraud. Any other rule would seem to me to be fraught with grave danger; would generate want of confidence in the ordinary business relations of life and would offer a premium upon gross business negligence. I think Lord Campbell has expressed the true rule to be followed in Cairncross v. Lorimer[11], at p. 830, in the following terms:\nI am of opinion that, generally speaking, if a party having an interest to prevent an act being done, has full notice of its having been done, and acquiesces in it, so as to induce a reasonable belief that he consents to it, and the position of others is altered by their giving credit to his sincerity, he has no more right to challenge the act, to their prejudice, than he would have had if it been done by his previous license.\nReason and common sense would convince me, if positive authority was wanting, that as between commercial men and banks or other kindred institutions there exists duties with respect to business notices and conditions which have no application to, and are not governed necessarily by, the principles and rules which control in the cases of other letters and notices on private or personal subjects. An example of such letters is to be found in the case of Wiedemann v. Walpole[12]. But the law which justifies and approves of a man ignoring impertinent or threatening letters relating to his private life or moral character, to which he is under no moral or legal obligation to give any answer, necessarily adopts a different rule with respect to ordinary business letters on business matters. Mere silence per se on the part of one who should speak is not, I grant, sufficient as an admission or adoption of liability or as an estoppel to prevent him denying his signature. But such silence coupled with material loss or prejudice to the person who should have been informed and which prompt and reasonable information would have prevented will so operate. Such a person under such conditions comes within the rule that where a man has kept silent when he ought to have spoken he will not be permitted to speak when he ought to keep silent. The case of McKenzie v. British Linen Co.[13] is one where no previous direct business relationship existed between the parties and has been appealed to by both parties as authority for their respective contentions. The actual decision in that case was that McKenzie, who had been sued as an indorser of a note on which his name had been forged, was not liable, though he had remained silent for a fortnight after he had received notice of his name being on the note. But the reason of the House of Lords for so holding was, that the position of the bank was in no way prejudiced or altered during the time McKenzie had remained silent. I think it is quite clear that in the judgment of all of the law lords who delivered opinions in that case that had the position of the bank been materially prejudiced or injured during the time of McKenzie\u2019s silence he would have been held estopped from denying his signature and liable to the bank. The language of Lord Watson, at page 109 seems very clear. He says:\nIt would be a most unreasonable thing to permit a man who knew the bank were relying upon his forged signature to a bill, to lie by and not to divulge the fact until he saw that the position of the bank was altered for the worse. But it appears to me that it would be equally contrary to justice to hold him responsible for the bill because he did not tell the bank of the forgery at once, if he did actually give the information, and if when he did so the bank was in no worse position than it was at the time when it was first within his power to give the information.\nThe reasoning adopted by all of these Law Lords in coming to the conclusion they did in that case convinces me first, that in all such cases the imperative duty of promptly giving notice and repudiating a liability wrongly attempted to be placed upon a man does arise whenever he is informed of the facts; secondly, that failure to discharge it will not necessarily involve liability unless there is also proved the material prejudice which compliance with the duty might have prevented; and thirdly, that where both conditions co-exist, namely, the silence of the person whose duty it is to speak and the material loss or prejudice of the bank or person who should have been notified which might or would have been averted had the notice been promptly given, then the party neglecting his duty is estopped from denying his signature and his liability follows. The extent of that liability has been determined by the Judicial Committee in Ogilvie v. West Australian Mortgage and Agency Corporation[14] as not limited to the actual amount of the loss sustained by the holder of the note but to entitle him to have his plea of estoppel sustained to its full extent. By this decision we are bound however strong the argument may be as to limiting the amount recoverable to the actual loss sustained through the neglect of the party to give the bank notice of the forgery. This case is also most important as determining that the material loss or injury which the bank or holder of the note sued on must shew he has sustained need not necessarily be shewn to be the direct and necessary consequence of the defendant\u2019s act or silence. The Judicial Committee there determines, p. 270, that\nif by keeping silence and allowing the forger to escape from the colony and the jurisdiction of its courts the appellant had violated his duty to the bank, these circumstances would in themselves have been sufficient to shew prejudice entitling the bank to have their plea of estoppel sustained to its full extent.\nThere silence of the person whose duty it was to speak and the loss which might arise to the bank by reason of the forger\u2019s escape had no necessary relation or connection. The escape of the one party was not a necessary consequence of the silence of the other, and yet the Judicial Committee maintained the liability arising from estoppel. Here it is argued that there is no necessary relation or connection between the silence of Ewing & Co. and the paying out of the $1,300 or $1,400 on the 17th. And yet if they had broken their silence and discharged their duty the bank would not have lost the money. I can see no distinction between losing the money in the one case and losing the opportunity of taking proceedings against the forger either civilly or criminally or both in the other. The loss in either case could hardly be said to be the direct and necessary result of the neglect of duty of the defendants. The most that can be said is that if the duty had been discharged the loss would or might have been prevented or averted.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting).\u2014The question which the court is here to decide is one of very great importance, and it is this, whether a person is to be liable to pay a note which he never signed. The facts are practically undisputed. The bank has its head office in Toronto. One Bonnell carried on business in Toronto under the name of the Thomas Phosphate Company. A clerk called Wallace, in the employ of Bonnell, forged the name of the defendants, William Ewing & Co., doing business in Montreal, Quebec, to a promissory note for the sum of $2,000 and discounted it with the bank in Toronto. Wallace had formerly had business relations with the firm of Ewing & Co., and had been discussing with them the formation of a company to take over the assets and good-will of the Thomas Phosphate Company, he, Wallace, hoping to obtain a substantial share of stock in the new company. As I gather from the evidence Ewing & Co. had declined to take stock in the proposed company. On the 15th August the note was discounted at the bank, and the transaction is best stated in the language of the manager:\nQ. The moment you as manager on the 15th agreed with Wallace to discount the note, Wallace could draw against it?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. So that he was entitled to draw against the note. That is to say, credit was given to him on that cheque so that he might draw against that note before this notice, exhibit 2, was sent out by the bank?\u2014A. Yes, before it would leave our office.\nQ. The discount having gone to his credit?\u2014A. Having gone to his credit.\nQ. That exhibit 2 you do not treat in any way as a letter in respect of which you wait for an answer before taking any step?\u2014A. No.\nQ. It is simply a notice?\u2014A. Simply a notice.\nQ. And you did not wait for an answer before giving credit?\u2014A. No.\nQ. You did not communicate with Ewing & Co. before discounting the note?\u2014A. No.\nThe notice referred to is in the following language:\nDOMINION BANK,\nTORONTO, Aug. 15th, 1900.\nYou will please take notice that your note for $2,000 to the Thomas Phosphate Co. falls due at this bank on the 17th Dec, 1900 and you are requested to provide for the same. To Messrs. WM. EWING & CO., A.P.,\nMontreal. Asst. Mgr.\nOn the morning of the 16th August, 1900, Ewing & Co. received by mail this slip and being aware that no note had been given to the Phosphate Company by way of accommodation or otherwise and knowing that Mr. Wallace was connected with the Phosphate Company telegraphed him asking him for an explanation. The telegram is in the following terms:\nG.N.W. Tel. Co., MONTREAL, Aug. 16th, 1900.\nT.C. WALLACE,\nBoard of Trade, Toronto.\nPhosphate Company have no note of ours and before advising bank thought best ask you what it means remember have to act promptly, writing\nWILLIAM EWING & CO.\nTo which Wallace answered as follows: G.N.W.T. Co. 16th August, 1900.\nTo Mr. EWING, from Boston, Mass.\nTelegram in reference to note just received here. I am coming Montreal and will explain why bank has it. Kindly await my return from New York.\nT.C. WALLACE.\nThis telegram was sent from Boston and is marked as not having been delivered in Montreal until 6.40 p.m. on the 16th, and Wallace did not arrive in New York until Sunday, the 19th, when he confessed that the note was a forgery. Wallace threw himself upon the mercy of Ewing & Co. at that time and induced them not to notify the bank, and the bank never were notified until the 10th December, a week before the note fell due, when, in answer to a letter dated December 4th which is in the following terms:\nDOMINION BANK.\nTORONTO, December 4th, 1900.\nMessrs WILLIAM EWING & Co.\nMontreal P.Q.\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014I beg to advise you that we are the holders of a note made by you, dated 14th August, 1900, at four months, in favour of the Thomas Phosphate Co., for $2,000, which is payable at this office on the 17th instant, and shall oblige if you will kindly provide for the same.\nYours truly,\nA. PEPLER,\nRegister. Assistant Manager,\nthey replied as follows:\nMONTREAL, December 10th, 1900.\nDOMINION BANK,\nToronto,\nGENTLEMEN,\u2014We have your letter referring to a note for $2,000 in favour of the Thomas Phosphate Company falling due on the 17th inst, and we beg to inform you that we have not issued the note described.\nYours truly,\nTo the Manager. (Signed) WILLIAM EWING & Co.\nWallace remained in the country for a week or two after the maturity of the note and then went to the United States. There seems to be no question raised that the bank had plenty of opportunity after it obtained knowledge of the forgery to have had him arrested before leaving the country if they desired to do so. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal have held the defendants estopped on the ground that they were under a legal duty to immediately communicate with the bank upon receipt of the slip and that their silence until a week before the maturity of the note operated as an estoppel. The doctrine of estoppel by conduct has been applied under a great diversity of circumstances. Mr. Bigelow in his work on Estoppel, 5 ed. speaking of estoppel arising from silence says:\u2014\nIn like manner, it is settled law that standing by in silence will not bar a man from asserting a title of record in the public registry or other like office, so long as no act is done to mislead the other party; there is no duty to speak in such a case. Thus, a patentee is not bound to warn others whom he may see buying an article which is an infringement on his patent; and this even when he urges the persons to buy his own article in preference as something better. And of course there can be no duty to speak without a knowledge of the \u2018existence of one\u2019s own rights, or of the action about to be taken. Nor can pure silence (i.e. silence without fraud) operate as an estoppel to assert one\u2019s rights over property when the party supposed to be estopped was at the time in possession, for the possession is notice. If it be a case of property sold, the person assuming the right to sell should ordinarily at least have the property in hand.\nThese and many other cases to the same effect proceed upon the ground, of course, that the silence of the party supposed to be estopped to assert his rights was no breach of duty to the person who asserted the estoppel. The latter had not in contemplation of law been misled by the former\u2019s silence. It follows that it is not enough to raise an estoppel that there was an opportunity to speak which was not embraced, there must have been an imperative duty to speak. Nor is any duty generated by the mere fact that a man is aware that some one may act to his prejudice if the true state of thing is not disclosed. To use an apt illustration of one of the judges, a man may become apprised of the fact that his name has been forged to a negotiable instrument, and so become aware that some one may be led to purchase the paper by supposing the signature to be genuine, and yet he is not bound to proceed against the forger or to take any steps to protect the interests of others whose claims he may know nothing of. So long as he is not brought into contact with the person about to act and does not know who that person may be, he is under no obligation to seek him out, or to stop a transaction which is not due to his own conduct, as the natural and obvious result of it; if the party is present at the time of the transaction it may be necessary for him to speak, if speaking would probably prevent the action about to be taken; if absent, his silence (or other conduct) must at least be of a nature to have an obvious and direct tendency to cause the omission or the step taken. Only thus can a duty to speak arise.\nIn this case it is to be observed that there is no pretence upon the part of the manager of the bank that he relied upon anything in the representation by defendants that the note was genuine. He distinctly avers that the slip was not intended as an inquiry as to the genuineness of the note, and also avers that he did not expect an answer to the slip, so that the bank so far as the discount itself of the note is concerned were not misled into such discount by the silence, and it remains to be seen whether the silence of Ewing & Co. misled them to their prejudice in any action which they took after the sending of the slip. The manager had put the proceeds to the credit of the Phosphate Company to be chequed out in the ordinary course and regardless of the sending of the slip and the receipt of any answer to it, and, as I have said, it is not pretended that the paying out of the money subsequently in any sense was affected by not receiving an answer to the slip or a notice from Ewing & Co. as to whether the note was genuine or not. It remains to be seen, then, whether Ewing & Co. were under any legal duty to communicate with the bank either upon receipt of the notice or at any time before the demand was made upon them by the bank as holders of the note for payment on the 4th December, 1900. In the consideration of the question aid will be derived from the examination of some of the cases in which the doctrine of estoppel by silence has been defined and applied. As stated by Lord Ardmillan in Warden v. British Linen Co.[15]:\nIf a party be sued on such a bill, and do not defend himself, that affords a strong presumption of adoption. If he be charged on the bill and do not resist, that is stronger still. If there be an express demand for payment of the bill and no answer is given; if the bill be shewn and the party do not deny his acceptance. * * *\nI see no case in which silence was construed into adoption, where there was no charge, or action, or demand for payment, no question directly put as to the genuineness of the subscription, no shewing of the bill. * * *\nAnd in 1880 the New York Court of Appeals in the case of Viele v. Judson[16], in dealing with the doctrine of silence, after citing Pickard v. Sears[17] and reviewing a number of English and American cases says:\nThese cases, and those of similar character, have been recently reviewed in this court and do not need a detailed examination. In all of them the silence operated as a fraud and actually itself misled. In all there was both the specific opportunity and apparent duty to speak. And in all the party maintaining silence knew that some one was relying upon that silence and either acting or about to act as he would not have done had the truth been told. These elements are essential to create a duty to speak.\nA great number of cases are reviewed in Leather Manufacturers\u2019 Bank v. Morgan,[18]. At page 108 the court says:\n\u201cThe doctrine always presupposes error on one side and fault or fraud upon the other, and some defect of which it would be inequitable for the party against whom the doctrine is asserted to take advantage.\u201d Morgan v. Railroad Co.[19] In Continental Bank v. Bank of the Commonwealth[20], it was held not to be always necessary to such an estoppel that there should be an intention, upon the part of the person making a declaration, or doing an act to mislead the one who is induced to rely upon it. \u201cIndeed, (said Folger, J.), it would limit the rule much within the reason of it if it were restricted to cases where there was an element of fraudulent purpose.\u201d\nAnd again on page 115, speaking of the prejudice, the court says:\nAs the right to seek and compel restoration and payment from the person committing the forgeries was, in itself, a valuable one, it is sufficient if it appears that the bank, by reason of the negligence of the depositor, was prevented from promptly, and, it may be, effectively, exercising it.\nThe two recent leading cases in England are McKenzie v. British Linen Co.[21], and Ogilvie v. West Australian Mortgage and Agency Corporation[22]. In the McKenzie Case21 Lord Blackburn, dealing with the judgment of the Lord President of the court below, after pointing out that he agreed with the language of the Lord President so far as the ratification was concerned, when he comes to deal with the question of estoppel by silence says:\nBut when Lord Deas says: \u201cIn cases of this kind where he has peculiar means of knowledge whether his signature is forged or not, he is not entitled by saying or doing something, or not saying or doing something, to lead his neighbour to think that his signature is genuine to his neighbour\u2019s loss,\u201d he goes further than I am inclined to follow in the words \u201cby not saying and doing something.\u201d And when he says, \u201cthere was here not only a moral but a legal duty on the part of the suspender to have informed the bank that his signature to the first bill was a forgery, and if he had done so there would not have been a second bill,\u201d I not only doubt his position that there was a legal duty then to have informed the bank, but I deny his conclusion of fact. As I have already pointed out, the second bill was uttered to the bank before McKenzie, with the utmost diligence, could have informed the bank that the first was forged. It would be a quite different thing if it were proved that McKenzie knew that the bank had put the second bill with his name on it to Fraser\u2019s credit, and knew that at the time when he had reason to believe that he would be permitted to draw against it. His silence then would certainly prejudice the bank, and would afford very strong evidence indeed that McKenzie for Fraser\u2019s sake thus ratified Fraser\u2019s act for a time; and a ratification for a time would, I think, in point of law operate as a ratification altogether. But if McKenzie (as his case is) first knew that the bank Lad taken the second bill in the face of his forged signature on receiving the intimation of the 19th of July, he knew that the bank were not going to give further credit to Fraser on the faith of that signature, and that all the mischief was already done. I cannot think that even if McKenzie had gone so far in his endeavours to shield Fraser from the consequences of his criminal act as to make himself liable to criminal proceedings for an endeavour to obstruct justice, that would bar him from averring against the bank that the signature was not his.\nAnd Lord Watson in dealing with the Scotch cases expressly adopts the decision in Warden v. British Linen Co.[23] to which I have referred, and points out that mere silence of the defendants in reference to a letter addressed to them, by the bank and informing them of the existence of the bill before it was due did not create any estoppel, and he proceeds to say:\nNone of these decisions appear to me to give the least support to the doctrine that mere silence after intimation or even after demand for payment of the forged bill necessarily implies adoption of a bill by one whose subscriptions to the bill are a forgery,\nand, as I understand, the court distinctly affirmed the doctrine that silence, after mere intimation of the existence of a forged bill, did not, unless there were other circumstances, as I have pointed out, create an estoppel, and even with these circumstances in existence there was no estoppel unless there was prejudice arising to the estoppel asserter.\nI think that in this case there could not be said to be any duty created by the mere intimation which was given by the slip; no question was asked nor was there anything in it which would indicate that the bank were likely to be prejudiced by silence other than the probability of arresting the forger. I think if the bank had written asking for information or in any way intimating that the proceeds were not already paid out, or if Ewing & Co. had any reason to know that the proceeds were not already paid out, that a duty would have arisen, but I adopt the language of Mr. Bigelow nor is any duty generated by the mere fact that a man is aware that some one may act to his prejudice if the true state of things is not disclosed.\nI think it was incumbent upon the bank now asserting the estoppel to have given some reason to Ewing & Co. to suppose that they would be prejudiced by their silence. I adopt the language of the Lord President in the Warden Case[24].\nI can find no instance of the plea of adoption being sustained where there had not been a demand made on the party charged for payment, nor any in which mere silence, apart from any other evidence, was held equivalent to adoption. I think the rule of adoption has gone as far as it should go and that this is not a case for extending it.\nI think that, in any event, until the interview on Sunday 19th Ewing & Co. were not bound to assume a crime had been committed and that their explanation which was adopted by the Court of Appeal that, although they knew that they had not made a note, the slip by mistake or error on the part of the clerk in the bank might refer to an advice of a draft intended to be drawn upon them was reasonable and they were not bound to suppose a crime had been committed; and Wallace\u2019s telegram would certainly lead them to suppose he had a reasonable explanation and that they were justified in waiting until Sunday the 19th, and at that time any telegram or other notice at the bank would have been quite ineffective. It was not pretended that the bank was in any worse position as to arrest by not receiving notice until the 10th December.\nI refer also to the definition of estoppel and the necessity for a person asserting it to bring himself within the strict doctrine of it to The Peoples\u2019 Bank of Halifax v. Estey[25]. It seems to me that even the extreme altruistic view referred to by Mr. Ewart in his work on Estoppel, page 38, does not justify acourt in making a man pay a note which he did not sign when the person who discounted the note relied entirely for the genuineness of the signature upon the representation of the party discounting it and did not communicate, in any way intending or relying upon such communication, with the party sought to be charged.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nKILLAM J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be dismissed.\nFor the reasons so well stated by Mr. Justice Osler the case appears to me to come directly within the principle upon which silence under certain circumstances gives rise to an estoppel.\nIt was not a case in which the defendants had merely learned of the existence of a note on which their signature had been placed without authority, and had cause to apprehend only that some unknown person might possibly advance money without notice of the falsity of the signature, which is the case put in Mr. Bigelow\u2019s work.\nThe bank directly notified them that their note would fall due at its office on a certain date and requested them to provide for the same. This distinctly implied that the bank had an interest, either of its own or on behalf of some one else, in the payment of the note and in its genuineness.\nWhile there was no intimation that the bank had acquired or was proposing to acquire the note for value, the defendants, as men of business, would know that the bank might have discounted the note and have the proceeds still at the customer\u2019s credit, or that it might make advances upon it. They would know that an immediate repudiation would enable the bank to withhold payment of any portion of the proceeds not actually paid out or of any sums not already ad- vanced. They knew that they had made no such note, that they had given no authority for the signature. They could at once repudiate it, and they did so in their telegram to Mr. Wallace. No further information was necessary for that purpose.\nWhile the bank manager placed the proceeds to the credit of the customer without inquiry, and took no precaution against their being paid out before he could hear from the defendants, the bank did act upon the defendants\u2019 silence in the sense that it did what, it should properly be inferred, it would not have done if the defendants had at once denied the signature; it allowed the balance of the proceeds to be withdrawn.\nThe decision in McKenzie v. British Linen Co[26], proceeded distinctly upon the view that all the mischief was done before either bill could have been repudiated. But I think that sufficient appears to show that the learned Lords would have been of the opposite opinion if the proceeds had remained at the customer\u2019s credit sufficiently long to have enabled the repudiation to be communicated before their withdrawal Lord Selborne, L C., said, (p. 92):\u2014\nThere is no principle on which the appellant\u2019s mere silence for a fortnight, during which the position of the respondents was in no way altered or prejudiced, can be held to be an admission or adoption of liability, or to estop him from now denying it.\nLord Blackburn said (p. 101):\u2014\nCertainly I think that his not telling the bank on the 15th of July nor till the 29th of July that it was a forgery, and so letting them continue in the belief that it was genuine, if he had not induced it could not so preclude him if, as I think was clearly the fact here, the bank neither gave fresh credit in the interval nor lost any remedy which if the information had been given earlier they might have made available.\nAnd Lord Watson said (p. 109):\u2014\nIt would be a most unreasonable thing to permit a man who knew the bank were relying upon his forged signature to a bill to lie by until he saw that the position of the bank was altered for the worse. In the interests of business morality, I think that the conclusion of the Court of Appeal upon this point should be supported. It is well warranted by the doctrines laid down in Freeman v. Cooke[27]. It does not appear to me to be opposed to any previous judicial decision or even to judicial opinion directly applicable.\nAs the appellant\u2019s counsel has expressly abstained from questioning the conclusion that the estoppel, if existing, must apply to the full amount of the note, I say nothing upon that point.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Mulock, Mulock, Thomson & Lee.\n[1] 7 Ont.

The deed had been executed before Ma\u00eetre Bastien, Notary Public, in 1893, for $3,500, the amount of a loan made through his ministry with interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, payable semi-annually, and remained in his custody as a member of the notarial profession of the Province of Quebec, under the provisions of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, articles 3660 to 36 5. The property, subsequently, passed through various hands until it was purchased by one of the defendants In January, 1901, the action was brought by the plaintiff for the full amount of the loan and a portion of the interest accrued. On dilatory exception the vendors were called into the suit, en garantie and en arri\u00e8re garantie, and, thereupon, the appellant, Gervais, intervened as arri\u00e8re-garant, alleging payment of the amount of principal and interest on the 8th of July, 1897, producing, at the same time, an authentic copy of deed of discharge of the mortgage purporting to be signed by the plaintiff and executed before said Bastien as a notary-public. The plaintiff denied her signature to the discharge and took proceedings by improbation to have the discharge declared false, forged and null and alleging, further, that she had never received the money and that the debt had never been satisfied by payment or otherwise nor any acquittance given therefore.\nThe defendant did not contest the moyens de faux, but they were contested by the intervenant who alleged, in substance, that Bastien was the son-in-law of the plaintiff, with whom he resided; that he was her confidential adviser and .counsellor; administered her affairs; loaned her capital, including the amount of the obligation in question; received her revenues and interest, including the interest on the amount of the loan in dispute; gave all the necessary receipts and discharges with her assent, express and implied, and that, for ten years proceeding his death, Bastien had been her agent for all such purposes with her express and tacit authorization.\nOn issue joined, on the contestation, the Superior Court, on 21st March, 1902, maintained the plaintiffs action and the inscription en faux, set aside the discharge as false and dismissed the intervention. An appeal to the Court of King's Bench was dismissed by the judgment now appealed from.\nThe evidence shewed that Bastien was residing, not with the plaintiff, but in the City of Montreal, at the time of the alleged discharge of the mortgage, and, shortly before his death, which occured in November, 1899, he confessed that he had received the money in question and forged the discharge. At the time the money was paid to Bastien by a brother notary named Houl\u00e9, in July, 1897, the principal secured by the mortgage was not due, the term having, then, several years still to run. The circumstances under which Bastien had been acting for the plaintiff as her notary and, occasionally as the collector of rents and interest falling due, from time to time, are shewn by quotations from the evidence in the judgments now reported, which also state the questions raised on the appeal.\nBeaudin K. C. and Gervais K. C. for the appellants. The evidence adduced establishes that Bastien had the plaintiff's mandate to receive the principal secured by the mortgage in question. He had from time to time received the installments of interest as they fell due and was held out to the public generally as the plaintiffs attorney in fact, the collector of her rents, interest and revenues and the general manager of her ] business affairs, for many years anterior to and at the time of the payment as well as for several years after the payment had been made and the mortgage satisfied. It is usual and customary, in the Province of Quebec, that the instrumenting notary, who has the custody of the securities for loans made through his ministration, receives the interest and principal of loans made for his clients. Plaintiff admits, in her evidence, that he was authorized to draw all her moneys and reimburse them to her. The plaintiff is responsible for the fraud and forgery of her agent. Arts. 1728 to 1731 C. C.; Banque Nationale v. Banque de la Cit\u00e9 ([1]); Pand Fr. vo. \"Faux Incident\" no. 708; The payment was valid under art. 1144 C. C., although the discharge might be, as a fact, a forgery. The written discharge is a mere formality for the purposes of registration and radiation of the mortgage; the actual payment was a satisfaction of the debt.\nTacit mandate may be proved by parol testimony. The judge of the Superior Court, at the trial, properly admitted such testimony and there was no objection thereto made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. Leroux v. Monnier ([2]); Michel v. Gaslineau ([3]); see also, notes of Labb\u00e9, S. Y. '76, 1, 401-402. The provisions of the Code as to the admission of parol testimony are not rules of public order and, consequently, the court cannot of its own motion raise such objections on behalf of interested parties. There has been, by plaintiff's admissions, a commencement of proof in writing; art. 316 C.P.Q.; and the parol testimony was regularly admitted under any circumstances. Schwersenski v. Vineberg ([4]); Williams v. Wilcox ([5]); Bain v. Whitehaven & Furness Junction Railway Co. ([6]); Macdougall v. Knight ([7]); Guerin v. Fox ([8]); Low v.

II, no. 292; Colmet de Santerre, t. 5, no. 325, bis 11.\nWe contend, therefore, that the judgments of both courts below are against the evidence, and in opposition to the declared law and the constant jurisprudence on the subject matter in dispute.\nLafleur K.C. and Ferguson for the respondent. There is no evidence to shew that, in any case, there was authority given to Bastien to receive or gr\u00e0nt acquittances for capital sums invested. Most certainly he had no authority to withdraw investments before maturity of the loans. Plaintiff's evidence clearly shews that the greatest authority ever given to Bastien was to receive rents and instalments of interest falling due from time to time and, further, it appears that the rents and interest invariably reached the hands of the plaintiff up to the time of Bastien's death. Nothing occurred to create suspicion or give her warning of the fraud he had committed. Neither the mortgagor nor his representatives nor the notary Houl\u00e9, who is alleged to have made the payment, thought it necessary to advise the plaintiff that such a payment had been made. If any such payment was made to Bastien then he became the agent of the party who made the payment for the purpose of transmitting the funds to the plaintiff. Consequently, the party who so constituted him the agent to make such payment to the plaintiff must suffer the loss resulting from his fraud. The good faith of the plaintiff throughout is abundantly manifest. There is no question as to credibility involved in the appreciation of the evidence. The character of Bastien as a notary cannot, alone, give rise to any presumption as to a tacit mandate and there is no proof to substantiate any assent by the plaintiff. The payment was not made to Bastien as a mandatary with authority to receive it, but he was trusted by the notary Houl\u00e9 to hand it to the plaintiff and obtain the necessary discharge from her, personally, in order the mortgage might be discharged and radiated by registration.

The mandate must be strictly interpreted; art. 1704 CO.; 27 Laurent no. 438; and at the time of the alleged payment the capital was not yet due. Even if it might be inferred that there was some sort of general mandate, these peculiar circumstances would prevent any presumption of authority on the part of Bastien to receive the money for the plaintiff at a place where it was not payable according to the terms of the mortgage and before maturity. 27 Laurent no. 419; Browne v.

Neither this indorsement nor the plaintiff's evidence can amount to a commencement of proof in writing sufficient to admit parol testimony under the provisions of the Civil Code, art. 1234. Neither can the forged discharge avail for that purpose; Durocher v. Durocher ([16]). The provisions of the Code excluding parol testimony except in the cases mentioned in the article referred io are regulations of public order and, even in the absence of objection, must be judicially, noticed by the courts.

C'\u00e9tait d\u00e9cider que Bastien \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir un paiement qu'il n'a pas re\u00e7u; car s'il n'est pas prouv\u00e9 l\u00e9galement qu'il l'a re\u00e7u, c'est tout comme s'il n'y en avait aucune preuve quelconque.\nLes consid\u00e9rants de la cour d'appel se lisent comme suit :\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il n'appert pas de la preuve faite que le nomm\u00e9 Bastien, notaire, auquel les appelants all\u00e8guent dans leur r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en faux avoir pay\u00e9 le montant de la dite obligation ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir ce paiement pour elle et d'en donner quittance :\nConsid\u00e9rant que la preuve faite \u00e0 l'appui de cette all\u00e9gation de paiement par les appelants au dit Bastien, est contraire \u00e0 la loi, et \u00e0 l'article 1233 du code civil, et qu'il n'appert pas que l'intim\u00e9e en ne s'objectant pas \u00e0 cette preuve ait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de faire telle objection au cours du proc\u00e8s; confirme le dispositif * * *\nLa cour d'appel a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 avec la cour sup\u00e9rieure;\u20141. qu'il n'y a pas de preuve l\u00e9gale du paiement \u00e0 Bastien; et 2., contrairement \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure, que Bastien n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir le paiement qu'il n'a pas re\u00e7u ou dont il n'y a pas de preuve l\u00e9gale.\nL'un ou l'autre de ces consid\u00e9rants \u00e9tait suffisant pour rejeter l'appel du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure. Et nous nous serions abstenus de d\u00e9cider inutilement que Bastien \u00e9tait ou n'\u00e9tait pas l'agent de la demanderesse, si nous avions pu admettre avec la cour d'appel qu'il n'y a pas au dossier de preuve l\u00e9gale du paiement que l'intervenant all\u00e8gue lui avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait comme agent de la demanderesse. Mais le devoir nous incombe de d\u00e9cider qu'il y a erreur dans le motif bas\u00e9 sur ce que la prohibition de la preuve testimoniale d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par l'article 1233 du code civil est d'ordre public. La question est controvers\u00e9e. Les autorit\u00e9s d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 et de l'autre sont nombreuses. On les trouve, compil\u00e9es dans Sirey, Code Annot\u00e9, (ed. 1901), sous l'art. 1341. On peut y ajouter, Thwaites v. Coulthurst ([23]); Guerin v. Fox ([24]); Schwersenski v. Vineberg ([25]); Dali. 93, 1, 445; et la note de l'arr\u00eatiste, S. V. 93, 1, 285, et la note de l'arr\u00eatiste, S. V. 43, 1, 403; S. Y. 79, 1, 213, et l'annotation.\nNous sommes aussi d'avis qu'une partie qui assiste \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate et n'objecte pas \u00e0 une preuve ill\u00e9gale offerte par la partie adverse ne peut ensuite se pr\u00e9valoir de l'ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de cette preuve: Si l'objection eut \u00e9t\u00e9 prise lorsque la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte, il est possible qu'un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit ([26]), une preuve \u00e9crite compl\u00e8te peut-\u00eatre, e\u00fbt pu \u00eatre fait. Mais tendre un pi\u00e8ge \u00e0 son adversaire, \u00e9viter soigneusement de le mettre sur ses gardes, afin d'invoquer contre lui plus tard une telle ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 quand il ne lui sera plus possible d'y rem\u00e9dier, ou afin de permettre \u00e0 la cour de le faire d'office, comme a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par la cour sup\u00e9rieure dans l'instance, c'est ce qui ne pourrait \u00eatre permis. Il serait oiseux de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici les arguments en faveur du point de vue que nous d\u00e9cidons \u00eatre la loi sur les deux branches de la question, Il me suffit de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux commentateurs cit\u00e9s au Code-Sirey sous l'article pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\nNous sommes donc d'avis que le paiement \u00e0 Bastien est clairement et l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9.\nEn \u00e9tant venus \u00e0 cette conclusion, il nous faut adjuger sur l'autre motif du jugement de la cour d'appel, celui bas\u00e9 sur le d\u00e9faut de pouvoir chez Bastien de recevoir ce paiement. Sur ce point, nous sommes d'avis qu'il n'y a pas erreur dans ce jugement. Bastien a agi sans autorisation. Le dispositif en sera donc confirm\u00e9. Mon coll\u00e8gue Monsieur le Juge Girouard dira les raisons de la cour sur cette partie de la cause. Nous y concourons tous sans r\u00e9serve.\nL'appel est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014En commen\u00e7ant les quelques observations que je me propose de faire, il n'est pas sans \u00e0 propos de reproduire ce que dit Laurent au tome 17e. n. 531:\nLe notaire a-t-il mandat tacite de recevoir le paiement au nom de de son client? En droit, la question n'est gu\u00e8re douteuse; si elle a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 de nombreux proc\u00e8s, c'est par suite de l'imprudence des d\u00e9biteurs. Ils s'imaginent que le notaire qui vend a aussi le droit de toucher le prix; en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le notaire ne fait que pr\u00eater son minist\u00e8re pour la vente, c'est le vendeur qui seul a qualit\u00e9 de toucher le prix, ou Je mandataire \u00e0 qui il a donn\u00e9 pouvoir de recevoir pour lui (art. 1239). En fait, ces d\u00e9bats deviennent tous les jours plus fr\u00e9quents : depuis que les notaires deviennent banquiers, sp\u00e9culateurs, agioteurs, les faillites abondent; et le d\u00e9biteur qui a pay\u00e9 irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement entre les mains du notaire, oblig\u00e9 de payer une seconde fois \u00e0 son vendeur, en est r\u00e9duit \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la faillite comme cr\u00e9ancier de celui qui a tromp\u00e9 sa confiance.\nLes notaires de la province de Qu\u00e9bec sont meilleurs que ceux dont parle Laurent, les notaires de France et de Belgique, Rarement ils faillissent au devoir et \u00e0 la probit\u00e9, dans les grandes villes quelquefois, \u00e0 la campagne presque jamais. Leur ambition supr\u00eame, c'est de devenir non pas banquier, mais r\u00e9gistrateur ou protonotaire. Cependant, lorsqu'il arrive des d\u00e9faillances et des d\u00e9falcations, ce sont toujours des d\u00e9sastres pour un grand nombre. Le public s'imagine que l'\u00e9tude du notaire instrumentant est un bureau officiel des consignations. Il d\u00e9couvre son erreur, mais trop tard. Il est bon de rappeler d'abord ce que la loi entend par notaire. \"Les notaires\", dit l'article 3607 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec,\nsont des officiers publics dont la principale fonction est de r\u00e9diger et recevoir des actes et contrats auxquels les parties doivent ou veulent faire donner le caract\u00e8re d'authenticit\u00e9.\nC'est la d\u00e9finition du droit fran\u00e7ais, 19 Laurent, n. 102; Gilbert sur Sirey, art. 1317,\nFuzier-Herman et Baudry-Lacantinerie ont r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise sur le sujet; on y trouvera une liste compl\u00e8te des autorit\u00e9s et il est remarquable qu'elles sont presqu'unanimes en faveur du cr\u00e9ancier et contre le d\u00e9biteur. Il n'est donc pas sans int\u00e9r\u00eat de noter ici ce qu'ils enseignent et l\u00e0-dessus il me suffira de citer l'un de ces jurisconsultes, Baudry-Lacantinerie, Obl., (\u00e9d. 1902), no. 1441, 1442:\n1441. Il n'est pas contestable, (dit-il) que les notaires n'out pas en cette seule qualit\u00e9, pouvoir de toucher ce qui est d\u00fb \u00e0 leurs clients.\nAinsi le notaire qui passe un acte de vente n'a pas par cela seul mandat de toucher le prix au nom du vendeur. Il en est ainsi m\u00eame lorsque Pacte de vente porte que le prix sera pay\u00e9 en l'\u00e9tude du notaire. Cette indication n'a pas d'autre but que de d\u00e9terminer le lieu o\u00f9 le paiement doit \u00eatre fait. Cela suffit d'ailleurs pour qu'elle ait sa raison d'\u00eatre, car elle peut donner plus de facilit\u00e9s au d\u00e9biteur pour payer ou au cr\u00e9ancier pour recevoir.\nMais rien ne s'oppose \u00e0 ce qu'on donne \u00e0 un notaire, comme \u00e0 toute autre personne, le mandat de toucher, soit expr\u00e8s, soit tacite. Seulement, pour qu'un notaire soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme constitu\u00e9 mandataire \u00e0 cet effet, il faut qu'il n'y ait aucun doute sur la volont\u00e9 des parties a cet \u00e9gard.\nQuelquefois, dans la pratique, le d\u00e9biteur apporte les fonds au notaire qui se charge de les transmettre au cr\u00e9ancier. En pareil cas, c'est le d\u00e9biteur qui donne un mandat tacite au notaire. Il s'ensuit que, si ce dernier tombe en d\u00e9confiture avant que les fonds soient aux mains du cr\u00e9ancier, la perte est pour le d\u00e9biteur.\n1442. Le mandat de vendre ne renferme pas celui de recevoir le paiement du prix, car on doit interpr\u00e9ter les mandats strictement.\nEn note, l'\u00e9minent commentateur ajoute :\nIl en est de m\u00eame lorsqu'un acte de vente ou d'adjudication devant notaire renferme, outre cette stipulation que le prix sera pay\u00e9 en l'\u00e9tude de notaire, une \u00e9lection de domicile faite par le vendeur dans cette \u00e9tude pour l'ex\u00e9cution de l'acte.

Le fait qu'au moment o\u00f9 le paiement a eu lieu le notaire avait en ses mains la grosse du titre n'implique pas davantage le mandat de recevoir le paiement. Douai, 29 nov. 1849, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\nLa jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec n'offre pas de nombreux exemples de vols ou d'escroqueries pratiqu\u00e9s par des notaires sur leurs clients; cependant dans les quelques causes qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es, les tribunaux semblent avoir appliqu\u00e9 les m\u00eames principes. Low v. Bain, en appel, 1886, ([27]); Webster v. Dufresne, ([28]) en appel, 1887, Cloran v. McClanaghan ([29]) C. S. 1885; Lauriault v. Lapointe ([30]) C. S. 1899; Beauchamp, Code Annot\u00e9, art. 1144.\nMaintenant, quels sont les laits dans l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupent? Bien entendu, le notaire n'\u00e9tait pas porteur d'une procuration notari\u00e9e ou m\u00eame \u00e9crite. Aucun \u00e9crit de la demanderesse ne constate la position \u2022de Bastien, si ce n'est qu'il \u00e9tait son notaire et avait pass\u00e9 l'hypoth\u00e8que en question et une prolongation du terme de paiement, toutes deux sign\u00e9es par la demande- resse. Avant de recourir \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale, il fallut donc l'examiner, afin d'obtenir au moins un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit. Elle fut soumise \u00e0 un examen s\u00e9v\u00e8re et tr\u00e8s long, non seulement dans cette instance mais d'autres causes; elle fut appel\u00e9e \u00e0 expliquer ses r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques, entre d'autres parties et apparemment sur des contestations diff\u00e9rentes. Elle fut examin\u00e9e et r\u00e9-examin\u00e9e, transquestionn\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs reprises par plusieurs avocats se relevant tour \u00e0 tour, jusqu'\u00e0 tel point que son avocat d\u00fbt protester, mais sans succ\u00e8s, sur la r\u00e9ouverture de l'enqu\u00eate, \"after being closed and resumed and closed again,\" pour me servir de ses expressions. Ses deux d\u00e9positions couvrent 78 pages du dossier imprim\u00e9. Il n'est pas surprenant que la pauvre femme, harcel\u00e9e et tortur\u00e9e\u2014le mot n'est pas exag\u00e9r\u00e9, elle fut m\u00eame interrog\u00e9e sans raison sur sa vie priv\u00e9e\u2014et d'ailleurs malade et souffrante, ait eu des moments de faiblesse, de mauvaise humeur, d'impatience et m\u00eame d'indignation, ait r\u00e9pondu quelque fois avec h\u00e9sitation ou apr\u00e8s des arr\u00eats prolong\u00e9s, et donn\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses vives, irr\u00e9fl\u00e9chies ou confuses sur des circonstances plus ou mois pertinentes et \u00e9trang\u00e8res, ou m\u00eame sur sa position l\u00e9gale avec son notaire. Ce r\u00e9sultat n'aide l'appelant en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit qui doit se trouver dans ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e9crites et non ailleurs, pas m\u00eame dans le ton ou la mani\u00e8re de les donner, particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu'il n'y a pas d'autre preuve \u00e0 invoquer et qu'il n'y a pas mauvaise foi. Il ne s'agit pas en effet de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin compar\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre t\u00e9moin que l'on oppose. Il n'y a pas d'autre t\u00e9moin qui la contredise. Ses r\u00e9ponses se soutiennent; elles sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement cat\u00e9goriques et pr\u00e9cises; pas une seule n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en vertu des articles 366 et 368 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile; enfin, elle affirme cent fois que Bastien n'\u00e9tait que son notaire, sans autorisation pour recevoir ses capitaux. Cette preuve, qui est d'ailleurs indivisible aux termes de l'article 1243 du Code Civil, amend\u00e9 en 1897 par 60 Vict. ch. 50, ne peut servir de commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit. Elle \u00e9tablit tout le contraire.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance constate dans le texte de son jugement\nque la demanderesse a admis devant le tribunal que le dit notaire Bastien avait droit de retirer ses capitaux plac\u00e9s par son entremise, ainsi que les int\u00e9r\u00eats,\nsans indiquer o\u00f9 se trouve cette admission. La minorit\u00e9 de la cour d'appel attache de l'importance \u00e0 ce consid\u00e9rant de la cour sup\u00e9rieure, \" qui a vu l'intim\u00e9e et l'a entendue rendre son t\u00e9moignage.\" Dans les circonstances ce fait n'a aucune importance, comme nous l'avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 observ\u00e9. Aussi, la majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'appel est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre conclusion, et nous acceptons son jugement sur ce point :\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il n'appara\u00eet pas de la preuve faite que le nomm\u00e9 Chs. Eug. Bastien, notaire, auquel les appelants all\u00e8guent dans leur r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en faux, avoir pay\u00e9 le montant de la dite obligation, ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 recevoir ce paiement pour elle et d'en donner quittance.\nL'appelant invoque des r\u00e9ponses comme les suivantes pour \u00e9tablir le paiement de la somme pay\u00e9e avec l'autorisation de l'intim\u00e9e :\nQ. He was authorised to get the money provided he reimbursed you?\nA. Yes, like every notary.\nQ. He was authorised to get all the money you had? A. I gave him no authorisation at all, I lent him the money and I expected to get it back when I asked for it.\nC'est une simple opinion l\u00e9gale qu'elle exprime sur la nature de ses relations avec son notaire. L'acte d'obligation d\u00e9montre que l'argent fut pr\u00eat\u00e9 non pas au notaire, mais \u00e0 Lavigne, l'auteur de l'appelant.\nEt ailleurs :\nQ. Provided Bastiein had been honest throughout his life, all the payments made to him for you would be good payments?\nA. Well, I suppose so, if he were honest.\nQ. Provided Bastien would have given you back the money, it would have been a straight forward payment, and a good valid payment?\nA. Yes, I suppose so, as far as I understand the business.\nC'est encore une opinion qu'elle exprime, et elle avait raison. La remise de l'argent \u00e0 la demanderesse aurait en effet \u00e9t\u00e9 un paiement effectif, non seulement en affaires, mais en droit, autoris\u00e9 ou non, aux termes de l'article 1144 du Code Civil. Partout ailleurs, elle ne cesse de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter que Bastien \u00e9tait simplement son notaire et qu'il n'a jamais eu pouvoir de sa part de retirer ses capitaux. Presqi 'au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 elle donnait l'appr\u00e9ciation de sa position en affaires, u as I understand the business\" elle r\u00e9pondait fermement :\nA. He was my notary, and did what a notary does under the circumstances, and no more or less.\nNous sommes d'avis que non seulement ses d\u00e9positions ne nous fournissent pas une preuve compl\u00e8te du paiement et du pouvoir du notaire de le recevoir, comme l'affirment les juges dissidents, mais qu'elles sont insuffisantes m\u00eame pour \u00e9tablir un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit. L'endossement du ch\u00e8que par Bastien peut bien faire un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit du paiement contre lui ou ses h\u00e9ritiers, mais non contre la demanderesse, qui nie son autorit\u00e9 de recevoir le capital de cette obligation ou de toute autre obligation et jusqu'au moment de sa mort ignorait le fait m\u00eame du paiement. Si l'autorisation \u00e9tait \u00e9tablie, cet endossement servirait probablement de commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit du paiement contre elle. La preuve au dossier a soulev\u00e9 devant les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs quelques questions de proc\u00e9dure inportantes en pratique qui sont discut\u00e9es par mon savant coll\u00e8gue le juge en chef et au sujet desquelles je n'entends pas dire autre chose que je concours enti\u00e8rement dans, son opinion.\nMais supposons qu'il y ait commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit et du paiement de l'hypoth\u00e8que et du pouvoir du notaire, cette preuve a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e? La demanderesse le nie et il n'y a pas un seul t\u00e9moin qui la contredise sur ce point. Tout ce qui est prouv\u00e9 c'est que le notaire, comme il arrive souvent, sinon presque toujours dans de pareils cas, \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 par la demanderesse de lui trouver des placements, de passer ses obligations en son nom, d'en recevoir les int\u00e9r\u00eats et m\u00eame de recevoir par occasion les loyers apport\u00e9s \u00e0 son bureau pour elle; c'est dans ce sens qu'il \u00e9tait son homme d'affaires et non autrement. Ces pouvoirs n'impliquent pas celui de recevoir les capitaux et la demanderesse jure qu'elle n'a lui jamais donn\u00e9 ce pouvoir. Jamais il n'a re\u00e7u les capitaux pr\u00eat\u00e9s, \u00e0 sa connaissance du moins. Peut-on dire que c'est la preuve qu'exige Baudry-Lacantinerie, savoir, \" qu'il n'y ait aucun doute sur la volont\u00e9 des parties \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard?\" Mais il y a plus. Il y a preuve \u00e9crite authentique et inconi estable qui corrobore parfaitement les dires de la demanderesse sous serment.\nD'abord, ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 lors du paiement fait par Gervais d\u00e9montre clairement que le d\u00e9biteur, Gervais, agissant par son notaire Houle, consid\u00e9rait la demaderesse comme seule capable de recevoir et de donner quittance. C'est cette quittance qu'il exigea et ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s son enregistrement que l'argent fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 entre les mains de Bastien, qui se chargea pour lui de le remettre \u00e0 la demanderesse. S'il f\u00fbt agent dans cette affaire, ce fut de Gervais, qui, par l'entre- mise d\u00e9 Houle, l'a charge de remettre les deniers \u00e0 la demanderesse. Le notaire Houl\u00e9 explique le paiement comme suit:\nQ. Pourquoi avez-vous remis ce ch\u00e8que \u00e0 M. Bastien?\nR. C'est parce que je ne pouvais pas voir Mme. McCarthy.\nQ. Pourquoi ne pouviez-vous pas la voir?\nR. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 au bureau de M. Bastien et M. Bastien m'a dit que Mme. McCarthy \u00e9tait malade et que je pouvais payer, qu'il \u00e9tait son charg\u00e9 d'affaires.\nObject\u00e9 \u00e0 cette preuve comme ill\u00e9gale.\nObjection maintenue.\nQ. A qui avez-vous remis ce ch\u00e8que?\u2014R.\u2014A M. Bastien, le notaire.\nQ. Pourquoi avez-vous remis ce ch\u00e8que au notaire Bastien?\u2014R. Parce que j'\u00e9tais sous l'impression, moi, qu'il \u00e9tait son charg\u00e9 d'affaires.\nEt plus loin il ajoute :\nR. D'apr\u00e8s M. Bastien, Mme. McCarthy \u00e9tait malade, j'ai cru qu'il serait plus facile de voir M. Bastien. Je ne connaissais pas M. Bastien comme un fausseur, moi :\u2014Je le connaissais comme correct honn\u00eate homme.\nLe notaire Houl\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime d'une trop grande confiance dans l'honneur professionnel de son confr\u00e8re et c'est son client qui doit souffrir la perte r\u00e9sultant de son imprudence et non la demanderesse. Il ne songea m\u00eame pas \u00e0 endosser le ch\u00e8que payable \u00e0 l'ordre de la demanderesse ou \u00e0 la notifier du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ce paiement que le notaire s'appropria, tout en continuant de lui solder les int\u00e9r\u00eats jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e8s de sa mort survenue presque subitement une couple d'ann\u00e9es plus tard.\nEnfin, elle fut si particuli\u00e8re dans cette transaction qu'elle stipula dans l'acte d'obligation que la somme pr\u00eat\u00e9e serait remboursable \" en sa demeure \", et non en l'\u00e9tude du notaire.\nN'oublions pas encore que le paiement fut fait avant l'expiration du d\u00e9lai, qui dans un cas comme celui-ci existe non seulement en faveur du d\u00e9biteur, mais aussi en faveur du cr\u00e9ancier vu le taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, 6 par 100, taux qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas toujours facile d'obtenir. Cela est si vrai que dans l'esp\u00e8ce, le remboursement fut fait en grande partie par un nouvel emprunt \u00e0 5\u00bd pour cent au Cr\u00e9dit Foncier.\nBastien, e\u00fbt-il un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de recevoir les capitaux de la demanderesse, n'aurait pu sans autorisation sp\u00e9ciale recevoir ce paiement par anticipation. Il n'est que juste que le dommage, caus\u00e9 par un paiement, ni convenu, ni autoris\u00e9 ou ratifi\u00e9, tombe sur la partie en faute.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nDAVIES.\u2014I am of the opinion, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Girouard, that this appeal should be dismissed.\nNESBITT J.\u2014The main point argued was, as to the right of Bastien to bind the plaintiff, assuming the receipt by him of the money.\nArticles 1727,1730,1731 C. C. seem to express the law as it has long been settled under English law, and in the United States. See Story on Agency, s. 443. But these must be read in this case with articles 1144, 1152, 1163 and 1703 C. C. the latter of which seems to concisely state the result of the cases under English law. The stipulation of time in a mortgage must, I think, from our knowledge of affairs, be said to be in favour of the creditor. Bonds, debentures and mortgages for long terms are always sought for by lenders as more valuable than those for short periods, and Parliament has interfered in favour of mortgagors by giving them the privilege of paying off after five years where a longer term is fixed by the mortgage. (E. S. C. ch. 127, sec. 7.)\nIn this case the time for payment of the principal had not expired, and I find the strongest expression used by the plaintiff as to the right to receive moneys, in her evidence.\nQ. I am speaking of the old loans made through Bastien. Supposing I paid the interest to Bastien was it a good payment?\nA. How was it a good payment?\nQ. Bastien was authorised to receive your interest?\nA. I suppose so. He was a notary.\nQ. Suppose I borrowed five thousand dollars from you, and the deed had been passed by Bastien, and supposing I wanted to pay my interest, I would be properly advised to go to Bastien and get a receipt from Bastien? It was good?\nA. Well, we all supposed he was good at the time.\nQ. Provided Bastien had been honest throughout his life, all the payments made to him for you would be good payments?\nA. Well, I suppose so, if he were honest.\nQ. Provided Bastien would have given you back the money it would have been a straightforward payment, and a good solid payment?\nA. Yes, I suppose so, as far as I understand business.\nQ. Because it was understood he was to draw those moneys !\nA. And pay it immediately to me.\nQ. He was authorized to draw those moneys provided he paid them to you?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Provided he reimbursed you right away, or as soon as possible, he was authorised to do that, and draw the money for you?\nA. Well, he was authorised to get the money for me and pay me.\nQ. He was authorised to get the money provided he reimbursed it to you at once?\nA. Yes, I suppose so.\nwhich seems to me to fall within the very language of an old case of Sir John Wolstenholm v. Davies ([31]), bearing in mind the duties of a scrivener as they are explained, in 1850, in Wilkenson v. Candlish ([32]), from which it would appear Bastien in no sense occupied the position of a scrivener as spoken of in that case, but rather that of solicitors, in the later cases, being a person in the possession of the mortgage and accustomed to collect the interest. The mortgage here was not due; it affected land, and for its effectual discharge not only is payment of money an essential, but a discharge of the mortgage should be obtained for the purposes of registration. This the notary sought to do, and obtained a forged discharge. It is an unfortunate case, but the loss has been solely caused by the notary's misplaced trust in a brother notary by handing him cash and a cheque indorsed in blank, and trusting to the forged discharge. I find no evidence which under the decided English cases is sufficient to establish express authority to receive capital, and for the reasons I have indicated the language of article 1730 C.C. appears to require certainly as full authority in such a case. The leaving of the mortgage with the notary seems to be of even less importance in the Province of Quebec than leaving it with a solicitor in Ontario or England.\nThe admissions of the plaintiff cannot, I think, be divided under article 1243 C.C., and she most strenuously denied any authority whatever in Bastien to collect the principal before maturity except upon the condition that he handed it to her. She would be bound in similar case by anyone else who might have carried the money to her.\nI refer, in addition to the articles of the Code mentioned above, which seem to be drawn from the rules laid down in Story, to the following cases : Gillen v. Roman Catholic Episcopal Corp. of Kingston ([33]); Mc-Mullen v. Volley ([34]); In re Tracy ([35]); Greenwood v. Commercial Bank of Canada ([36]); Withington v. Tate ([37]); Gordon v. James ([38]); Palmer v. Winstanley ([39]). KILLAM J.\u2014I agree, upon the grounds stated by my brother Girouard, that the notary had neither actual authority to receive the mortgage money nor ostensible authority under art. 1730 of the Civil Code.\nI express no opinion respecting the sufficiency of the evidence of payment to the notary.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants; Rainville, Arthambautt, Geruais & Rainville.\nSolicitor for the respondent; J.

The solicitor took a confession of judgment from a client for a sum which included the whole amount charged by the Halifax counsel only part of which was paid to him.\nHeld, that though the arrangement was improper it did not vitiate the judgment entered on the confession but the amount not paid to counsel should be deducted therefrom.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nIn 1895, the respondent, Joseph Knock, commenced an action against the appellant in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The other respondents who compose the firm of Messrs. Owen & Ruggles, were retained, and acted throughout as his solicitors.\nUpon the trial of said cause judgment was given in favour of the plaintiff, which was affirmed upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco. From that judgment an appeal was taken by the present plaintiff to the Supreme Court of Canada, which said appeal came on for argument on the 4th and 5th days of May, 1897, and judgment was delivered by the said Supreme Court of Canada, on the 10th day of November, 1897, reversing the decisions below, and dismissing the action with costs[1].\nOn December 2nd, 1897, an order embodying said decision was granted, and the costs on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada were taxed. On December 6th and 10th, 1897, the present plaintiff's costs of action and of appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, were taxed. On January 4th, 1898, judgment was entered at Lunenburg for the present plaintiff against the said Joseph Knock for the sum of $804.14, and said judgment was recorded in the registry deeds for the County of Lunenburg, on January 7th, 1898.\nOn or about the 13th day of November, 1897, the said Joseph Knock confessed judgment in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to the said Owen & Ruggles, for the sum of $860 debt and $16 costs, and said judgment was entered for $876 in the prothonotary's office at Lunenburg, on November, 13th, 1897, and recorded in the said registry of deeds, on November 19th, 1897. On or about November 20th, 1897, the said Joseph Knock confessed a second judgment to the said Owen & Ruggles, in the Supreme Court, for the sum of $100, which judgment was entered in the prothonotary's office at Lunenburg, on November 20th, 1897, and recorded in said registry of deeds on December 2nd, 1897. On or about the 27th day of January, 1898, the said Joseph Knock assigned all his real estate, being the same as bound by said judgments and personal property, except such as was exempt from execution to the said appellant, in trust for the payment of her said judgment debt, as provided by the Collection Act, 1894.\nAfter said judgments had been obtained by the said Owen & Ruggles, and after the same had been recorded for upwards of one year, the said Owen & Ruggles issued executions thereupon under which executions the sheriff for the County of Lunenburg sold the real estate of the said Joseph Knock at public auction to the said Owen & Ruggles and conveyed the same to them by the usual sheriffs deed.\nCounsel was employed by the said Owen & Ruggles for the said Joseph Knock, in said suit, the total amount of whose account was $371.80. The said Owen & Ruggles included in said judgment the said account as the amount paid by them to said counsel. As a matter of fact, said Ruggles admits that they had only paid said counsel $100.80, and they subsequently settled with him by paying $75 cash, and a contra account of $16.31, in all, $91.31.\nMr. Ruggles, in his evidence, seeks to explain this by stating that he had a continuing arrangement with the counsel he employed to the following effect: \"I had an arrangement with Mr. Harrington when I left his office about costs, agency costs. He was to divide his charges with me according to the circumstances of the case. I was to explain the case to him, and he was to make a reasonable allowance to me.\" Joseph Knock knew nothing of this arrangement. Mr. Ruggles transacted the most of the business between Owen & Ruggles and the said Joseph Knock.\nWade K.C. for the appellant. A retainer makes an entire contract determinable only by mutual agreement or performance of the whole services. Until the relationship of solicitor and client ceases the former can recover nothing for his services. Holman v. Loynes[2]; Harris v. Osbourn[3].\nIf the judgment is bad in part it is bad in toto. Martin v. McAlpine[4]; Ley v. Madill[5]; Freeman v. Pope[6].\nBorden K.C. for the respondent cited Ex parte Hemming[7].\nThe Chief Justice and Girouard and Nesbitt JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Lavies.\nDavies J.\u2014The plaintiff who was a judgment creditor of one Joseph Knock, and also his general assignee, under The Collection Act, 1894, brought this action to set aside two prior judgments given by Joseph Knock and the sheriff's sale and deed thereunder. These judgments had been given by Joseph Knock to his solicitors, the other respondents, Owen & Ruggles, as security for the payment of the amount of the latters' costs in defending a law suit brought against Knock, and which had gone through many stages until finally disposed of by this court on appeal, Knock v. Knock[8]. The grounds upon which the judgments were attacked were that they were given fraudulently and for the purpose of hindering and delaying the respondent Knock's creditors. There was an alternative claim that the judgments should be reduced\nThe learned trial judge found as facts that the amount charged for the services rendered was not unreasonable; also that Knock was fairly used and his interests sufficiently guarded for the circumstances of the case; also that the judgments were given bond fide and not for the purpose of retaining any benefit for the debtor. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on appeal, in a majority judgment, sustained the trial judge's findings, saying:\nThe learned judge finds that there is no evidence of gross error or charges amounting to imposition or fraud or under pressure, and nothing has been pointed out to us to lead to a contrary conclusion.\nUnder these findings it would require strong evidence in a case of this kind, which depends almost entirely upon questions of fact, for us to allow the appeal and set aside the security attacked. Mr. Wade, during the course of the argument, admitted that the judgment he was attacking did not cover any future costs, but even if it did the authorities show it would still stand good for those already incurred and for which it was given. Holdsworth v. Wakeman[9]; Re Whitcombe[10].\nThe observations of the Master of the Rolls in this latter case are so applicable to the appeal now under consideration that I quote them:\nI must remark on the great danger which solicitors incur when they enter into such arrangements with their clients. An agreement like this between a solicitor and client for taking a fixed sum in satisfaction of all demands for costs, is an agreement which may be perfectly good; but this court, for the protection of parties, looks at every transaction of this kind with great suspicion. The matter may turn out to be perfectly fair and right; still it exposes the conduct of the solicitor to suspicion, and naturally awakens the vigilance and jealousy of this court, seeing that one party has all the knowledge, and the other is in ignorance. But it is not because the transaction may be opened that, therefore, it is to be considered as open upon an occasion on which the court is exercising a jurisdiction in which it cannot set aside the transaction.\nThe circumstances in this case were not free from suspicion and the flat contradictions given by both Knock and Ruggles at the trial to the sworn evidence given by them before the commissioner, McGuire, seem fully to justify the severe strictures passed upon them by Mr. Justice Meagher in his dissenting judgment. But none of these suspicious circumstances, nor all of them combined, were strong enough to convince the trial judge or the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia of the existence of such fraud or gross error as would vitate the entire transaction and upon the whole case, notwithstanding the able argument addressed to us, I am not convinced that the judgment of the court below should be reversed.\nOn the other branch of the case I am satisfied, however, that the judgment attacked should be reduced by the difference between the amount charged as paid to Mr. Harrington, the counsel in the cause. and the amount actually paid. This reduction does not necessarily involve any finding of fraud against the solicitors. At the time the bill of costs was being made up or shortly before Mr. Harrington was applied to for the amount of his charges. He gave them and as given they were charged in the bill $371.10. Subsequently Mr. Ruggles settled with him by paying $191.31, leaving a sum charged against Knock, which was never paid, of $180.59. Ruggles refused to make the necessary reduction of the judgment by this amount on the grounds that his firm either had a right to retain any deductions made by counsel from his bill on general principles, or that such right existed under a special agreement existing between Mr. Harrington and Mr. Ruggles, as to agency costs. I am, however, perfectly clear that this agreement as to agency costs, which is quite a common one and quite defensible, can have no relation whatever to counsel fees such as those of Mr. Harrington, and if it had it is equally clear it never would receive the sanction of this court. The relations existing between solicitor and client are peculiarly sacred. The latter has a right to receive from the former not only his best judgment and skill, but the strictest integrity and the most scrupulous good faith in dealing with his clients' rights and business. It would be intolerable that a solicitor could charge and exact payment from his client of a larger sum of money as paid to counsel retained to advocate that client's interests than was actually paid or be permitted to retain money actually his client's and coming into his hands by way of reductions made in the charges of counsel or otherwise. This court, I take it, will be astute to see that under no possible guise or contrivance will any such a breach of the trust which a client is compelled to place in his solicitor be permitted. I adopt the language used by the Lord Chancellor in delivering the judgment of the House of Lords in Tyrrell v. Bank of London[11]:\nMy lords, there is no relation known to society, or the duties of which it is more incumbent upon a court of justice strictly to require a faithful and honest observance, than the relation between solicitor and client; * * * a solicitor shall not, in any way whatever, in respect of the subject of any transactions in the relations between him and his client, make gain to himself at the expense of his client, beyond the amount of the just and fair professional remuneration to which he is entitled.\nI am willing to admit that in this case the original charge was not fraudulently made and that the subsequent refusal to allow his client the reductions which Mr. Harrington subsequently made in his charges was based upon a mistake as to his duties and rights as a solicitor.\nIn the result I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed to this extent that the judgments of the respondents Owen & Ruggles against Joseph Knock should be reduced by the amount of the overcharge of $189.50 with interest if any charged but, under the circumstances, as neither party has been fully successful, without costs. The form of the order will be to set aside altogether the second judgment for $100 and to reduce the first judgment by the remaining $80.59.\nKillam J.\u2014It appears to me immaterial whether or not the relation of solicitor and client was formally terminated between the defendants Owen & Ruggles and the defendant Joseph Knock before the giving of the confessions of judgment.\nAdmitting that the solicitors were not then in a position to sue, they had performed valuable services and paid out money for their client, who could at any time waive further services and bind himself by an agreement to pay for what had been done. And there was a sufficient consideration to prevent the first confession of judgment being held void as being devised to delay, hinder or defraud the creditors of Joseph Knock. I have nothing to add upon these points to what has been so well said by Graham and Townshend JJ. in the court below.\nThe trial judge expressed himself as\nsatisfied that Knock was fairly used and that his interests were sufficiently guarded for the circumstances of the case.\nHe further said,\nIn my opinion there was valuable and adequate consideration for the confession of judgment in each case. I am satisfied that they were bond fide and not for the purpose of retaining any benefit for the debtor.\nAnd, in reference to the claim for a taxation of the costs, the learned judge said,\non this branch of the case she stands in no better position than Joseph Knock. He was offered the privilege of taxing the costs and waived it. There was no pressure and I cannot say that he was overcharged.\nAnd, further,\nI think the amounts charged for services were not unreasonable, as costs are now taxed by the taxing authorities. And,\nIn the plaintiff's written argument no point is made that Knock was overcharged.\nThe majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting in appeal, adopted these findings and opinions. Under ordinary circumstances, then, it would not seem proper for this court to go behind them and examine into the reasonableness of the charges, a task for which we cannot be nearly so well fitted as the learned judges in Nova Scotia.\nBut one point that has been raised involves a question of principle which renders it proper for our earnest consideration. The solicitors are shewn to have included, in making up their costs, the full amount of an account rendered to them by a firm of barristers and solicitors in Halifax for counsel fees both in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and in the Supreme Court of Canada, as well as for services as agents in Halifax.\nIn making up the costs for the purpose of obtaining the confessions of judgment, Mr. Ruggles procured, by telephone, a statement of the amount charged by the Halifax firm, and included it in his claim for costs. After the giving of the confessions the account was rendered, amounting to $371.80, of which $100 had been paid. This, according to Mr. Ruggles' recollection, was about the amount given him by telephone. Subsequently, Mr. Ruggles and Mr. Harrington agreed upon a settlement of the account, by which Ruggles paid $75.00 and set off a contra account which appears to have amounted to $19.21. Thus, upon my reading of the evidence, the utmost which Messrs Owen and Ruggles can claim to have paid to the Harrington firm was $194.21\nMr. Ruggles' evidence, in explanation of this transaction, is thus reported: I had an arrangement with Mr. Harrington, when I left his office, about costs. Agency costs. He was to divide his charges with me according to the circumstances of the case. I was to explain the case to him and he was to make a reasonable allowance to me. I suppose he lived up to that in this case.\nIt is a well known practice, as between solicitors in different places, that a rebate, usually of one half, is made upon charges for services performed by one on behalf of the other, and the law allows the latter to charge the full amount of the fees as against the client. Usually the fees are small and regulated by a tariff, and the services are such as might be performed for the solicitor by another person, sometimes a clerk or another solicitor, sometimes one unconnected with the legal profession. Counsel fees are for personal services, and large as compared with solicitors' fees. The client is interested in having the intervention of a solicitor to advise in selecting the counsel and in settling the fee. If the solicitor is to have the advantage of every reduction upon the fee as first charged the interests of the client will have little protection.\nUndoubtedly, the circumstances differ greatly in the various provinces of Canada from those existing in England. Mr. Justice Graham has pointed out some differences in respect of Nova Scotia. In Ontario Harrison C.J., in Robertson v. Furhess[12], and Boyd C., in Armour v. Kilmer[13], pointed out other such differences, many of which were applicable to other portions of Canada. Both practice and statute may give rise to such.\nIn England one person cannot be at once solicitor and barrister. For professional reasons the solicitor cannot be allowed to share a barrister's fee, which must be treated by the solicitor as a disbursement to be charged for only at the amount actually paid. In most, I believe in all, the provinces of Canada, solicitors may be barristers, and, by partnership with other barristers, these may share the counsel fees of one member of the firm, and the client retaining them must take the consequences.\nIn this case the counsel on both sides are members of the Nova Scotia bar of long standing. One asserts and the other denies that it is a recognized practice with city counsel to divide their fees with country barristers and solicitors. Nothing in the opinions expressed in this case by the learned judges of Nova Scotia indicates that any of them recognized such a practice as actually prevailing. I cannot find that any express reference to the point was made by Graham J. Townshend J. merely said:\nI know of no reason why such an arrangement may not be made, provided no unjust advantage is taken of the client in doing so.\nWeatherbe J. said:\nOnly the amount charged in the bill of counsel at Halifax has been demanded of Knock. At least, I think, if this was contended as sufficient to vitiate the transaction, evidence should have been furnished to convince the trial judge that that claim of counsel could not be enforced. There is nothing to show it may not be enforced. I think the trial judge was bound to assume it could be enforced.\nMeagher J., however, said:\nThe inclusion of a sum which was neither due ror payable, and which was included so as to give the defendants (solicitors) a gain or profit from their client, beyond their fair professional remuneration, being fraudulent, both as against Knock, who was left in ignorance of the fact, and especially as against the plaintiff, vitiates the judgment entirely under the statute.\nAnd, again:\nSo far, too, as the judgment included a sum for the services of Halifax counsel, in excess of what was paid or payable, it was fraudulent on the part of Ruggles, the party who claims under it.\nPossibly, if there were a well known practice in the profession in Nova Scotia, recognized and countenanced by the courts, to allow one barrister and solicicitor the benefit of agency terms as to the counsel fee of another barrister retained by the former for a client, we might feel bound to recognize and countenance it too, but when neither of the judges supporting the transaction suggests this, and the judge disapproving of the transaction does not indicate that he has heard of such, it seems impossible for this court to assume its existence.\nThe circumstance that admission to practice in one branch of the profession is in Nova Scotia an admission to practice in the other branch also, does not appear to me to distinguish the position from that in a province where it is merely admissible and customary to admit the same person to practice in both branches. \"The Barristers and Solicitors Act,\"R.S.N.S. (1900), ch. 164, recognizes a distinction between bar-listers and solicitors, and I can find nothing in that statute involving the application of a rule different from that which should prevail in Ontario.\nIn my experience in practice, both in Ontario and in Manitoba, an attorney or solicitor, upon taxation of a bill of costs, was required to prove actual payment of counsel fees charged, unless he or his partner had acted as counsel. Whether that practice is now rigidly adhered to in either province, I am unable to say; but I feel that I can say, with confidence, that in neither would the sharing of counsel fees, contended for in this case, be countenanced. I can see no greater reason for countenancing it in Nova Scotia.\nHere $112.80, out of the amount of Mr. Harrington's account, were for disbursements, leaving only $259 in which the solicitors could seek to share, since any deduction for an excessive charge of disbursements would clearly be for the client's benefit. Taking it, then, most favourably for the solicitors, they seek to charge $259 as paid for professional services of others when they have paid only about one-third thereof. Undoubtedly a number of items in the account were for purely solicitor's work, in the fees for which the defendant solicitors would be entitled to share. Still it is very evident that there was a large overcharge to the client.\nI am unable, however, to agree with the view of Meagher J. that, on this ground, the first confession of judgment should be treated as fraudulent and void as against the creditors of Joseph Knock. He certainly is not shewn to have intentionally given a confession of judgment for a larger sum than he owed.\nRuggles made up his bill, apparently, upon the basis of the statement by the telephone. He did not then know what reduction would be made. He was probably entitled to some without allowing it to his client. But having afterwards settled as he did. he was bound to give credit to his client for a considerable sum, and a court of equity would, I think, compel him to give this credit upon the judgment in favour of the present plaintiff.\nFor myself I would like to see the cause referred back for taxation of the costs, both because we cannot, in my opinion, properly determine the extent of the reduction which should be made, and because the circumstance of this overcharge appears to me to throw doubt upon the whole charge, and on other grounds, but as the majority of the court are of opinion to the contrary, it seems unnecessary for me to lengthen my remarks by further discussing this part of the case.\nI think that it sufficiently appears that there must be such a reduction; that the full amount of the second judgment must be taken as improperly charged, and the difference of amount in other respects seems of no practical importance. I, therefore, concur in the setting aside of the second judgment, and do not dissent from the reduction of the first.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wade & Paton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

The giving of such security cannot be waived by the respondent nor can the amount fixed by the Act be reduced by his consent.\nTHE CASE ON APPEAL in the above cause when transmitted by the Registrar of the Court of Appeal for Ontario contained an order made by a judge of that court approving of the bond for security for costs in the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars and stating that counsel for respondent had consented to that amount. The Registrar of the Supreme Court refused to accept the case and referred the matter to the Chief Justice who approved of the order refusing to receive the case and gave the following ruling as to the practice:\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Though it would seem that, as a general rule, the giving of security is an enactment in favour of the adverse party, and that, consequently, the adverse party may waive it expressly or impliedly, yet, under the Supreme Court Act, that is not so. Under sections 40, 43 and 46, the case is taken out of the jurisdiction of the provincial court only by the approval of the security. It is only by that act that the Supreme Court of Canada acquires jurisdiction. That is why rule 6 requires that the case should contain a certificate that the security has been given. Fraser v. Abbott[1]; In re Cahan[2]; Whitman v. The Union Bank[3], might perhaps be read as opposed to that view. But, to my mind, the statute is clear, and the clerk of the provincial court has no authority whatever, as a general rule, to certify a case (sec. 44, rule 1), when no security has been given. Our registrar should, therefore, refuse to receive such a case. Under rules 5 and 44, also, the security must be required. And the security, of course, must be as required by the statute.\n[1] Cass.

Wallace, judge of the County Court Judges' Criminal Court in and for the Metropolitan County of Halifax, District No. 1, in the Province of Nova Scotia, under the provisions of part 54 of the Criminal Code, 1892, for the Speedy Trial of Indictable Offences.\nThe circumstances under which the application was made are stated in the judgment reported.\nPower for the application, ex parte.\nDavies J.\u2014A motion was made before me at chambers for the discharge from custody of the prisoner Smitheman, now serving a term of imprisonment in the Penitentiary at Dorchester N.B., for \"unlawfully inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Fong Lena.\" The motion was made pursuant to an order of my brother Killam of the third of June instant setting down for hearing by a judge of this court in chambers a motion for the discharge of Smitheman from custody under a writ of habeas corpus which he ordered to be issued. The grounds upon which Mr. Power sought to sustain his motion were two and were each based upon alleged defects in the warrant of commitment signed by the clerk of the County Court Judges' Criminal Court, at Halifax, N.S., returned by the warden of the Dorchester Penitentiary with the return to the writ of habeas corpus as the authority under which he detained and held Smitheman;\u2014\n1. That this warrant did not contain any allegation of the place where the prisoner committed the offence for which he was convicted and imprisoned; and\n2. That no time was stated in the warrant of commitment from which the imprisonment was to run\nWith respect to the last objection, it is sufficient to refer to section 955 (7) of the Criminal Code which prescribes that the term of imprisonment in pursuance of any sentence shall, unless otherwise directed in the sentence, commence on and from the day of the passing of the sentence, which day the commitment in question shewed to have been the fifth day of May, 1904.\nWith regard to the only other objection to the validity of the commitment, namely, the absence of any specific allegation of the place where the offence was committed, it is to be observed that the County Court Judges Criminal Court for the County of Halifax, District No I, when exercising criminal jurisdiction under the provisions of part 54 of the Criminal Code, intituled, \"Speedy Trials of Indictable Offences\" is declared, by section 764, to be a court of record, and sub-section two enacts that\nthe record in any such case shall be filed among the records of the court over which the judge presides and as part of such records.\nThe jurisdiction of this criminal court is, by section 640, made, as regards the place of the commission of the offence, co-extensive with the Province of Nova Scotia and extends, by section 539, over all indictable offences excepting those specially reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the superior courts of criminal jurisdiction which do not include the offence of which this prisoner was convicted. As regards \"place,\" therefore, the jurisdiction of the court is not what is known as a limited one.\nThe general rule, no doubt, with regard to inferior courts is that stated in Paley on Convictions, (5 ed.) p. 204, that\non the ground that the magistrate's jurisdiction is limited in local extent the place where the offence was committed should be stated in the conviction.\nBut I am not prepared to hold that such rule would necessarily apply to a court having criminal jurisdiction co-extensive, as regards place, with the Supreme Court of the province. The same rule formerly prevailed with regard to the venue in indictments. But now, by section 609 of the Code,\nit shall not be necessary to state any venue in the body of the indictment and the district, county or place named in the margin thereof shall be the venue for all the facts stated in the body of the indictment but, if local description is required, such local description shall be given in the body thereof.\nThis is not an offence requiring a local description and, therefore, if the question whether there was or was not a valid conviction in this case was before me, it would become necessary to determine whether this section 609 applied to the proceedings in this prosecution. In an ordinary indictment, the absence of the place in the body of the indictment would be immaterial, being covered by that named in the margin. It would be curious, if by a technical limitation of the meaning of the word \"indictment\" to the proceedings of the Supreme Court of the province, this remedial section of the Code should not be held applicable to the proceedings of the County Court Judge's Criminal Court. Subsection \"l\" of the Interpretation Act, sec. 3 of the Code, says:\u2014\nThe expressions \"indictment\" and \"count\" respectively include information and presentment as well as indictment and also any plea, replication or other pleading and any record.\nI think, therefore, that the enactments of the Code are sufficient to meet this case where, even if the place was absent from the body of the record of the conviction, it would be covered by that named in the margin, viz. \"County of Halifax\".\nIn this view, I am strengthened by the forms or examples of the manner of stating offences given in the Code. Section 982 declares that these forms shall be deemed good, valid and sufficient in law. The form adopted in the case before me seems to have followed one of the examples given in the Schedule \"F.F.\" to the Code, (f.). See also (M.M.)\nBut, apart from that, I am not satisfied that the document authorising the prisoner's detention in the penitentiary need necessarily contain every essential averment of a formal conviction. Section 42 of chapter 182 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, prescribes that the sheriff or other officer may convey the convict sentenced to the penitentiary and deliver him to the warden\nwithout any further warrant than a copy of the sentence taken from the minutes of the court before which the convict was tried and certified by a judge or by the clerk or acting clerk of such court. I would greatly doubt that a \"copy of the sentence\" must contain all the averments essential to the validity of an indictment or conviction.\nThis document, certified by the warden as his authority for Smitheman's detention, is sufficient, in my opinion, and the motion for the prisoner's discharge is refused.\nApplication refused.\n"}

In December, 1844, the late Amable Pr\u00e9vost (who died in 1872), made his last will and a codicil thereto whereby he bequeathed the usufruct of all his estate, real and personal, to his wife and children, and then the ownership to his grandchildren whom he instituted his universal legatees, and he directed that in case all his children should die without issue before their mother, then his estate should go to other beneficiaries named. He also declared, as express and absolute conditions of the legacy of the usufruct, that the revenues should be an alimentary pension, exempt from seizure, and that the real estate should pass to his grandchildren in its natural state and, consequently, that it should not be alienable by any authority or under any pretext whatever, even for their greater advantage. He also provided that his grandchildren could not sell, alienate or hypothecate their shares or rights in his estate before the expiration of the term of the usufruct, nor of the shares in such usufruct belonging to their fathers or mothers. Finally, in case all his children should die without issue before the death of his wife, then that his wife, during widowhood, should have the usufruct of all his said estate with remainder as provided in the will.\nEleven years after the death of the testator his children, interpreting the will as creating seven distinct substitutions, i. e., seven separate transmissions, executed a deed of partition of the property, and since then (April, 1883), have each had separate enjoyment of the shares that fell to them respectively. Subsequently, this partition was declared valid by an Act of the Quebec legislature, 60 Vict. ch. 95, which declared it final and definitive and that the legatees, grev\u00e9s de substitution, were and had always been sole proprietors of the shares of the estate that had fallen to them respectively, subject to a reversionary charge, on their decease, to their children conformably to the dispositions of the will and codicil. On submission of the question to the court a judgment, in December, 1897, declared the deed of partition final and definitive.\nUnder the deed of partition the lands now in question fell to the lot of the respondent, Berthe Rh\u00e9a Pr\u00e9vost (Mrs. Berthelot), an institute under the substitution, and to her children as substitutes. An offer for the purchase of said property having been received, she joined with the curator and George Berthelot, the only substitute then of the age of majority, in an application by petition to the Superior Court, at Montreal, to have a family council assembled to advise on the subject matter of the petition and to have the sale of the land authorized in the usual manner, under the provisions of Act 953a C. 0. The family council, with the exception of Dr. A. Brodeur an uncle by marriage (the husband of the appellant, Ad\u00e8le Pr\u00e9vost), agreed that in the interest of both institute and substitutes the proposed sale should be authorized, and the sale was authorized accordingly.\nAd\u00e8le Pr\u00e9vost, a sister of the petitioner, was not a party to the application and was not called to the family council, nor did she intervene, oppose or otherwise contest the proceedings except by filing a memorandum of the objections made by her husband at the family council. These objections were in effect that the price offered was too low, that it was not advisable to make the sale at the price offered and that there was express prohibition against alienation declared by the will. However, as one of the grev\u00e9s de substitution under the will, and claiming to have an interest in a possible reversion, she appealed from the judge's order to the Court of King's Bench. The respondents moved for the dismissal of the appeal on the grounds that the appellant was not a party in the Superior Court nor could she have the necessary interest in the property (Art. 77 C. P. Q.) to entitle her to bring the appeal, and also contested the appeal on the merits.\nBy the judgment now appealed from the Court of King's Bench, holding that the appellant had the necessary capacity and an interest sufficient to entitle her to bring the appeal, dismissed the motion with costs, but, on the merits, affirmed the order of the Superior Court and dismissed the appeal with costs.\nBrosseau K.C. for the appellants. As a daughter of the testator, Ad\u00e8le Prevost (Mrs. Brodeur) has a contingent interest in the whole estate, grev\u00e9 de substitution, in the event of none of the substitutes surviving. Under the new rule as to right of action, art. 77 C.P.Q., this eventual interest is sufficient to give her the right of appeal from the order for sale. The petition was ex parte and Mrs. Brodeur, being merely an aunt of the substitutes, could not be summoned on the family council, art. 252 C. C. However, her interests in the estate and the provisions of her father's will against alienation were protected by law (arts. 968 et seq. C.C.) and by the objections to the advice of the family council filed by her husband.\nLafleur K. C. appeared for the respondents but was not called upon by the court.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014We are of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed simply upon the ground that as the appellant was not a party to the case in which the judgment ordering the sale of the property in question was rendered, she cannot be prejudiced thereby, and should therefore not have been admitted by the Court of King's Bench to appeal from it. Even assuming that she has an eventual right in this property, without deciding anything on the point, the judgment of the Superior Court inter alios cannot affect that right. For this reason we hold that the dispositif of the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing her appeal is right, without adjudicating upon the judgment of the Superior Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants :- Brosseau, Lajoie, Lacoste & Quigley.\nSolicitor for the respondents : Lafleur, McDougall & Macfarlane.\n"}

The plaintiff\u2019s husband was killed by a train of the defendant company at a highway crossing in the City of London. At the trial of her action for compensation for his death the jury found no contributory negligence on the part of deceased, and found negligence in defendant causing the accident which negligence consisted in non-ringing of the bell and want of a watchman at the crossing and an automatic bell. The plaintiff obtained a verdict for $1000 which was not sufficient give an appeal de plano.\nRiddell K.C. for motion. This case is of great importance to railway companies and to the whole public. The jury has usurped the functions of the Board of Railway Commissioners in holding the lack of an automatic bell or a watchman at the crossing, which are not required by statute, to be negligence.\nFaules contra. This case is of no more public importance than was Fisher v. Fisher[1].\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. were of opinion that the motion should be refused for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nDAVIES J.\u2014While concurring generally in the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Nesbitt dismissing this application for special leave to appeal, I do not wish to express any opinion whatever as to the conclusion this court would reach on an application for leave where the question was raised \u201cWhether an engine and tender running reversely had other duties to perform than those imposed by the Railway Act.\u201d I have seen no reason to qualify the observations I made in the case of The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay[2] with respect to the decision of this court in The Lake Erie and Detroit River Railway Co. v. Barclay[3].\nNESBITT J.\u2014This is a motion for special leave to appeal. We are of opinion that special leave should not be granted in this case.\nThe action was one for negligence, tried by a jury, and the plaintiff recovered a verdict for $1,000. A perusal of the case shows that there was evidence of statutory negligence in failing to ring the bell of the engine, which the jury found to have caused the accident. They also found against the defence of contributory negligence. There were added, too, findings of the necessity of further precautions which we think were surplusage and cannot on a fair reading be treated as part of the negligence but for which the accident would not have happened; and, therefore, no questions such as were raised in The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McKay2 were in our opinion involved.\nNor does the case raise the important question of the duty of a traveller to observe the precautions of looking and listening, on approaching a crossing, since the trial judge expressly charged that such was the duty of the plaintiff and the plaintiff swore to the observance of the duty.\nWhether this court would have come to the same conclusion as the jury is not the question. In applications to this court for special leave, it is bound to apply judicial discretion to the particular facts and circumstances of each case as presented. Cases vary so widely in their circumstances that the principles upon which an appeal ought to be allowed do not admit of anything approaching to exhaustive definition. No rule can be laid down which would not necessarily be subject to future qualification, and any attempt to formulate any such rule might, therefore, prove misleading. The court may indicate certain particulars the absence of which will have a strong influence in inducing it to refuse leave, but it by no means follows that leave will be given in all cases where these features occur. If a case is of great public interest and raises important questions of law and, yet, the judgment is plainly right, no leave should be granted. See \u201cDaily Telegraph\u201d Newspaper Co. v. McLaughlin[4].\nWhere, however, the case involves matter of public interest or some important question of law or the construction of Imperial or Dominion statutes or a conflict of provincial and Dominion authority or questions of law applicable to the whole Dominion, leave may well be granted. Such cases, as we understand, came peculiarly within the purview of this court which was established, as far as possible, to be a guide to provincial courts in questions likely to arise throughout the Dominion. We think it was the intention of the framers of the Act creating this court that a tribunal should be established to speak with authority for the Dominion as a whole and, as far as possible, to establish a uniform jurisprudence, especially within matters falling within section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, where the legislation is for the Dominion as a whole, or, as I have said, where purely provincial legislation may be of general interest throughout the Dominion.\nHad this case involved a discussion of any special section of the Railway Act and the powers of the railway committee, as suggested, we think it would have been a case for leave; had there been any such general question in dispute, as the undoubted duty of a traveller to observe care in approaching a railway cross- ing, or the question of whether or not an engine and tender running reversely were bound to observe other duties and obligations than those imposed by the Railway Act, a case for leave might have been made out. But we think that no such questions were really involved, as the case was wholly disposed of by answers finding statutory negligence and against contributory negligence, with evidence which must have gone to the jury on each branch, findings that we cannot think should be disturbed.\nThe motion is therefore dismissed with costs.\nKILLAM J. also concurred with Nesbitt J.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.H.

Taschereau for the appellants.\nBisaillon K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nDAVIES J.\u2014\"We are all of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action restored. The question is really one more of fact than of law. The action was brought against the company by one of its employees for damages sustained by him in consequence of the alleged negligent unloading of a car-load of large posts, thirty or forty feet in length, from a railway flat-car. The plaintiff was on top of the posts on the car for the purpose of cutting the wires which, for the purpose of holding the load firmly on the car, were fastened from three upright stakes on one side of the car to corresponding stakes on the other side. The negligence charged in the first instance was the cutting of the stakes too soon by the defendant's foreman or those acting under him while the plaintiff was at his work on the top of the posts, in consequence of which the posts rolled off carrying the plaintiff with them.\nThe evidence, as is generally the case in actions of this kind, was conflicting but the trial judge accepted the testimony of the witnesses for the defence that the plaintiff was warned to come down from his place of danger but persisted in remaining, saying that there was no danger, or words to that effect, and actually himself giving orders to one of the workmen to cut away the last retaining stake. Some five or six witnesses testify to these facts and we see no reason whatever to differ from the learned trial judge who accepted and acted upon their testimony.\nThe plaintiff, himself, was the author of his own injuries and by his own orders, neglect and carelessness brought them upon himself\nThe judgment appealed from was attempted to be supported on the ground that the ropes used to break the fall of the posts from the car were old and rotten and not fit for the purpose. But, apart from the fact that this is not charged in the plaintiff's statement of claim as the negligence which caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injuries and is evidently an afterthought, we are clearly of the opinion that it was not the character of the ropes which either caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injuries, but his own conduct in persisting in remaining upon the load of posts after the wires had been cut, contrary to his orders, and himself directing the cutting away of the last retaining stake and so causing the load of posts to roll to the ground.\nThe case of Lamoureux v. Fournier ([1]) was cited by the respondent's counsel as authority for the proposition that the foreman was bound, in any case, to see that his orders to the plaintiff to come down were obeyed. But if the plaintiff chose to disobey them and himself bring about the accident which caused his injuries, he surely cannot hold the company liable. There were no reasons given for the judgment of this court in the case cited. It turned almost altogether upon questions of fact. The ground upon which we affirmed the judgment in that case was that the fall of the scaffold which caused the death of the plaintiff's husband was caused by its being overloaded with stone and that the appellant, whose duty it was to see that the scaffold was not overloaded, altogether neglected that duty, in consequence of which neglect the accident took place. The short note of the case in the Supreme Court Reports (1), does not shew the ground of our decision. We did not intend to affirm. or approve of the principle of law stated in the head-note of the report of the case in the Quebec Reports ([2]), copied into the note of the decision of this court on the appeal, even if the language of that head-note is justified by the reasons given by the Court of Review, which I doubt. However, no such law was laid down by this court.\nThe appeal will be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Pr\u00e9fontaine, Archer, Perron & Taschereau.\nSolicitor for the respondent : Bisaillon & Brossard.\n[1] 33 Can.

The policy contained a clause providing that no action should be maintainable thereon unless commenced within twelve months next after the fire. The \" rider \" provided that the re-insurance should be subject to the same risks, conditions, valuations, privileges, mode of settlement, etc., as the original policy, and that loss, if any, should be payable ten days after presentation of proofs of payment by the company so re-insured.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, Girouard and Nesbitt JJ. dissenting, that there was no incongruity between the limitation of twelve months in the form of the main policy and the condition in the rider agreement as to claims for re-insurance and, consequently, that the action for recovery of the amount of the reinsurance way prescribed by the conventional limitation of twelve months from the date of the fire occasioning the loss.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment by Trenholme J. at the trial, in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the action with costs. The circumstances of the case and questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ. E. Martin K.C. and Howard for the appellants, referred to Prevost v. The Scottish Union and National; Ins. Co. ([1]) and cases there cited; Cornell v. The Liverpool and London Fire and Life Ins. Co. ([2]); Allen v. The Merchants Marine Ins. Co.

The \"rider\" contains the whole contract and expresses the intention of the parties and the nature and scope of their agreement. This is not an insurance of property but merely re-insurance of a liability incurred under the terms set out in the form of the main policy. The conditions of that policy clearly apply only to the insurances on property and are incompatible with a contract such as the \"rider\" discloses. We must eliminate all incongruous and inappropriate clauses and, as no liability can arise until the re-insured company suffers loss by being forced to make payments upon adjustment of losses on their risks. The debt due by the re-insuring company does not become exigible until ten days after proof of such payments and, consequently, prescription cannot commence to run until the latter date, Art. 2236 C. C. None but the statutory limitation provided by Art 2260 C. C. can apply in this case. We refer to The Fire Insurance Association v. The Canada Fire and Marine Ins. Co. ([9]) per Haggarty C.J. at pages 489-490; Jackson v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. ([10]); The Manufacturers Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Western Assurance Co. ([11]); Faneuil Hall Ins. Co. v.

Associated Manufacturers' Mut. Fire Ins. Corporation ([14]); Alker v Rhoads ([15]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\"In consideration of the stipulations herein contained\" the policy upon which the respondents' action is based was issued.\nOne of these stipulations reads as follows:\u2014\nNo suit or action on this policy, for the recovery of any claim, shall be sustained in any court of law or equity unless commenced within twelve months next after the fire.\nThat is plain enough. However, the respondents contend that there is no contractual limitation of time whatever against any action under this policy. It is not true, they say, that it was issued in consideration of the stipulations therein contained, and that stipulation as to limitation of action must be read out of it because, they argue, it is provided therein that liability for re-insurance is to be as specifically agreed upon in the rider attached to it, and the provision as to limitation of action not being repeated in specific terms in that rider, it does not form part of the contract of reinsurance. In my opinion that contention is untenable. It is merely the extent and terms of the re-insurer's liability that must be specifically agreed upon by the rider. All the other conditions of the policy not incompatible with the contract of re-insurance must be given effect to. It is not because there are other stipulations in the policy that are incompatible with those of the rider that every stipulation thereof must be read out of it. The policy and the rider together, one as much as the other, contain the contract between the parties. There is not necessarily incompatibility between the stipulation as to limitation of action and any of the specific agreements as to the re-insurance. It may often happen that the loss is adjusted and paid within a short time after the fire, yet the respondents would contend that the right of action against the reinsurers would, notwithstanding the stipulation, exist in that case as long as not barred by statutory limitation. That cannot be, in my opinion. That such a limitation of action might occasionally, under certain circumstances, operate injuriously against the reinsured was a good reason not to stipulate it, not at all a reason for asking the court to read it out of the contract. They cannot have intended to stipulate it, or it is by inadvertence that it is in the policy, they would argue. That may be But they must be told that stipulations in a contract cannot be ignored simply because they lead to consequences that the parties did not contemplate. That is the law of Canada, whatever it may be in the foreign country where to the respondents have had to look for decisions in support of their case.\nAnd insurance companies are not at liberty to invoke their loose and careless ways of drafting their re-insurance policies that we have been told of at the hearing as a reason to be admitted in contending that they do not mean what they stipulate in clear and unambiguous terms.\nThe judgment appealed from holds that there was no limitation of action whatever stipulated by the policy\nIf that were so, this would be the first insurance policy that has ever been before us in which there is no such stipulation.\nI would allow the appeal, and dismiss the action with costs in all the courts.\nSEDGWICK J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting):\u2014 I do not intend to go over the facts of the case; they are fully set out in the opinions of my colleagues, and moreover they are not disputed. No doubt the parties agreed by the printed form of policy that no suit or action on the policy should be sustainable\nunless commenced within twelve months after the fire\nbut by the rider or latest agreement annexed, the claim is made subject to many new conditions usually stipulated in a contract of re-insurance which had to be accomplished before a claim could be made against the re-insuring company, and finally it is declared in the rider that\nthe loss, if any, is payable ten days after presentation of proofs of payment\nThe conditions in the printed form are applicable in so far as they are not inconsistent with those in the so-called rider, and when so inconsistent the rider should govern. I look therefore upon this addition as \u00e0 modification to the contractual prescription stipulated in the printed form. Till ten days after the presentation of the proofs of payment, the respondents were in the absolute impossibility of moving against the appellants. Contra non valentem agere nulla currit praescriptio. This is the principle laid down in art. 2232 C. C. applicable to conventional as well as legal prescriptions. Fuzier-Herman Code Annot\u00e9, art. 2245, n, 106; art. 2248, n. 58. Prescription commenced to run only\" ten days after \"presentation of proofs of payment.\" Denison v. The Masons' Fraternal Accident Association ([16]), in 1891, at page 297.\nThe payment of the loss by respondents was made by them in April, 1901, and on the 31st of May following the proofs of payment were duly presented to the appellants. The loss due by them became, therefore, payable ten days after, namely, on the 10th June, 1901. The action was taken on the 17th of June 1901, within the time provided by both the printed policy and the rider.\nTo conclude, by interpreting the clauses of the contract so as to give effect to all, I have come to the conclusion that the plea of prescription is unfounded and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs\nDAVIES J.:\u2014The sole question for our decision is whether or not a clause in the policy prescribing any suit or action upon it for the recovery of any claim \"unless commenced within twelve months next after the fire\" can be eliminated as not being part of the contract between the parties. The respondent successfully contended in the courts below that this could be done on the ground that the contract was one of re-insurance only and the prescriptive clause in question was altogether inapplicable to it. I have not been able to reach that conclusion or to decide that this or any court can eliminate from a contract any of its provisions except those plainly and palpably inapplicable to the contract made or inconsistent with other provisions of the same contract.\nNow there is nothing in a prescriptive clause plainly or palpably inapplicable to a re-insurance contract. Nor in the contract before us is that clause inconsistent with any other provision or stipulation of the contract. In fact, prim\u00e2 facie and as between two insurance companies, some such clause would seem to be just as applicable to the re-insurance contract as it would to an original insurance contract between an owner or mortgagee and an insurance company.\nThe special limitation of \"twelve months next after the fire\" inserted in the policy as the period within which an action must be brought upon the policy may be a harsh and unjust one and capable under certain contingencies of depriving the party insured of the indemnity he thought he had assured to him. But the same may be said with great, if not with equal force of the same clause in any ordinary policy of insurance. It may at times and under certain contingencies operate in ordinary cases most harshly and cruelly and yet no one would for a moment suggest that the courts could avoid giving effect to the clause.\nIn my opinion, therefore, before we attempt to read such a clause out of the contract we must be fully convinced that it is quite inapplicable to the real contract entered into and was never intended by the parties for that reason to form any part of it or that it is inconsistent with other express stipulations of the policy.\nNow what are the facts here? The forms of the defendant company ordinarily used for insurance purposes are used between the two companies to express the re-insurance contract. That these forms are intended so to be used is apparent from their language. The words \"liability for re-insurance shall be as specifically agreed hereon\" form part of the printed form. The specific matters agreed to on the re-insurance were set out fully on what is called a \" rider \" pasted upon or attached to the policy above and before the usual and ordinary conditions and are headed \"Re-Insurance Home Insurance Company of New York\". As might be expected these special stipulations relate to the amount insured, the property the re-insurance covers, the losses which must; be sustained by fire before any liability attached under the policy and other analogous clauses. They also fixed the notice required to cancel the policy and provided for the inspection of all papers touching any claim made under the contract. There was also inserted the usual clause in re-insurance contracts making the policy subject to the \" same risks, conditions, valuations, privileges, mode of settlement and assessments as are or may be assumed or adopted by the Home Insurance Company, and covers such property as may be protected by the said company\nand the loss, if any, is payable ten days after presentation of proof of payment.\nAs a good deal was attempted to be made of these words which I have italicized, I pause here to consider whether they in any way conflict or are at variance with the twelve months' prescription. For myself I read both clauses together and find nothing antagonistic in them. One defines with certainty the day when the loss, if any, becomes payable, namely, ten days after presentation of proof of payment by the company insured, the other clause fixes a date after which no action can be brought to recover the loss payable. But, it is argued, there may be such delays in proving and adjusting the original loss that the whole twelve months after the fire will have elapsed before the Home Company could pay, and in such a case, as the loss was not payable till ten days after presentation of proofs of payment, the prescriptive period being passed, no action could be brought at all, or to put it the other way the right to bring the action might not arise until the period which extinguished the right had elapsed. Just so. Such a contingency might possible arise. But if the company by its own contract created such a possible disability on itself it has only itself to blame. Such a result would not justify a court in cutting the gordian knot and granting relief by altering the contract.\nReturning to our examination of the policy we find that after the special stipulations above referred to relating to re-insurance had been inserted the usual and ordinary clauses in customary use followed including the one in question reading as follows:\nNo suit or action on this policy, for the recovery of any claim, shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity until after full compliance by the insured with all the foregoing requirements, nor unless commenced within twelve months next after the fire.\nThis again was followed by another clause declaring\nthis policy is made and accepted subject to the foregoing stipulations and conditions.\nThe time limit for bringing the action is one of those stipulations and conditions. If it was irreconcilable with any special stipulation inserted respecting re-insurance the court would have to reconcile them, and if that could only be done by striking the clause out or declaring it plainly and palpably inapplicable, such a result might be defended. But as I cannot find any such conditions of irreconcilability exist I must only construe the contract with the clause in. Remaining there it can have but one meaning and that is fatal to the maintenance of the action.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts,\nNESBITT J. (dissenting):\u2014The plaintiffs' action is based on a policy of re-insurance issued by the company on the 29th of December, 1899, by which it re-insured for the term of one year and to the extent of $10,000 the liability of the Home Insurance Company, under policies issued through its railway department covering railway property situated in the United States of America, Canada and Mexico.\nIn order that any liability should attach under the terms of the policy it was agreed that any railway com- pany insured by the Home Insurance Company, either directly or as re-insurance of another company, must suffer by one fire a loss exceeding $50,000, and that by such fire the Home Insurance Company must also have sustained an insurance loss in excess of $5,000, after proper allowance for all other re-insurance applicable to the same.\nOn the 26th of April, during the currency of this policy, the \"Hull fire\" occurred and by it the Canadian Pacific Railway Company suffered a large loss. The railway company were directly insured by the Western Assurance Company of Canada, under a policy issued on the 20th. April, 1899. Twenty per cent of the liability of the Western Assurance Company under this policy was re-insured by the Home Insurance Company under a policy dated the 10th. April, 1899, and the Home Insurance Company, in its turn, re-in-sured a portion of its liability under the policy referred to. The liability of the Western Assurance Company was finally settled and paid on the 16th. March, 1901, and the Home Insurance Company immediately paid their proportion of the loss, and on the 21st. May, 1901, made a claim upon the Victoria Fire Insurance Company for a sum which was subsequently fixed as the sum of $3,727.60, and the question to be decided in this case is as to the application of a limitation clause which appears in a printed portion of the defendants' policy in the following terms:\u2014\nNo suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity until after full compliance by the insured with all foregoing requirements, nor unless commenced within twelve months next after the fire. The trial judge and the Court of Review have both held this condition inapplicable to the contract of reinsurance. The contract was entered into apparently by the defendant company using one of their ordinary printed blank forms changing the words \"does insure\" in the second line of the policy, to the words \"does re-insure\" and by adding a number of conditions applicable to a contract of re-insurance in a typewritten \"rider\" attached to the printed form.\nThis course was probably taken because an examination of the American authorities indicates that such a course of action is customary, and apparently this blank printed form has, by reason of its use for such purposes, had inserted in it the printed words \"liability for re-insurance to be as specifically agreed hereon\"; language, so far as I can see, entirely inapplicable to the ordinary contract of insurance which contemplates an insurance upon specific property in which the assured has an interest and in which, in case of a loss, he is required to make proofs of loss by fire and submit his claim to arbitrators if required and fulfil many other conditions in no respect applicable to a case such as this where the insurance is not upon any specific property in any specific place, but is an insurance of the liability of the Home Insurance Company under their railway policies, provided the originally insured railway company suffered by one fire a loss exceeding $50,000, and that the Home Insurance Company itself sustained a loss in excess of $5,000 in respect of such fire, after proper allowance made for all other re-insurance applicable to the loss and with the specific \"rider-agreement\" as between the Home Insurance Company and the Victoria Fire Insurance Company:\u2014\nThis policy is subject to and liable for the same risks, conditions, valuations, privileges, mode of settlement, indorsements and assignments as are or may be assumed or adopted by the Home Insurance Company, and covers such property as may be protected by the said company, and the loss, if any, is payable ten days after presentation of proofs of payment.\nThe manifest purpose and spirit of this contract is that, except for the purpose of receiving certain notice from the Home Insurance Company, the Victoria Fire Insurance Company are in no way interested in the adjustment of the loss nor can they be called upon to make a payment until after all disputes have been settled by litigation or otherwise ended and the claim has been paid by the Home Insurance Company for the space of ten days.\nI have pointed out that the Home Insurance Company must have paid a considerable sum before any liability at all attaches on the re-insurance contract. I think the limitation clause which provides that no action shall be maintained after one year from the date of the fire is wholly inapplicable to such a contract and covenant for payment, and would provide for prescription running when no claim was running. I think the period of ordinary commercial prescription would apply ten days after the payment by the Home Insurance Company as under similar conditions six years have been held the prescriptive time applicable in the United States. Article 2236 of the Civil Code provides:\u2014\nPrescription of personal actions does not run with respect to debts depending on a condition, until such condition happens.\nThe condition in this case was the payment by the plaintiffs, and, until ten days thereafter, no debt arose. The American authorities, both state and federal, are uniform in dealing with precisely similar questions, and it is scarcely credible to me that the parties to this contract were not well aware of what seems to be the uniform practice. Although the American cases are not authorities in our courts the opinion and reasoning of the learned judges of courts in the United States, especially in insurance cases, have always been regarded with respectful consideration in this court and in England as affording valuable assistance, and I think we cannot do better than adopt them in this case. I would refer to the following cases upon the point under consideration:\u2014Consolidated Real Estate and Fire Insurance Company of Baltimore v. Cashow (1874), ([17]); Jackson v. St Paul F. & M. Insurance Company (1885), ([18]); Manufacturers' Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Western Assurance Company (1888), ([19]); Faneuil Hall Insurance Company v. Liverpool & London & Globe Insurance Company (1891), ([20]); Imperial Fire Insurance Company of London v. Home Insurance Company of New Orleans (1895), ([21]); Alker v. Rhoads (1902), ([22]); Insurance Company of the State of New York v. Associated Manufacturers' Mutual Insurance Corporation (1902), ([23]).\nIn the report in 145 Mass. the court said:\nThe contract entered into by the defendant with the plaintiff differed materially from an ordinary contract to insure a general owner against damage to his property by fire. While in a sense it was an insurance upon property, it was strictly a contract of indemnity against risk under another contract which has been entered into by the assured. The assured was not the owner of the property at risk, and had no relation to it except as insurer under the original policy. In that relation it had an insurable interest in it, and could enter into any proper contract for the protection of that interest. Eastern Railroad Go. v. Relief Fire Ins. Co. ([24]). But, manifestly, many provisions appropriate to an ordinary agreement with the owner of property for the insurance of it could have no proper application to the agreement made by these parties.\nIt appears upon inspection of the defendant's policy, and is agreed by the parties, that it was prepared upon a printed blank, commonly used in writing policies to insure against loss upon property by the owners of it,\nIt is often doubtful how far provisions which relate to the conduct of an assured person as general owner of that which is the subject of the contract should be given effect, in a policy to indemnify against a risk which the assured has taken upon the property of another. That can only be determined in a given case by a careful scrutiny of the different parts of the writing to ascertain its meaning. Whenever words are found in a contract which can have no proper application to the subject to which it relates, they cannot be regarded; and, not infrequently, the careless use of printed blanks compels recognition of this rule. The policy in this case contained many provisions which were originally intended to regulate the conduct of an owner in relation to his property before and after a possible fire.\nAs I have pointed out, the provision making the policy subject to and liable to the same risks, etc., and making the loss payable only ten days after proof of payment by the Home Insurance Company, coupled with the provision that liability for re-insurance shall be as specifically agreed hereon, rendered nugatory many printed portions of the policy. In the language of the case cited\nthese are special and peculiar partaining directly to the subject matter of the contract and control those parts of the policy which are inconsistent with it.\nIn Ontario it has been held in Citizens Ins Co, v. Parsons (1881), ([25]), that the statutory conditions are applicable to every contract of insurance the subject matter of which is situated in Ontario. And it was argued in the Fire Insurance Association v. Canada Fire 8\u00e7 Marine Insurance Co. (1883), ([26]), that, therefore, the statutory conditions must be read into a contract of re-insurance. But it was held that the statutory conditions would be meaningless as applied to the contract of re-insurance, a holding which is applicable to this case, and although it was urged upon the argument that the parties had seen fit to make these conditions part of their contract of insurance, so in the case referred to it was argued that the statute had made practically similar additions applicable without the consent of the parties to the contract of insurance in that case. The cases are all reviewed and it is pointed out that owing to the decisions a clause such as I have indicated is now always inserted in re-insurance contracts by which the re-insuring company bind themselves to allow the insuring company to make a settlement, and the re-insuring company to be bound by such settlement and adjustment, and so the usual conditions cannot form part of the contract. It is plain that the plaintiffs were not to send in proofs, furnish certificates, etc., and it is to my mind equally clear that the parties agreed that the time for prescription should not begin until ten days after payment by the insuring company.\nIt is admitted that many of the conditions are wholly inapplicable to and cannot form part of the contract made by the parties. Why? Because they are senseless and repugnant to the bargain Is it not then the duty of the court to go over the language and see if the same can be harmonized and read into the admitted bargain? In the case of this particular condition, the early part is wholly senseless applied to the bargain here but clearly applicable to an ordinary risk. Why then emasculate the condition and divorce part of it from its context and read in a different bargain and one with which the condition as a whole can have no relation? I would affirm the judgment of the court below and dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McLennan & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Lafleur, Macdougall & Macfarlane.\n[1] Q.

The prescription could not run against the city while the validity of the tax was being contested in court. Art. 2236 C.C. The city was prevented taking action during the pendency of the litigation ; contra non valentem agere nulla currit prcescriptio. See City of Montreal v. Montreal Land and Loan Co. ([1]) per Blanchet J. ; Dalloz, 1858, 1, 414; 1862, 1, 35-36 and note The contestation of the roll was by the respondent's auteurs, the owners of the lands assessed, and having, by their own proceeding, caused the delay they cannot now plead the limitation after the failure of their contestation. We also refer to Cass. 13 Avril, 1810, S. V. 10, 1, 175.\nBond and Lacoste for the respondents. The taxes, if any were due, became exigible upon the deposit of the revised roll in the treasurer's office, (sec. 231 of city charter) ; the prescription provided by sec. 120, therefore, commenced to run from that date ; no judicial demand, (art. 2224 C. C.) was made, and the full period of three years had elapsed before proceedings for collection were begun. See O'Connor v. Scanlan ([2]). The operation of sec. 408 of the amending act, 62 Vict. ch. 58, can have no retroactive effect to revive the prescribed right. We refer to sects. 565 and 558 of the last mentioned Act, and also to Endlich on Statutes secs. 271-273; 18 DeLorimier, Code Civil, art. 2232, p. 536 ; Dalloz R\u00e9p. vo.

Beaudry ([4]) ; Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v City of Montreal ([5]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellants, as empowered in such cases, caused the sheriff, in August, 1902, to seize a certain lot of land belonging to the respondents for the recovery of a special assessment imposed upon it by an assessment roll which had been deposited in the office of the city treasurer on the 20th of February, 1895, over seven years before.\nThe respondents by an opposition asked the annulment of the seizure on the ground that the appellants' claim was prescribed and extinguished.\nThe judgment of the court of appeal, confirming the judgment of the Superior Court, maintained that opposition and quashed the seizure.\nThese judgments are in my opinion unassailable.\nSection 231 of the appellants' statutory charter of 1889 (52 Vict. c. 19 Que.) which, it is admitted, governs the case, provided that\nthe roll of assessment, when finally settled by the commissioners, shall be filed and kept of record in the treasurer's office ; and such special assessment shall thereupon become due and may be recovered by the corporation.\nBy section 120 of the same Act, it was enacted that the right to recover any tax or assessment imposed under the Act was to be prescribed and extinguished unless the city within three years * * to be counted from the time at which such tax or assessment became due, had commenced an action for the recovery thereof, or had initiated legal proceedings for the same purpose under the provisions of the Act provided that in case any special assessment is made payable by annual instalments, the prescription runs only from the expiry of each such instalment.\nThese enactments were clear and unambiguous, and prim\u00e2 facie, the appellant's rights to the proceedings in question were prescribed and extinguished in 1902 when they were initiated.\nThey contend, however, that it is not so, for the reason that the respondents, availing themselves of the provisions of section 144 of the Act, had filed within six months from the date of the deposit of the said roll a contestation thereof, by which contestation, not finally determined till the 15th of June, 1901, they, the appellants, as they allege in their plea in answer to the respondents' opposition\nwere hindered, impeded and delayed by the respondents in the collection of the said assessment.\nBy that section 144 it was enacted that:\nAny municipal elector, in his own name, may, by a petition presented to the Superior Court, demand and obtain, on the ground of illegality, the annulment of any by-law, resolution, assessment roll or apportionment ; but the right-of demanding such annullment is prescribed by six months from the date of the passing or completion of such by-law, resolution, assessment roll or apportionment ; and, after that delay, every such by-law, resolution, assessment roll or apportionment shall be considered valid and binding for all purposes whatsoever, provided that the subject matter thereof be within the competence of the corporation.\nThe appellants contend that they had not the right to take proceedings for the recovery of the assessment in question until the final adjudication, in June, 1901, of the respondents' said contestation of the roll authorized by that section.\nBut, as held by the two courts below by the judgment now appealed from, and previously by the judgments in The City of Montreal v. The Land & Loan Co. ([6]) where the same question was raised, that contention cannot prevail. It is contrary to the plain words of the statute. It probably is therein a casus omissus, the propriety of supplying which has since been acknowledged by the legislature in the appellants' subsequent charter of 1899 (62 Vic. c. 58, sec. 408, Que.). But the statute of 1889 must be taken as it was. We cannot add to it or mend it, and by construction fill up gaps and make up its deficiencies, however apparent they may be, and nowhere in its various clauses is there the least indication that the law-giver intended to suspend the appellants' right to take proceedings for the recovery of any assessment for six months, or till after the determination of a contestation of the whole roll. Quite the contrary. As it reads, it is unequivocal. The prescription runs from the date that the assesment became due, says sec. 120, in so many words.\nNow, in this case, the assessment became due in 1895, and might then have been recovered according to the plain language of sec. 231. If the appellants then or at any time within three years thereafter had issued a writ against the respondents, the sale would perhaps have been stayed by order of the court or of a judge till the final determination of the contestation of the roll. But they had the right to issue the writ were it merely to interrupt the prescription. Art. 1086 C.C. ; 32 Laurent, Nos. 20 et seq. And no plea of lis pendens could have prevailed against it. Bioche, Proc\u00e9dure vo. \" Exception,\" No. 134. An order for consolidation under Art. 291 of the Code of procedure would probably have then been the proper proceeding The appellant vainly relies upon the maxim, \"Contra non valentem agere\" The city had the right to issue the writ ; therefore the maxim has no application.\nThis section 144 is nothing but an enactment as to the mode by which, the time within which, and by whom, a common law right of action can be exercised. (There is no such thing as a rule to quash in such cases in the province). And an action impeaching the validity of such a roll would not suspend the prescription running against the city's right to recover the assessments for the good reason that its right to initiate proceedings for the recovery of the assessments would not be affected by that, action. A debtor cannot have it in his power to deprive his creditor of his right of action, as the appellants would contend.\nCertainly, as argued by the appellants, prescription does not run against a debt depending upon a condition until such condition happens. But why? Because a conditional debt is not exigible until the fulfilment of the condition. And the appellants beg the question in their argument on this point. They assume that this is a conditional debt. But that is the very point in controversy. And they have failed to establish that the statute imposed any condition whatever upon the maturity of the assessment, or on their right to recover it as soon as the roll was deposited. The forced construction of it that they contend for is based on nothing else than the alleged unreasonableness of enabling them to recover upon a roll which might subsequently be set aside. But with that we have nothing to do. The law-giver has the power to be unreasonable. And the courts are not at liberty to read into a statute clauses or conditions that are not in it simply because they think that they ought to be in it. When a statute is so plain, it has to be given effect to, whatever may be the consequences.\nHere the statute decrees not merely that the assessment became due but also that it may be recovered immediately after the deposit of the roll creating the debt, and gives the remedy, the right to collect it immediately. And when it adds that the prescription runs from the date that the assessment became due, using the same expression, or when payable by instalments from the date of the expiry of each such instalment, that cannot but be construed as if it said, in so many words, that the prescription runs from the date of the deposit of the roll, or from the expiry of each instalment, if any, and this, whether the roll later on is contested or not, for, if the legislature had intended such a contestation to suspend the appellants' rights, it would have said so, as it has since said in the statute of 1899.\nThen, were the non-contestation or the dismissal of a contestation to be considered as a condition, the legislature had the right to say that the assessment would be due and could be recovered before the fulfilment of the condition. And that is what it did, in the public interest, by the enactments in question.\nAnd what shews that there was a debt, a sum unconditionally due upon the deposit of the roll and that could then be recovered, even if the roll were to be subsequently contested and annulled, is the provision of sec. 241 that, in that case, the payments made under it, whether by the contesting party or by anyone else, are not to be invalidated. The city is not then bound to restore what it had received :\u2014and why ? Because what it had received was due, though the roll has been annulled. That shows clearly that the debt is not a conditional one, depending upon the validity of the roll. Art. 1088 C. C. What is called a special assessment roll is nothing but the apportionment of the amount due to the city among the different proprietors of the immovables belonging to the parties benefited by the local improvement. Secs. 209, 213; sub-secs. 8, 14, 17, 18, 228, 238, 241. The appellant, I observe, claims, under sec. 118 of the Act, interest on the amount of the assessment in question from 1895, or so much of it as is not prescribed. Now, it can only be because the assessment was unconditionally due and payable in 1895, according to the words of that section, that they have a right to the interest from that date. And if it was then due and payable so as to carry interest moratoires because the respondents who were then liable for it, were in default, en demeure, the appellants must have had the right to take proceedings to recover it. And, as the prescription against them began to run concurrently with their right to take such proceedings, and as they did not take any until over three years after, they are out of court.\nThe appellants' further contention that this special assessment is not such a tax or assessment as is, under any circumstances, prescribed by three years, but that it is prescribed by thirty years only, must also be dismissed. The words of sec. 120, \" Any assessment under this Act \" include a special assessment made under the Act. Then when the same section adds :\nProvided that in case any special assessment is payable by annual instalments, the prescription of three years runs only from the expiry of such instalments\nthat makes it still clearer that special assessments like the others are prescribed by three years. The contention that it is only when such special assessments are payable by instalments that the three years prescription applies, but that if they are payable en bloc, they are prescribed only by thirty years, would be untenable. Yet that is what the appellants' arguments on this point would lead to.\nFurther, the words \"such special assessment \" in section 231 refer to the roll simply called assessment in that and the preceding sections 228, 229, 230. Now if a special assessment is an assessment under the Act in those sections, the word \" assessment\" in section 120 must likewise include special assessments. And the right to contest an assessment roll given by sec. 144 has, by the appellants themselves and by a uniform jurisprudence, always been considered as applying to special assessment rolls.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting) :\u2014This appeal involves an important question of prescription of a municipal tax and is far from being free from difficulty. It has already divided the judges of the Province of Quebec, and it is not surprising that the judges of this court are not unanimous. Briefly told, the facts, which have been admitted by the parties, are as follows :\u2014\nOn the 20th February, 1895, a roll of special assessment for the widening of Notre Dame Street, west, section 2, was deposited in the Treasurer's Office of the City of Montreal, by virtue of which a total sum of $205,426.73 was assessed upon all the proprietors interested, and a sum of $24,245.43, with interest amounting to $7,273.63 was claimed from the heirs Cantin, gr\u00e8ves de substitution, as their share. On the 8th Aug-est, 1895, they, together with a large number of other proprietors, about twenty-five in number, presented to the Superior Court a petition praying for the annulment of the roll, and in a subsidiary manner that all the proprietors, and especially the petitioners, \" les propri\u00e9taires d'immeubles dans les dites limites et en particulier vos requ\u00e9rants,\" were not subject to certain charges and payments set forth in the petition, and finally that the said roll be sent back to the commissioners for the preparation of a new roll, allowing a deduction of said charges and payments \u00e0 ce que le dit r\u00f4le soit renvoy\u00e9 devant les dits commissaires pour pr\u00e9parer un nouveau r\u00f3le, en y faisant les r\u00e9ductions ci dessus indiqu\u00e9es.\nAfter four years of unexplained delay, probably caused by a hope that the Quebec legislature would pass a declaratory Act, namely, on the 26th October, 1899, the city pleaded to the petition which was finally dismissed in toto by a judgment of the Court, rendered on the 29th of June 1900, and confirmed in Review on the 15th of June 1901. That was the end of the contestation of the roll so far as the petitioners and the respondents in particular were concerned.\nThere remained, however, another contestation of the roll by the Guy estate, which was likewise dismissed by the Superior Court and finally by the court of appeal, by judgment of the 20th of January, 1903. This case may yet be pending before the Privy Council, for what we know, and possibly the roll may yet be annulled ; but it is certain that at that date and when the seizure complained of was made, to wit, on the 1st of October, 1902, it was still pending and undecided.\nIt was contended at the argument that this court cannot take notice of this Guy contestation, as it is not pleaded by either party. I think it is covered by the plea of the appellants, but it is undoubtedly set up by both parties in written admissions which practically constitute a special or stated case under article 509 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as they were made in order to discuss the questions of law raised by the opposition and the contestation of said opposition and The present cause. These admissions were considered in the courts below, not only without objection, but by consent. Even if I am mistaken in the view I take of the effect of these admissions, I think it would be in the interest of justice and within the intention of the parties, as above expressed, to order an amendment of the opposition.\nOn the 10th of September, 1902, the sheriff of Montreal seized certain lands of the respondents to levy the amount of their special assessment with interest. On the 2nd of October they fyled an opposition afin d'annuler for two reasons. First, because the lands are not seized and advertised to be sold subject to the substitution or substitutions with which they were charged : Secondly, because the debt of assessment is prescribed and extinguished.\nThe first ground has been rejected by all the courts, and correctly rejected under article 781 of the Code of Procedure. The substitutions alleged by the appellants, not being opened, cannot possibly be affected by a sheriff's sale. The judges were unanimous upon this point, but not so upon the second ground which affords a very remarkable conflict of opinions. We will be able to appreciate them better after the clauses of the charter of the City of Montreal are quoted.\nClause 231. The roll of assessment, when finally settled by the commissioners, as aforesaid, shall be filed and kept of record in the city treasurer's office ; and such special assessment shall thereupon become due and may be recovered by the corporation in the same manner as the ordinary taxes and assessments which it is authorized by this Act to impose and levy.\n120. The right to recover any tax, assessment or water rate, under this Act is prescribed and extinguished, unless the city within three years, in addition to the current year, to be counted from the time at which such tax, assessment or water rate became due, has commenced an action for the recovery thereof, or initiated legal proceedings for the same purpose under the provisions of this Act ; and the privilege securing such tax, assessment or water rate avails to the city, notwithstanding any lapse of time, for the recovery of any sum which may, by any judgment, be awarded to the city, for such tax, assessment or water rate ; provided that in case any special assessment is made payable by annual instalments, the prescription runs only from the expiry of such instalment. 144. Any municipal elector, in his own name, may, by a petition presented to the Superior Court, demand and obtain, on the ground of illegality, the annulment of any by-law, resolution, assessment roll or apportionment ; but the right of demanding such annulment is prescribed by six months from the date of the passing or completion of such by law, resolution, assessment roll, or apportionment ; and after that delay, every such by-law: resolution, assessment roll, or apportionment shall be considered valid and binding for all purposes whatsoever, provided that the subject matter thereof be within the competence of the corporation.\n238. When any roll of assessment or apportionment made by commissioners to defray, in whole or in part, the cost of any improvement under the provisions of this Act, is annulled by competent authority, the city may cause a new roll of assessment or apportionment to be made by commissioners appointed and acting as hereinbefore provided with regard to commissioners for expropriation. And all the provisions of this Act, with respect to the making, revision and completion of any such assessment or apportionment, and to all matters incidental thereto, shall apply to such assessment or apportionment ; provided always that proceedings for the making of any new roll of assessment or apportionment shall be commenced within six months from the date of annulment of the previous roll.\n241. Whenever a roll of assessment or apportionment for any street improvement shall be annulled and set aside, the payments made under authority of the same shall not be thereby invalidated ; but such payments, with interest added, shall go to the discharge of the respective amounts to be fixed by the new assessment roll, subject, on the part of the ratepayers, to making good any deficiency, or to receiving back any surplus according to the difference that may eventually exist between the old and the new roll of assessment ; and the present provision shall apply as well to special assessment rolls heretofore made as to those which may be made hereafter.\nThe contention of of the respondents in effect is that, if under these enactments their petition for annulling the roll had been maintained, they would still be liable for their due share of the cost of the expropriation to be settled by a new roll, but as they set up an unfounded opposition to the roll they are liberated in toto by lapse of time. This result, if true, reminds me of the old game \"qui perd gagne \", which, I hope, will never hold good in a court of justice. On two occasions the courts of Quebec have been called upon to pronounce upon this question, and, although divided, they have maintained that prescription commences to run from the day of the deposit of the roll under section 231, and that it is not interrupted nor suspended by its contestation, both as to ratepayers contesting or not.\nThe point came up first in the case of the City of Montreal v. The Land and Loan Co. ([7]), a ratepayer who had not contested the roll. On the 15th January, 1903, Mr. Justice Doherty decided that the prescription of three years was well taken. The learned judge held that article 2232 of the Civil Code did not apply, as the city could proceed to collect, notwithstanding the contestation. He makes no reference to any other article of the code. In appeal, this judgment was confirmed purely and simply, Boss\u00e9, Hall and Wurt\u00e8le JJ., Blanchet and Ouimet JJ. dissenting ([8]). Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 for the majority said :\nQue dans les cas ordinaires, la prescription ait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquise, ne peut souffrir de doute. Les termes du statut, 52 Vic. ci-haut cit\u00e9s, ne sau raient \u00eatre plus clairs, ni plus imp\u00e9ratifs.

Il n'y a l\u00e0 mandat ni expr\u00e8s, ni tacite, et la contestation faite par Joseph n'int\u00e9ressait au proc\u00e8s que lui seul, sans pouvoir en aucune mani\u00e8re lier les autres contribuables.\nL'on objecte des raisons d'inconv\u00e9nient ; mais il ne peut y avoir inconv\u00e9nient, car la corporation avait trois ans pour r\u00e9clamer contre les autres propri\u00e9taires, et elle ne doit s'en prendre qu'\u00e0 elle-m\u00eame de la position qu'elle s'est faite. Mr. Justice Blanchet dissenting :\nEn permettant \u00e0 tout int\u00e9ress\u00e9 de contester le r\u00f4le, en son nom, et d'en demander la nullite (sec. 144) non pas seulement quant \u00e0 lui, mais pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de ses coint\u00e9ress\u00e9s ainsi que le contestant l'a fait, la charte, par exception au droit commun, confiait \u00e0 celui qui conteste un mandat sp\u00e9cial qui constitue en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 tous les autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s demandeurs conjoints.

(S.R. Q. ch. 2, sec. 13.)\nMr. Justice Ouimet, also dissenting, was of opinion that a special assessment for street improvements is not a tax or assessment within the meaning of section 120 of the charter. We have decided the contrary in Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v. The City of Montreal ([10]).\nIn the case under consideration, which is one between the city and one of the rate prayers contesting, Mr. Justice Robidoux, who rendered the judgment of the Superior Court, likewise maintained the prescription of three years, and that it was not interrupted by the contestation; the question of suspension was not considered :\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il est \u00e9dict\u00e9 par Particle 231 de la charte de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1889) que les sommes payables en vertu d'un r\u00f4le de cotisations sp\u00e9ciales deviennent dues d\u00e8s le moment que ce r\u00f4le a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau du Tr\u00e9sorier de la Cit\u00e9 par les Commissaires qui apr\u00e8s avoir d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9s de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'expropriation, sont ensuite tenus de pr\u00e9parer le dit r\u00f4le de cotisations sp\u00e9ciales.\nConsid\u00e9rant que c'est le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1895 que le dit r\u00f4le de cotisation sp\u00e9ciales a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau du dit Tr\u00e9sorier de la Cit\u00e9 par les dits Commissaires.\nConsid\u00e9rant que c'est \u00e0 partir de la dite date du 20 f\u00e9vrier 1695 qu'a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir la prescription de la dite somme de $24,245.43.\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'aux termes de l'article 120 de la dite Charte de ]a Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1889) le droit de recouvrir toute cotisation en vertu des dispositions de la dite charte est prescrit et \u00e9teint \u00e0 moins que la dite Cit\u00e9 dans les trois ans \u00e0 compter de l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de cette cotisation n'ait intent\u00e9 une action pour le recouvrement d'icelle.\nConsid\u00e9rant que le 18 ao\u00fbt 1902, date de la dite saisie du dit immeuble\u2014laquelle saisie para\u00eet \u00eatre la premi\u00e8re et seule proc\u00e9dure institu\u00e9e aux fins de recouvrer la dite somme de $24.245.43 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat\u2014il s \u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9 plus de trois ans depuis que la dite somme \u00e9tait devenue due en vertu du dit r\u00f4le de cotisations sp\u00e9ciales \u00e0 savoir depuis le 20 f\u00e9vrier 1895, date o\u00f9 le dit r\u00f4le de cotisations sp\u00e9ciales \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 comme susdit par les dits Commissaires au bureau du dit Tr\u00e9sorier de la dite Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al ;\nConsid\u00e9rant que les actes faits par un d\u00e9biteur dans le seul but de faire d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gal et nul le titre de son cr\u00e9antier ne son pas interruptifs de prescription et que partant la requ\u00eate en contestation du dit r\u00f4le de cotisations sp\u00e9ciales produite le 8 ao\u00fbt et dans laquelle Dame Elizabeth Benning, l'un des auteurs des dits opposants Cantin \u00e9tait en effet partie, n'a pas eu pour r\u00e9sultats d'interrompre la prescription de la dite somme de $24,245.43 (Art. 2224 C.C.).\nIn appeal this judgment appears to have been unanimously confirmed, Bosse, Blanchet, Hall, Ouimet and Charbonneau, ad hoc, JJ., no special reason being given. Mr. Justice Blanchet observes, however, that he only concurs in the result, entertaining the same views he expressed in the former case, but as, at the time of the seizure, there was the Guy contestation still pending, the city could not proceed to levy the assessment from the respondents. Mr. Justice Charbonneau is of the same opinion.\nThe clauses of the charter are undoubtedly ambiguous, but our duty is to reconcile ambiguous enactments, by giving them a reasonable and even liberal interpretation, so as to give effect to all. C. C. art. 12 ; Que. Rev. St., Int. Act. Pres. Title, ch. 2, s. 13. This sound principle, as old as legislatures, was followed recently in a remarkable Privy Council case, where the literal meaning of a clause of a statute was overlooked. Smith v. McArthur ([11]). All the cases agree that, in construing a section of an Act, regard must be had first to the language of the clause itself, and second to other clauses in the same Act, and that construction should be adopted which makes the whole Act stand consistently together or reduces the inconsistency to the smallest possible limits. See cases cited in Vol. 26, Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, vo. \" Statutes,\" (2 ed.) at page 616.\nAs I understand the above clauses of the charter, they mean this :\u2014A special assessment becomes due from the day of the deposit of the roll in the city treasurer's office (s. 231), and immediately prescription commences to run and continues to run, if the roll is not contested within six months. If it is contested the prescription is suspended pending the final judgment. This conclusion results from sections 144 and 238. It is not disputed if the contestation is maintained and the roll annulled. A new roll may be then made where the liability of the contesting ratepayer is continued, subjected to a new prescription (sect. 238). But the statute is silent as to the effect upon prescription of a judgment dismissing the contestation. Therefore, it is contended by the respondents, it continued to run as if no contestation had been made. This would certainly be a remarkable case of summum jus summa injuria.\nThe court of appeal holds that, pendente lite, the city was bound to proceed by action or seizure in order to interrupt prescription. If so bound as against the contesting parties, a fortiori will it be against the ratepayers not contesting. Hence the necessity of any number of actions or seizures, 100 or 200, or more\u2014at least as many as there are ratepayers assessed\u2014which would be perfectly useless if the roll be annulled. The Court of Appeals calls this state of affairs a mere inconvenience. It leads not only to great inconvenience, but to most absurd consequences which cannot be supposed to have been contemplated by the promoters of the charter or the legislature (26 Am. & Eng. Encyl. of Law, p. 648).\nOf course, as Lord O'Hagan said in a well known House of Lords case :\nWe must take care that a hard case shall not make bad law ; but . we must also take care that we do not attribute to Parliament the intention of injustice so very flagrant, without coercive necessity. River Wear Commissioners v. \u00c0damson ([12]) (H. L. 1877).\nIn The Queen v. The Judge of the City of London Court ([13]) Lord Esher M. R.said :\nIn my opinion, the rule has always been this\u2014if the words of an Act admit of two interpretations, then they are not clear ; and if one interpretation leads to an absurdity, and the other does not, the court will conclude that the legislature did not intend to lead to an absurdity, and will adopt the other interpretation.\nIs it not absurd to suppose that in order to accomplish one object, namely, the determination of the liability of the proprietors, two or more actions\u2014in this instance at least twenty-five\u2014would be necessary ; one by the dissatisfied debtors to the effect that the instrument of indebtedness be annulled, and the others by the creditor against all the debtors, contesting or not, praying for the payment of the debt? Especially, is it not preposterous to hold that prescription will be interrupted or suspended if the debtor's action be maintained, but that it will not, if it be dismissed. With due deference, such a state of affairs is contrary to reason, and cannot be attributed to men in their right senses, as members of a legislature are presumed to be. (26 Am. & Eng. Encyl. of Law, pp. 601, 648).\nI therefore consider, independently of the provisions of the Civil Code, and merely by giving a fair meaning to the statute, that prescription was suspended during the pendency of the contestation and that section 408 of the charter of 1899 is merely declaratory, to remove any possible doubt :\nWhenever any valuation and assessment roll, or special assessment roll, is. attacked or contested by proceedings, such proceedings shallbe held to interrupt prescription in respect to all such assessment rolls, until the date of the final adjudication upon or determination of such judicial proceeding.\nThe legislature has used the word \"interrupt\" instead of the more correct one \"suspend\" ; but it is immaterial in the present case, as both would preserve the right of the city to enforce the collection of the assessment.\nIt is especially when viewed by the light of the Civil Code that the true meaning of the above statutory enactments appears.\nI quite agree with Mr Justice Robidoux, confirmed in appeal, that article 2224 of the Civil Code does not apply, but not for the same reason, namely, that the opposition afin d'annuler was made \" dans le seul but de faire d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gal et nul le titre de son cr\u00e9ancier.\" Something else was demanded, namely, the confection of a new roll, and in any event, the modification of the first one. It seems to me that the true and, probably, the only reason why Art. 2224 C C. does not apply is to be found in Art. 2226 C. C., which declares that a judicial proceeding does not interrupt prescription if it be dismissed, as undoubtedly it was here.\nBut can we not find a cause for interruption of prescription in articles 2184, 2185 and 2221 of the Civil Code ? To my mind, the petition to annul the roll of assessment contains not only tacit but express allegations of an acknowledgement of the right to assess and a tacit renunciation of the benefit of the prescription which had commenced to run. The petitioners pray, first, that the roll be annulled ; but they knew that this meant not a liberation or discharge from the payment of the cost of the expropriation but the making of a new roll where the legal liability would be continued and adjusted. Finally they pray, in a subsidiary manner, that certain deductions be made from the first roll and, for that purpose, that it be referred back to the commissioners \"pour pr\u00e9parer un nouveau r\u00f4le.\" These allegations of the respondents amount to this : We owe our due share of the expropriation; but the roll is null and illegal and we demand that a new one be made ; and if this cannot be granted, we pray for certain deductions. The court, by judgment rendered in 1900, dismissed their demand and as a necessary consequence declared that their share of the tax was as stated in the roll.\nIt may be said that the acknowledgement in the petition to annul was of no avail to the appellants, as the prescription was not acquired. This would be true if the proceedings had ended then ; but, in 1899, instead of invoking prescription by an amendment to their petition or otherwise\u2014prescription being, available at any stage of the proceedings even in appeal\u2014 they joined issue with the city, persisted in the prayer of their petition as framed and, on the 7th of July, 1900, asked the Court of Review to reverse the judgment of the Superior Court and grant the prayer of their demand to annul the roll. All this appears in written admissions and establishes that the last act of interruption happened in 1901. The seizure by the sheriff was made in 1902, when the interrupted prescription was yet running. If these facts do not constitute tacit renunciation of prescription, then I do not know what that word means. Arts. 2227, 2184, 2185, 2264, C. C.\nPothier, Oblig. n. 693 says :\nPar quelque acte que le d\u00e9biteur reconnaisse la dette, cet acte interrompt la prescription.\nDunod, p. 58, adds that\ntoutes les fois qu'il se fait quelque-chose entre le cr\u00e9ancier et le d\u00e9biteur, le possesseur et le propri\u00e9taire, qui emporte un aveu expr\u00e9s ou tacite de la dette, du droit ou de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ce sera une interpretation civile.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, Droit 'Civil, Vol. 25, n. 520, (2 \u00e9d.):\nLa reconnaissance interruptive de prescription r\u00e9sulte de tout acte ou de tout fait contenant ou impliquant l'aveu de l'existence d'un droit. Elle peut \u00eatre, en effet, expresse ou tacite.\nFuzier-Herman, Code Annot\u00e9, art. 2221, Vol. 4, pp. 1262, 1263, summarizes the jurisprudence upon this point in the following paragraphs :\n7. Il faut observer d'ailleurs que les juges du fait peuvent induire la renonciation, tant des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la cause que du silence gard\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur en premi\u00e8re instance relativement au moyen de prescription.

V. supr\u00e0, art. 2220, n. 11.\nPrescription was not only interrupted, but it was also suspended. These two expressions are not synonymous. All the commentators of the French Code, similar in this matter to the Quebec Code, establish that they have a different meaning and effect. See Quebec Civil Code, arts. 2222 to 2231, and 2232 to 2239, also 2264; 32 Laurent, n. 77 ; 25 Baudry-Lacantinerie,. n. 365. Interruption means the entire destruction of the prescription running which recommences to run for the same time as before. Suspension, as the word indicates, merely suspends the running prescription. The expression is used to indicate cases in which the statute, after having begun to run, is suspended in its operation so that the time during which the statute ran prior to the period of suspension and the time elapsing after are alone to be counted against the creditor.\nMr. Justice Doherty and the majority of the court of appeal held in the case of City of Montreal v. The Land and Loan Company ([14]), that the contestation of the roll does not constitute the absolute impossibility to collect required by art. 2232 C. C. I believe that practically it does. What valid reason can be advanced to force the city to take hundreds of cases ruinous to all ? As many suits or seizures of a similar character and for the same object as there were proprietors, contesting or not, would be necessary. Such an absurd result could not have been contemplated by the legislature. It may be that the learned judges were right in the case before them, that of a ratepayer who did not contest the roll ; I express no opinion upon that case which is not before us ; but it seems to me that the parties who have contested the roll are bound by this contestation and its result. Evidently the city could not force the collection of the assessment against them until the contestion was finally disposed of. If undertaken by an action or a seizure, it would probably have been met by a plea of lis pendens setting forth all the grounds of nullity alleged in the petition to annul the roll, and its demand would be not simply stayed, but dismissed with costs under article 173 of the new Code of Procedure, or article 136 of the old Code. At all events, the ratepayer contesting the roll will be entitled by dilatory exception to a stay of proceedings till the rendering of the decision of the court on his contestation, and will thus prevent the city from enforcing the payment of the assessment pendente lite (art. 177 C. P. Q.) The same course would be necessary at least against all proprietors contesting, a most absurd state of affairs which, in my opinion, amounts to absolute impossibility to proceed. The present case, therefore, falls strictly within the exception of article 2232, namely, that it was absolutely impossible for the city, in law, to act effectively, utilement, to use the expression of French decisions quoted later on. It is the application of the old well known Roman law maxim which is to be found in all systems of jurisprudence: \"Contra non valentem agere nulla currit pr\u0153scriptio\" The French Code, art. 2251, different from art. 2232 of our Code, did not retain the maxim. It merely declares that prescription runs against all persons, unless they fall within some exception established by law. The jurisprudence has however maintained the old rule with the limitation resulting from the word \"absolute\" contained in our article.\nOn the 21st of May, 1900, the Cour de Cassation held that : La prescription ne court pas contre celui qui est dans l'impassibilit\u00e9 absolue d'agir par suite d'un emp\u00eachement quelconque r\u00e9sultant soit de la loi, soit de la convention ou de la force majeure. P. F. 1900, 1,431.\nSee also Troplong, Pres. vol. 2, n. 701 ; 5 Zachari\u00e9, par. 848; Merlin, R\u00e9p. S. 1, par. 7, art. 2, quest. 10 and 11 ; Dalloz. R\u00e9p. Supp. vo.

Here again the reason of the exception is the absolute impossibility for the creditor to move. The code has, however, specially provided for this particular case. Article 2236 C.C. says :\nPrescription of personal actions does not run with respect to debts depending on a condition, until such condition happens.\nAs I read the various statutory enactments relating to the prescription of a special assessment in the City of Montreal, I find that they are subject to the happening of an event which may or may not come, namely, the contestation of the roll. If no contestation be lodged within six months, the prescription continues its course till accomplished. If a contestation be made, prescription will be suspended pending the litigation. This necessarily results from sections 144 and 238.\nThe provision of article 2236 C.C. was borrowed, word for word, from article 2257 of the Code of France, where its scope and effect have been fully considered by the highest courts and jurists. I will refer to a few of these decisions: Cass. 20th Feby. and 15th July 1839 ; S.V. '39,1,215,575 ; 26th May, 1856 ; S.V. 57, 1,820 ; Cass. 14th Feby. 1888 ; S.V. 90, 1,313 ; Cass. 28th Oct. 1889 ; S.V. 91, 1,293 ; Troplong, Pres. Vol. 2, n. 686 ; Leroux de Bretagne, n. 512,592. A decision of the Cour de Cassation of the 22nd June, 1853, is quite in point. A doubt having arisen as to the applicability of a canal tax or toll, both parties referred the case to the Conseil d'Etat, the competent tribunal, for determination, it being agreed that, in the meantime, no other proceeding would be taken. The court held, 1st: That prescription had been suspended pending the decision in consequence of the said agreement ; and 2ndly, that independently of the agreement and by force of law, prescription was suspended by the proceeding or instance before the State Council, where the validity of the title of the creditor was at stake. Dalloz 1853, 1,302 :\nLa Cour : Sur le premier moyen: Attendu que l'arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 a reconnu et constat\u00e9, en fait, qu'il \u00e9tait intervenu entre les parties des conventions dont le but \u00e9tait de suspendre toutes poursuites jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le conseil d'Etat e\u00fbt statu\u00e9 sur la port\u00e9e du titre en vertu duquel le droit \u00e9tait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 : qu'en induisant de ces conventions que la prescription n'avait qu'\u00e0 courir au profit des demandeurs, l'arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 n'a viol\u00e9 ni faussement interpret\u00e9 les articles invoqu\u00e9s ; Que c'est avec la m\u00eame raison que le dit arr\u00eat a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la prescription avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue par suite du litige soulev\u00e9 sur le titre lui-m\u00eame, puisque, pendant cette instance, la personne du d\u00e9biteur \u00e9tant incertaine, le cr\u00e9ancier ne pouvait utilement agir.\nThe commentators and arr\u00eatistes who have noted this decision, refer only to the last moyen which they express as follows :\nJug\u00e9 que la prescription d'un droit qui repose sur un titre dont la validit\u00e9 est contest\u00e9e demeure suspendue pendant l'instance en validit\u00e9 du titre. Gilbert sur Sirey, Code Annot\u00e9, ed. 1870, p. 573, art. 2257 ; Marcad\u00e9, art. 2257. See also Cass. 27th May, 1857, D. 57, 1,290.\nThe issue and the facts of the case as detailed in the report lead to no other conclusion, and no authority can be quoted which gives another meaning to this decision of the highest court of France. I am not aware that its soundness has been questioned by either courts or commentators. It is cited as law by the best authorities : Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9p. 1903, Vo. Pres.; vol. 31, p. 265 ; Pand. Fr. R\u00e9p. 1903, Vo. Pres. vol. 45, p. 507 ; S.V. 1902, 1,133, note 1-2.\nWith regard to the Guy contestation, Mr. Justice Blanchet and Mr. Justice Charbonneau held that as long as it is not finally disposed of, the city cannot levy the tax even from the respondents who have been unsuccessful in their petition to annul. It is true that, if the Guy estate succeeds, a new roll may become necessary as to all the proprietors, the respondents included ; but this does not mean that they are parties to that case, and that the assessment is not payable as to all who did not contest, or at least those who having contested have been put out of court. As to the latter at least, there is chose jug\u00e9e and they have no other course to adopt than to pay. If the roll be annulled at the suit of the Guy estate or any other proprietor, then the respondents will find their relief in section 241 of the charter. This clearly results from our judgment rendered last December on a motion to quash an appeal for want of jurisdiction in the case of The City of Montreal v. The Land and Loan Company ([15]).\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the opposition afin d'annuler of the respondents dismissed with costs before all the courts.\nDAVI ES J., concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting):\u2014I must say I have felt very great doubt and difficulty as to this case, but I have come to the conclusion that the opinion of my brother Girouard is the correct one. It appears to me that the debt does not become due on the roll when a person assessed properly disputes it until that dispute is solved and that, in any event, the person so disputing cannot be h ead to say at the time the court declares the roll valid and binding on him that no debt is due from him in respect to it.\nKILLAM J.\u2014I agree entirely with the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice for the dismissal of this appeal ; but on account of the importance of the case and the differences of opinion in this court and the courts below, I desire to add some further considerations.\nThe prescription given by section 120 of the city charter of 1889 applied to,\nthe right to recover any tax, assessment or water rate under this Act.\nSection 81 of the Act authorized the council to make by-laws to impose and levy an assessment on immovable property liable to taxation in the city, not to exceed one and a quarter per cent of the assessed value of such property, and also to impose and levy a business tax on trades, professions, etc., and certain special taxes upon those engaged in particular kinds of business. By section 82 these assessments and taxes were to be payable annually and at the times fixed by such by-laws.\nSection 260 authorised the imposition of rates for the use of water.\nSections 228-231 provided for the making of special assessments of the kind now in question.\nBy section 1 of the Act :\u2014\nWhenever the following words occur in this Act, they shall, unless the context otherwise requires, he understood as follows : * * * * * * *\nThe word \"assessment\" shall mean the rates annually levied upon immovable property in the city generally ; The words \"special assessment\" or \"apportionment\" shall mean the assessment levied, from time to time, upon certain proprietors for local improvements;\nThe word \"tax\" shall mean the personal duty or license fee levied upon trades, business professions or occupations generally.\nThe \"special assessment\" is certainly within the generic term \"assessment\". While there was an advance by the city of the whole cost of an improvement, one half of which was eventually to be borne by certain property holders only, their proportion of the cost was to be imposed upon them by the sovereign authority vested for the purpose in the governing body of the city. It was as much an assessment upon them as was the imposition of any contribution for ordinary municipal purposes. The benefit being considered to be greater to them than to the city at large, they were made liable to the imposition of a greater proportion of the burden. That was deemed the fairest mode of apportioning the cost of a particular civic improvement.\nWhen a general term, like \"assessment,\" is assigned in a statute a narrower meaning than it would have in its ordinary sense, excluding some of its species, the draftsmen requires to exercise great care to escape its use in the general sense. In such a case a slight indication may be sufficient to warrant the ascribing to it of its full natural meaning. The definition is qualified. It is \" unless the context otherwise requires.\"\nSection 120 refers to\nthe right to recover any tax, assessment or water rate under this Act.\nAnd the proviso at the end refers to a \"special assessment\" as if it had been included under the previous language. It is not merely an enactment that, in case of a special assessment payable by instalments, there shall be a similar period of prescription running from the maturity of each instalment. It seems to assume that special assessments are included in the previous part of the section ; it is a proviso apparently framed to qualify or explain the prior terms ; it speaks of \" the \" prescription, as if that previously provided was applicable ; it states that it is to run u only from the expiry,\" etc., as if otherwise it would be different. In my opinion the context sufficiently indicates that a special assessment of the kind now in question comes within the word \" assessment \" where first used in the section.\nThe period of prescription ran from the time at which the \"tax, assessment or water rate became due.\" It did not run from the time that proceedings could be taken to collect the tax, assessment or water rate. Different methods and different times were fixed for recovery from different sources. In order to a sale of immovables, there must, whether under the Act of 1889 or under that of 1899 (which was the one in force when these proceedings were taken), have been some tax, assessment or rate in arrear for a year.\nIn respect of all these various taxes, rates and assessments express provisions were made either directly fixing or authorizing the council to fix the times when they should respectively become due. And in the case of a special assessment the time was explicitly fixed by the statute. Section 231 required the assessment roll to be filed with the city treasurer, and provided that \"such special assessment shall thereupon become due.\"\nIf there had been nothing in the Act to qualify these provisions it would be absolutely clear that the period of prescription would run from the times thus respectively fixed for the maturity of the claims.\nThe argument for the city is, however, that section 144 of the Act of 1889 postponed the commencement of the period of prescription, either by postponing the due date of the assessment or by interposing an obstacle to its enforcement. The section was as follows :\n144. Any municipal elector, in his own name, may, by a petition presented to the Superior Court, demand and obtain, on the ground of illegality, the annulment of any by-law, resolution, assessment roll or apportionment ; but the right of demanding such annulment is prescribed by six months from the date of the passing or completion of such by law, resolution, assessment roll, or apportionment ; and after that delay, every such by-law, resolution, assessment roll, or apportionment shall be considered valid and binding for all purposes whatsoever, provided that the subject matter thereof be within the competence of the corporation.\nThis section did not relate exclusively to assessments. It had not for its object to fix the times of their maturity. It was general and dealt with other than financial matters.\nThe sections numbered from 140 to 148 came within a portion of the Act designated as \"Title XV.\" having the heading \" By-laws\" and beginning with section 140 which authorized the city council to make by-laws on a great variety of subjects.\nIt appears to me that nothing in section 144 affected in any way the time of the coming into force of valid by-laws, resolutions, assessment rolls or apportionments. It dealt with the method of attacking such matters for illegality and fixed a limit of time within which this could be done. The portion of the section making them valid and binding after the specified delay was not needed in order to make valid and binding by-laws, resolutions, etc., which were legal and valid when made. And it could not have been intended for that purpose. They would be so without any such provision. To hold the council's by-laws and resolutions suspended in their operation until the expiry of the six months, and then until the disposition of proceedings attacking them, would. be to paralyze the hands of the civic authorities.\nThe proceedings to annul for illegality the assessment roll in question failed. This established that the roll was valid and legal from the beginning. The proceedings were begun within the necessary six months, so that the expiration of six months gave the roll no greater force than it had when filed with the treasurer.\nThe last of the conditions upon which it could be said that the debt depended, under art. 2236 of the Civil Code, happened with the filing of the roll. It was not a debt with a term, but one payable immediately upon its coming into existence.\nArticles 2222-2231 C. C. deal with the causes which interrupt presenption articles 2232-9 C. C. with the causes which suspend the course of prescription.\nThe causes of interruption are divided into \"natural\" and \"civil.\" By its definition \"natural interruption\" does not apply to a case like the present. The specified causes of civil interruption are judicial demands, renunciation of the benefit of a period elapsed and acknowledgement by the debtor.\nThe judicial demand, under article 2224 C. C is one served on the person whose prescription it is sought to hinder, not upon the person whose claim may be prescribed. And as the petition was dismissed, it cannot, by the terms of article 2226. C. C., be treated as having interrupted the prescription. Seizures, set-offs, interventions and oppositions are considered as judicial demands. Even if the contestation of the petition to annul the roll could be treated as an opposition within this article, that contestation was not put in until after the expiration of the period of prescription. \"The result of the proceeding was only the dismissal of the petition, which merely established the validity of the assessment roll when made and filed and involved no adjudication upon the continuance of its effect.\nThe petition did not acknowledge the right. It contested it.\nBy article 2232 C. C.,\nprescription runs against all persons, unless they are included in some exception established by this code, or unless it is absolutely impossible for them in law or fact to act by themselves or to be represented by others.\nI am quite unable to discover any reason for believing that the petition to annul the assessment roll interposed any obstacle to proceedings for the enforcement of the assessment either against the petitioners or against other property holders affected. It seems to me that, if they had been taken in time and opposition entered, the only relief would be by an appeal to the discretion of the court, which might have stayed the proceedings if the petition had seemed to raise sufficiently substantial questions.\nIf the mere filing of a petition to annul an assessment roll would suspend its operation or effect, equally a petition to annul a by-law or resolution would suspend the operation or effect of the by-law or resolution, a result which would leave the city at the mercy of any elector in cases in which a short delay might be of serious importance.\nNotwithstanding the authorities to which my brother Girouard has referred, I am unable to agree with him that the pendency of this petition had the effect of either interrupting or suspending the prescription.\nThe summary in Dalloz, 1853,1, 302, of the case there mentioned, does not appear to me to show the circumstances sufficiently to warrant its being taken as a direct decision that the pendency of any collateral litigation questioning the title to or existence of a right or debt operates ipso Jacto to prevent the owner or creditor from taking direct proceedings to enforce the right or debt. The reason there given\npuisque, pendant cette instance, la personne du d\u00e9biteur \u00e9tant incertaine, le cr\u00e9ancier ne pouvait utilement agir,\nappears to limit the decision to a case of that character, although the summary of the case does not clearly show in what the uncertainty of the person consisted, And further it was thought that le cr\u00e9ancier ne pouvait utilement agir. It was not that it was absolutely impossible for him to act, as the Quebec code requires.\nIn the present case the prescription was expressly made to run from the time at which the assessment became due, not from the accrual of the right to enforce it, which would be a year later. Neither the city charter nor the Civil Code expressly interposed any obstacle to proceedings upon the claim or to the running of the prescription ; and, in the absence of any clear, well-known principle of law to that effect, I cannot think that the existence of such an obstacle should be implied.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Coyle & T\u00e9treau.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Brosseau, Lajoie, Lacoste & Quigley.\n[1] Q.

Before any appeal was instituted, the plaintiff filed a written offer to accept a reduction of $2,590, persisting merely in $410 for special damages to date of action, with costs, and reserving the right to claim all subsequent damages, including damages for permanent depreciation, but without admitting that the damages suffered up to the time of the action did not exceed the whole amount actually recovered. This offer was refused by the defendants as it did not affect the costs and contained reservations, and an appeal was taken by them, on which the Court of King's Bench, in allowing the appeal, reduced the amount of the judgment to $410, reserved to*plaintiff the right of action for subsequent special damages and damages for permanent depreciation and gave full costs against the appellants, on the ground that they should have accepted the renunciation filed.\nHeld, Davies J. dissenting, that the Court of King's Bench erred in holding that the defendants had no right to reject the conditional renunciation and in giving costs against the appellants ; that the action should be dismissed as to the $2,590 with costs, and the reservation as to further action for depreciation disallowed, but that the judgment for $410 with costs as in an action of that class, with the reservation as to temporary damages accruing since the action, should be affirmed. As the costs at the enqu\u00eate were considerably increased on account of the large amount of damages claimed, it was deemed advisable, under the circumstances, to order that each party should pay their own costs thus incurred.\nHeld, also, that, although the nuisance complained of was caused by the defendants acting under rights secured to them by special statute, yet, as there was negligence found against them upon evidence sufficient to support that finding, the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non l\u0153das applied and the powers granted by their special charter did not excuse them from liability.

The said damages and depreciation in value (of which no detail can at present be given) amount to at least $15,000.00.\nWherefore plaintiff brings suit and prays that the defendant be adjudged and condemned to pay to the plaintiff the said sum of $15,000.00 with interest and costs of suit and of exhibits.\nAfter issue joined and a long enqu\u00eate, the Superior Court gave judgment against the appellants for $3,000 as well for the respondent's personal damages as for the damages to her property by the depreciation of its value.\nBefore an inscription in appeal by the appellants, the respondent produced upon the record an offer of renunciation to $2,590 of the judgment so rendered for $3,000 in her favour by the Superior Court. That offer is couched in the following terms :\nThe above named plaintiff, with a view to avoid costs, appeals and uncertainty, hereby offers to renounce part of the judgment for $3,000.00 herein rendered on the eight day of January instant, to wit, the sum of two thousand five hundred and ninety dollars, persisting in the said judgment for the remainder thereof and costs, to wit, for the sum of four hundred and ten dollars ($410.00) in satisfaction of the damages mentioned in her declaration in this cause, caused and accrued and suffered prior to the 26th November, 1901 (other than permanent depreciation in value of the property) and costs, but at the same time, reserving to herself to claim hereafter from the defendant the amount of all damages subsequent to the said last mentioned date including the amount of such permanent depreciation as may be established ; and she hereby tenders to the defendant a renunciation as aforesaid.\nThese presents being made for the reasons hereinabove stated are not to be taken as an admission either that the damages do not exceed the sums above mentioned or that the said judgment is not well founded.\nWitness the signature of the said plaintiff, this 15th January 1903.\n(Signed) HARRIET S. KERR.\nThe appellants refused to accept that offer ; First, because it did not cover the costs on the dismissal of the largest part of the action ; Secondly, because the offer was a conditional one, and was made subject to a reserve of the right to bring another action for the same cause, and brought on their appeal upon which the judgment now complained of by them was rendered. It reads as follows :\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'intim\u00e9e demanderesse a clairement prouv\u00e9 qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 troubl\u00e9e dans la jouissance de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par la faute de la d\u00e9fenderesse, et que ce trouble r\u00e9sultait des inconv\u00e9nients qui provenaient du fonctionnement des machines construites par lappelante sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 voisine de celle de l'intim\u00e9e ;\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'appelante a ainsi viol\u00e9 les lois du voisinage et est responsable des dommages que l'intim\u00e9e a subis ;\nConsid\u00e9rant que ces dommages (en dehors de la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur laquelle il n'y a pas d'adjudication) s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent, \u00e0 venir au vingt-six novembre mil neuf cent un, \u00e0 la somme de quatre cent dix dollars ;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'avant l'institution du pr\u00e9sent appel, l'intim\u00e9e s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9e de cette partie du jugement qui lui accordait des dommages \u00e0 raison de la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et a consenti \u00e0 ce qu'il fut r\u00e9duit a la somme de quatre cent dix piastres :\nConsid\u00e9rant que dans les circonstances le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure rendu a Montr\u00e9al, le huit janvier mil neuf cent trois, doit \u00eatre r\u00e9duit a ce montant de quatre cent dix piastres, avec d\u00e9pens d'une action de cette classe ;\nMaintient l'appel, mais avec d\u00e9pens contre l;appelante ;\nConfirme le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure jusqu'a concurrence de quatre cent dix piastres avec int\u00e9r\u00eat de la date du dit jugement et les d\u00e9pens d'une action de quatre cent dix piastres en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e\u00bb et la cour donne acte a l'intimee de la reserve faite dans le dit desistement pour le recouvrement des dommages subs\u00e9quents au 26 novembre 1901 et ceux resultant de la depreciation de la propri\u00e9te pour valoir ce que de droit.\nA preliminary objection to our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal was taken by the respondent on the ground that, by her renunciation, the amount demanded is now $410 only. There is nothing however in this objection. The original demand was for $15,000 and the conditional renunciation to a part of her claim not having been accepted, the controversy as to the amount claimed remained as it had been before the Superior Court. It was quite open to her, notwithstanding her offer, to cross appeal and ask judgment for a higher sum than the $3,000 that the Superior Court had given her. The appeal taken by these appellants to the Court of Appeal was from a judgment for $3,000, in a case where the amount demanded originally was $15,000. The case is therefore clearly appealable. We have not to determine what would be the consequence as to our jurisdiction if the renunciation had been accepted.\nAs to the merits of the appeal, the judgment a quo seems to me erroneous.\nThe respondent's offer of a conditional renunciation not having been accepted by the appellants, their appeal, as I said, was from a judgment condemning them to $3,000 and the respondent had the right, on that appeal, to treat that offer as out of the record, as it had been expressly made without admission, and to insist upon keeping the judgment of $3,000 that she had recovered in the Superior Court. And that is what she did. And not only did she ask the confirmation of that judgment in tato and the dismissal of the appeal, but added in her factum before that court :\nThe undersigned would only add that upon the evidence the award (of $3,000) has been very moderate and that the evidence would have justified a condemnation for over $5,000.\nHowever, not having cross-appealed, she could not expect more than a confirmation of her judgment for $3,000.\nThe Court of Appeal, refusing to adjudicate upon that part of the respondent's claim for damages caused by the depreciation in value of her property and to dismiss the action pro tanto, allowed the appeal however for an amount of $2,590 as being so much given for that depreciation in value by the Superior Court, and deducted that sum from the $3,000 awarded by the Superior Court, leaving the small balance of $410 to the respondent. These figures were taken from the ipse dixit of the respondent, for the judgment of the Superior Court allows her $3,000 en bloc. However, they may be assumed to be correct for the purposes of this appeal.\nNow, what the appellants complain of is that though their appeal was so allowed as to $2,590 out of $3,000, yet they were condemned to pay all the costs of the trial and of the appeal on both sides upon the ground that they should have accepted the respondent's offer to renounce that part of the judgment, and, as another ground of grievance, that the non-dismissal of the action as to the $2,590 and the reservation granted by the Court of Appeal to the respondent of the right of bringing another action against them for these $2,590 is unjust and unlawful.\nIn my opinion, on both these grounds, their appeal should be allowed. The respondent had no right to that reservation, and the appellants were justified in refusing her offer coupled with it as it was. The action had been tried and judgment given by the Superior Court as well for the damage caused by the depreciation in value of respondent's property as for the other part of her claim ; and the Court of Appeal had not the right to refuse to adjudicate upon that part as well as upon the other simply because the respondent asked them conditionally not to do so. She was not, upon the. record, entitled to this sum of $2,590, as she now admits, by not cross-appealing for it here and by asking us, on the contrary, to confirm the judgment.\nNow, having so failed as to that part of her claim, upon what ground could she ask the court to reserve the right to her of vexing and harassing the appellants a second time for the same cause ? She says in her factum : It was in view of the fact that the evidence at the trial did not make it clear to what extent the nuisance was attributable to defective construction or bungling which might he regarded as being of a temporary character, and to what extent it was attributable to a cause which would be certain to continue in permanent operation, that the respondent decided to relinquish as much of the judgment in her favour as represented permanent damage and to adhere to it only for an amount representing damages actually suffered prior to action brought.\nBut if she had not proved her case as to that part of her demand it should have been dismissed by the Superior Court. And she then would have no right io another action.\nThere is no reason, that I can see, for reserving her that right. Her claim, if not proved, not having been dismissed by the Superior Court ought to have been dismissed by the judgment of the Court of Appeal. By her offer of renunciation, she said to the appellants : \" I will abandon my judgment for the $2,590, because I may not have given sufficient evidence of the depreciation in value of my property and the Court of Appeal might reverse it, but only if you consent to my suing you again for it.\"\nSuch an offer the appellants had the right to reject, and the Court of Appeal erred in holding the contrary.\nFurther, the appellants were not bound to accept the respondent's offer of renunciation for the additional reason that it did not cover the costs occasioned by her claim for the $2,590 that she offered to renounce. By her demand of $15,000, now conceded to have been grossly excessive and unfounded to the amount of $14,590, she tripled, if not more, the appellants' costs of defence to her action.\nNow, by the judgment a quo not only have they ta bear the burden of their own costs, but they are also mulcted, in addition to all the costs of the appeal ou both sides, with all the respondent's costs occasioned by her claim for the $2,590, although they succeed on that part of the case. To so put on the appellants the consequences of the exaggeration of the respondent's original claim is a manifest injustice to them. And though the allowance of the appeal will affect principally the costs ; Archbald v. Delisle ([22]) ; yet, as the Court of Appeal came to the determination of giving them all against the appellants on the erroneous ground that they should have accepted the respondent's conditional offer of renunciation, we must interfere and redress the injustice that the appellants would suffer if the judgment were to stand. Then the appellants are entitled to have the reservation to the respondent of the right to another action for the depreciation in value of her property struck out of the judgment.\nAs to the $410 to which the appellants are con demned for personal damages to the respondent, there is nothing in their contention, based on the decision of the Privy Council in the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy ([23]), that they are not liable because they were acting under their statutory charter. There is a finding of negligence against them on this part of the case, in support of which there is ample evidence, and their charter does not authorise them to be negligent. The maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non ladas has to be read into it.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal, dismiss the action as to $2,590 with costs, strike out of the judgment the reservation in favour of respondent of another action for the depreciation in value of her property ; reservation of action for damages accrued since first action, if any, to stand ; judgment against appellants for $410 with interest from the date of che judgment of the Superior Court, and costs of an action of that class to stand. As to the costs of the enqu\u00eate, as it would otherwise create difficulties in the taxation, I would order that each party pay his costs thereof.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014The two substantial points submitted by the appellants as defences to this action for damages arising out of an alleged nuisance caused to respondent and her property by the operation of appellants' water-pumping station were:\u2014First, that they had legislative authority to commit the nuisance, if nuisance there was, and :\u2014Secondly, that no nuisance had been committed.\nOn both points, in my opinion their contention is untenable. They had no legislative authority to erect their pumping station on any particular piece of property, but a general power to do as a company, in this particular, what a private person could do. In doing what they did they are clearly responsible, just as private persons would be for all damages caused thereby to their neighbours.\nAs to the amount of these damages, they were assessed by the Superior Court at three thousand dollars.\nThe present appellants then appealed to the Court of King's Bench, persisting in their claim of immunity from an action such as this and in their contention that the plaintiff had not sustained any damage.\nBefore the appeal was inscribed, the plaintiff, the present respondent, offered in writing to give up $2,590 of the judgment awarded her by the Superior Court and thus reduce her judgment to $410. This $410 which the plaintiff thus offered to accept was expressed to be in satisfaction of the damages caused to her up to the commencement of the action, other than permanent depreciation in value of her property. In the same writing, she expressly reserved to herself the right to recover all subsequent damage, together with. any permanent depreciation she could establish.\nThe appellants refused to accept this offer, partly on the question of costs and partly because of the reserve made, and persisted in their appeal.\nThe Court of King's Bench maintained the legal contention of the plaintiff as to her right to bring the action for such damages as she had sustained up to the commencement of the action, which they assessed at $410, but allowed the appeal for $2,590, as being the amount allowed for depreciation of the plaintiff's property by the Superior Court. They also gave the plaintiff her costs in the Superior Court as for an action brought to recover the actual amount allowed by them and damages and on appeal.\nI am not disposed, with the facts we possess, to interfere with the judgment below on the question of costs simply. I think the judgment of that court on the substantial questions of law and fact was correct and that they were right in making the reservation they did in the plaintiff's favour as to future actions for damages for depreciation of property. It may well be that the appellants will so improve the working of their pumping power that all reasonable ground for complaint will be removed and the future damages to the plaintiff's property largely decreased, possibly reduced to a minimum. Or they may remove the site of the pumping power to another place, or they may persist in going on as at present. But, in any contingency, the plaintiff's rights were properly conserved by the Court of King's Bench by the reservation made by it in its judgment appealed from.\nI think that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : White & Buchanan.\nSolicitor for the respondent : A.

The questions so answered did not specially refer to accident insurance, but the policy provided that the statements in the application should constitute warranties and form part of the contract.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, the Chief Justice dissenting, that \" accident insurance \" is not insurance of the character embraced in the term \"insurance on life \" contained in the application and, consequently, that the questions had been sufficiently and truthfully answered according to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words used, and, even if the words used were capable of interpretation as having another or different meaning, then the language was ambiguous and the construction as to its meaning must be against the company by which the questions were framed.

C. Smith K.C. and Claxton for the appellants, cited Arts. 2485, 2490, 2587 C. C. ; McKay v. Glasgow & London Ins. Co. ([2]) ; McCollum v. Mutual Life Ins. Co, ([3]) ; Anderson v.

B: and at p. 16 per Martin B. ; Confederation Life Association v. Miller ([10]) per Gynne J. at page 344 ; Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association v. Foster ([11]). THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting) :\u2014I would allow this appeal and dismiss respondents' action.\nBy the express terms of the policy, the answers and statements contained in the written and printed application for it are made warranties and part of the contract. In the application it is stipulated that any false, incorrect or untrue answer, any suppression or concealment of facts in any of the answers * * shall render the policy null and void and forfeit all payments made thereon.\nNow Muir, by not mentioning-the two accident policies on his life when asked what was the amount of insurance he then carried on his life, told a half truth equivalent to a falsehood. And when being further asked if there was any other insurance in force on his life (besides the six he had previously mentioned) he answered \"No.\" That answer was not true. There was no ambiguity in the questions. And whatever popular notions may be on the meaning of the words \" life insurance,\" whatever classifications encyclopedias or books of any kind may think proper 'on the subject, the indisputable fact remains that these answers did not disclose all the truth.\nI fail to understand how the respondents can reasonably contend that Muir's life was not insured by these two companies when they have to admit that Mrs. Muir might have got $20,000 from them because his life was covered by their policies. They were conditional insurances, certainly, but so are all life policies more or less. No amount of reasoning, or of cases or of books, can convince me that Muir told the truth when he said that his life was insured in only six companies and in no other.\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs, provided that the judgment below be reduced by the amount of the unpaid half-yearly premium.\nDAVIES J.\u2014Ever since the argument of this appeal I have entertained the gravest doubts as to the decision which should be rendered. Subsequent reflection upon the arguments and consideration of the cases which seemed more or less to bear upon the issues have not removed these doubts. Under these circumstances I will acquiesce in the judgment of the majority of the court dismissing the appeal.\nSo far as the question of setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to evidence is concerned I should have been disposed to allow the appeal. It did appear to me from the evidence that the verdict was not one which reasonable men could under the circumstances fairly find. I understand, however, that my brethern do not concur in this view.\nWith respect to the legal question whether the deceased had truthfully or untruthfully answered the question put to Mm at the time he made his application for insurance as to the amount of insurance he then carried on his life, I have had very grave doubts. The untruth alleged was withholding the existence of the two accident policies carried by the deceased. These two policies became payable on his death from the gun-shot wounds unless they were intentionally inflicted, and that they were not so has been disposed of by the verdict of the jury which the courts have refused to disturb. The two accident policies were carried by the deceased at the time he made his application, and one of them at least has been paid to his wife, the beneficiary. Did the withholding of them in the answer to the question as to the amount of insurance then carried on his life amount to an untruthful answer ? I quite concede that as the answer was made a warranty and the basis of the contract it must be true in point of fact and not true simply according to the declarant's sincere conviction or belief. As Lord Fitzgerald tersely put the point in Thomson v. Weems ([12]), it must be\ntrue iu fact without any qualification of judgment opinion or belief.\nBut then again as Lord Watson says in the same case at p. 687 :\nThe question must be interpreted according to the ordinary and natural meaning of the words used if that meaning be plain and unequivocal and there be nothing in the context to qualify it. On the other hand if the words used are ambiguous they must be construed contra 'proferentes and in favour of the assured.\nI have not been able to satisfy myself that the words used are so plain and un-ambiguous as to justify me in dissenting from the opinion of a majority of my brethren and reversing the judgment of the court below. I therefore acquiesce.\nNESBITT J.\u2014This action was brought to recover $8,500 on a policy of insurance on the life of one Muir, and two questions are involved in the appeal, namely: (1) whether Muir died by his own act, by shooting himself, on the 14th November, 1902, and ; (2) that Muir omitted to inform the company that he carried, on his life, insurance for $10,000 in the Travellers' Life and Accident Company and $10,000 in the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Company.\nThe case was tried by a jury and a verdict was found by ten of the jurymen against the defence of suicide, which verdict has been sustained by the Court of Review and the Court of King's Bench. Notwithstanding the very able argument addressed to us by the appellants' counsel in favour of an order for a new trial, I do not think it is a case where that power should be exercised, as it is not a case where the evidence so strongly preponderates against the verdict as to lead to the conclusion that the jury have either wilfully disregarded the evidence or failed to understand or appreciate it.\nOn the second ground the defence is based upon a question and answer in the application worded as follows :\nE. State amount of insurance you now carry on your life, with name of company or association, by whom granted and the year of issue ? (Enumerate each).\nCanada Life, $1,000, paid up ; Manufacturers Life, $5,000, 1901 ; Standard Life, $3,000, 1901-2; Imperial Life, $3,000, 1902; New York Life, $5,000, 1902 ; British Empire, $8,500, 1902.\nThe canon of construction to be applied in considering such a question and answer is of course that the language is to be read in its plain, ordinary and natural signification and that if there is any ambiguity, such ambiguity is to be resolved against the company who framed the question and in favour of the applicant. See Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association v. Foster ([13]). 1 think reference may usefully be had to two other questions in the application, namely, 6 A and 7 C.\n6A. Have you ever applied to any company, order or association for insurance on your life without receiving the exact kind and amount of insurance applied for ? (If yes, give particulars). Ans. No.\n7C. State whether any company has refused to restore a lapsed policy on your life ? (If yes, give particulars). Ans. No.\nLight is thrown upon the meaning of the words \" insurance on your life\" by reference to the Insurance Act, E. S. C. (1886), ch. 124, sect. 4, which provides that\nno company or person except as hereinafter provided, shall accept any risk or issue any policy of fire or inland marine insurance or policy of life insurance, or grant any annuity on a life or lives or receive any premium or carry on any business of life or fire or inland marine insurance in Canada, without first obtaining a license from the minister.\nAnd section 49 provides that\nin the case of any policy other than life, fire or inland marine policy, permission to carry on such business shall be obtained from the minister with the approval of the Governor in Council, who shall determine in each case the terms upon which such permission is to be granted.\nAnd section 10, in the case of life insurance, provides, amongst other things, that the deposit in the hands of the minister shall be a sum sufficient to cover all liabilities to policy holders in Canada, and the full reserve or re-insurance value of outstanding policies. By the amending Act, 1889, 62 & 63 Vict. ch. 13, sec. 2, ss. b, \"accident insurance\" is defined to mean insurance against bodily injury and death by accident, including the liability of employers for injuries to persons in their employment, shewing that statutory recognition is given to the view that a policy of life insurance is not an insurance for a single year with a privilege of renewal from year to year. by paying the annual premium, but is an entire contract of insurance for life, subject to discontinuance and forfeiture for non-payment of any of the stipulated premiums, etc.\nI find in a recent leading work, Lefort \" Contrat d'assurance sur la vie \" 1893, vol. 3, on pages 18-19, that author stating as follows :\nLa prime \u00e9tant le prix de l'assurance, son taux devrait varier chaque ann\u00e9e ; il tombe sous le sens qu'au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'une personne vieillit ses chances de mortalit\u00e9 vont en augmentant. N\u00e9anmoins et \u00e0 juste titre, car dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es le chiffre aurait pu \u00eatre excessif, il a paru plus pratique et plus rational de ne pas tenir comte des diff\u00e9rences qui se produisent d'ann\u00e9e en ann\u00e9e et de rendre la prime uniforme. On reporte sur les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es une partie de ce qui serait \u00e0 payer pour les derni\u00e8res, en prenant la moyenne dea chiffres donn\u00e9s par toutes les primes pr\u00e9vues pour l'assurance vie enti\u00e8re et indiqu\u00e9es par les tables de mortalit\u00e9. Ce chiffre de la prime uniformis\u00e9e comprend deux parties ; l'une correspond \u00e0 la prime simple d'assurance pour l'ann\u00e9e, l'autre est destin\u00e9e \u00e0 parfaire l'insuffisance des primes futures, c'est qui constitue la r\u00e9serve.\nSo that the legislature and the text writers apparently concur in viewing \" insurance on life \" as of the character embraced in the answer excluding accident insurance.\nI have already drawn attention to the form of questions 6 A, and 7 C., in the application as indicating that the framers of the application took (if I may so describe it) the popular view of the meaning of \" insurance on life\", I refer particularly to the language of 7 C., which seems to me to be inconsistent with any other than the view that the framer of the application had in mind the ordinary life insurance policy of the character I have above described which had lapsed. I draw attention also to the language in the question E , in dispute, which speaks of \"year of issue\" indicating the same idea.\nSuppose a person bargained with another that in consideration of a loan of $10,000 he would carry \"insurance on his life\" to the extent of $10,000, it would scarcely be argued that if he tendered an accident policy for $10,000 he was fulfilling his contract, as the accident policy merely insures his life in case certain contingencies happen.\nTo my mind the answer to the question in this case is correctly given, but in any event if the meaning of the question is that contended for by the appellant, the language used is certainly ambiguous, and as I have said the dispute must be resolved against it. I adopt the language of Mr. Justice Gwynne in Confederation Life Association v. Miller ([14]), where on page 344 he says : The rule of construction is that the language of the warranty being framed by the defendants themselves the warranty must be read in the sense in which the person who was required to sign it should reasonably have understood it.\nIt follows that the appeal should be dismissed with costs, with the provision, however, that $113.99, the half yearly premium, should be deducted.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.

C.\u2014Sale of goods\u2014Deliver.\nThe construction of a contract for the sale of goods cannot be affected by the introduction of evidence of local mercantile usage unless the terms of the contract are doubtful and ambiguous.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe principal contention of the appellants was that, according to the mercantile usage of the port of Montreal, their contract with the respondents for the purchase of their season's cut of lumber was subject to certain conditions as to the times and places of deliveries, notwithstanding that the contract mentioned the place where the delivery of the lumber should be made and did not refer to any trade custom. The questions raised on the appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nMignault K.C. and Bisaillon K.C. for the appellants. The respondents by the prevailing usage and custom of merchants dealing in lumber at the Port of Montreal, were bound to await shipping instructions before forwarding the lumber. See Arts. 1013- L021 and 1024 C. C. We also rely upon The Midland Navigation Co. v. The Dominion Elevator Co. ([1]).\nAtwater K.C. and Buchan K.C. for the respondents. The contract is free from any doubt or ambiguity as to the place of delivery and as to time. It is evident from the nature of the transaction that the lumber was to be delivered, from time to time, as cut at the mills and according to the best facilities for shipping it forward. No unreasonable delay is charged against us, and no custom proved which, under our contract, could be binding upon us. We refer to articles 8 and 1016 C. C. ; Trent Valley Woollen Manufacturing Co. v. Oelrichs ([2]), at pages 692-693 ; Parsons v. Hart ([3]) ; Benjamin on Sales, pp. 130, 131, Rule 23 and p. 233, note 3 ; Blackett v. Royal Exchange Assurance Co. ([4]) ; Yates v. Pym ([5]) ; Roberts v. Barker ([6]) ; Clarke v. Roystone ([7]).\nSEDGEWICK J., concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs. GIROUARD J.\u2014En supposant que la coutume ou l'usage invoqu\u00e9 par les appelants serait prouv\u00e9\u2014ce que je suis loin d'admettre\u2014doit-il l'emporter sur la convention des parties ? Ce n'est que lorsque le contrat est ambigu que l'usage peut \u00eatre admis. Art. 1016 C.C.\nLe bois achet\u00e9 le 1er f\u00e9vrier 1901, est celui de la saison qui va suivre, livrable au quai du canal Lachine, Montr\u00e9al, (delivered on wharf, Lachine Canal, Montreal,) et les appelants soutiennent qu'\u00e0 raison de l'usage de la place cela veut dire que la livraison se ferait quand et o\u00f9 ils l'indiqueraient entre Qu\u00e9bec et le canal Lachine. Je comprendrais la force de cette pr\u00e9tention si le contrat et la loi qui le r\u00e9git \u00e9taient douteux. Il est vrai que la date pr\u00e9cise de chaque livraison n'est pas stipul\u00e9e ; la nature de la transaction ne le permettait gu\u00e8re ; mais le temps o\u00f9 elle pouvait \u00eatre faite \u00e9tait suffisamment indiqu\u00e9, puisque c'\u00e9tait la coupe de toute la saison qui \u00e9tait vendue et ne pouvait \u00eatre livr\u00e9e, d'apr\u00e8s la loi, que dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable apr\u00e8s la production. Il fallait plusieurs vaisseaux pour transporter une si grande quantit\u00e9 de bois et il n'est pas raisonnable de supposer que le vendeur se serait mis enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la merci de l'acheteur sur une mati\u00e8re aussi importante que la date des diverses livraisons. En l'absence d'une stipulation formelle \u00e0 cet effet, nous ne pouvons le pr\u00e9sumer.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance (Doherty J..) est d'avis que le contrat ne justifie pas la livraison partielle. Mais c'est la seule que le contrat avait en vue. Comment peut-on livrer en bloc un million et demi pieds de bois sci\u00e9 de jour en jour durant toute la saison, depuis mai jusqu'\u00e0 novembre. Il suffit d'\u00e9noncer une telle proposition pour la rejeter. C'est ce que la conduite des parties d\u00e9montre jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9vidence. La premi\u00e8re livraison fut faite le 14 mai et la derni\u00e8re le 27 novembre 1901, et entre ces deux dates les intim\u00e9s en firent pas moins de dix-huit qui furent toutes accept\u00e9es et regl\u00e9es sans difficult\u00e9 par billets apr\u00e8s chaque livraison. Il est vrai que g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les intim\u00e9s suivirent les instructions que les appelants leur addressaient, \u00e9tant m\u00eame de leur avantage de le faire. en faisant des livraisons le long de la route, par exemple, au quai Molson ou \u00e0 Maisonneuve, dans le port de Montr\u00e9al. Ces instructions sp\u00e9ciales \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour dispenser les intim\u00e9s de d\u00e9charger au quai du canal Lachine, lieu de livraison convenu.\nIl est arriv\u00e9, cepeudant, une fois ou deux, que ces instructions, n'\u00e9tant pas arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 temps, ne furent pas suivies, ce qui fut cause que les appelants perdirent quelques ventes, une entre autres, \u00e0 Longueuil. Il ne para\u00eet pas qu'ils aient fait des protestations ou m\u00eame des reproches aux intim\u00e9s pour ne pas avoir attendu leurs instructions. Enfin, quant au temps de la livraison, les appelants ne pr\u00e9tendent pas que ces deux barges en question leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9es dans uu d\u00e9lai inopportun et non raisonnable. La correspondance constate qu'ils retardaient cette livraison depuis un mois ;\nYou have been putting us off for about a month,\ndisent les intim\u00e9s aux appelants dans une lettre du 23 ao\u00fbt. Puis dans une lettre du 27 ao\u00fbt, ils ajoutent ;\nNow the season is getting pretty well advanced and we have a large amount of this lumber to ship yet, and the longer it goes now the harder it will be to secure boats and very likely we will have to pay higher freight.\nEn r\u00e9ponse, les appellants invoquent purement et simplement l'usage du commerce \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, qui certainement n'existe pas \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 les chargements devaient se faire. Ils soutiennent,\u2014et c'est l\u00e0 toute leur d\u00e9fense, telle qu'elle fut r\u00e9sum\u00e9e devant nous\u2014 qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas tenus de recevoir avant d'avoir envoy\u00e9 leurs instructions.\nOur pretention, (\u00e9crivaient-ils aux intim\u00e9s, le 23 ao\u00fbt,) is to receive the lumber bought from you when we need it during the present season of navigation.\nLa cour d'appel a rejet\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention et nous sommes de son avis. C'est surtout \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du lieu de la livraison que l'usage du commerce invoqu\u00e9 ne peut pr\u00e9valoir. Juger le contraire serait an\u00e9antir la convention \u00e9crite des parties.\nLa cour d'appel s'est aussi appuy\u00e9e sur le fait que les appelants avaient donn\u00e9 instructions aux intim\u00e9s et aux messieurs Price d'exp\u00e9dier le bois provenant des moulins de ces derniers le plut\u00f4t possible. Ils disent que ces instructions furent donn\u00e9es en juillet. M. Ovide Dufresne jure qu'elles le furent au commencement de la saison, mais qu'elles ne furent pas suivies, ce qui fut cause qu'il perdit une grosse vente, encore sans prot\u00eat et sans faire de r\u00e9clamation. Si la version de M. Dufresne est la seule exacte, ne doit-il pas s'en prendre \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, s'il n'a pas plus tard revoqu\u00e9 ces instructions et si les intim\u00e9s ont naturellement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu'elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es pour toute la saison. Il ne para\u00eet pas s'en \u00eatre expliqu\u00e9 autrement durant tout le cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9. Il se retranche derri\u00e8re la coutume, mais fut-elle \u00e9tablie, fut-elle m\u00eame incorpor\u00e9e dans le contrat \u00e9crit et quand au temps et au lieu de la livraison, il leur \u00e9tait bien permis d'y renoncer.\nLes appelants objectent que ce moyen n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9. Il ne l'a certainement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re sp\u00e9cifique. Se trouve-t-il compris dans l'all\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la d\u00e9claration qu'ils ont refus\u00e9 la livraison illegally and without right ? La cour d'appel a \u00e9videmment consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait que d'an d\u00e9tail de preuve. Le point ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance, du moins le juge Doherty n'en fait pas mention.\nVu qu'il r\u00e9sulte du t\u00e9moignage de l'un des appelants et qu'il ne peut lui causer aucune surprise, nous pourrions peut-\u00eatre ordonner un amendement \u00e0 la contestation. Nous croyons, n\u00e9anmoins, qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9. Nous basons notre jugement sur le premier moyen invoqu\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9s, que nous avons examin\u00e9 plus haut, savoir l'usage du commerce s'il existe, et son effet sur le contrat \u00e9crit des pa\nNous sommes donc d'avis de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of the Court of King's Bench for Quebec for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Ouimet.\nThe appellants interpret the contract as meaning that delivery was dependent upon the vendors (Fee) receiving special instructions from the appellants (Dufresne), as to its destination which might vary the contractual place of delivery. I do not so construe the contract.\nThe special place of delivery being agreed to, neither party could, of his own motion, change it.\nThe question was raised whether, under a proper construction of the contract, payment could be demanded until after the delivery of the entire season's cut which was agreed to be sold? But, apart from the fact that no such defence is suggested in the pleadings, I do not think the construction of the contract contended for by the appellants on this point is correct. The contract was as follows :\nMontreal, February 1st, 1901.\nMessis. Thos. E. Fee & Sou, of Ste. Hyacinthe, sell, and 0. Dufresne jr. & Fr\u00e8re, of Montreal, buy, all they will have of 6th quality spruce deals from different points on the St. Lawrence River, below Montreal, and also all they will have from same points of 1 in., 1\u00bc in., 1\u00bd in. and 2 in. of same grade ; quantities to be as follows :\n1,000,000 ft., more or less of 3 in. deals ;\n500,000 ft., more or less of 1 in. to 2 in. deals.\nThe above represents the 1901 season's cut; price for the whole eight dollars and fifty cents ($8.50), per M. feet, board measure, delivered on wharf, Lachine Canal, Montreal. Canal toll 3\u00be|c. per M. ft. payable by buyers. Terms 3 months note from date of delivery.\n(Signed in duplicate by each party.)\nThe lumber bought was all that Fee & Son (respondents), would have of a certain quality of dimensions of spruce deals\nfrom different points on the St. Lawrence River below Montreal, representing the 1901 season's cut.\nI think the contract clearly contemplated several deliveries of this lumber, probably many, and that Dufresne was entitled to have, and Fee to make, such deliveries at the place stipulated within a reasonable time after Fee had become possessed of any substantial quantity of lumber at any of the points on the St. Lawrence.\nThe contract as to payment may, I admit, be open to some doubt. But if Dufresne had, as I think he had, a right to exact delivery of lumber from time to time as Fee became possessed of it, and if these deliveries of separate parcels might be months apart and from different places, the payment clause should be construed with reference to this state of facts, and the \" date of delivery \" from which the three months note was to be given in payment, construed as meaning date of each delivery. This was the construction adopted by the parties all through the season as the proper one. The same principle of construction must be applied to payment as to delivery. If it is unreasonable to hold that Fee would discharge his contract by one delivery at the end of the season, so it is unreasonable to hold that, while Fee was compelled to make many deliveries of the lumber, he was only entitled to receive payment in the form of a note at three months after the final delivery of the season's cut.\nThe court of appeal found, as a matter of law, that the respondent Fee's construction of the contract was correct, but they also found, as a fact, that the lumber in dispute, and which Dufresne refused to accept or pay for, had been forwarded at the latter's express request, and that the quality was within the terms of the contract. I see nothing in the evidence to justify any interference with that finding.\nSince writing the above, I have read the reasons of my brother Girouard, from which I do not differ.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT and KILLAM JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by Girouard and Davies J J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Bisaillon & Brossard.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Buchan & Elliott.\n[1] 34 Can.

JOS. COOTE,\nN. W. Cor. Hastings & Westr. Ave.\"\nThe lots on the corner of the streets mentioned were, in fact, lots 9 and 10 in block 9, and were the only lots owned defendant; the trial judge found that these were the lots intended to be sold, and also that the words below the signature formed part of the receipt. In an action for specific performance of the agreement for sale of the lands:\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (10 B. C. Rep. 493), Killam J. dissenting, that the inaccuracy of the description in the receipt was a mere discrepancy which should be disregarded and the decree made for specific performance in respect of the lots actually bargained for between the parties.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia,[1], affirming the judgment at the trial maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiff to enforce specific performance by the defendant of an alleged agreement for the sale of lands as evidenced by a verbal agreement between them and reduced to writing in the form of the receipt recited in the head-note with a discrepancy, merely, as to the block of the subdivision in which the lots were situated. The defence was that it was intended to make a sale of lots 9 and 10, in block 10, which were on the north-east corner of Hastings street and Westminster avenue, while the plaintiff contended that the lots he purchased were on the north-west corner of those streets, viz., lots 9 and 10, block 9. The defendant also claimed that the words \"N. W. Cor. Hastings & Westr. Ave.\" at the bottom of the receipt were written there after he had signed it.\nOn the facts, the Chief Justice, at the trial, held in favour of the contentions of the plaintiff on both points, and made a decree in his favour which was affirmed by the judgment of the full court, on appeal[2], Irving J. dissenting.\nThe same questions were raised on the present appeal and are more fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nJoseph Martin K.C. for the appellant.\nDavis K.C. for. the respondent.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The principle on which I reach the conclusion to dismiss this appeal is that the signature of the vendor authenticates the entire document and this under the findings of the trial judge, on evidence which I think under the circumstances admissible, confirmed by the Supreme Court in British Columbia, covers the words at the foot of and below the vendor's signature. The findings were'that the appellant placed his signature to the document at a time when he saw the words below where he signed and that he signed seeing them there and intending to authenticate them as part of the memorandum or receipt. That being so and these words being written into the document must, I think, to have their natural and reasonable meaning, be read into the description of the property contracted to be sold and so that description would read \"the north west corner Hastings and Westminster Avenues, being Lots 9 and 10, Block 10, District Lot 196,\" or \" Lots 9 and 10, Block No. 10, District Lot 196, being the north-west corner Hastings and Westminster Avenues.\" Read into the description in any way the latter would then only apply to and describe one property, namely, that owned by the vendor, although the number of the Block (No. 10) would be at variance with the rest of the description. The whole description then obviously would not accurately apply in all its parts to both corner lots. But with the exception of the block number it would so apply accurately in all its parts to the only lands defendant owned. And I think, that being so, the written part of the description of the lands must prevail and the number of the block, either fraudulently or by mistake inserted, be rejected as Jalso demonstratio. And this not only on the ground that where the written words of a document are at variance with the figures used therein the former must in the absence of other determining evidence prevail, but also in my opinion because the words and letters \" N. W. Cor. Hastings and Westr. Ave.\" are the controlling words and must be held to describe the lands so definitely as to over-ride a mere conflicting number of a lot contained in the description of which the said controlling words form part.\nI adopt the language used by Lord Cairns in the case of Charter v. Charter[3], at p. 377, as to the class of cases where extrinsic evidence is receivable to enable the court to understand the language used by the parties. His Lordship was speaking of testamentary dispositions it is true. But I apprehend that the same principle there enunciated by him is equally applicable to contracts between parties. When so applied the language of the learned Chancellor would read : The court has a right to ascertain all the facts which were known to both parties at the time they entered into the contract and thus to place itself in their position in order to ascertain the bearingand application of the language they used and in order to ascertain whether there exists any land to which the whole description given in the contract can be reasonably and with sufficient certainty applied.\nApplying then this principle and reading into the description the words at the foot of the signature we find only one piece of land to which the whole description in the contract can reasonably and with sufficient certainty be applicable, and we reject either as surplusage or as Jalso demonstratio the number of the block either fraudulently or erroneously inserted leaving the description with this number rejected perfectly good and sufficient and applicable in all its parts to the lands in question.\nGIROUARD J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nNESBITT J.\u2014The trial judge found that the defendant signed the following receipt: \"VANCOUVER, June 28th, 1902.\n\"Received from James Borland the sum of ten dollars being a deposit on the purchase of lots 9 & 10 Block No. 10 District lot 196, purchase price twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00), the balance to be paid within (10 July) days when I agree to give the said James Borland a deed in fee simple free from all incumbrances.\nJOSEPH COOTE,\nN. W. Cor. Hayings & Westr. Ave.\"\nand that the words following the signature were on the receipt at the time of signing. He admitted parol evidence to show that the parties were dealing about the lots on the north-west corner of the streets mentioned, the defendant being the owner of the same, and that the defendant had furnished the plaintiff with a list showing the names of the tenants and the rents paid, and on his findings there is no doubt the parties were negotiating about the sale of the lots on the north-west corner and no other. Curiously enough the lots on the north-west corner are 9 and 10, Block 9, District lot 196, and so if you substitute 9 for 10 in the block number, the two descriptions are the same property. It also happens that the lots on the north-east corner are actually described as lots 9 and 10, Block 10, District lot 106, and so on the argument I thought it was a case of two specific properties described in the receipt, that is the north-east corner by proper lot and block description and the north-west corner as such, and, therefore, contradictory descriptions or rather two specific properties receipted for in which case no parol evidence would be admissible to shewr as an independent fact what the intention of the parties was. See remarks of Coleridge J. in Lobb v. Stanley[4], at page 582, In my view the trial judge's findings make it plain we must treat the whole receipt as authenticated by the signature; see Johnson v. Dodgson[5]; Evans v. Hoare[6].; Calon v. Caton[7]; and in that case the receipt is not to be held void if by any reasonable construction it can be made available, and it therefore would seem to be the case that you then have a description applicable to the property owned by the vendor with \" 10,\" by error, used for \"9\" in the block number. If you try to make the words available it must be as a part of description of property and so reading them they do describe the property in the north-west corner saving only an error in the block number ; in fact, make a perfect and true description of the only property owned by the vendor.\nI have read all the numerous cases cited and many others, but in none of them do you find the singular state of facts which exist here, viz., both properties being aptly described so as to raise an apparent case of two specific properties being bargained for and yet the last description being read into the document properly filling in and completing the description of the first when read along with it, saving an error in the block number only. I think the doctrine to apply is that of falsa demonst ratio nan nocet.\nI have had the advantage of reading the judgment of my brother Killam. The evidence was clearly admissible to show what the parties were dealing about, what was covered by N. W. corner, Westminster and Hastings Avenues, that such property was the only property owned by the vendor and therefore the only property he could sell or can be supposed to have intended to sell, and, therefore, it becomes a case of what is to be taken as the leading feature in the document as a description of the property bargained about. It is as if I sold lot 8, block 6, etc., and below my signature put \"Montagu House in which I live.\" Surely, on its being shown that the particular description was inaccurate, the inaccuracy would be treated as surplusage and a decree made for what I owned and was bargaining to sell. It is a case simply of identifying the property being bargained about.\nI would refer to Washburn on Real Property (6 ed.), 2316-2321; Hunt on Boundaries and Fences (5 ed.), 220-1; Loomis v. Jackson,[8]; Glass v. Hulbers[9]; Plant v. Bourne[10]; Shore v. Wilson[11]; Cowen v. Truefitt[12]; Hutchins v. Scott[13].\nThe judgment should be affirmed with costs.\nKILLAM J. (dissenting).\nThree questions arise in this case:\u2014\n1. Were the words below the defendant's signature part of the receipt signed by him?\n2. Are those words to be incorporated by construction into the description of the property referred to in the receipt?\n3. What was the land to which, upon a proper construction, the receipt referred?\nThe first and third of these are questions of fact; the second is a question of law. It is necessary to thus distinguish in order to determine properly the evidence which should be considered upon these different questions.\nAs a matter of abstract law it is quite clear that a signature, in order to be a signature within the Statute of Frauds, may be written upon any part of an agreement or memorandum. But when we come to consider the question of fact, as to whether all the words upon a particular piece of paper bearing a person's signature are to be taken as a part of the agreement or memorandum signed by him, the position of the signature may be of great importance.\nIn the present case I accept the findings upon this point of the courts below and treat the words and letters below the signature as a portion of the receipt to which the signature relates.\nThe court in British Columbia has read the receipt as if it described the property referred to therein as being situated at the north-west comer of Hastings and Westminster Avenues. It determined, as a matter of fact, that the land therein described was a parcel so situated and was composed of lots numbered 9 and 10 in a block numbered 9, in a certain district lot in the City of Vancouver, according to a known survey or plan.\nThe distinction between the questions of the construction of a document and the identification of what is therein referred to was clearly made in Lyle v. Richards[14].\nLord Cranworth L.C. there said (page 229).\nParcel or no parcel is a question for the jury, and it was properly left to them. But the judge was bound to explain to the jurymen for their guidance, what was the true construction of any documents necessary foi the decision of the question \"parcel or no parcel.\"\nIt was the duty of the judge to decide what was the true meaning of the language there used for describing the boundary line. But in order to adapt the description, contained in a lease or other instrument, of a boundary line (whether expressed by words or by a diagram) to the line in nature meant to be designated by the description, it is necessary to have recourse to parol evidence. The description in the deed cannot otherwise be identified with the thing intended to be described.\nAnd Lord Westbury (page 239):\u2014 In my opinion the evidence was clearly admissible. Upon,a question of parcel parol evidence is always received. The error here is latent, not being discovered until it is shewn by extrinsic evidence whatl,was the true site of the home incorrectly laid down on the map, and on a question of the extent or correctness of the parcels in a deed (which are a description of external objects) parol evidence, for the purpose of ascertaining the thing so described or referred to, is admissible.\nThe principle upon which extrinsic evidence is receivable for such purpose was shown in Charter v. Charier[15], and by the language of Tindal C. J in Shore v. Wilson[16] at pp. 565-6; and of Parke B., in the same case at pp. 556-8.\nUnder the interpretation which it placed upon the receipt, I should have little difficulty in accepting the court's conclusion of fact. In that view the case was one for the application of the maxim falsa demontratio non norel, and the conclusion was supported by such cases as Blague v. Gold[17]; Shore v. Wilson[18]; Miller v. Travers[19]; Hutchins v. Scott[20] ; and Doed. Dunning v. Cranstoun[21].\nIt is, however, upon the question of construction that, to my mind, the real difficulty of the case arises. Upon that question the oral evidence of the negotiations should not be considered. It must be decided upon the language of the document itself and evidence of the surrounding circumstances.\nIn both Shardlow v. Collerell[22] and Plant v. Bourne[23], to which reference has been made, the oral evidence of the property to which the negotiations had related, was held to be receivable for the purpose of identification but not for the purpose of construction. Among the surrounding circumstances may be taken, I think, the facts that, according to the only known survey or plan, lots 9 and 10, in block 10, were at the north-east corner of Hastings and Westminster A Avenues; that the parcel at the north-west corner was in block 9; that, after oral negotiations between the plaiutiff and the defendant, the former went away and reported to one Dawson, on whose behalf the plaintiff was acting; that Dawson drew up the receipt, putting at the bottom the letters and words \"N. W. Cor. Hastings and Westr. Ave.\" and leaving blanks for the numbers of the lots and block ; and that it was taken in this condition to the defendant who filled in the numbers as they now appear and placed on it his signature where it now is.\nThe letters and words below the signature are not connected in sense with the language above. Upon the face of the paper there is nothing to indicate that they have any reference to the description of the property from which they are separated by mention of the price, the time of payment and the agreement to convey. In order to make them applicable to any part of the receipt some connecting words must be understood or supplied.\nAnd when we find that the defendant inserted the figures in the body ot the receipt for the evident purpose of describing the property, paying so little attention to the bottom line as to write his signature above it, and that the figures do not describe the property at the north-west corner of the avenues named, it does not appear to me possible to read the bottom line as a portion of the description, to the other portion of which, expressly inserted by the signer, it would be directly contradictory. To thus make a description which involves the rejection as surplusage or falsa demonstratio of the very numbers inserted by the signer seems more unwarrantable than to treat the portion below the signature as not materially affecting or qualifying any part of the receipt.\nThe circumstances of ownership and the handing to the plaintiff of certain papers bearing memoranda apparently relating to the north-west corner property do not seem to me to suppily the defect.\nI do not think that the court can direct an amendment or alteration of the receipt so as to make it evidence of an agreement to sell the lands in block 9. Upon my interpretation the defendant, whether fraudulently or carelessly or otherwise, never signed any such agreement or any memorandum or note thereof, and the court cannot sign one for him or make him do so. As this point was not insisted upon by the respondent's counsel I do not discuss it further.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Martin & Weart.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bowser & Wallbridge.\n[1] 10 B.

I cannot but feel that the trial judge was affected in his view that negligence had been made out by reading the trial judgment in Mc Dowall v. The Great Western Railway Co.[1], reversed in 1903[2], and this case, like that, seems to me to fail for lack of proof that the negligence complained of was itself the affecting cause of the accident, and on the further ground that, granted negligence existed, the result was not what would reasonably be apprehended. See Sharp v. Powell [3]; Wood v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[4].\nI should have felt great doubt in holding the storm described came within the doctrine of vis major. See Garfield v. The City of Toronto[5], where Hagarty C.J. summarizes all the authorities to date as determining the vis major rule to be satisfied when what has occurred \" is extraordinary and that it could not reasonably be expected.\"\nThe evidence here would not have satisfied me as coming up to that standard. I do not feel, as I have said, confident enough to reverse and restore the trial judge and, so, when in doubt, affirm.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKILLAM J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be dismissed.\nAs I look upon the case it is one of fact only. The defendant committed no trespass or other actionable wrong in mooring his tug beside the plaintiff's. Whether any or how many or what class of men should have been kept on board, whether there should have been a watch, whether steam should have been kept up or other precautions taken, depended wholly upon the circumstances. The cases which have been cited to show that the absence of certain precautions was regarded as constituting negligence depended upon the particular facts and the respective situations of the vessels.\nViewing the evidence as a whole, I cannot find that the defendant was neglient, under the circumstances, in leaving the tug as he did. The storm that came up was one of exceptional violence and it is by no means certain that, without the observance of extreme and very unusual precautions, the injury could have been avoided.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor, Bradburn & Innes.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bowser & Wallbridge.\n[1] [1902] 1 K.

A light engine was at the time coming towards him on the track he wished to cross which struck and killed him. The light engine was moving slowly and showed a red light at the end nearest the conductor which would indicate that it was either stationary or going away from him. In an action by the conductor\u2019s widow she was nonsuited at the trial and a new trial was granted by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Davies and Killam JJ. dissenting, that as the light engine had been allowed to pass a semaphore beyond the station on the assumption, which was justified, that it would pass before the train came to a stop at the station, and as, if the deceased had not, contrary to rule, left the train while in motion, he could not have come into contact with said engine, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.\nHeld, per Davies and Killam JJ. dissenting, that the act of the deceased in getting off the train when he did was not the proximate cause of the accident and plaintiff was entitled to have the opinion of the jury as to whether or not deceased was misled by the red light.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario setting aside a non-suit and ordering a new trial. The facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nWaller Cassels K.C. for the appellants. The deceased did not take ordinary precautions to avoid injury and was the author of his own wrong. Jean v. Boston and Maine Railroad Co.[1]\nMoreover his disobedience of the rules of the company would bar recovery. Sloan v. Georgia Pacific Railroad Co. [2]\nJ.S. Robertson for the respondent, referred to Balfour v. Toronto Railway Co. [3]; Randall v. Ahearn & Soper[4]\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Nesbitt for allowing the appeal.\nDAVIES J (dissenting)\u2014After reading the evidence on which the trial judge non-suited the plaintiff together with the company\u2019s rules which were invoked by both parties, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons, given by Mr. Justice Garrow speaking for the Court of Appeal.\nI purposely refrain from a critical analysis of the evidence because it might prejudice the parties in case of a new trial.\nAssuming that the deceased conductor had, contrary to the rules, stepped on to the platform from his train before it had actually stopped, it is quite clear that such action on his part was not the causa causans of his death. He reached the space between his train and the reversing engine and tender safely, and it was what took place subsequently and was not necessarily the consequence of the too speedy stepping from the train which caused the death. In other words there was no necessary relation or casual connection between the breach of the rule in stepping off the train, if breach there was, and the accident which brought about deceased\u2019s death. Mr. Robertson\u2019s argument on this phase of the case was, to my mind, conclusive.\nIt was conceded without qualification by Mr. Cassells that the reversing engine and tender, which was running along an inside track between the deceased and the station house, displayed a red light instead of a white one, as required by the rules. This, to an experienced railway man, such as deceased was, would, under ordinary circumstances, indicate that the engine and tender were either stationary or were going away from him. It is, in my opinion, sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to have the question submitted to a jury whether or not, under the circumstances at the time, the deceased was misled and thrown off his guard and so excused from taking those precautions which under different conditions he would have been obliged to take to ascertain definitely whether the reversing engine and tender were running towards him or not. It was open to the jury to find, under the special circumstances of this case, that the crossing of the track by the deceased at the time he did might lose its character of negligence by reason of its being induced by the false signal, the red light, which might easily convey to him the impression in effect that the train was either stationary or receding from him. See Coyle v. Great Northern Ry. Co. [5], at page 425.\nNESBITT J.\u2014The negligence which must be charged against the defendants in this action must consist in the running of an engine reversely with a red light instead of a white one at the particular spot and at the particular moment that the accident occurred.\nThe man in charge of the semaphore proved that he allowed the light engine to proceed past the semaphore as, in his judgment, it would be in a position of safety before the incoming passenger train would stop and allow its passengers to alight. It is not disputed that his judgment in this matter was correct, and that, in fact, had the rules of the plaintiff company-been observed there would have been no negligence so far as this plaintiff is concerned, the negligence charged, as I have said, being the running of the engine with a red light at the particular spot and at the particular moment, causing the injury to the plaintiff. This seems to me to be the point entirely overlooked by the Court of Appeal. Had not the unfortunate deceased disobeyed the express rules of the company and stepped off the moving train there would have been no negligence in the engine being where it was. Both courts below have found that the train was in motion and did not come to a stop until the light engine had moved to a point beyond where the train stopped, and, therefore, the act of the conductor in stepping off the moving train produced the negligent situation charged. The semaphore man in allowing the light engine to proceed as he did had a right to assume the conductor would not get off the moving train, and, as I have pointed out, there was no negligence in any servant of the company in the engine being at the point it was at the moment of the accident. It was argued that when the conductor got off the train he was in a place of safety and was misled by the red light being displayed instead of the white one. This seems to me not to be the point in the case. The negligence, as I have pointed out, causing the accident, was the act of the conductor in disobedience of the rules stepping off a moving train, and bringing himself, therefore, into a situation where he had no right to be and the company had no right to expect him to be. It was not negligence, so far as he was concerned under the particular circumstances, to have the engine at the point that it was.\nIn my view the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge dismissing the action restored.\nKILLAM J. (dissenting.)\u2014I agree with the view taken by the Court of Appeal.\nThe act of the deceased in alighting from the train while in motion cannot, in my opinion, be taken as the proximate cause of the accident. If the deceased had remained where he alighted until the train stopped he would have been in the same position as if he had remained upon it; it was subsequent acts that brought him into danger. The most that can be said is that possibly he alighted so hurriedly and in such a manner as momentarily to disturb his mental equilibrium or render his faculties less acute than usual; and it may be that his attempt to cross the track was made too soon or that it was made without due care.\nThese questions, however, appear to me as proper for the consideration of a jury in connection with the fact of the use of the red light.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John Bell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Idington & Robertson.\n[1] 26 Am. & Eng.

He brought a person to the manager who was able and willing to purchase at the price mentioned and who, after some discussion, made a deposit on account of the price and proposed a slight variation as to the terms. They failed to close and the manager sold to another person on the following day. The broker claimed his commission as agent for the sale of the property having found a qualified purchaser at the price quoted.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (14 Man. Rep. 650) Taschereau C. J. and Girouard J. dubitante, that the broker could not recover a commission as he had failed to secure a purchaser on the terms specified. Under the circumstances, as the owner did not accept the purchaser produced and close the deal with him, there could be no inference of the request necessary in law as the basis of an obligation to pay the plaintiff a commission.\nPer Taschereau C.J. and Girouard J. That the general manager of a commercial corporation could not make a binding agreement for the sale of its real estate without special authorization for that purpose.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, ([1]), affirming the trial court judgment by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed with costs. The plaintiff is a real estate broker in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the defendants are a commercial corporation carrying on the business of wholesale dry goods merchants there. The defendants had built a new warehouse for the purposes of their business and it became generally known that their old premises were to be sold as soon as the new building was ready for occupation. Several real estate brokers were looking out for purchasers and the plaintiff applied to the general manager for the defendants and obtained from him a memorandum of the price asked for the property, the terms for payment, and probable date when the old premises would be vacated by the owners. Up to this time the corporation had not given the manager special authorization to offer the property for sale. The plaintiff found a person willing to purchase at the price stated, $70,000, and with the necessary means to do so and brought him to the manager to settle about the purchase of the property. They met in the managers office and had some conversation about the rentals and so forth, when the purchaser deposited $5,000 on account of the price, proposed some modification as to the date of delivery of the premises and they separated without closing the transaction. Shortly afterwards the defendants sold the property to another person for $71,000 and the deposit of $5,000 was returned. The plaintiff then brought an action against the corporation and the general manager to recover a broker\u2019s commission on the price of the sale. The action was tried before Killam C.J. without a jury, who found that the general manager gave the plaintiff particulars of the terms on which the property would be sold, knowing and expecting that the plaintiff asked for them with a view to finding a purchaser for a commission to be paid ; that he assented that the plaintiff should try to do this ; that he knew that the plaintiff was so trying ; that the plaintiff brought his purchaser and the manager together. He refused to find that the manager agreed to sell to this person on any terms, or that he settled with him on the terms proposed as those on which he or his company was willing to sell. The trial judge would not imply from the circumstances a request to the plaintiff to give his services for reward, or an agreement to pay him merely for finding and introducing a person who was ready and willing to purchase on the terms mentioned, or on those or other terms to be settled. The action was, accordingly, dismissed with costs. On an appeal by the plaintiff, the full court, Perdue J. dissenting, affirmed the decision of the trial judge by the judgment ([2]), from which the present appeal is asserted. Upon the appeal in the court below the plaintiff abandoned his claim against the general manager and consequently he is not now made respondent.\nEwart K.C. and Pitblado for the appellant. Under the contract, as found by the trial judge, all that the plaintiff had to do in order to earn his commission was to find a purchaser able and willing to buy the property at the price quoted and he did so. The purchaser, thus found, proceeded so far as to make a verbal contract as to the special terms of payment and delivery of the premises. There was no revocation of the plaintiff\u2019s authority until after he had earned his commission. In fact, as there were several brokers employed, the completion of the work by the plaintiff was a revocation of the authority of all others. Addison on Contracts (10 ed.) 888.\nThe commission was earned ; see Hart on Auctioneers (2 ed.) 321, 337,\u2019 371 ; Simpson v. Lamb ([3]) ; Prickett v. Badger ([4]); Bowstead (2 ed.) 189-190; Roberts v. Barnard ([5]) ; Green v. Lucas ([6]) ; Fisher v. Drewett ([7]) ; Wilkinson v. Alston ([8]) ; 4 Am. & Eng. Encyl. pages 967, 975 ; Bird v. Phillips ([9]) ; Kock v. Emmerling ([10]) ; Doty v. Miller ([11]).\nThe premises were a part of the plant or machinery of the business. The manager had absolute power in regard to the affairs of the company and entire control of them. See sec. 64, \u201c Manitoba Joint Stock Companies Act.\u201d His acts are binding on the company without the company\u2019s seal. The other directors were, in fact, consulted individually and gave their approval. The sale actually made was effected by the manager, without any resolution by the directors. The manager as agent of the company, had power by the by-laws, under the circumstances of the case, to enter into a contract for the sale of the land in question, without a formal resolution of the directors. However, the contract sued upon is not one for the sale of the property, but to find a purchaser for property belonging to the company, which it intended and desired to sell, and such a contract would come directly within the scope of the authority from the company to the manager giving him \u201c the entire control and management of the affairs of the company,\u201d and would be binding on the company. Howarth v. Singer Mfg. Co, ([12]); South of Ireland Colliery Co. v. Waddle ([13]) ; Wilson v. West Hartlepool Harbour Co. ([14]) ; Biggerstaff v. Rowatt\u2019s Wharf, Limited ([15]),\nHowell K.C. for the respondents. There was no promise by the respondents or by their manager to pay any commission and, as the proposed purchaser was not accepted, none can be inferred. In any event, the company did not authorise a sale through the plaintiff\u2019s agency and the manager of the company, a trader in dry goods, could not presume to deal in such a manner with its real estate as part of the ordinary administration of its affairs. Masten\u2019s Company Law pp. 237-238; Balfour v. Ernest (1). A broker to be entitled to a commission must be actually employed by the principal as broker. Bowstead on Agency, 176-9 ; 4 Am. & Eng. Encly. 970, and note; Cook v. Welch (2) ; Smith v. McGovern (3). He must establish his employment either by previous authority or by acceptance of his acts. Keys v. Johnson (4).\nThe plaintiff did not find a purchaser ready and willing to buy on the terms stated by the manager. See Grogan v. Smith (5), per Esher L. J. at p. 133 ; and Hamlin v. Schulte (6). The plaintiff was a mere volunteer to whom the company had assumed no responsibility. They were not obliged to accept any purchaser he might introduce, although he might be willing to subscribe to all the terms. If they had accepted the purchaser, and thus taken advantage of plaintiff\u2019s labour, then and only then would they become liable to remunerate him.\nWe also refer to Soper v. Littlejohn (7) ; In re Marseilles Extension Railway Co. (8) ; D\u2019Arcy v. Tamar, Kit Hill and Callington Railway Co. (9) ; Re Haycraft Gold Reduction and Mining Co. (10) ; Moody v. Tile London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co. (11) ; per ,Cockburn C. J. at page 292 ; Garland Mfg. Co. v. North-umberland Paper and Electric Co. (12) ; Curran v. \u0422he Rural Municipality of North Norfolk ([16]) ; Keighley Maxstead & Co. v. Durant ([17]) ; Toulmin v. Millar ([18]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am not quite convinced that the view of the case taken by Mr. Justice Perdue in the court below on the evidence of the agreement between the parties and the legal results therefrom is not the correct one. However, in my view of the case, that is immaterial for the determination of the appeal. I am of opinion that it must be dismissed upon the ground that stobart had no authority to bind the company by an agreement to pay Calloway a commission of over $1700 for introducing a purchaser whom the company might not accept and whose services might therefore be fruitless to them. Calloway knew very well that he was dealing with an officer of limited authority. And he must be assumed to have known that selling the company\u2019s real property is not within the usual powers of its president or manager.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSEDGRWICK J.\u2014I agree with my brother Nesbitt.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I agree with the Chief Justice.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I take the same view of the facts proved by the evidence in this case as that taken by the trial judge, Chief Justice Killam. There was no actual contract of hiring but it is argued one must be implied. I cannot on the findings of the learned judge do so. The plaintiff was at the utmost a mere volunteer. He applied to defendant for the terms on which his property was for sale and defendant gave them to him. It is said defendant knew plaintiff obtained them with the object and hope that he would find a satisfactory purchaser. The facts are so found. But these facts did not of themselves constitute plaintiff the agent of the defendants to sell the property nor from them can there be implied a contract to pay him for his services as a land agent.\nI agree that if the owners had, under the circumstances, accepted a purchaser produced to them by the plaintiff and thus profited by the plaintiff\u2019s volunteered services, the case would be different and the plaintiff might recover. But that is not the case here. The owners declined to enter into a contract with the purchaser introduced by the plaintiff They did not therefore profit by any work or services performed by the plaintiff. Under the facts as found, I cannot infer a contract to pay the plaintiff a commission and concur in the dismissal of the appeal.\nNESBITT J.\u2014Had the finding of the trial judge relied upon by the appellant stood alone I should have differed from him as to the legal conclusion. The finding was as follows :\nStobart gave the plaintiff particulars of the terms on which the property would be sold, knowing and expecting that the plaintiff asked these with a view to trying to find a purchaser for a commission to be paid. I infer that he assented that the plaintiff should try to do this. I find that he knew that the plaintiff was so trying.\nI would infer from this an implied contract of agency entitling the plaintiff to be paid on production of a purchaser on the terms demanded by the defendant. See Bowstead on Agency, (2 ed.) pp. 15 and 177. I adopt the statement of law to be found in 4 Am. & Eng. Encyl. of Law, (2 ed ) \u0440. 967 :\nWhere several brokers are employed independently about the same transaction, the accomplishment of the object of the agency by one operates as a revocation of the authority of the others, and third persons subsequently dealing with them do so at the risk of such revocation; and no action for damages will lie in such case against the principal unless the nature of his contract with the broker is such as to estop him from setting up the revocation.\nThis avoids the difficulties suggested by Dubuc C. J. in the court below.\nIn this case, however, the Chief Justice (Killam) further found\nthe plaintiff brought Mr. Hespeler and Mr. Stobart together. I cannot find that Mr. Stobart agreed to sell to Mr. Hespeler on any terms or that he settled with Hespeler on the terms of the latter\u2019s letter as those on which he or his company was willing to sell.\nAnd while Mr. Hespeler swore he was ready to purchase on the Stobart terms his letters introduced terms which no doubt he thought were a substantial offer to purchase in accordance with the memo, handed by Stobart to the plaintiff, but which could not be treated as an unqualified acceptance of them and, therefore, a purchaser was not found in the precise terms of the memo, relied upon as taken with the finding \u0406 have quoted as entitling the plaintiff to his commission. See Fuller v. Eames ([19]) where the cases referred to by Mr. Ewart are collected.\nIt is therefore unnecessary to discuss the other questions raised as to the authority of stobart or how far the company could afterwards ratify.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs in all courts.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellants: Campbell, Pitblado & Co.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Howell, Mathers & Howell.\n[1] 14 Man.

C. Sup. Ct. Rule 168, provides that \"any condition precedent, the performance of which is intended to be contested, shall be distinctly specified in his pleadings by the plaintiff or defendant (as the case may be), and, subject thereto, an averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent, necessary for the case of the plaintiff or defendant, shall be implied in his pleadings.\" In an action for trespass and a mandatory injunction, the defendants pleaded the right of entry under a private Act, and the consent or acquiescence of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs replied setting up the failure of defendants to comply with certain conditions precedent to the exercise of the privileges claimed but did not set up another condition precedent upon which the judgment appealed from proceeded though it was not referred to at the trial.\nHeld, Killam J. contra, that the rule refers rather to cases founded on contract than to those where statutory authority is relied upon and that the plaintiff's need not have replied as they did, but having done so without setting up the condition specially relied upon in appeal, thereby possibly misleading the defendants, they were properly punished by the court below by being deprived of their costs in appeal.\nPer Killam J.\u2014It was improper for the court appealed from to allow the absence of proof to be set up for the first time on the appeal. Where a trespasser, by taking proper steps to that effect, would have the right to expropriate the lands in dispute, an injunction should be withheld in order to enable the necessary proceedings to be taken and compensation made. Goodson v. Richardson (9 Cb. App. 221), and Cowper v Laidler ([1903] 2 Ch. 337) applied. But where there has been acquiescence equivalent to a fraud upon the defendant the injunction ought not to be granted, even where the legal right of the plaintiff has been proved. Gerrard v. O'Reilly (3 Dr. & War. 414) ; Wilmot v. Barber (15 Ch. D. 96) : Johnson v. Wyatt (2 DtG. J. & S 17) ; and Smith v. Smith (L. R. 20 Eq. 500), referrel to.\nBy the defendants' charter [59 Vict. ch. 62, ss. 9, 25, (B. C.)], it was provided that the powers to enter, survey, ascertain, set out and take, hold, appropriate and acquire lands should be subject to the making of compensation and that the powers, other than the powers \"to enter, survey, set out and ascertain,\" should not be exercised or proceeded with until approval of the plans and sites by the Lientenant Governor in Council. The defendants entered upon lands of the plaintiffs, made surveys and constructed works thereon without making compensation or obtaining such approval. Some time after entry the defendants obtained the necessary order in council approving of the plans an I sites of the land to be expropriated.\nHeld, that making of compensation was not a condition precedent to making the survey and taking possession of the land, and as the said order in council was not dealt with at the trial the rights of the parties could not properly be determined on the material presented ; the injunction, should, therefore, be refused and the parties left to take proceedings as they should respectively see fit.\nPer SEDGEWICK and KILLAM JJ.\u2014That as approval of the plans had not been obtained till some time after the defendants had taken possession and appropriated the land, there was a trespass for which the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, but after the approval had been obtained the defendants remained rightfully in possession and could not be compelled by a mandatory injunction to replace the land in its former position.\nJudgment appealed from (10 B. C. Rep. 361) varied.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia,[1], reversing the decision of Irving J. at the trial, and maintaining the action of the plaintiffs with costs of the trial court. The plaintiffs own a mill-site near Sandon, B.C., called lot 590 and that part of the Wyoming Mineral Claim, lot 754, lying to the east of Sandon Creek, and claim that the defendants wrongfully went upon the same in 1897 and built a tank and pipe line, and that the plaintiffs require the space thus taken for the deposit of tailings, etc. ; they limited their claim for relief, in the statement of claim, to that for a mandatory injunction compelling the defendants to restore the land to its former condition, and to general damages for trespass.\nThe defendants claim:\n1st. That they, acting under the authority of a private Act of Parliament to erect and operate a water and light plant for the citizens of Sandon, went there under the powers given by their private Act (being chapter 62 of the Statute of British Columbia, 1896), and that they are properly in possession.\n2nd. That they went upon such lands with the full knowledge and consent or, in the alternative, the acquiescence of the respondents.\n3rd. That it was necessary for the appellants to go upon said lands in order to make their water and light system effective.\n4th. That the \"Wyoming\" being a mineral claim, the respondents have no surface rights on the same, hence cannot object to the appellants' possession.\n5th. That the respondents by their delay, or their acquiescence above named, have waived their right to object to the appellants' conduct; or in the alternative the limitation clauses of the appellants' private Act, chap. 62 of 1896, preclude the present action.\nThe respondents in reply claim that the appellants did not comply with the following conditions precedent in their private Act contained to enable them to take advantage of their private Act, reading as follows:\n\"In further answer to paragraphs four and five of the amended statement of defence the plaintiffs say that prior to the trespass complained of the defendants did not comply with the following conditions precedent under the said 'Sandon Water Works and Light Company Act, 1896,' to entitle them to enter upon the lands in question :\n\"(a) They did not file and have approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council the plans and sites of their works under section 9.\n\"(b) They did not serve upon the plaintiffs any notices to treat or any other notice under the said Act, nor did they obtain the consent of the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works under section 25.\n\"And the plaintiffs say that without compliance with the said conditions precedent the defendants obtained no right or privilege under the provisions of their said Act as against them.\"\nOn the appeal another and new condition precedent was urged as to which no amendment was asked or opportunity to give evidence was allowed, and no admission was made, viz.: \"That the defendants did not show on the trial that they had a water record for Sandon Creek ; and hence no right to enter the plaintiffs' lands under the private Act \" ; and upon this point alone the appeal was allowed.\nHUNTER C. J. in the Supreme Court of British Columbia gave judgment as follows, the other members of the court concurring therein.\n\"The court is unanimously of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed. This is a common law action of trespass by the Byron N. White Company against Sandon Water Works and Light Company. The Water Works Company were entitled to go upon the lands and do what they did under the powers given by their Act, provided they proved strict compliance with the conditions imposed, because that was their only authority for interfering, as they did, with the property of the plaintiffs. It was not shown at the trial that the Lieutenant Governor in Council had authorized the diversion of the water, and that, in my opinion, was a preliminary essential, or a condition, to the exercise of the power of interfering with the soil of the plaintiffs.\n\"It is not necessary to decide on this occasion whether the authority of the Lieutenant Governor to divert the water was a condition precedent to the right of entry, but it was certainly a condition precedent to the right of interference with the soil of the plaintiffs. It was open, on the pleadings, to the plaintiffs to take advantage of any failure of proof by the defendants of their case, and although the attention of the learned judge was not directed to the fact that there was no proof that the authority of the Lieutenant Governor in Council to divert the water had been obtained, I do not think that precluded the plaintiff from taking advantage of the point of law, especially as this is a court of re-hearing.\n\"As to the defence raised on the ground of laches, it is quite clear that there were no laches which would raise any equity on behalf of the defendants. If we were to hold, on the facts which are before us on this occasion, that there were laches which preclude the plaintiffs from enforcing their legal rights we would wipe out the statute of limitations. To raise an equity in favour of the defendants in such circumstances as appear here, it would have to be shown that they were induced to make the expenditure they did by some equivocal conduct on the part of the plaintiffs. It is quite clear they were not in any way misled when they entered on the property, and they have only themselves to thank for the consequences. I think only nominal damages ought to be allowed, say $ 10, and I think the right ought to be further aided by the issue of a mandatory injunction, not to be drawn up, however, for six months, in order to enable the parties if possible to come to some understanding.\n\"As to the costs : The appeal, in strictness, is not successful, as the defendants are defeated on the ground not taken at the trial, or in the notice of appeal. Therefore, while the plaintiffs should have succeeded at the trial and, therefore, should have the costs of the action, there should be no costs of the appeal.\"\nDavis K.C. and Taylor K.C. for the appellants. The plaintiffs allege that defendants did not file plans nor serve notice of expropriation. But having obtained the order in council approving of the plans and site after being some years in possession it should be presumed that all necessary preliminaries had been observed.\nThey claim, also, that defendants could not enter without first making payment but that is not a condition precedent under their Act of incorporation. See Harding v. Township of Cardiff[2] ; Stonehouse v. Township of Enniskillen[3] Moreover the plaintiffs acquiesced in such possession. Kelsey v. Dodd[4] ; Sayers v. Collyer[5], at pp. 106-8.\nPlaintiffs could not set up violation of one condition after pleading that of two others only. Collelte v. Goode[6].\nBodwell K.C. and Lennie for the respondents. Performance of the conditions alleged in plaintiffs' reply is an essential preliminary to defendants' right to interfere with the premises. Corporation of Parkdale v. West[7]; North Shore Railway Co. v. Pion[8].\nDefendants could not take possession without making compensation. Harding v. Township of Cardiff[9].\nDefendants did not ask for consent of plaintiffs to their entry and cannot rely on acquiescence. Fullwood v. Fullwood[10]; Willmot v. Barber[11], at p. 105; Archbold v. Scully[12] at p. 388. Mandatory injunction is the proper remedy. Smith v. Smith[13], at p. 504; Goodson v. Richardson[14], at pp. 223, 227 ; County of Welland v. Buffalo and Lake Huron Railway Co.[15]; Kerr on Injunctions, 4 ed. p. 33.\nSEDGEWICK J. \u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal, in part, without costs, and ordering that the judgment appealed from should be varied by refusing the injunction for the reasons stated by my brother Killam.\nGIROUARD J. agreed with Mr Justice Nesbitt.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I have given much consideration to this case and have had the additional advantage of reading the conclusions reached by my brothers Nesbitt and Killam. I concur in the disposition of the appeal proposed by my brother Nesbitt, and in the reasons given by him.\nNESBITT J.\u2014 The plaintiffs, a mining company, brought an action of trespass against the defendants' the Sandon Water Works and Light Company. The defendants are incorporated under a special Act of the legislature of British Columbia, ch. 62, of the statutes of 1896.\nThe plaintiffs are the owners of a mill site near Sandon, B C, on lot 590, and also part of the Wyoming Mineral Claim, lot 754, lying to the east of Sandon Creek, and allege that the defendants wrongly went upon their land in 1897, and built a tank and pipe line.\nThe action was commenced on the 16th of July, 1902, and is for damages for trespass and a mandatory injunction compelling the defendants to restore the land to its former condition.\nThe defendants pleaded the private Act I have mentioned, and that they went upon the land under the authority of the private Act and with the full knowledge and consent, or, in the alternative, with the acquiescence of the plaintiffs, and also claimed that the \" Wyoming \" being a mineral claim the plaintiffs have no surface rights on the same, and the possession of the defendants did not interfere with the rights of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs replied setting up failure upon the part of the defendants to comply with certain conditions in the private Act which they claimed were conditions precedent to enable the defendants to obtain any right or privilege under the private Act. The plaintiffs did not reply another alleged condition precedent upon which the judgment in the Court in appeal proceeded, the learned Chief Justice saying:\u2014\nIt is not necessary to decide, on this occasion, whether the authority of the Lieutenant Governor to divert the water was a condition precedent to the right of entry, but it was certainly a condition precedent to the right of interference with the soil of the plaintiff. It was open on the pleadings to the plaintiff to take advantage of any failure of proof by the defendants of their case, and although the attention of the learned judge was not directed to the fact that there was no proof that the authority of the Lieutenant Governor in Council to divert the water had been obtained, I do not think that precluded the plaintiff from taking advantage of the point of law, especially as this is a court of rehearing.\nThe defendants in this court objected to the course which was taken in the Supreme Court of British Columbia relying upon rule 168 which provides that:\nAny condition precedent, the performance or occurrence of which is intended to be contested, shall be distinctly specified in his pleadings by the plaintiff or defendant (as the case may be) and, subject thereto, an averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent, necessary for the case of the plaintiff or defendants, shall be implied in his pleadings.\nI think that this rule rather has reference to contracts than to cases such as this where the party relied upon the statute as justifying his action, and that in such a case it would not be necessary for the plaintiff to reply as was done here, but as he has seen fit to do so and thereby not only not drawing attention to something he relies upon but perhaps misleading the defendant, he was properly punished by the court below by being deprived of his costs in appeal.\nTo deal then with the various defences raised, I think that the plaintiffs have shewn that they are entitled to the use and possession of all the property in dispute. The other questions involved are more difficult.\nI think that the authority of the Lieutenant Governor in Council to divert the water is a condition precedent to the expropriation of lands for the purpose of utilizing the water so alleged to be diverted, and in this I agree with the court below. I think, however, it would be most unsatisfactory to have the rights of the parties ultimately determined upon what at present appears before the court. Counsel strenuously argued upon the one side that it was for the defendant to shew that such an order in council existed; and upon the other side it was argued that the defendants, owing to the course of the pleading, had a perfect right to assume that this was not the question, and pointed to the order in council which approved of the plans and site as shewing that when such order was issued some years after the works were erected, the Council had before them the affidavit shewing that the company had continuously from 1897 to March, 1902, been using the water, and shewing the various works in use, and that, therefore, it should be presumed that all necessary consents of all public authorities of the province were given. If this case is to be determined upon that point I think the facts would appear rather to justify such presumption, but, in the view that I take, I think that the proper course is to refuse an injunction and leave the parties to their respective rights, the plaintiffs if they are so advised to bring trespass or ejectment, and the defendants to take immediate proceedings to expropriate, when it can be properly determined whether they have complied with the necessary conditions precedent to enable them to expropriate, and if they have not no doubt plaintiffs will, upon making a proper case, be entitled to have their rights protected and recover possession of their property.\nThe next question for consideration was whether payment or tender of the money was a condition precedent to taking of possession. The private Act relied upon is very difficult of construction. There is no doubt that the rule is plain that parties shall not be deprived of the use and possession of their property before payment unless by express words or necessary implication in the statute conferring rights of expropriation. I have examined, in addition to the cases mentioned by the parties, a number of authorities including Boy\u2014field v. Porter in 1811[16]; Doe dem Robins v. Warwick Canal Co. in 1836[17]; Lister v. Lobley in 1837[18]; Earl of Harborough v. Shardlow in 1840[19]; Peters v. Clarson in 1844[20]; Johnson v. Ontario, Simcoe & Huron Railroad Co. in 1853[21], and I have come to the conclusion that, on the true construction of this Act, the making of compensation is not a condition precedent to taking possession.\nIt will be observed that looking at clause 9 the power is to\nsurvey, ascertain, set out, and take hold, appropriate and acquire * * * * (subject, however, to making compensation therefor in manner hereinafter mentioned).\nAnd had that been the only language used in the Act I would have held it was necessary to make compensation before taking possession. But the statute then proceeds:\nThe powers other than the powers \"to enter, survey, set out and ascertain\" conferred by this section, shall not be exercised or proceeded with until the plans and sites are approved of.\nIt will be seen that while the surveying, setting out, ascertaining, taking, etc., are all grouped together (subject to making compensation) they are dissevered when you come to the necessity of obtaining the approval of the plans and site, which is clearly a condition precedent, and as it could never be intended that for the mere purposes of surveying, etc., there should be payment as a condition precedent, I take it that the legislature by necessary implication put surveying and expropriation on the same footing as to payment since it joined all these processes in speaking of payment, and therefore payment is not a condition pre- cedent to the taking possession of the land either to survey or take. The legislature has clearly stated that expropriation cannot take place until the plans and site are approved of and apparently imply that, when such approval is given, then possession may be taken subject to making payment and either party can set the law in motion for obtaining payment. I refer also to clause 13 as indicating that in the case of clearing lands and underwood it is plain that payment is to follow the work.\nI am unable to derive any light upon the subject from a consideration of clauses 22 and 23 relied on by Mr. Davis. Much argument was devoted to the question of acquiescence as affecting the granting of the injunction. Even assuming the court below was right in holding that the right to divert was a condition precedent compliance with which was necessary by the plaintiff, in the view I take of the case that the injunction should not go on the present record it is perhaps unnecessary to discuss the point, but as the same question has arisen more than once recently I desire to say that in cases where a legal right is established the general rule is that laid down in Goodsun v. Richardson[22] in 1873, viz.: that where the invasion of the right is for the purpose of a continuing trespass which is in effect a series of trespasses from time to time to the gain and profit of the trespasser without the consent of the owner of the land, this is a proper subject for an injunction. See also Cowper v. Laidler[23], where the rules to date are stated by Buckley J.\nWhere, however, the case is one in which the party trespassing would, if proper steps had been taken, have the right to expropriate, I think the better course is to withhold the issue of the injunction in order to enable the necessary steps to be taken and payment made. See Corporation of Parkdale v. West[24], pp. 613-15-16; Pion v. North Shore Railviay Co.[25], pp. 629-30 ; County of Wetland v. Buffalo and Lake Huron Ry. Co.[26].\nThere is another class of case in which it may be that an injunction will not be granted even where the legal right is proved, viz.: where there has been acquiescence practically amounting to a fraud upon the defendant. See as an example the observation of Lord St. Leonards in Gerrard v. O'Reilly[27], pp. 433-4; and see rules expressly laid down by Fry J. in Willmolt v. Barber[28], pp. 105-06.\nAs it is the duty of the court to decide upon the rights of the parties and the dismissal of the bill upon the grounds of acquiescence amounts to a decision that a right which has once existed is absolutely and forever lost, (see per Turner, L. J. in Johnson v. Wyatt[29], p. 25, I would hesitate to say the court could refuse the injunction at the trial were legal right established unless in case of fraud. See also Smith v. Smith[30] at pp. 504-505, per Jessel M. R. Had the case been clearly proved here I think an injunction should have gone, the order not to issue if within a limited time the defendants had put matters in train for expropriation, but in view of the doubt whether the defendants can now put themselves in position to expropriate I would allow the appeal so far as an injunction is concerned, but as the defendants could have applied to the court for a suspension of the order to enable them fo set the proceedings for expropriation in motion, and also have failed in their argument that the authority to divert was not a condition pre- cedent, I think there should be no costs to either party and both should be left to their remedies which. I have pointed out.\nThe order should be to vary judgment below by refusing the injunction.\nKILLAM J.\u2014 If, as found by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, no objection was made at the trial to the want of strict proof of a formal order in council authorising the defendant company to divert and use the water of the creeks mentioned in the statute, I do not think that the absence of such proof should have been allowed to be set up on appeal. It is possible that upon the point being raised the evidence could have been supplied. See Eyre v. Highway Board[31]; Page v. Bawdier[32]; Graham v. The Mayor etc., of Huddersfield[33]; Kennedy v. Freeth[34]; Armstrong v. Bowes[35]; Proctor v. Parker[36]; Hvghes v. Chambers[37].\nThe defendant company, for over four years, operated its works through and over the plaintiff company's lands and used the waters of the creeks for the purpose. With notice of this the Lieutenant Governor in Council approved of the plans of the works. The plaintiff company had no interest in the waters, which were vested in the Crown, and no right other than that of an ordinary citizen to object to any allowance by the executive of their diversion and use. The plaintiff company, by its pleadings, expressly set up several conditions precedent to the defendant company's right to take and use the plaintiffs lands under the statute, but not the absence of authority to use the water. It appears to me that it was proper to assume that any necessary formal authority for the use of the water had been given.\nIn The North Shore Ry. Co. v. Pion[38], where the company had built its railway along the fore-shore of a river, cutting off the plaintiff's access to the water, although, as appears by the reports of the case in this court[39], an'd in the courts of Quebec[40], the formal authority to the railway company to use the shore was neither set up in the pleadings nor directly proved, Lord Selborne, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, said:\nTheir Lordships do not in this case proceed upon the assumption that the consent of the Lieutenant Governor ia Council of Quebec was not duly given to the use made by the railway company of the foreshore of the river St. Charles for the construction of their works. If it were necessary to determine that point the facts would appear to their Lordships rather to justify the presumption that all necessary consents of all the public authorities of the province were given.\nAnd in the Corporation of the County of Wetland v. The Buffalo and Lake Huron Ry. Co.[41], it was presumed, from the use by a railway company for a number of years of a strip of land of the Crown and its crossing, near by, of a canal for which the authority of the Governor in Council was required, that the company had obtained the authority of the Governor in Council to so use the land.\nNo evidence of the want of authority was given at the trial and no motion was made against the judgment of the trial court on evidence of the want of such authority in fact. While it is claimed in the respondents' factum that, upon the argument in the full court, the defendant company conceded that the Lieutenant Governor in Council had not allowed, granted or approved of the diversion of the water, this does not appear in the printed case; and the judgment of the court did not proceed upon any such admission, but upon the supposed want of evidence in that respect.\nUpon careful perusal of the various statutes of British Columbia relating to the diversion and use of the natural waters, and of the appellant company's Act of incorporation, I am of opinion that the payment of compensation was not a condition precedent to the right to enter upon and use the plaintiff company's lands. Under the Land Act, C. S. B. C. (1888) c.66, ss. 39 to 52, payment of compensation in advance was expressly required in the cases in which parties were thereby authorized to acquire the right to divert and use water and to enter and use the lands of others for the purpose. Under the Water Privileges Act, 1832, 55 Vict. ch. 47 (B C), it was necessary to obtain the authority of a judge in order to enter upon and use the lands of others. The judge ascertained the compensation in advance and could impose such terms as he thought fit respecting payment or security.\nUnder the Water Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897, 60 Vict. ch. 45, R. S.B. C ch. 190, the power to enter upon, use or expropriate the lands of others was to be governed by The Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1897, 60 Vict. ch. 20, R. S. B. C. ch. 112, which expressly required payment of or security for compensation before entry, except for the purpose of surveying, taking levels, etc.\nBy the appellants' Act of incorporation, 59 Vict. ch. 62, s. 9, the company was authorized to enter into and upon the lands of other parties\nto survey, set out, ascertain, and take, expropriate, hold and acquire such parts thereof as it may require, etc., subject, however, to making compensation therefor in manner hereinafter mentioned, but the powers (other than the powers to enter, survey, and set out and ascertain what parts thereof are necessary for the purposes aforesaid, or for making the plans hereinafter mentioned) conferred by this section shall not be exercised or proceeded with until the plans and sites of the said works have been approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nIt will be noticed that, in this section, the portion beginning \" subject, however \" applied to surveying, setting out and ascertaining, as well as to taking, expropriating, holding and acquiring. If, then, this portion should be interpreted as expressing a condition precedent it would be applicable to entry for the purpose of surveying and ascertaining the parts to be taken, as well as to the permanent acquisition and use of the property. It is usual in such Acts to allow, as in The Lands Clauses Act just referred to, entry for the purpose of surveying and ascertaining the land to be taken without previous compensation, which cannot well be estimated until the land has been ascertained. This Act authorized either the company or the owner to initiate arbitration proceedings to fix the compensation. By section 22 the owner was bound to convey upon payment or tender of the compensation. By section 23\nthe lands, rights and privileges which shall be asceitained, set out and appropriated by the said company for the purposes aforesaid, shall, so long as the said company use the same for the purposes of this Act, be vested in the said company.\nBy section 9 one condition precedent was expressly imposed for the permanent acquisition of the land, and to that it was expressly limited. It seems, then, not unreasonable to construe the Act as not imposing the payment of compensation as a condition precedent for any purpose, except for formal conveyance.\nAs the approval of the plans was an express condition precedent to the right to appropriate and use the plaintiff company's lands, and as the plans were not approved until long after the appellant company had taken possession and appropriated the lands, there was clearly a trespass for which the plaintiff company was entitled to recover. But after the approval of the plans the appellant company remained rightfully in possession.\nIn my opinion the portion of the judgment appealed from awarding an injunction should be struck out, and the respondent company should pay the costs of the appeal.\nAppeal allowed, in part, without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taylor & O'Shea.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Elliott & Lennie.\n[1] 10 B.

Neuswander (32 Can. S. C. R. 405), the plaintiff was held entitled to a conveyance from defendants of a quarter interest in certain mineral claims. In that action Newswander et al. were only nominal defendants, the real interest in the claims being in F. After the judgment was given plaintiff conveyed nine-tenths of his interest to G., the expressed consideration being moneys advanced and an undertaking by G. to pay the costs of that action and another brought by Briggs, and by a subsequent deed, which recited the proceedings in the action and the deed of the ninetenths, he conveyed to G. the remaining one-tenth of his interest, the consideration of that deed being $300 payable by instalments. Briggs afterwards assigned the above-mentioned judgment and his interest in the claims to F. In an action by G. against F. for a declaration that he was entitled to the quarter interest.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (10 B. C. Rep 309) that the transfer to G. of the nine-tenths was champertous and the court would not interfere to assist one claiming under a title so acquired.\nHeld, also, that the transfer of one-tenth was valid, being for good consideration and severable from the remainder of the interest.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff except as to one-tenth of the property claimed.\nThe facts will be found sufficiently stated in the above head-note. S. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellant. The convey\" ance of the nine-tenths was not champertous, it being for the valuable consideration of money lent and advanced as well as the undertaking to pay costs. See Fischer v. Kamala[2] at page 187. If it was, a stranger to the deed could not take advantage of it. Knight v. Bowyer[3] at page 444.\nOn the cross-appeal the plaintiff contends that there is no connection between the assignment of the one-tenth interest remaining in Briggs and the prior agreements or arrangements. Consequently the cross-appeal should not succeed.\nR. M. Macdonald for the respondent. The appellant can only succeed by relying on an illegal conveyance which he will not be permitted to do. Hillon v. Woods[4].\nOn the cross-appeal we should have relief against the decision of the court below as Fleutot is estopped from asserting any prior equity by reason of his standing by and not disclosing his rights during the litigation of the case of Briggs v. Newswander[5].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKILLAM J.\u2014We are all of opinion that these appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nThe original transfer from Briggs to Giegerich of nine-tenths of Briggs' interest was clearly champertous. Admittedly, it was in pursuance of an arrangement by which Giegerich was to maintain the suit against Newswander. Doras and Darignac for a share of the property to be recovered.\nNewswander had a right of action against Giegerich for maintenance. The transaction was wrongful towards him. The present action was brought to enforce, as against Fleutot, the judgment in the suit against Newswander et al.[6]. Whether Fleutot should be held barred by the judgment as an assignee of Newswander pendente lite or as having a prior interest represented by Newswander, Giegerich cannot be in a better position to enforce the judgment against him than against Newswander himself.\nIn our opinion a court of equity should not interfere against either Newswander or Fleutot at the instance of one claiming under a title so acquired. See Burke v. Greene[7]; Prosser v. Edmonds[8] ; Harrington v. Long[9] ; Hilton v. Woods[10] ; Re Cannon[11] ; Peck v. Heurich[12].\nGiegerich alone appeals. Briggs has repudiated the transactions with him by conveying to Fleutot. In so far as they were illegal and wrongful towards Newswander Giegerich cannot insist on the right to use Briggs's name to enforce the former judgment.\nWe agree with the court below, also, in considering the transfer of the remaining one-tenth interest as good. It was severable and upon good consideration. The fact that the consideration was expressed to be in part for a confirmation of the former illegal transfer could not invalidate the legal part of the transaction. See Pigot's Case[13] ; Bank of Australasia v. Breillat[14]; Pickering v. The Ilfracombe Railway Co[15].\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taylor & O'Shea.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R. M. Macdonald.\n[1] 10 B. C.

P. Q. permits four judges of the Court of King's Bench to give judgment in a cause heard before five when the remaining judge, after hearing the case argued, recused himself as disqalified. Davies and Nesbitt J J. contra.\nA took out a policy on his life in a mutual association relying on statements contained in circulars issued by the association stating that interest on the reserve fund would be sufficient to cover increases in the death rates and make the policy, after a certain period, self-sustaining. The rates having been increased, A. paid the assessments for some years under protest and then allowed his policy to lapse and sued for a return of the payments he had made with interest and for a declaration that the contracts were void ab initio.\nHeld, Sedgewick and Nesbitt J J. dissenting, that the statements in the circulars only expressed the expectation of the managers of the association as to the future and did not prevent the rates being increased in the discretion of the directors. The Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association v. Foster (20 Times L. R. 715) distinguished. The Provident Savings Life Assurance Society v. Mowat (32 Can. S. C. R. 147) referred to.\nPer Taschereau C. J. As the contracts of A. with the association were . only voidable he was not entitled to be repaid the premiums for which he had received value by being insured as long as the contracts were in force. Bernardin v. La R\u00e9serve Mutuelle des Etats-Unis (Cour d'Appel, Paris, 10 Feb. 1904 : Gaz. des Trib. 26 f\u00e9v. 1904), referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the plaintiffs action with costs.\nThe declaration of the plaintiff alleged that he had been, in 1885 and 1887, solicited and induced by the agent of the defendants to become a member of the association and insure his life therein upon the assessment system at an annual rate of contribution by mortuary calls according to a minimum and maximum rate determined by his age at entry, the contributions not to be increased as age advanced but subject to decrease by quinquennial divisions of profits and in no case to exceed, in any year, the maximum rate of assessment indicated by the tables of the association; that one-fourth of the assessments collected were to be accumulated as a reserve fund for the benefit of policy holders, and that he should pay $30 admission fee and $20 for dues annually. He further alleged that he was induced to enter into the contracts of insurance he made with the association and to persist therein for some time by their written false and fraudulent representations in their circulars and statements; that, in May, 1898, when the rates of assessment had been greatly increased by virtue of powers given by certain clauses in the certificates or policies of insurance issued to him, he became aware of the fraud, deceit and wilful misrepresentations so made by the association for the first time, that he then protested against the increased rates as being contrary to the terms on which he had been induced to apply for membership, discontinued further payments and was, at his increased age, unable 'to obtain life insurance in another company or association without great loss and increased rates of premium. The action was for $6,509.57 damages, being the amount of the payments made with interest, and to have the policies declared null and void ah initio. The defence was a denial of any fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, that the association carried on the business of mutual life assurance effectually according to the provisions of its charter and the conditions of the contracts with the plaintiff in accordance with his applications, certificates of membership and the constitution and by-laws of the association. It alleged that the association had the right of increasing the assessments as they did, that it was necessary and obligatory for them to do so for the benefit of members of the association and under the laws of the State of New York,; that the plaintiff had received value for all payments made by him by the insurance of his life while he continued a member of the association; that, for a time, the plaintiff had continued to pay the increased rates and had acquiesced in the increased assessments; that, having failed to pay his assessments his contracts of insurance had lapsed and all moneys paid thereon had been forfeited to the association in virtue of the conditions, by-laws and regulations to which they were subject 'and that he was estopped of any right of action upon any ground whatever.\nIn the trial court Lavergue J. entered judgment for the plaintiff for the amount demanded with interest, declared the contracts void ah initio, that the payments made by the plaintiff had been made in error and by reason of the false and fraudulent representations and concealment by the defendants and that they had been received by them in bad faith. In the Court of King's Bench, on appeal, the case was argued before five judges, in September, 1902, but, when it was ripe for judgment, on 23rd December, 1902, one of the judges, Mr. Justice W\u00fcrt\u00e8le, withdrew from the court for special reasons on account of which he considered himself disqualified and incompetent to take part in the judgment about to be rendered. The four remaining judges then proceeded to render the judgment now appealed from, allowed the appeal, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nWhen the appeal came on for hearing in the Supreme Court of Canada, counsel on behalf of the appellant took preliminary objections to the validity of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, on the grounds that the four remaining judges in that court had taken an erroneous view of the provisions of art. 1241 C. P. Q.; that as the hearing had taken place before five judges, art. 1227 C. P. Q. could not have the effect of reducing the court to a bare quorum; that the case did not fall within the exceptions mentioned in arts. 1205, and 1206 C. P. Q. but was one of disqualification or incompetency ruled solely by art. 1242 C. P. Q.; that, consequently, the judgment so rendered was an absolute nullity, that no appeal was necessary and that the judgment of the Superior Court should stand restored and confirmed with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nAfter hearing counsel on the question, the majority of the court overruled the. objection, Davies and Nesbitt JJ, dissenting, and the hearing on the merits was proceeded with.\nThe questions arising on the present appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.\nAfter the case had been argued judgment was reserved pending the decision of a case by the same association against Foster then pending in the House of Lords, on appeal from the decision of the King's Bench Division, in England ([1]), and which was subsequently decided against the association ([2]). After this decision, on the application of the association, the Supreme Court of Canada ordered a re-hearing upon the points of somewhat similar nature to those in the Foster Case (2) involved on the present appeal. These questions are shortly stated in the arguments of counsel.\nT. Chase Casgrain K.C. and Lafleur K.C. for the appellant. The appellant was deceived by the false representations made by the association in their circulars, prospectuses and written statements issued by them from time to time, and kept under delusion and in error up to the time he protested against the increased assessments and allowed his insurances to lapse. The extracts printed in our factum clearly shew how he was kept in ignorance and the payments exacted from him in bad faith. He was even induced to believe that the association could eventually shew that the Superintendent of Insurance for the State of New York was wrong in compelling the association to change their system of assessment and that, in the end, there would be a general reimbursement and the old rates, as at age of entry, resumed. He did not discover the fraud until the last moment and, consequently, never acquiesced in the increased mortuary calls. In fact, he never ceased to protest against the increases. No one can complain that another has believed too implicitedly in the truth of his statements. This is specially so when the party making the statements is an expert.

Muggeridge ([3]); Central Railway Co. of Venezuela v. Kisch ([4]), at page 113. If the statements forming the basis of the contract are false the contract must be rescinded. See Ranger v. The Great Western Co. ([5]). In re Reese River Mining Co.; Smith's Case ([6]); Lynde v. Anglo-Italian Hemp Spinning Co. ([7]). It is only necessary to shew that there was a material misrepresentation; Derry v. Peek ([8]), at page 359; Arkwright v. Newbold ([9]); Dalloz Rep. \"Obligations\" no. 218; Sun Mutual Lije Insurance Co. v. B\u00e9land ([10]); Pand. Fr. vo. \"Assurance Mutuelles\" nn. 311-317; S. V.'80, 1, 125; Pand. Fr. vo. \"Assurances en general\" nn. 63, 421, 422, 423. We also refer to arts. 993, 1047, 1049, 2488 C. C The appellant relies with confidence on the decision of the House of Lords in the Foster Case ([11]), which involves points exactly similar to those in the present case,\nBeaudin K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the respondents. There has been no proof of fraud made and none can be presumed; Art. 993 C. C. It requires proof in writing in the case of a contract of mutual insurance : Art. 2471 C. C. Testimony can be received only in the cases mentioned in Art. 1233 C. C. There is not even a written protest proved, and a verbal protest, even if proved, would be insufficient. On the contrary, it is shewn that the plaintiff acquiesced in the increase of the rates by making voluntary payments for three years, six times in each year, and is, consequently, estopped from disputing his rating at this stage. Bain v. City of Montreal ([12]); Baker v. The Forest City Lodge ([13]).\nIt is quite clear from the circulars that the rating was to be on the natural premium system according to current age, that is, according to the attained age of the insured, from time to time, as assessments were made. There was no warranty as to level premium as at age of entry in the circulars, no representations of the kind were made. The applications and contracts make none, and they, alone, constitute the con-tracts between the parties. They do not mention any premium nor fix any maximum rates. However, it is not contended that the maximum assessment according to attained age has been exceeded.\nNo rescission of the contracts is necessary here because the plaintiff voluntarily allowed his contracts to lapse. If he ever had any right of action for specific performance, (arts. 1065, 1066 C. C.,) he lost it by ceasing to make payments for the purpose of keeping the insurances alive. Art. 1067 C. C. He simply dropped out of the association after getting full value for the moneys he paid by the insurance carried on his life from the time he entered until the contracts lapsed, under the conditions therein expressed, by default to continue payments of the assessments. Consequently, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover back any of the moneys so paid for value received.\nIt is not shewn that any wilfully false statements were made or that any artifice, deceit or trick was practised upon the plaintiff. Even if the prospects proved to be exaggerated or puffed up in the circulars and statements, they were made in good faith according to the expectations of the managers of the association. Such statements cannot amount to fraud or misrepresentation, although they may afterwards have turned out less advantageous on account of a mistake in their scheme of insurance.\nWe rely, also, upon the following authorities : The Provident Savings Life Assurance Society of New York v. Mowat ([14]); Hiven v. La R\u00e9serve Mutuelle des Etats-Unis ([15]), at page 42; Bernardin v. La Reserve Mutuelle des Etats-Unis ([16]); R. S. C. ch. 124, ss. 36 to 39; Pand. Fr. vo. \"Obligations\" nn. 7281, 7285, 7288, 7291, 7296-9, 7303; Fuzier-Herman vo. u Assurance Mutuelle \" nn. 53, 54, 55; Beaudry-Lacantinerie, \" Obligations,\" vol. I, no. 109, note 2, no. 111; Banque Ville-Marie v. Montplaisir ([17]); Lovell v. St. Louis Mutual Life Insurance Co. ([18]); Grymes v. Saunders ([19]); and Lindley on Companies (8 ed.) p. 62\nWe contend that the case of The Mutual Reserve Fund Lift Association v. Foster ([20]), recently decided in the House of Lords differs from the present case in the following respects: The policies were in different form; there were different representations made to the assured; there was no acquiescence by Foster; there were different questions of laches and no question as to the amount Foster should recover on cancellation of the policy arose, as in this case.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Though as the result of the decision of the House of Lords in the Foster Case (8), the respondents are precluded, in my view of the evidence, from supporting the judgment a quo upon the consid\u00e9rants of the court of appeal on the facts of the case and the inferences of fact therefrom, the proof of the company's fraud being still stronger in this case than in that one, and the appellant's policies being in terms as tricky and intentionally misleading as Foster's was, yet, under the civil law which, it is conceded, governs the present controversy, the appeal, in my opinion, fails, and the action must stand dismissed upon the ground that though the appellant be entitled to a rescission of the contracts ab initio, his claim to the reimbursement of premiums, either as condictio indebili, or as damages, is unfounded in law. Under the latter head, all that he demands by his declaration is the amount, with interest, of the premiums. So that the same reasons militate against both branches of his action. If he recovered judgment for the amounts he paid because they were payments indus, he could not recover in this action any additional amount for damages. And, a converso he cannot recover as damages the amounts he paid if they were not payments indus. As to any other, could they be considered as claimed, none but remote, in-direct, fictitious and exaggerated damages to himself personally are in evidence.\nThis is not, as in the Foster Case ([21]), an action for rescission of an existing contract. The appellant and respondents had both determined, before the institution of the action, to treat these policies as rescinded for the future; and it is mutual ground that to all intents and purposes they stand rescinded from that time. (Pars. X, XI, of conditions indorsed on second policy). The action is consequently nothing but one by the appellant to recover back the premiums he has paid to the company respondent during the continuance of the policies. Pothier, Oblig. No. 29; 24 Demol. No. 181; arts. 988, 993, 1000 C.C. As Laurent well puts it, Vol. 20, No. 346:\nSi la r\u00e9solution doit \u00eatre demand\u00e9e en justice, l\u2019action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'indu se confond avec l\u2019action qui tend \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre le contrat.\nNow, upon principle, the appellant's contentions cannot prevail.\nThe rescinding ab initio of a contract for fraud has no doubt the same effect as would the rescinding of a contract under an express resolutory clause in the case provided for by art. 1088 C. C. A contract such as those in question here is, in law, subject to the tacit resolutory clause that, if it be obtained by fraud, the party defrauded and suffering prejudice thereby, will have the right to have it rescinded. Consequently the appellant's proposition that the parties must, in the lattei case as in the former, be restored, as far as possible to \"as they were\" before they entered into the contract is undeniably correct.\nBut in a case like this one, where a contract of mutual insurance may be rescinded at the suit of the insured for false representations by the insurer, the insured, as said by DeLalande, Assur. No. 825, is not entitled to the return of the premiums, because they were\nl'\u00e9quivalent des risques que la compagnie a r\u00e9ellement courus. Suscepti periculum pretium' (says Pothier, Assur. No 1).\nThe appellant got for his money all the value he had bargained for. It was indeed by false representations that he was induced to enter into the partnership that this mutual company in law constitutes; 1 Couteau, assur. Nos. 132 et seq., 192; 2 Couteau, Nos. 364, 382, 433, 438; Dall. 76,1,345; Pand, fr. 86,1, 220; S. V. 86, 2, 225; Delangle, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, Nos. 41 to 47; but he put no capital therein; the premiums he paid did not inure to the benefit of the company; they went in satisfaction of his obligations as co-insurer towards his co- insured; he got all the benefit from these payments that he could expect; the company, consisting of himself and his co-insurers, fulfilled its obligation to carry the risk of the amount insured on his life; his co-partners had the right to exact from him his share of the burdens of the co-partnership so long as he enjoyed his share of its benefits; and no court, no power on earth, can declare that he has not been effectively insured; he suffered no loss from the fraud he now complains of, and fraud without damage gives him no cause of action. Petrie v. Guelph Lumber Co. ([22]); Bedarride, Dol & Fraude, Vol. 1, Nos. 268, 270, 272, 300 to 308. His claim lacks one of the essential ingredients required by the law7. Point d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, point (Taction. An action in rescission ab initio, (restitulio ad integrum of the Roman law) cannot be maintained when the contract has previously come to an end if the plaintiff has not been l\u00e9s\u00e9. 2 Bonjean, des actions en dr. rom. page 144; Ancien D\u00e9nizart, vo. Rescission; I Solon Nullit\u00e9s, Nos. 426,481.\nPour proposer une nullit\u00e9s, (says Favard de Langlade, Rep. vo. Nullit\u00e9, part. 3), il faut y avoir int\u00e9r\u00eat. Une nullit\u00e9 serait m\u00eame susceptible d'\u00eatre prononc\u00e9e dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la loi qu'elle ne pourrait pas l'\u00eatre dans celui de la partie \u00e0 qui elle ne fait aucun tort.\nIt is on this principle that, under the civil law, a minor who, after becoming of age, obtains the rescission of a contract entered into with the required formalities whilst he was a minor, is given that re-course, as a general rule, not tanquam minor sed tan quam l\u0153sus.\nAfter saying that a contract of insurance so re-scinded ab initio must be considered as never having produced any effect, Lefort, Assur. sur la vie, Vol. 8, pages 9 and 17, adds, quoting other leading commentators; Mais il importe de noter que le contrat ayant eu une existence, la responsibilit\u00e9 de l'assureur ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9e, ce dernier a le droit de conserver les primes qui repr\u00e9sentent les risques courus. * * Dans l'assurance, il est impossible que l'assur\u00e9 rende l'assureur ce qu'il a re\u00e7u de lui, c'est-\u00e0-dire la garantie de la chose assur\u00e9e.\nAnd Demolombe, Vol. 25, No. 464, citing cases in the Cour de Cassation and other courts upon an analogous question, points out how, in a case of this kind, it is impossible to replace things in the same state as if the contract had never existed, in the words of art. 1088 of the Code, saying\ncar le caract\u00e8re de la convention est tel qu'il est impossible d'effacer, in pr\u00e6teritum, les cons\u00e9quences qu'elle a produites, tant qu'elle existait.\nSee also Troplong, Contrats Al\u00e9atoires, Nos. 154,298.\nFor the same reasons the action, taken as one condictione sine caus\u00e2, arts. 984 and 989 C. C, must likewise fail.\nThe appellant has received from the company in return for the premiums all the value and consideration he could expect up to the time he chose not to renew his bi-monthly contracts with them. Were he now to be reimbursed all that he has paid to the company, he would make a speculation out of their fraud. And that he cannot be allowed to do. Where a party to a voidable contract has received a benefit under it, he is bound by it; and if the contrac: be rescinded and it be, as in this case, impossible for him to return the benefit because of the nature of the benefit, he cannot recover the sum he paid for it. He is not entitled to both. He paid for nothing that he did not get. He got everything that he paid for.\nFor every mortuary call he paid, he received compensation by the assurance that if he were to be the next one to be called out of the world his surviving partners would pay to his executors or beneficiaries the $20,000 he was insured for. L'assureur, ayant jusqu'au jour de l'annulation du contrat couru les risques, les primea qui correspondent \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode des risques n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es sans cause et ne sont pas sujettes \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition. Dall. 78, 2, 58, 60.\nA judgment reported in Sirey, 83, 2, 19, orders the return of the premiums upon the rescission of a policy, but there the policy was void, nulle ah initio (not merely voidable, annulable) for a reason that might have been invoked by the insurer as well as by the insured. And the Court of Appeal affirming the judgment de premi\u00e8re instance distinctly points out the difference and holds that if the policy had been valid at its origin, the insured would not have been entitled to a return of the premiums.\nThe judgment (reprinted in the factum) of the court of original jurisdiction in the case precisely similar to this one of Bernardin against this same company, now respondent, has since been affirmed by the Paris Court of Appeal on the 10th February last [Bernardin v. La R\u00e9serve Mutuelle des Etats-Unis] ([23]). One of the consid\u00e9rants upon which the judgment of that court dis-missing the action rests, has its full application here. It reads as follows :\nConsid\u00e9rant que les demandeurs ont joui respectivement des avantages de l'assurance pendant plus de dix ou onze ans, qu'ainsi l'effet de l'assurance, qui consiste dans la garantie du risque mortuaire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite contre la compagnie, alors que, par la restitution des primes, si elle \u00e9tait ordonn\u00e9e, l'effet de l'assurance ne se produirait pas contre eux, et que l'allocation de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, r\u00e9quise au profit de mutualistes sortis volontairement de l'association, aurait pour cons\u00e9quence d'en faire supporter la charge par les nouveaux associ\u00e9s, derniers admis, ce qui serait contraire \u00e0 l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 qui doit persister entre mutualistes * * *\nSuch is the law that rules this case.\nI would dismiss the appeal, without costs however, as the findings of fraud by the trial judge against the company respondent are amply supported by the evidence of record.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I dissent from the judgment of the majority of the court dismissing this appeal for the reasons stated by my brother Nesbitt, in which I entirely concur.\nDAVIES J.\u2014For the reasons given by the Chief Justice o\u00ed the Court of King's Bench, speaking for the whole court, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI think the fact that the company was a mutual one and carried on under the assessment system, and that the underlying principle of the company was over and over again in its documents and literature declared to be the natural premium principle as distinct from the level rate premium adopted by all old line companies, would call for very strong and positive evidence to shew that these principles were to be so far departed from as to ensure to the appellant an assurance for $20,000 on assessment calculated upon his age at entry into the association and which assessments were not to be subsequently increased. Such evidence as I shall shew is, in my opinion, distinctly wanting.\nNor do I think plaintiff has succeeded in shewing that there were other fraudulent representations made to him going to the basis of the contract at and before the time he entered into it, and which induced him to enter into it, which would avail him to have all the premiums he paid during the years, he was insured returned to him.\nWe have been pressed with the argument that the late decision in the House of Lords of The Mutual Re-serve Fund Life Association v. Foster ([24]), confirming a judgment of the Court of Appeal for a rescission of the policy and a return of all the moneys paid thereunder settled the questions in controversy in this appeal and is binding on us. If the substantial questions there determined were to be determined on this appeal and on the same or analogous facts, I should not for a moment hesitate to follow that decision. We have had the advantage of having a re-argument of this appeal on this one point as to whether the decision of the House of Lords substantially covers it, and I am opinion that it does not. It is true the company is the same and that in very many particulars the policy there rescinded was the same as those in question on this appeal. But Foster's Case (1) was one for rescission of an existing contract in which it was not necessary to allege or prove fraud, and the grounds upon which the contract was rescinded were that the policy was not such a policy as was held out to him being wholly inconsistent with Bridgeman's letter supported by its accompanying documents, and that it differed essentially and on the vital point of the age on which assessments should be levied from the representations made to the plaintiff before and at the time when the proposal was signed and upon which he acted, and that the documents circulated by the company and on which Foster and Bridgeman, their officer, acted were tricky and misleading on this vital point of age for assessment purposes.\nThe policy in the Foster Case ([25]) expressly declared in its third clause or provision that\nThere should be payable to the association a mortuary premium for such an amount as the executive committee of the association may deem requisite, which amount should not exceed the maximum rates indorsed thereon according to the age of each member. Indorsed upon the policy was a schedule showing in columns the ages of the members from 25 to 60 and opposite to each age two sums in separate columns, one being headed \" largest amount which may be collected every two months\" and the other \"maximum amount which can be collected annually on each \u00a3100 insured.\" The main question there debated was whether the age of the member was intended to mean his age \"at entry\" or at the time of the call or assessment. It was held, under the terms of the policy, to mean the latter; but the contract was set aside because of the Bridgeman letter and other documents submitted to Foster at the time he applied for insurance which it was held justified him in believing that he was only to be assessed at the rates as of the age of entry. The Bridgeman letter was clear and specific. He was assured that \" it (the assurance) would cost him about \u00a310 per annum only\" and calculated on the basis of age at entry that was correct, but on the basis of attained age at the time the calls would be made, which was the legal construction of the policy given Foster, was entirely misleading.\nThis action is entirely different. It is not an action to have an existing policy declared to mean what the insurer was led to believe it did mean when entering into it or in the alternative to have it rescinded, but is one brought to have it declared that on policies which the plaintiff knowingly allowed to lapse, before action brought, the lapsed policies should be declared void ab initio and all the assessments paid under them returned to the plaintiff with interest on the ground of fraudulent representations made before and at the time of plaintiff taking out his policy.\nThe first policy in this case taken out by plaintiff for $10,000 in 1885, was in its fifth clause expressly made subject to all the provisions and conditions contained in the constitution and by-laws of this association with the amendments made and that may be hereafter made thereto.\nClause 1 provided for the levying of assessments\nat such rates according to the age of each member as may be established by the said Board of Directors,\nwhile clause 3, in its closing words, declared that\nat each apportionment the rate of assessment may be changed to correspond with the actual mortality experience of the association.\nNowhere in this contract, either in the body or in the table of rates indorsed upon it, is any reference made to any \"maximum rates\" which could not be exceeded, or to any \"age of entry\" as the age on which assessments should be based. So far from that being true the provision was for\nsuch rates according to the age of each member as might be established by the Board of Directors,\nand that without regard to any limit. That, together with the express power at each apportionment to change the rate, seems to me to be the main and broad distinction between the policy in the Foster Case ([26]) and the first one in the present appeal. The plaintiff's chief claim, as I understand, is that he is entitled to have had a maximum rate and that such rate should be based upon his age at entry, and the answer is that so far as the first policy is concerned there was no reference whatever to any maximum rate or any limit except the rate which might be fixed by the directors as necessary to meet the accruing death charges.\nThen, is there anything in the evidence here with respect to the inducements held out to the plaintiff to take out policies analogous to the Bridgeman letter and its accompanying documents as shewing that the \"age of entry\" was intended as the age on which the assessment should be made? I am not able to find anything, and a careful reading of the evidence given by the plaintiff himself as to the inducements held out to him to insure convinces me that whatever else they were, the right to be assessed for calls only on the \"age of entry\" was not one of them.\nThe plaintiff says he was solicited to take the insurance and, to induce him, the agent used the circular put in evidence. He quotes the parts of the circular on which he says he relied and so far as its truthfulness is challenged his evidence reads as follows :\n\"The expenses of the management limited to $2 on each $1,000.\" That was very material for me.\n\"A Reserve fund which provides against excessive assessments. The interest on the reserve fund is applied to the payment of death claims. Thi3 will be nearly, or quite sufficient to pay all claims caused by any increase in the death rate by reason of the advancing age of the association\". That I considered most important.\n\"Graded assessments so that each member pays only his exact share. Its system provides through its reserve fund for the decrease of assessments and this lessens payment in after years. The assessment of persistent members will be greatly reduced in fifteen years, and it is estimated that the certificate will be nearly, if not quite self-sustaining.\"\n\"It pays all legitimate claims promptly and in full.\"\n\"Its members have a voice and vote in the management.\" And on page 5 : \" Insurance actuaries calculate that should this association experience the same mortality and ratio of lapses as that experienced by the level premium companies in the past decade, its certificates will be self sustaining after fifteen years.\"\nThe foregoing are substantially all the alleged representations which induced the plaintiff to take out his policy. Where is anything said or called to plaintiff's attention which could have induced him to believe that age of entry was to be the only age at which he could be assessed. I do not find anything. Much was pointed out which convinced him the policy would be a much more favourable one than it turned out to be. But on the crucial point of \" age of entry \" the representations are silent. The broad comment I would make upon these extracts from the circular (on which the plaintiff says he relied) as shewing how different this case is from Foster's, is that they make no reference to maximum or minimum rates, nor do they say anything with respect to the crucial question whether these rates were to be calculated as plaintiff now con-tends he was induced to believe on the \" age of entry \" or the u attained age \" when the calls were made.\n\"With regard to the truthfulness or otherwise of the statement or predictions themselves it does seem to me that there might be great difficulty in reaching a conclusion as to them if instead of assessing on the basis of \" age of entry \" the directors had from the time plaintiff became a member assessed on that of \"attained age\", and if the members themselves had allowed the reserve fund to remain intact. But, in the beginning of the year 1889, the members themselves at the annual meeting, by what is known as the Shield's\" resolution, determined that the age of entry should be retained and continued as the basis upon which assessments should be levied and radically impaired the surplus reserve emergency fund by applying the current receipts applicable to it to the payment of death claims. These expedients gave temporary relief to the existing members it is true, but they were the action of the members themselves or of the necessary majority under the constitution. But the carrying out of this Shield's resolution could only have one result, and that was the impairment of the reserve and eventually its destruction with the alternative of bankruptcy or the placing of the assessments upon the only possible scientific basis (if indeed it is that) of attained age. If the reserve system and the \" attained age \" as the basis of the assessments had not been departed from there might possibly have been a substantial reduction in the amount of assessments of \" persistent members in fifteen years \" as promised, and the statements as to the calculations of insurance actuaries would not necessarily be false. It might require a lively imagination to believe in the fulfilment of the predictions but, granted the data I have assumed, namely, the assessment of all the members at their respective attained ages and the maintenance intact of the reserve, I do not find any evidence to convince me that the statements quoted from the circular by the plaintiff were necessarily false, much less false to the knowledge of those who made them. Of course if you assume age of entry as the basis of the actuarial statements of the circulars on which plaintiff says he relied it would be easy to prove their falsity, and a not unreasonable conclusion that their author must have known them to be so.\nThe same inducements were placed before plaintiff to take out his second policy, namely, the company's circular, known as Exhibit No. 3, from which I have quoted above.\nPlaintiff also refers to another circular, Exhibit No. 26, as having been shown to him, but does not point out specially anything in it as distinct from the statements of the first circular upon which he depended. It seems clear to me, at any rate in the absence of any special statement in the latter circular having been relied on by plaintiff, that his case must rest upon his first policy and the inducements under which heapplied for it. The second policy differed from the first in having the \" Table of Rates \" indorsed showing a \" maximum amount which could be collected annually on each $1,000,\" with a note at the foot stating that this rate was based upon the mortality tables and the experience of the association for current ages The body of the policy expressly provided for a bi-monthly\npayment of a mortuary premium for such an amount as the executive committee of the association may deem requisite, which amount shall . be at such rates according to the age of each member as may be established by the Board of Directors.\nThe question of maximum and minimum rates has been magnified. The complaint is not that the maximum of one or other age has been exceeded\u2014indeed that of attained age is admitted not to have been\u2014but that \" attained age \" was adopted and exacted in levying assessments instead of age of entry. And it seems to me that the question on this branch of the case has been reduced to whether there is such evidence in the case as shews that the plaintiff was clearly induced to take out his policy by representations that his premium annually would not exceed the maximum sum payable on his age at entry and so bring it within the principle laid down in the House of Lords in the Foster Case ([27]).\nThe fact that for years subsequent to the taking out of his policies and the passage of the Shield's resolution the assessments were based upon the age of entry and that the calls upon the members for these assessments gave prominence to this fact cannot in any way avail the plaintiff. Both he and the management may have been living in a fool's paradise. It appears to me the passage of the Shield's resolution by the members of the association and the attempt to carry on the company on the basis it prescribed foredoomed the company to failure, but there is nothing in anything which transpired after his policies were taken out which can avail plaintiff in this action.\nHaving reached these conclusions I have not thought it necessary to go into the question of the effect of the plaintiff's acquiescence in the raising of the rates or as to whether considering the pecuniary and other benefits he derived from the assurance on his life for so many years at the premiums paid by him the facts shew he has really sustained actionable damage. On both points I incline against the appellant.\nAs the majority o\u00ed the court is not agreed as to the grounds upon which the appeal should be dismissed I concur that under the circumstances there should be no costs.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting).\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of the Chief Justice and my brother Davies. I am unable to agree with the grounds upon which either arrives at the result of dismissal of this appeal. I concur with the Chief Justice that both policies were obtained by misleading and fraudulent misrepresentations.\nI cannot view the so-called puffing circulars as mere boastings or think that the plaintiff should have looked upon them as mere expressions of hope and expectation. Language which under some circumstances may well be held to be hope and expectation may, under other circumstances, be looked upon as a representation which a party is entitled to rely upon, and I think that in this case the plaintiff would be entitled to assume that the statements were statements of fact. The language was adopted by experts in insurance who professed to have discovered a new system of insurance which differed from any other system in vogue, and that the result of this system was that the person insuring would save from one half to two-thirds of capital which he otherwise would take from his business to pay the old line companies for the same amount of insurance; that by the use of the reserve fund his certificate would be practically self-sustaining after fifteen years as the reserve fund provided against excessive assessments, and that the reserve fund had securely invested more than was necessary to meet all liabilities; and that by reason of the cutting down of the cost of management the company was able to furnish life insurance at one-half the rates of ordinary companies, and that cost would not increase as age advanced. It might be less, but it would not exceed the maximum amount indicated by tables, etc.\nIt is urged that the second policy differs from the first inasmuch as the second policy has a table on the back containing minimum and maximum amounts. But the constitution and by-laws of the society are made part of the first policy, and I cannot read the policy with the constitution and by-laws as reasonably indicating to a person of average intelligence that the premiums which he was asked to pay would not exceed the amount stated upon the back of the policy as at age of entry, coupled with the representation which the plaintiff was led to rely upon as coming from experts asserting that they had discovered a new system of insurance. I think that the two policies are upon the same footing and that both are substantially upon the same footing as the policy in the Foster Case ([28]) and the more r\u00e9cent case of Cross v. Mutual Reserve Life Ins. Co. ([29]). It is answered that, assuming the circulars and agents' statements were untrue, the plaintiff upon reading his policy should have discovered the fraud, that in fact he had become a member of a company which entitled the directors to assess at least up to the maximum amounts called for by the policies at current age, that with the knowledge of such a condition of things he elected to treat the policy as existing, and that he has received benefits under the policy by being kept insured during a number of years.\nIn my view the policies were framed in such tricky and misleading language and the calls which were sent to the plaintiff were so framed that any reasonable person would be thrown off his guard and would have remained in a state of blissful ignorance of the real nature of the contract and have been entitled to assume that the age of entry was what was intended, and that when a highly increased assessment was asked for it was only asked for by way of advanced payment in order to satisfy the technical requirements of the Superintendent of Insurance for the State of New York. I think, therefore, that the defence of approbation of the contract, if I may so describe it, fails, and that when the plaintiff really became aware of the nature of the gross fraud which, in my opinion, has been perpetrated upon him, he, within a reasonable time, took action to recover the premium.\nI find in the record in the Foster Case ([30]), in the House of Lords that the very point was made that there could not be a return of the premium because the plaintiff in that case had been kept insured and had in reality suffered no damage, but, notwithstanding such an argument, the House ordered a return of the premiums with interest, and the same argument was addressed to the court in the Cross Case ([31]), but without avail. It seems to me that where the plaintiff has been induced by fraud to enter into a contract of insurance (although he may be said to be kept insured during the time that he remained ignorant of the fraud and until he claimed a return of his money) he is entitled as against the person guilty of the fraud to say, you obtained my money in bad faith, you shall not be heard to say that I have received benefit. As a fact it is difficult to say whether he had received a benefit by the so-called contract of insurance which he allowed to expire. Had he died in the meantime and the company had offered to pay the money his representatives would not be able to elect to take the money and also claim that the premiums had been obtained through fraud, and ask for a return of them; but, is he in this position? If it is found that the premiums were obtained through fraud, and the plaintiff is to be defeated in this case, I do not see how Foster was able to obtain a return of his premiums where he (Foster) had received precisely the same benefits as plaintiff did, and was asking to rescind the contract. I cannot see what difference it makes that the plaintiff, unable to keep up the extortionate demands made upon him, pays under protest, and says, in this case : \" the contract is obtained by fraud\u2014I have just discovered it\u2014I demand my premiums so paid;\" and, in the other case says: \"I have been misled into a contract different from what I expected I was entering into, and as the court finds that the contract is as the other side argued for it I claim to be entitled to receive my money back.\" Both the parties may be said to have enjoyed the benefit of insurance during the time they remained ignorant.\nIn the last case the House of Lords has said that the premiums are to be returned with interest. In the present case I think the principle of that decision is clearly applicable and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the premiums paid, with interest, and costs in all the courts. It may be said that this is hard mea\" sure, but there is high authority for saying \"the way of the transgressor is hard.\" The case is one of much importance and involves, we are told, many others, and I regret that the questions of law cannot be said to be settled by our present decision which proceeds on such various grounds.\nKILLAM J.\u2014In the main I agree with the views so well expressed by Sir Alexander Lacoste C. J., in the Court of Appeal for Quebec, and by my brother Davies here.\n1 desire to state as briefly as possible the grounds upon which, particularly, I base the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe formal transaction began in each case with the filling up, by the appellant himself, of blanks in a printed form entitled \" Application for a Membership in the Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association,\" and its signature by him. Each application was, by its terms, expressed to be subject to all the limitations and requirements of the constitution and by-laws of the association, with the amendments made or that might thereafter be made thereto, all of which were thereby made part of any certificate that might be issued on the application. And the applicant agreed that, if he or his representatives should omit or neglect to make any payment as required by the conditions of such certificate or by the constitution and by-laws of the association, then the certificate to be issued upon the application should be null and void, and the officers of the association might cancel the certificate, and all money paid thereon should be forfeited to the association.\nAt the top of each form were the words: \" This abstract of the application is to be filled up at the office only.\" Certain particulars were given, among them \" assessments\", the blanks following which were filled in \" $17.60 \" and \" $20.00 \" respectively. These particulars were evidently memoranda for the company's convenience, not intended to be part of the application. The blanks are not shewn to have been filled in by the appellant or before he signed, and I infer that they were not filled in until after the applications were received at the head office. I would not take these particulars either as forming any part of the application or as having influenced the appellant to enter into the contract.\nUpon each application was issued what was called a '' Certificate of Membership \". Between the two documents there were differences which in some aspects might be material, but for the purposes of my present reasoning I treat the two as practically alike. By each it was stated that, in consideration of the application (which was expressed to be made a part of the contract), the association thereby received the applicant as a member of the association. By each there was to be payable to the legal representatives of the applicant, upon his death, $10,000. Each provided for the making of assessments upon the members to meet death claims, the assessments to be at such rates, according to the age of each member, as might be established by the Board of Directors, and the amounts (less 25 per cent) to go into a death fund out of which the death claims were primarily to be paid. The 25 per cent was to go into a reserve fund and, at the expiration of each period of five years, a bond was to be issued to each member for an equitable proportion of the reserve fund; and it was provided that, at each apportionment, the rate of assessment might be changed to correspond with the actual mortality experience of the association.\nThe first instrument expressly provided (par. 5) that it should be subject to all the provisions and conditions contained in the constitution and by-laws of the association, with the amendments made and that might thereafter be made thereto. The second did not set out such a provision in terms, but through the incorporation of the application it appears to have embodied it.\nOn the back of the first certificate there was indorsed what was styled a \"table of rates,\" in which it was stated \"the basis of the assessment rate for each member, according to the age taken at the nearest birthday, on each $1,000, is as follows\"; this was followed by columns giving rates opposite different ages.\nOn the back of the second certificate there was indorsed what was styled \"mortuary rates and comparison of cost,\" composed of columns for \"age,\" \"minimum rate of each bi-monthly assessment on $1,000 insurance,\" \"maximum amount which can be collected annually on each $1,000 insurance,\" and \"old line rates,\" giving amounts opposite different ages.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court proceeded solely upon the ground that the appellant had been induced by misrepresentation to enter into the contracts. Upon this point alone the case has been argued before us. There is no question of contravention of either contract, \u00f2r of the levy of assessments in excess of what the terms of the contracts warranted.\nFortunately we are not left to evidence of verbal representations, but the appellant points to two circulars issued by the association (exhibits 3 and 26) as containing the representations, and to no others. These alone should be considered for the purpose.\nThese circulars set out the system of insurance adopted by the association. Naturally they magnified the advantages of the system and its prospective results, and made claim to great superiority over other systems. In so far as the nature of the system was -concerned it was accurately described. Unfortunately the expectations were not realized; the advantages and superiority were not all that were claimed.\nI will not go over the circulars in detail but will refer only to the portions upon which the argument for the appellant appears to be the strongest. The principal complaint on the part of the appellant is that he was induced to believe that the contracts were to be such that assessments were always to be made with reference to ages of entry into the association, and were not to advance beyond the maximum amounts shewn by the table for the ages of entry. There does not seem to me to have been anything in the circulars representing such a limitation as part of the contracts into which parties were invited to enter. The tables of maximum rates did not specify that they were to be calculated upon the ages of entry. The strongest clause of the circulars in this respect was one to the effect that\nthe interest on the reserve fund is applied to the payment of death claims. This will be nearly or quite sufficient to pay all claims caused by any increase in the death rate by reason of the advancing age of the association.\nThis is claimed to amount to a representation that the assessment would not increase with the age of the insured.\nThere is a manifest difference between increase by reason of the advancing age of the association and increase due to the advancing age of the insured. The framers of the circulars might think that, for some years at least, there would be an increase in the death rate among members which would not be wholly met by the addition of new members, and that the interest on the reserve fund would make up this deficiency. The realization of this expectation would depend upon many contingencies. The expression of the expectation could not properly be understood as more than an expression of opinion. But all the members had to bear in some proportions the assessments necessary to meet death claims, even if the aggregate did not increase by reason of the advancing age of the association. And as new members were introduced, if, as stated in the circulars, the assessments were to be graded so that each member would pay only his exact share, the apportionment among them should have reference to relative ages and chances of life, for which purpose actual ages ought to be taken. This clause of the circulars did not touch upon that subject.\nAnd those responsible for the circulars might have honestly believed and honestly expressed the opinion that the system provided, through its reserve fund, for the decrease of assessments, that this would lessen payments in after years, and that the payments of members would be greatly reduced in fifteen years, if the assessments should be properly apportioned among members and the reserve fund kept increasing according to the system\u2014that there would come a time when the accumulation in the reserve fund would provide sufficient to largely or wholly pay for insurance during the balance of life.\nThe circulars should not be read as expressing more than the opinions of the responsible heads of the association in these respects. \"We have not to consider whether the system, was sound or fallacious, whether the expectations were reasonable or unreasonable, but whether or not the proposed contracts were wrongly represented.\nEvidence of experts in insurance was given for the purpose of shewing that actuaries could not have made the calculations stated in the circulars; but this evidence does not appear to me to prove that, if the system had been fairly laid before actuaries deemed to be reliable, they might not have so calculated. The experts were probably referring to the practice subsequently followed and not to the real system outlined.\nThe other portions of the circulars seem sufficiently covered by these remarks. I cannot find that there was in either any misrepresentation sufficient to avoid the contracts, whether under the law of England or under that of Quebec. It was not proved that anything stated as a fact was untrue, or that anything stated as matter of opinion or expectation did not represent the real opinion or expectation of the responsible heads of the association.\nI wish to add but a few words as to Foster's Case ([32]). It appears to have determined only that an assured person in his position, deceived as he was adjuged to have been deceived, and drawn into accepting as the embodiment of his contract a written document calculated, as that was adjuged to have been, to maintain the deception, may have judgment for the rescission of the contract and a return of the moneys paid under it, even after acting under it to the extent that he did, and after suing in the alternative as he did and failing upon the question of interpretation. When it is sought to apply the decision in another case, it is necessary to consider whether there have been similar misrepresentations or other material and false representations inducing the contract and whether the policy is similarly deceiving.\nIn my opinion neither the representations nor the policies or certificates in this case were similar to the representations or the policy in Foster's Case (1). These documents provided for assessments at such rates, according to the age of each member (presumably at the age of assessment), as might be established by the board of directors, and also for changes in the rates. Thus, on the face of the documents, apart entirely from the constitution and by-laws (to which I have purposely omitted specific reference as their terms did not appear in the documents), there was no apparent limitation upon the powers of the directors and nothing to mislead in that regard. The contracts being clear in these respects upon their face, and there being no evidence that the appellant was misled as to their terms, the decision in The Provident Savings Life Assurance Society v. Mowat ([33]), and the cases there cited seem applicable.\nUnder the circumstances I agree that there \u00abhall be no costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : McGibbon, Casgrain, Ryan & Mitchell\nSolicitors for the respondents : Geoffrion, Geoffrion & Cusson.\n[1] 19 Times L.

The plaintiff, Bellew, is an insurance broker in Montreal and in May, 1902, by arrangement with the defendants, he went to Halifax to endeavour to receive applications for insurance from the members of the fourth contingent which was about to be sent to South Africa He effected insurance on the lives of 235 officers and men all the policies, aggregating $251,000, being issued by the defendant company. Each policy contained the following provisions:\n\"The renewal contract of assurance defined upon the third page hereof shall be indisputable after one year from the date of entry upon the same, for the amount due, provided the premiums are duly paid as set forth in the renewal agreement; except that military or naval service in time of war without a permit are risks not assumed by the society at any time, further than that the reserve on this assurance only, will be due and payable in case of death from such service.\n\"A. I hereby agree on behalf of myself and of any person who shall have any claim or any interest in any policy issued under this application as follows: First, that I will not within two years from the date of policy to be issued under this application, travel or reside in any part of the torrid zone or north of the parallel of sixty degrees north latitude.\n\" It is understood and agreed that this policy is issued and accepted upon the additional condition of a further payment of an extra annual premium of twenty-five dollars whenever and as long as the occupation of the assured shall be that of a soldier in army of Great Britain in time of war.\n\" This extra premium shall be payable at the time, in the manner, and subject to the conditions specified in this policy for premiums and their payment, and shall be embodied in the regular statutory premium notice and in the regular premium receipt. \"It is understood and agreed, in connection with policy No.\u2014\u2014for $\u2014\u2014, dated May 12th, 1902, of Form 507 A, and issued on the life of that, in consideration of written application therefor, and also of the payment of an annual ' extra premium ' of $25, the assured has hereby consent to engage in military service in South Africa in the army of Great Britain, any restrictions in the policy contract to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\nThe following facts were admitted:\n1. The military corps in question in this case sailed for South Africa from Halifax in three detachments, on the 8th, 16th and 23rd May, 1902.\n2. On May 29th. 1902, a cessation of hostilities took place between the British forces and the armies of the Transvaal Republic and Orange Free State, and on June 1st, 1902, a treaty of peace was signed, terminating the war.\n3. The soldiers of the Fourth Contingent in question in this case reached South Africa after such declaration of peace and the cessation of hostilities.\n4. The soldiers of the Fourth Contingent in question sailed from South Africa on their way home on or about July the 1st, 1902.\nAs the company refused to issue the policies until the premiums were paid the plaintiff advanced the money for the purpose taking assignments from the insured of their pay from the Department of Militia to the extent of the sums paid. As the contingent did not reach South Africa before the war ended the department refused to honour the assignments so far as the extra premium was concerned and the plaintiff brought action against the company for the amount of such premiums, $6,275.\nThe Superior Court held that the insured were never members of the army of Great Britain in time of war and gave judgment for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench. The company then appealed to this court.\nGreenshields K.C. and Laftamme K.C. for the appellants. The risk attached when the contingent left Halifax. See Marshall on Insurance, vol. 2, p. 673 Em\u00e9rigon Trait\u00e9 des Assurances, vol. 1, pp. 62, 67.\nThere was a reasonable cause for payment of the extra premium and it cannot be recovered back.\nRyan and Garneau for the respondent The company was subjected to neither liability nor risk so that the extra premium was paid without consideration. Am. &Eng. Ency of Law, (2 ed.) vol. 16, p. 954.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and SEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal.\nGIROUARD J. concurred in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting). I agree with the conclusions reached by the Court of King's Bench and substantially with the reasons therefor given by Mr. Justice Blanchet.\nThe appellant agreed to insure the lives of as many of the men comprising the Fourth Canadian Contingent of militia and volunteers then at Halifax en route to South Africa to join the army of Great Britain there as would make the necessary application and pass the proper examinations.\nThe respondent who was an insurance broker was authorized by the company to proceed to Halifax and effect the insurances, provided he secured 200 out of the 2000 members of the contingent, and an annual extra premium of $25 per $1,000 for the war risk. The policies were issued in the company's ordinary form of twenty annual payments of $24.78 \"whole life\" and with a stipulation that \"military or naval service in time of war without a permit were risks not assumed by the society at any time.\"\nAs the object and intention of the society and of the men insuring were clearly to cover the risks incident to the contemplated service of the latter in the army of Great Britain, in South Africa, against the forces of the then Transvaal Republic and Orange Free State with which Great Britain was at war, and as the condition of the ordinary policy prohibited such service, an extra premium of $25 on each $1,000 insured was exacted and the following two clauses either pasted or written on the policies :\nIt is understood and agreed that this policy is issued and accepted upon the additional condition of a further payment of an extra annual premium of twenty-five dollars whenever and as long as the occupation of the Assured shall be that of soldier in army of Great Britain in time of war.\nThis extra premium shall be payable at the time, in the manner, and subject to the conditions specified in this policy for premiums and their payment, and shall be embodied in the regular statutory premium notice and in the regular premium receipt.\nNew York, N.Y., May 12th, 1902.\nWM. E. STEVENS,\nSecretary,\nTHE PROVIDENT SAVINGS LIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY OF NEW YORK,\n346 BROADWAY, N.Y.\nIt is understood and agreed in connection with policy No. 127,605 for $1,000.00 dated May 12th, 1902, of Form 507 A. and issued on the life of Herbert Crawley Dickey, that, in consideration of written application therefor, and also of the payment of an annual \"extra premium\" of $25.00, the Assured has hereby consent to engage in military service in South Africa in the army of Great Britain, any restrictions in the policy contract to the contrary notwithstanding.\nWM. E. STEVENS,\nSecretary, Now bearing in mind that military or naval service was not per se prohibited by the original policy but only \" in time of war \" it is clear that the extra risk the society was insuring against and receiving the extra premium for was a \"war risk\" and that such war risk was limited to service by the assured \"in the army of Great Britain in South Africa\" and was renew-able while the war thus going on lasted. It was not necessary for the assured to pay any extra premium in order to serve in the army of Great Britain in South Africa or elsewhere in time of peace. The policy did not prevent an assured from doing that. The extra risk assured by the company and paid for by the assured obviously was the risk attached or incident to service in the army of Great Britain in South Africa in time of war.\nAn ingenious argument was advanced that the extra war premium was really paid on the ordinary life policy the risk on which had attached and in order to obtain a consent, waiver or permission from the company to the assured to engage in the South African war as a soldier of the British Army. But looking at all the circumstances it appears to me that this war risk was a new substantive risk for which a new agreement was entered into and a new premium paid. The fact of it being indorsed upon the life policy did not matter. To my mind it was just as if a new war risk policy was issued. The risk under the new agreement had not attached and did not attach till the conditions specially mentioned in it had come into existence, namely, until the assured had become a soldier in the army of Great Britain in South Africa in a time of war.\nThe whole case, in my judgment, turns upon the proper construction of the policy and the two memoranda indorsed upon it relating to the extra risk assumed.\nNo evidence of any kind was offered as to the members of this Canadian contingent being or forming in any way part of the \"army of Great Britain\" before they arrived in South Africa. Nor do I think it would have availed the appellant had he given such evidence because the attaching of the risk and its location were fixed and determined by the contract to commence in South Africa.\nThe war was at an end before and when the Contingent arrived in South Africa. Hostilities there had ceased. Peace had been proclaimed and the special conditions under which and under which alone the extra risk was to arise never existed. If the assured ever was a soldier of or in the army of Great Britain in South Africa it was during a time of peace and not of war, a time and condition which neither called for nor justified an extra premium. If the contingent had arrived in South Africa one day before the cessation of hostilities and the evidence had shown it had been received or drafted into Great Britain's army there the risk would have attached and the premium could not of course be recovered back. But never having attached and it not being possible that it could have attached during the year I am of opinion that it can be recovered back.\nMr. Greenshields submitted that it was reasonable to argue the premium had been paid in part for permission to cross the torrid zone, a prohibited area, by the terms of the policy. At first I felt inclined to yield to that argument, but I think on more reflection and examination of the policy that the language of the new agreement referring to and defining the extra risk controls that restriction in the original policy and shews just the extent of the war risk which the company was accepting and for which the assured was paying. The prohibition invoked was inconsistent with the new agreement and does not apply to it and must be read and construed as applicable only to the ordinary life policy under which the ordinary life risks were incurred, the ordinary premium paid and the customary prohibitions agreed to. On the other points I agree also with the judgment of Mr. Justice Blanchet.\nNESBITT J.\u2014I was of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed, but reflection has convinced me that it should be allowed. It is clear law that where the risk does not attach, or where by reason of the parties not being ad idem there is no contract, the moneys paid for premiums are recoverable. See Porter on Insurance, 3rd edition, 90 to 92, and cases there collected. Also Fowler v. Scottish Equitable Life Ins. Soc. ([1]) ; and Foster v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Assoc.([2]).\nIt is equally clear, in the case of a life policy, that where the risk has attached, or the premium begun to be earned for any space of time, the annual premium paid in advance is not recoverable. In this case the policy, issued upon what is known as the flat rate, provided that the insurance should not go into effect until the first premium had been paid, and that all premiums were due and payable in advance, and it also provided that should the insurance cease or become void by the violation of any stipulation or agreement, all payments made or accepted should be retained by the society.\nAnother clause provided for indisputability of the renewal contract of assurance after one year from the date of entry upon the same, provided the premiums were paid, \"except that military or naval service in time of war without a permit are risks not assumed by the society at any time.\"\nAnother clause provided that the application should be made a part of the contract, and the application contained the following:\nI hereby agree on behalf of myself and of any person who shall have any claim or any interest in any policy issued under this application as follows:\u2014First: That I will not within two years from the date of policy to be issued under this application, travel or reside in any part of the torrid zone or north of the parallel of sixty degrees north latitude.\nHad this policy been issued in that form, I think that, upon the insured embarking at Halifax, as a member of the fourth contingent, intending to take part in the war then pending in South Africa, if he had died after entering the torrid zone on the voyage, or if he had been killed by the ship being attacked by any Boers who might have escaped, or if the assured had died of disease contracted on the transport, which is one of the chief causes of risk in war time, the policy would have been voided.\nIt has been held, however, by the courts below and was argued here, that the further contract of insurance, known as the war risk, removed these obstacles to the right to recover under such circumstances. Such further contract is shown by the two following indorsements:\n1. It is understood and agreed that this policy is issued and accepted upon the additional condition of a further payment of an extra annual premium of twenty-five dollars whenever and as long as the occupation of the assured shall be that of soldier in army of Great Britain in time of war.\nThis extra premium shall be payable at the time, in the manner, and subject to the conditions specified in this policy for premiums and their payment, and shall be embodied in the regular statutory premium notice and in the premium receipt.\n2. It is understood and agreed, in connection with Policy No. 127,- 805 for $1,000 dated May 12th, 1902, of Form 507A, and issued on the life of Herbert Crawley Dickey, that, in consideration of written application therefor, and also of the payment of an annual \" extra premium\" of $25, the assured has hereby consent to engage in military service in South Africa in the army of Great Britain, any restriction in the policy contract to the contrary notwithstanding.\nIt has been held that the indorsement No. 2, by its very terms, involved the idea that the parties had waived the \"travel limit\" clause as it must be assumed that the parties contemplated the journey co South Africa in order that the limited war risk should attach. The parties were, in my view, contracting on the basis of the fourth contingent being, once they embarked from Halifax, no longer militia but soldiers of Great Britain intended for hostile operations in South Africa, and I think that the $25 extra money was paid to cover the risk attaching to them as members of such fourth contingent in war time renewable each year no matter how long the war lasted, provided that as such soldiers they participated in hostilities in South Africa. One of the chief risks of war, as I have said, is the risk of disease in transportation to the seat of war or to the actual place of hostilities. The company also agreed on receipt of the $25 to insure the applicant as a war risk for the then current year, and to continue such insurance from year to year as long as the war might last and this was the consideration for the $25 paid. The applicant, the moment he paid his extra $25 and received his policy with this indorsation, clearly had a right, if the war continued for any number of years, to pay from year to year his extra $25, being engaged as a combatant in South Africa during the time, a right which had not previously existed. I think, bearing in mind what the flat rate covered and the added risks occurring after the embarkation from Halifax when in point of time a state of war existed, and the further right of compell\u00edng a renewal war risk, that some consideration was given by the company for the additional premium I and that but for this further bargain the applicant would not have been protected during the voyage and, therefore, he cannot recover the $25 so paid.\nKILLAM J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed.\nThe claim is for the return of money as having been paid upon a consideration which has failed. The position taken in the courts below was that the extra premiums were paid only for the risk of military service in South Africa, in the army of Great Britain, in time of war, and that as, upon the arrival of the assured soldiers in South Africa and during their stay there, the contemplated state of war did not exist, the risk never attached and the consideration for the extra premium had failed.\nWhile, undoubtedly, the only war which was contemplated as the one in which the assured were to be engaged was the existing war between Great Britain and the Republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State in South Africa, the provisions respecting the extra premiums were not so limited. The judgments have not proceeded upon any claim that the policies differed from the terms of the agreements upon which the premiums were paid. No such contention has been raised before us. The argument proceeded solely upon the interpretation of the policies.\nThe company insisted upon payment of the premiums before issuing the policies. In order to determine whether the considerations for the two classes of premiums were severable, and what they were, we must examine each policy as a whole. We should read with the ordinary form of policy, containing the provision that \"military or naval service in time of war without a permit are risks not assured by the society at any time,\" the clauses indorsed or annexed as follows:\nIt is understood and agreed that this policy is issued and accepted upon the additional condition of a further payment of an extra annual premium of twenty-five dollars whenever and as long as the occupation of the assured shall be that of soldier in army of Great Britain in time of war.\nThis extra premium shall be payable at the time, in the manner, and subject to the conditions specified in this policy for premiums and their payment, and shall be embodied in the regular statutory premium notice and in the regular premium receipt.\nIt is understood and agreed, in connection with Policy No. 127805 for $1,000, dated May 12th, 1902, of Form 507 A, and issued on the life of Herbert Crawley Dickey, that, in consideration of written application therefor, and also of the payment of an annual \" extra premium \" of $25, the assured has hereby consent to engage in military service in South Africa in the army of Great Britain, any restrictions in the policy contract to the contrary notwithstanding.\nWhen the policies issued it was uncertain what would be the duration of the then existing war. It might continue for years; it might end, as it did, without the insured incurring any real risk incident to actual participation in it.\nFurther, the stipulations for the extra risk were not limited to the war then in progress. The consent was\nto engage in military service in South Africa in the army of Great Britain\nand this was expressed to be given in consideration of an \"annual extra premium of $25.\" The provision for an \"extra annual premium\" was that it was to be paid\nwhenever and as long as the occupation of the assured shall be that of a soldier in army of Great Britain in time of war,\nThe policy was one under which the assured was to be covered so long as his occupation should be that of a soldier in the army of Great Britain in time of war provided he should keep up the payment of the extra premiums. The company incurred the risk of a continuance of the existing war for years, and it incurred the risk of Great Britain becoming engaged in other wars and of the assured participating in them as a soldier in the British army. Whether this risk was to be limited to South Africa only is not now important.\nIt cannot, I think, be properly said that the consideration upon which the extra premiums were paid wholly failed. As the company incurred the risks and bound itself to their continuance so long as the extra premiums should be paid, it was entitled to the benefit of the cessation of the existing war.\nIt appears to me that the judgment in favour of the plaintiff should be set aside and the action dismissed, with costs here and in all courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Greenshields, Greenshields, Heniker & Mitchell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Jacobs & Garneau.\n*Leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused (xliii, Can, Gaz. 376).\n[1] 4 Jur.

Judgment appealed from (10 B. C. Rep. 473) affirmed, Davies J. dissenting.\nHeld, per Nesbitt J. \u2014 That in an action founded on negligence it is advisable that specific questions should be submitted to the jury to enable them to state the special grounds on which they find negligence or no negligence.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1], which reversed the judgment of the trial court in favour of the defendant and ordered a new trial.\nThe defendant had undertaken to tow the respondents' ship into Victoria, B.C., from a point outside the harbour where she had been driven by a gale. The ship was attached to the defendant's tug by a hauser and proceeded to haul up her anchor when the winch chain broke. After the necessary repairs had been made, the ship continued to haul in the anchor chain without regard to the position of the tug which was such that the tug could not exercise power over the ship and, when the ship broke ground, she was swung by the current upon an island near by and was injured. In an action for damages founded on negligence and want of skill, judgment was entered in favour of the defendant upon the verdict of the jury, but this judgment was set aside by the judgment now appealed from and a new trial ordered on the ground that, in charging the jury, the trial judge had failed to point out the bearing of the facts in evidence upon the questions to be determined and, consequently, that the jury had been misled by the incompleteness of the charge.\nThe questions at issue upon the present appeal are fully discussed in the judgments now reported.\nPeters K.C. for the appellant.\nBodwell K.C. for the respondents.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014From what took place at the time of the trial, I think that the learned trial judge did not give proper and full directions to the jury and, as a consequence, that the latter did not understand the case. The confused state of their minds is revealed in the number of applications by them for further instructions which the judge did not, however, give, holding that they involved only questions of fact. I entirely concur in the opinion of my brother Justice Nesbitt.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I would allow this appeal. On full consideration of all the facts proved and in evidence before the jury I do not doubt that they fully understood the charge of the trial judge. His language, it is true, is vague but it must be read and understood in the light of the facts as they were then before the jury and, so read now, or heard by the jury then, I think they leave no reasonable room for doubt. I do not think the real facts to be determined were\nimperfectly and inadequately stated by the judge and so stated as tending to mislead the jury.\nAt any rate, if the counsel for the plaintiff thought the charge defective for non-direction it was his duty clearly to have pointed out the nature of the charge the judge should have made, and I am not satisfied that he did this.\nAs, however, a majority of my colleagues think that, under the circumstances, there should be a new trial for non-direction, I purposely refrain from discussing at length the reasons why I differ from that conclusion.\nNESBITT J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia directing a new trial in a case tried by a jury in which a general verdict was rendered in favour of the defendant.\nThe case was very fully argued and the appellant relied upon certain authorities (which I propose shortly to analyze), as establishing the position that the case at the furthest was one simply of non-direction, and that in any event the judge was not bound to do more than direct the jury as to the law which, it was contended, had been very fully done by the learned trial judge in this case.\nI think it is necessary to refer to the pleadings to see whether the case which the parties went down to try was in fact tried out. In the language of Lord Halsbury in Bray v. Ford[2], at page 48\nthe case must be tried again and I desire to say nothing which can in any way influence the arguments upon the trial which must take place.\nThe plaintiff in substance charges in his statement of claim that the tug \"Mystery\" coming alongside the \" Santa Clara\" which had drifted in a storm to a position just outside Trial Island, the captain represented that his tug was supplied with plenty of power and could tow the \" Santa Clara\" from her then position to Ladysmith, and that relying upon such representations, which were the result of special inquiry, the ship's captain allowed the captain of the tug to undertake the towage. It is to be borne in mind that, apart from any special representation of this kind, the plaintiffs relied upon the rule of law that a steamboat engaging to tow a vessel for a certain remuneration, while not warranting her ability to do so under all circumstances and at all hazards, does engage that she will use her best endeavours for that purpose and will bring to the task competent skill and such a crew' tackle and equipments as are reasonably to be expected in a vessel of her class, and that she does not become relieved from her obligations because unforeseen difficulties occur in the completion of her task, and, furthermore, that the captain of such a tug is bound to know the various currents, etc., which set about the places where he undertakes to tow from. In this case, as I have said, an express representation was alleged to have been made that the tug was of capacity to tow a boat double the size of the \"Santa Clara.\"\nThe defence substantially set up was that the damage occurred owing to the negligence of those on board the \"Santa Clara\" in breaking ground with the anchor at a time when the tug was in a position that she could not reasonably be expected to save the \"Santa Clara\" from drifting on the rocks.\nSuch being the substantial issue to be tried the plaintiffs say that the learned trial judge proceeded to give a very full and accurate statement of the law of negligence and contributory negligence and adverted at considerable length to a further suggested defence, namely, that owing to the breaking of one of the propeller blades on the tug, the tug was unavoidably deprived of the power she otherwise would have had, but that he did not apply the law to the facts, or give the jury any instruction as to what the plaintiffs claimed were the obligations undertaken by the defendants and what would form an answer in law by them, and that the questions by members of the jury showed that they were unable to grasp what the real issues were, and particularly unable to appreciate what bearing, as a matter of law, the last act of negligence, as it was described by the trial judge, had upon the case, and I think it is apparent from the questions asked both before the jury retired and afterwards when they came into court to seek information that they were greatly puzzled to know how to apply the law, as stated to them by the trial judge, to the facts. Mr. Bodwell, at the conclusion of the charge, pressed in various ways upon the trial judge a request that he should charge the jury that the plaintiffs relied upon an express representation as to the power of the tug and if they found that that representation was made that it would have a double bearing on their view of the case: First, that, as a matter of law, if the representation was made the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict, and: Secondly, in any event, that the captain of the \"Santa Clara\" was entitled to assume that he could safely break ground with his anchor in the position the tug was in, as he claimed that the evidence showed that if the tug was of sufficient power she could easily have prevented drifting, and that, therefore, under such circumstances, the act of the captain of the \" Santa Clara\" was not negligence, in fact being reasonably prudent with a powerful tug. He also pressed upon the trial judge that under his direction the jury would naturally assume that the hoisting of the anchor was an act of negligence per se, and that if that act was found to have been, in point of time, the last act before the disaster it amounted to substantially a direction to the jury to find for the defendant. I agree that the charge is open to this construction.\nThe learned trial judge, after the jury returned to court and made some inquiries, repeated in another form his definitions of negligence and contributory negligence, but Mr. Bodwell again requested the trial judge to point out to the jury how the law did apply to the facts, and the more I read the direction to the jury the more I am convinced that the jury had a very confused idea of how they were to apply the law to the facts before them.\nA number of cases were commented on to shew what was the duty of a judge in directing a jury. I think that one cannot do better than adopt the language of Lord Watson in the case of Bray v. Ford[3], at page 49,\nthat every party to a trial by jury has a legal and constitutional right to have the case which he has made either in pursuit or in defence fairly submitted to the consideration of that tribunal.\nI think it is very dangerous to quote from cases statements of the duty of a judge in directing a jury which are only applicable to the particular case. I quote the language of Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathem[4]: Now before discussing the case of Allen v. Flood[5], and what was decided therein, there are two observations of a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat what I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all.\nMuch reliance was placed upon the language of the court in Ford v. Lacey[6], as adopted by the Privy Council in the case of the Great Western Railway Company of Canada v. Braid[7], (at page 122) namely that\nnon-direction is only a ground for granting a new trial where it produces a verdict against the evidence.\nLet us see the circumstances under which that language was used. Turning then to Ford v. Lacey[8], it will be found that that was a case for trespass for breaking and entering land of the plaintiff, and it appeared that the plaintiff had been for many years in the occupation of certain lands, and the land, the subject of the action, according to the plaintiff's case, formed part of a property of the landlord of the plaintiff, and that the land in question had been left dry by the river gradually changing its course. Four questions were left to the jury and a motion for a new trial was made upon the ground that the judge ought to have directed the jury on the question raised by the defendants, that land left by the gradual change of a river becomes part of the adjoining property. Mr. Baron Bramwell pointed out that the rule had not been obtained on the ground of the ver- dict being against evidence, and Chief Baron Pollock pointed out that the assumption of liability argued for did not arise where there was positive evidence of ownership, which existed in the case in question, Mr. Baron Martin thought that the third and fourth questions left to the jury were the real and substantial questions in the case, and that, so far as he could see, the evidence appeared to be all one way, and said that as the verdict was right and there was no complaint of it being against evidence, he did not see how the fact of the judge not having drawn the attention of the jury to a particular proposition of law could be a ground for setting aside the verdict. Mr. Baron Bramwell said that the court thought there might be some cases where non-direction would amount to misdirection, but he did not see that the fact of the judge not having adverted to the law upon the point in that case amounted to a misdirection. And Baron Channell (at page 355) said:\nI do not mean to say that it may not be a good ground for a new trial that a direction has been left so bare as to require an explanation to prevent the probability of its being misunderstood. For instance suppose a plea of payment and no evidence to show an actual delivery by the defendant of the money claimed, but evidence of circumstances amounting in point of law to a payment, if the judge, without informing the jury of the legal effect of those circumstances, left it nakedly to them to say whether or not there had been a payment, I think so bare a direction would amount to a misdirection that would justify a new trial. But if the law is clear, as it is here\u2014for there is no question that the law as laid down by Lord Hale is correct\u2014and if, as here, the jury have found a distinct issue, I do not think that the omission of the judge to instruct the jury respecting a clear proposition of law which does not affect the issue, is an omission of anything he was bound to state.\nIs the non-direction complained of here of the character referred to in that case?\nIf the facts here were found by the jury as the plaintiff contended for they would necessarily find no negli- gence upon his part, and it seems to me that the jury were left wholly without direction as to the application of the law of negligence to the particular contentions which the parties were respectively making.\nThe observations of Mr. Justice Brett in the case of Bridges v. The North London Railway Co.[9] were also much relied upon. Those observations would not be disputed if read in connection with the case. The learned judge, at page 150, sets out what a plaintiff must prove in order to shew that defendants were guilty of negligence causing the injury, and that as between him and the defendants such negligence was the sole cause of the injury, and he points out that such a direction is not sufficient; it requires to be amplified by a legal definition as to what amounted to negligence and he proceeds to give such definition and then says:\nThe final and full and strict direction to a jury, therefore, in such cases, is contained in the following questions: Have the defendants or their servants done anything in the conveyance of the plaintiff to his destination which persons of ordinary care and skill under the circumstances would not have done? * * * Have they or their servants by such act of commission or omission caused injury to the plaintiff? Did the plaintiff do anything which a person of ordinary care and skill would not have done under the circumstances, or omit to do anything which a person of ordinary care and skill would have done under the circumstances, and thereby contribute to the accident? The plaintiff can only recover if he satisfies the jury by evidence that the defendants or their servants were guilty of negligence as described and that he has been injured thereby, and that he has not been guilty of negligence, as described, contributing to the accident.\nHe then proceeds to consider what is the duty of the judge before giving such a direction, and then follows the sentence so much relied upon, (at page 160), namely:\nWhen the judge has so directed the jury as to the law he has finished all which it is legal for him exclusively to determine in the case. He ought then, though I do not think there is any legal absolute obligation on him to do so, to point out to the jury the bearing of the facts in evidence upon each of the questions which they must determine, and which of the facts are in his judgment in dispute, and that there are not only the facts directly deposed to which are to be considered but facts or propositions of fact which are to be inferred by them from the facts directly deposed to, and finally that it is for them to say whether the facts directly in evidence and adopted by them, and the facts and propositions of fact inferred by them, do or do not amount in their judgment to proof of the propositions which the plaintiff is bound to maintain. But the judge has no legal right, either directly or indirectly, to force upon the jury his view of any fact or inference of fact.\nHe follows this statement by amplifying at considerable length what he means, pointing out that judges would have no right, for instance, in such a case as that before him, to say to a jury that the calling out of the name of a station was no intimation that the passengers might, on the stopping of the train, alight; that was a matter in his opinion of life and habits solely for the determination of the jury. I do not view this as in any way impeaching the view generally held that a judge's duty is to place distinctly before the jury the application of the rules of law laid down by him according as they find the facts and inferences of the facts are made out. I consider the illustrative charge given by the learned judge the best possible example of what I mean when I say the law must be applied to the facts. I do not think the judge is bound to comment upon evidence in the sense of reviewing what the several witnesses have sworn to, or to point out for the consideration of the jury anything which may strike him as throwing light upon the credibility of the story, but I think he is bound to direct the jury as to the law and to direct their attention how that law is to be applied to the facts before them according as they find them. Reliance was also placed upon the judgment of Lord Justice Bramwell in Clark v. Molyneux[10], (at page 243) where that learned judge said:\nI certainly think that the summing-up is not to be rigorously criticized; and it would not be right to set aside the verdict of a jury because, in the course of a long and elaborate summing-up, the judge has used inaccurate language ; the whole of the summing-up must be considered in order to determine whether it afforded a fair guide to the jury, and too much weight must not be allowed to isolated and detached expressions. In the present case, however, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that the question left by the judge to the jury was put in an inaccurate shape.\nI adopt this but it is to be observed that, in that case, the Lord Justice was of opinion that the very form of the questions left by the judge to the jury was in itself a misdirection. And I think, in this case, without, as I have said, expressing any view whatever upon the evidence, that the form of the charge must necessarily have left the jury in a confused state of mind, and that they were not directed as to the real contest between the parties and as to what should be the proper result in law according to the view they took of the facts sworn to. The plaintiff was suing upon a contract the very making of which involved certain legal obligations which obligations the plaintiff contended were added to by express representations which in any point of view he contended rendered his conduct perfectly proper and not negligent, whereas if such representations had not been made and were not relied upon by the captain of the \"Santa Clara\" the jury might take a very different view of the reasonableness of his conduct under the circumstances. None of this was pointed out to the jury. If questions are answered by a jury many difficulties are avoided and the jury's attention would be directed to the points at issue. In case of a new trial I would suggest that, particularly in actions of negligence, it is well for a trial judge to get from a jury, by questions to be answered, the grounds specifically upon which they find negligence. Lord Coleridge in the case of Prilchard v. Lang[11], uses some strong expressions in reference to this subject, in fact saying that in pursuing the course of not asking the jury to put the specific ground upon which they found negligence was calculated to mislead them and to defeat justice.\nI have had an opportunity of reading the judgment prepared by my brother Killam and I entirely concur in the view he expresses regarding the respective duties of judge and counsel and the distinction between misdirection and non-direction.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKILLAM J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. Stated in the abstract, it may be said that it is the duty of a judge presiding at a jury trial to see that the jury are instructed as to what are the issues of fact upon which their findings are required, and the law relating to these, and how their verdict should be according as their findings of fact are in one way or another. But the degree in which it is important to point out these things expressly in a formal charge must always depend upon the circumstances of the case.\nIt can never, then, be a sufficient statement of an objection to the judge's charge that he did not apply the law to the facts. If in the opinion of counsel some further direction than that given by the judge is required, in justice to his client, counsel should formulate the propositions of law, applicable to the factsi which he desires that the judge should express to the jury and ask the judge to instruct the jury accordingly. I find nothing in section 66 of the Supreme Court Act, 1904, referred to by Mr. Justice Martin in the court below, which varies in these respects the practice at common law. The effect of that section in regard to objections not taken at the trial is not now in question.\nIn The Great Western Railway Co. v. Braid[12], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council expressly approved of the rule stated to have been laid down in Ford v. Lacey [13], that\nnon-direction is only a ground for a new trial when it produces a verdict against the evidence.\nWhile this may be taken as the general rule, it must be confined to cases of pure non\u2014direction, and not applied to cases in which non-direction on some particular matter amounts to 'misdirection.\nUpon the latter point the correct principles were well stated by Lord Blackburn in The Prudential Assurance Co. v. Edmonds[14], at pages 507-8:\nI take it that when there is a case tried before a judge sitting with a jury, and there arises any question of law mixed up with the facts, the duty of the judge is to give a direction upon the law to the jury, so far as is necessary to make them understand the law as bearing upon the facts before them. Further than that, it is not necessary for him to go. * * * So far as a statement of the law is necessary to give a proper guide to the jury upon the case, the judge should state it; and, although it is generally said, and said truly, that non\u2014direction is not a subject of a bill of exceptions, yet when the facts are such that in order to guide the jury properly there should be a direction of law given, the not giving that direction of law would be a subject for a bill of exceptions and would be a ground for a venire de novo. When once it is established that a direction was not proper, either wrong in giving a wrong guide, or imperfect in not giving the right guide, to the jury, when the facts were such as to make it the duty of the judge to give a guide, we cannot inquire whether or no the verdict is right or wrong ashaving been against the weight of evidence or not, but there having been an improper direction there must be a venire de novo. Upon a careful reading of the charge, I am of opinion that the portion relating to contributory negligence, especially after the return of the jury into court, was calculated to leave the jury in a very confused state of mind respecting the law. The learned judge was not bound to tell the jury, as the plaintiffs' counsel asked, that there was an express warranty or representation of the power of the tug. That was matter of inference from the evidence of a conversation. It might have been better if the judge had asked the jury to considei the conversation and take it into account in determining how far the plaintiff's captain was justified in relying upon the tug's power and whether, in view of that and the other circumstances, he was negligent in raising the anchor when he did. But the omission to do this was merely an omission to comment on particular portions of the evidence.\nSome parts of the charge, however, seem to me to have been misleading. These were the portions in which the learned judge spoke of the last act of negligence as a determining factor. It was for the jury to find on the power of the tug and whether, if the tug had had the requisite power, she might have been able to save the ship even after the anchor had been raised. An alleged deficiency of power was one of the chief complaints on the part of the plaintiff, and yet it was hardly likely to be considered by the jury as the last act of negligence.\nUpon the whole I think that the court below was right in directing a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Peters & Wilson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bodwell & Lawson.\n[1] 10 B.

The case stated for the opinion of the court below was as follows:\n\"Case Stated for the Opinion of the Court.\nOct. 11, 1901.\n\"The prisoner was charged before me under section 305 of the Code, that on a certain day in the month of April, A.D. 1901, he unlawfully did steal one piece of Oregon pine wood, of the value of five dollars and forty cents, the property of His Majesty the King.\n\"At the conclusion of the evidence, Mr. Power, counsel for the accused, objected that the charge of stealing in this case must allege that the offence was committed fraudulently and without colour of right, etc.\n\"I found the prisoner guilty, but at the request of his counsel I suspended sentence, and granted a reserved case, upon the following question:\n\"1.

But for that opinion I would have had no doubt whatever as to the sufficiency of the charge, and would have refused the application for a reserved case.\n\"(Signed), W. B. WALLACE,\n\"Judge of County Court, District No. 1,\nand Judge of the County Court Judges'\nCriminal Court for the County of Halifax.\"\nWhen the case was heard by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting in banco, that court was constituted of four of its judges only, being a quorum according to the rules of practice. The majority of the judges, Weather be J. dissenting, were of opinion that the charge to which the prisoner pleaded and upon which he was tried and convicted was not bad by reason of the omission to charge the offence as having been committed fraudulently and without colour of right, and ordered the case to be remitted to the trial court and the proper sentence passed upon the prisoner. The prisoner appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nJohn J. Power for the appellant. The charge was insufficient. It should have set out in substance all the elements which under sec. 305 of the Criminal Code constitute the offence of theft or stealing; in other words, it should have been averred that it was done \"fraudulently and without colour of right\" and with \"intent, etc.\"\nThere was no jurisdiction in the court below to render the decision now under appeal. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, by sec. 5 of the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, is composed of seven judges and, as constituted, in banco, of a number less than seven judges, it had no jurisdiction to hear or determine the case reserved by the judge of the County Court Judges' Criminal Court. Section 3, (e, iii) of the Criminal Code requires criminal appeals or cases reserved, in Nova Scotia, to be heard before the court in banco. See definition of \"Court in banco\" in the Century Dictionary, also in the Imperial Dictionary. Order 58, Rule 7, and Order 61, Rule 1, of the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, fixing the quorum of judges on the hearing of appeals, relate merely to civil matters and do not affect procedure in criminal and matrimonial cases. These rules are rules of procedure only, passed under section 45 of the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, and do not relate to the \"constitution\" of a court. See British North America Act, 1867, sec. 92, s.s, 14. Section 15 of the Imperial Judicature Act of 1881 allows a court composed of five judges to hear criminal appeals in England. Prior to the passing of that Act all the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench attended during arguments of Crown cases reserved. As no such provision regarding the proper quorum in criminal cases exists in Nova Scotia, the attendance of all the judges of the Supreme Court of that province is necessary to give jurisdiction.\nLongley K.C., Attorney General for Nova Scotia, for the Crown, was not called upon for any argument.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSedgewick J. (Oral).\u2014\"We are all of the opinion that there was jurisdiction in the court below to hear and decide the case reserved and that the court as then constituted, composed of a quorum of the judges only, was properly constituted for that purpose.\nWe are also of opinion that the offence of which the appellant was accused is sufficiently stated in the charge upon which he was convicted in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court.\nThe appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John J.

The order was placed with a firm in Buffalo and the price going down C. & Son forwarded money to the latter to cover the margins. P. having written the brokers to know how he stood in the transaction received an answer stating that \u201cno doubt the wheat was bought and has been carried, and whether it has or not our good money has gone to protect the deal for you\u201d on which he gave them his note for $1,500 which they represented to be the amount so advanced. Shortly after the Buffalo firm failed and P. became satisfied that they had only conducted a bucket shop and the transaction had no real substance. He accordingly repudiated his liability on the note and C. & Son sued him for the amount of the same.\nHeld, Davies and Killam JJ. dissenting, that the evidence showed that the transaction was not one in which the wheat was actually purchased; that C. & Son were acting therein as agents for the Buffalo firm; that the transaction was not completed until the acceptance by the firm in Buffalo was notified to P. in Toronto; and being consummated in Toronto it was within the terms of sec. 201 Crim. Code and plaintiff could not recover.\nHeld also, Davies and Killiam JJ. dissenting, that assuming C. & Son to have been agents of P. in the transaction they were not authorized to advance any moneys for their principal beyond the sums deposited with them for the purpose.\nHeld per Davies and Killam JJ. that the transaction was completed in Buffalo and in the absence of evidence that it was illegal by law there the defence of illegality could only be raised by plea under rule 271 of the Judicature Act of Ontario. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff but reducing the amount of the damages.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note and in the judgments published herewith.\nW.R. Smyth for the appellant. Sec. 201 of the Criminal Code makes this transaction illegal and not merely void as was that in Read v. Anderson[1], and similar cases. See Anson on Contracts, 8 ed. p. 258, for the distinction between the two.\nIt being illegal the plaintiffs cannot recover. Leggait v. Brown[2].\nIllegality need not be pleaded. Re Summerfeldt v.

Universal Stock Exchange v. Stevens[7].\nEven if it was a wagering contract plaintiff can recover for money advanced on defendant\u2019s behalf Read v. Anderson1.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and SEDGEWICK J. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Killam. NESBITT J.\u2014In this case, as I understand, a different view having been taken of the facts by at least one of my brother judges I have again gone carefully over the evidence, and a re\u2011perusal of it satisfies me that Camp & Co. were carrying on in Buffalo what is popularly known as a bucket shop, pure and simple, that is to say, there was an absolute unreality as to any transactions. They never placed nor intended to place any order which was telegraphed to them but simply entered same upon the sheets and bet against it. I have also no doubt whatever that Carpenter & Co. were agents for Camp & Co. by whom they were paid a commission, and that when Pearson went in and instructed a purchase or bet, whichever view is taken of the evidence, that that was telegraphed on by Carpenter & Co. to their principals, Camp & Co., and no transaction was entered into either by bet or otherwise until Camp & Co. signified to Carpenter & Co. that Carpenter & Co. were authorised by them to issue a memorandum (which took the form of a sold note) and that the transaction was not completed until the acceptance of it by Camp & Co. was received in Toronto and notified to the customer there. If this is a proper view of the transaction then it was not consumated except in Toronto, and it is to my mind clearly within section 201 of the Criminal Code, and being illegal is within the reasoning of this court in Walsh v. Trebilcock[8].\nIf the view is taken that Carpenter & Co. were agents for Pearson, and that everybody understood that the substance of the transaction was a mere bet, I am unable to find that there was an implied authority to do more than pay over the money deposited at the time, and I think it would require express instructions from Pearson to Carpenter & Co. to pay money on a lost bet such as this to enable Carpenter & Co. to recover from Pearson. I do not think that such a transaction as this comes within the purview of Read v. Anderson[9], That was a case of a simple bet, not of a succession of payments on further bets arising out of the original bet which is this case. Even on this view of the evidence that Carpenter & Co. were agents for Pearson to telegraph to Buffalo to make a bet, it is plain that the bet never became a bet until Carpenter & Co. notified him of the acceptance of it by Camp & Co., and the transaction would still be within the section of the Code I have referred to. In my view, however, the defence set up by Pearson is the correct one. I think that in all of these cases it is a question of fact whether the transaction entered into is really that of betting as in Universal Stock Exchange v. Strachan[10], or whether there was a knowledge upon the part of both parties that no transaction really ever took place. It is to be noted that both the Messrs. Carpenters swore in the most positive terms that they had no actual knowledge that the transactions of Camp & Co. were merely betting transactions. They both swore that they had a right to assume that when Camp & Co. telegraphed back accepting the order telegraphed to them that such an order was in fact placed; and it is to be noted that when they telegraphed similarly to Ladenburg, Thalman & Company, or Bartlett & Fraser that the transactions were in fact placed, and while as in Universal Stock Exchange v. Stevens[11], there never was any expectation that the stocks would actually be asked for, yet, if they were asked for at any time, evidence was forthcoming that the transactions had been originally placed and were carried, and, therefore, the customer was bound, on the one hand, to pay any losses that might occur in selling the stocks out or, on the other, he could, if he desired, pay up the balance over and above the margins and get his stocks. I have no doubt whatever that Pearson was perfectly aware of the difference between the two styles of broker\u2019s offices, and it was for this reason that he made the inquiry that he did in his letter of April 6th, in which he says:\nSATURDAY EVENING, 6th April, 1901.\nMESSRS. CARPENTER & SON.\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014You will have to tell your people that I cannot arrange more margins just now on that wheat. I suppose Monday will be a holiday but I expect to be back Tuesday. Am going to Rochester tomorrow. If they purchased the stuff I must try and arrange it some way but don\u2019t you pay any money on my account.\nYours truly,\nJ. PEARSON.\nand again on April 9th:\nTORONTO, April 9th, 1901.\nMESSRS. CARPENTER & SONS.\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014As you have seen fit to consult a solicitor I presume you are inquiring what your rights are, it will not be out of place for me to see what mine are. I had not been thinking on this line.\nThe only open transaction is the wheat. The others are closed. I gave you the order to buy and if this order was carried out then I have 30 M bushels of May wheat bought and if party with whom I am dealing has sold this wheat for me then I am behind in my margin and intend to put it up but if he closed out the transaction as soon as the margin I had up was exhausted or before that then I do not owe him anything. It all depends on the facts.\nNow as you have asked me for a letter and I have written it I ask you for one to state just how the transaction stands\u2014the actual facts.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) JAMES PEARSON,\npp. \u201cD.\u201d\nAnd, as I have said, until inquiry was made it was impossible for him to tell whether the transaction was a mere bet or was, as in the case of the two brokers\u2019 offices I have mentioned, a real transaction. I cannot understand what object he had in writing this letter except it was trying to ascertain his position. He knew or supposed that he was not liable to pay if it was a mere bet, which is apparent from the fact that he wanted them not to pay any money on his account. He knew the doctrine of Read v. Anderson[12] and was guarding himself against the notion of Carpenter & Co. claiming to make good the loss upon his (Pearson\u2019s) bet. And, on the other hand, if the transaction was one they could shew had been placed he knew that he would be liable to pay. To this letter Carpenter & Co. replied on the 9th April as follows:\nTORONTO, April 9th, 1901.\nJ. PEARSON, Esq.,\nBarrister, &c., City.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Answering yours of to-day you are mistaken in thinking that we consulted a solicitor professionally respecting our right against you. All we did was this: our senior partner\u2019s private solicitor is Mr. Teetzel and being with him on private business yesterday it occurred to him to inquire whether he knew you, and on being informed that he was well acquainted with you ventured to inquire as to your standing, and in the course of confidential talk told Mr. Teetzel of the relation between us and expressed his anxiety on account of the size of your account, and also explained that the claim being large, and not knowing you personally, some quibble might be raised, whereupon Mr. Teetzel volunteered to phone you more as a friend than a solicitor to know if there was any trouble. Mr. Teetzel assured him you were a gentleman of high honour and if everything was fair we need fear no trouble.\nNow the facts are: Your order was placed with us as your broker, and we at once wired to purchase, and as your agents forwarded from time to time your margins, as our books will show. No doubt the wheat was bought and has been carried, and whether it has been or not our good money has gone to protect the deal for you. You also knew from the beginning that we held ourselves directly responsible to you and you could have no misgiving as to our financial ability to meet all engagements undertaken. We regret that you should suggest even the idea of a dispute between us, and while greatly regretting the deal has gone against you we feel assured you will acknowledge our legal and moral claim without delay. Let us have settlement and in the mean time write us when we are to close the deal.\nYours truly,\nCARPENTER & SON,\nper D.\nAnd upon this Pearson gives the note in question in this action.\nHow it can be said by Carpenter & Co. that upon its turning out upon their statement that the wheat had actually been carried that they could recover upon a note given entirely upon the faith of its being a real transaction I cannot understand. It does not lie in the mouth of the person who makes the statement of fact to say that the other party should have known better, and that is really what the judgment of the Court of Appeal comes to.\nI do not see what object Pearson would have in writing the letter unless it was for the purpose of finding out whether he was bound to pay or not. It has been said that, if it is found to be a gambling transaction, that has not been pleaded, and the defendant has disclaimed any desire to take advantage of the section in the Criminal Code. My answer is that that is not the business of the defendant but of the court whose duty it is to refuse to give assistance to a plaintiff asking to enforce an application arising out of an illegal transaction.\nI adopt the language of Lord Justice Lindley in Scott v. Brown[13] at p. 728.\nI think the real facts are that Pearson was not sure whether the whole thing was a bet or not, that in order to make himself sure he wrote the letters that he did, and that Carpenter & Co. are bound by their answer, and that the note was given on the representation that the transactions were real and that the wheat was in fact purchased and carried, and the evidence makes it perfectly plain that there never was a transaction. If this view of the evidence is not taken I think certainly that it is clear that if all the parties knew the whole thing was a mere betting transaction from beginning to end that, nevertheless, the substance of the transaction was that Pearson proposed to Carpenter & Co., in Toronto, to make a bet knowing that they would telegraph his offer to a principal of Carpenter & Co., and both parties perfectly understanding that the bet would not be made until Carpenter & Co. signified to Pearson, in Toronto, that they were ready and willing to make the bet on behalf of their principal and went through the form (if it is to be assumed that they were really only betting) showing a real transaction of purchase and sale, and that, therefore, the transaction was expressly within the Criminal Code and Carpenter & Co. cannot recover for moneys paid by them in a matter arising out of such illegal transaction. I would also hold in any event that if Carpenter & Co. are held to be the agents of Pearson that the only authority they possessed was to forward the moneys deposited by him on the original making of the bet and that in such a case there is no implied authority to forward other moneys to make good additional losses, but that there must be in every such case as this an express request to pay the money on behalf of the person sued, and there is no pretence of an express request in this case by Pearson to Carpenter & Co. to pay any further or additional moneys for him, but that they must be taken to have assumed to pay them relying upon his honour to make restitution to them.\nPeople carrying on this type of business should understand that the courts will not be eager to assist, and that when they get the original amount out of the party with whom they deal, they must be very alert to get the actual money for further losses; and that if they see fit to give credit for such pretended further losses they cannot come to the courts of this country for aid to collect.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nKILLAM J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in an action for the balance claimed by the plaintiffs upon a promissory note for $1,600 made by the defendant in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs carry on business as brokers and financial agents in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario. The defendant speculated through their Toronto office in stocks, grain, etc., upon margin; and the note in question was given in respect of a claim made by the plaintiffs for moneys said by them to have been advanced for him to protect his transactions.\nAt the trial the plaintiffs recovered judgment for the full amount claimed by them. The Court of Appeal reduced the amount by a sum advanced upon a transaction found by the court to have been made contrary to direction from the defendant, but confirmed the judgment for the balance, which is now alone in question.\nThere is no doubt that the plaintiffs made the advances. It seems to me quite clear that the courts were correct in finding that the plaintiffs had the authority of the defendant to make advances necessary to protect his transactions.\nThe defence set up by the pleadings was that the plaintiffs had obtained the note by representing to the defendant that they had made purchase or sales in accordance with the defendant\u2019s orders when, in fact, no such purchases or sales had been so made. The transactions in question were carried on between the plaintiffs and a firm in Buffalo, N.Y., styled Camp & Co. The defence pleaded rests upon the theory that the plaintiffs were merely the agents of Camp & Co., by whom the purchases and sales were to be made, and that, in reality, none were so made or attempted to be made by Camp & Co., but that, as between the plaintiffs and Camp & Co, there was merely a series of speculations by Camp & Co. in differences which were charged or credited to the plaintiffs according to circumstances as upon assumed purchases and sales.\nThe learned trial judge found that Camp & Co. were the agents of the plaintiffs to effect the purchases and sales, that while Camp & Co. did not make real purchases or sales they reported such to the plaintiffs as having been actually made, and that the plaintiffs, believing the reports and having made the payments relying upon them, were entitled to recover the amounts.\nThe Court of Appeal held, upon the evidence, that the plaintiffs were the agents of Camp & Co., whose real business and the transactions in question were of the nature found by the trial judge, but that both the plaintiffs and the defendant knew the nature of the transactions, and that, as the moneys had been paid under authority to so deal, the defendant was bound to repay them.\nThere can be no doubt that Camp & Co. never made or assumed to make any contracts of purchase or sale on the defendant\u2019s behalf with any other persons. The most that can be contended for is that any contracts or transactions were made or conducted between Camp & Co. and the defendant through the medium of the plaintiffs acting as the agents of one party or the other or partly for each. And in my opinion none of the parties ever intended or expected that there were to be any real contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities or stocks.\nIn the particular cases out of which this action has arisen the defendant initialled and gave to the plaintiffs a memorandum in the following form:\nMEMO.\nBuy 18th May.\n10 May wheat\nat 76 7-8 & 20 at 76 1-2.\nJ. P.\nThe plaintiffs telegraphed an offer in these terms to Camp & Co., and it was accepted. The defendant knew nothing of Camp & Co. It was not material to him whether the plaintiffs effected a deal with another party directly or through the medium of some one in Buffalo. He obtained what he sought\u2014an arrangement by which there was to be the semblance of a sale to him and a subsequent re-sale, as a result of which he was to receive or pay the difference in market prices. The result was a loss which he, and not the plaintiffs, should bear. The defence on the record failed.\nBefore the Court of Appeal, as appears by the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, the defendant disclaimed any desire to avail himself of the defence that these were gambling transactions. He now seeks to do so.\nIf it were clear that the contracts were wholly made in Toronto between the defendant and Camp & Co. through the agency of the plaintiffs, it appears to me that they were directly within section 201 of \u201cThe Criminal Code, 1892.\u201d\nAnd, probably, as the transactions and the authority to make the advances were all linked together and the plaintiffs directly parties to them all, the advances would not be recoverable. On the other hand, there seems to be nothing in the statute or otherwise to make it unlawful to employ a person in Canada to enter into such transactions abroad, though the agent\u2019s right to recover for moneys advanced upon them would probably depend upon the law of the country where they were entered into.\nIn the absence of express or implied prohibition by statute, moneys paid at the request of another in discharge of a lost bet or wager made by or for the latter is recoverable under the law of the Province of Ontario. See Hussey v. Crickitt[14]; Rosewarne v. Billing[15]; Knight v. Cambers[16]; Bubb v. Yelverton[17]; Oldham v. Ramsden[18]; Read v. Anderson[19]; Bank of Toronto v. McDougall[20].\nWhether this is the law in the State of New York; whether there is there any statute similar to ours or which, either expressly or by implication, makes money paid upon such transactions as that now in question non-recoverable, there is nothing to show.\nBy Rule 271 under the Judicature Act of the Province of Ontario:\nEach party in any pleading shall raise all matters which show the action or counter-claim not to be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of law, and all such grounds of defence or reply, as the case may be, as if not raised would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the preceding pleadings, as for instance, fraud, Statute of Limitatations, release, payment, performance, facts showing illegality either by statute or common law, or Statute of Frauds.\nIf the evidence made it clear that the consideration for the note was illegal the defect in pleading would be easily got over. Although the plaintiffs were spoken of by some of the witnesses as agents of Camp & Co. and were allowed commissions in their dealings, yet upon the evidence as a whole, I am inclined to the view that the plaintiffs acted as agents of the defendant to carry on the dealings for him, and that the transactions should be deemed to have occurred in Buffalo. But whether this view is correct or not, still, in the absence of the plea, it should not be assumed that all the evidence was given that could be given upon the question as to where the transactions should be considered to have taken place. And whatever might be the presumption in a proper case as to the law in New York, it would be a presumption of fact which could not properly be raised without the plea because, if raised, it might have been rebutted.\nI think that the new defence should not be allowed at this stage, and in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Wm.

C. being eventually heavily in the other\u2019s debt it was agreed between them that if he could procure the signatures of his wife and daughter, each of whom had property of her own, as security, W. would give him a further advance of $1,000. Though unwilling at first the wife and daughter finally agreed to sign notes in favour of C. for sums aggregating over $7,000, which were delivered to W. Neither of the makers had independent advice.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, Taschereau C.J. dissenting that though the daughter was twenty-three years old she was still subject to the dominion and influence of her father and the contract made by her without independent advice was not binding,\nHeld also, Taschereau, C.J. and Killam J. dissenting, that his wife was also subjected to influence by C. and entitled to independent advice and she was, therefore, not liable on the note she signed.\nHeld, per Sedgewick J. that the evidence produced disclosed that the transaction was a conspiracy between C. and W. to procure the signatures of the notes and that the wife of C. was deceived as to his financial position and the purpose for which the notes were required therefore the plaintiff could not recover.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.

Duval4.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal.\nThe opinion delivered by the Chief Justice of Ontario is unanswerable I entirely agree with his reasoning. A proper understanding of the facts of the case as they have been found by the trial judge and by the Court of Appeal, unanimously, leaves no room for the application of the law and of the authorities upon which the appellants have attempted to support their contentions.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I entirely agree with the conclusions at which my brother Girouard has arrived in his very able and exhaustive judgment, but it appears to me that the same end might have been reached by a less elaborate process. To my mind the transaction impeached in this case is a most unconscionable one, a transaction the like of which, so far as I know, no court of equity has ever ventured to affirm. Reading as well what is conspicuously between the lines as the lines themselves, the following facts may, I think, be fairly gathered from the evidence.\nThe real plaintiff, one Walmsley, is a stock broker of considerable wealth, in the City of Toronto. For three years, at least, he and the defendant, E. Strachan Cox, who was possessed of but little means, were dealing jointly in the purchase and sale of mining and other stocks, speculating to the extent of over a million dollars. For the purpose of carrying on this business Walmsley would discount Cox\u2019s paper whenever it was necessary for him to do so. The final result of these speculations was that, while Walmsley made out of them what may be regarded as a small fortune, Cox came out of them, not only penniless, but very heavily involved, owing Walmsley several thousands of dollars. Walmsley had managed to obtain from Cox an absolute transfer of all possible interests that he had in any mining stock in which they both, theretofore, had been interested, as well as all stocks he held in his individual name, and began pressing for payment of the balance due (a wholly usurious balance), although he was aware that Cox had no means whatever of paying the debt out of any assets of his own. He, however, was determined either to get his money or security for it.\nNow it happened that the appellant, Mrs. Cox, was a lady who held a life estate in certain property devised or bequeathed to her by her father, and that their only child, a girl of twenty\u2011three, Evelyn by name, had a reversionary interest in the corpus of the estate. It also happened that Cox was very anxious to raise the sum of $1,000 for his own personal benefit, probably to try his luck once more at the casinos or bucket shops which are becoming so numerous in the larger cities of this country, and the idea was conceived\u2014Cox asserts by Walmsley, while Walmsley asserts by Cox\u2014of achieving the desires of both of them, namely, security for Walmsley, and $1,000 for Cox, at the expense of Mrs. Cox and her daughter. So it was proposed that Walmsley should advance $1,000 to Cox, upon Cox inducing his wife and daughter to become surety to Walmsley for the debt which Cox owed him and for the $1,000 proposed to be advanced, Walmsley, in effect, saying:\nYou will get the $1,000 cash, if you can manage (honestly if you can, but somehow, anyway), to get your wife\u2019s and daughter\u2019s signatures to promissory notes in my favour.\nHe knew, as I have said, that Cox was worse than worthless. He knew that he could give nothing of a pecuniary kind to his wife and daughter in consideration of their assisting him, but nevertheless, he held out as a bribe to Cox for the use of his marital and parental influence over the mother and child, the $1,000 which the latter was so feverishly anxious to obtain. Cox thereupon proceeded with his task. It is unnecessary to go into details. After many days, not only of expostulation and entreaty but also upon the most atrocious misrepresentation of his financial position and his prospects of ultimate success from property which he then falsely asserted that he owned, they both were induced to sign the notes which are the instruments sued on in this case.\nI look upon the whole thing as a conspiracy between Walmsley and Cox to rob, for their mutual advantage, those weak and trustful ladies. I call it a conspiracy because both the conspirators must have known that there was no prospect or likelihood that Cox would ever be able to make good the amounts for which his wife and daughter were to become responsible, and, therefore, it was a deliberate attempt on the part of both to defraud them. The evidence shows conclusively, and it was so admitted by all parties at the argument, that Cox obtained these signatures by false pretences, and that his proper place was in a penal cell. It is said, however, that Walmsley was not affected by the criminal conduct of Cox. I would have found; as a juryman, that he was a party to it, but that is not necessary, in my view, where he gets the benefit of his companion\u2019s crime.\nIt makes but little difference, the name of the particular relationship which existed between the two. Cox may not be in strict legal parlance the agent of Walmsley, but he was his instrument, a tool used by him to work out, at the expense of mother and daughter, Cox\u2019s indebtedness to him, and therefore he was responsible for everything that Cox had done in order to carry out their dishonest scheme.\nI need say no more. If the case be such as I have represented it then the equitable principles regarding undue influence need not be resorted to, with reference to which I can usefully add nothing to what my brother Girouard and my brother Davies have said.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014As I understand the case there is only one serious issue, namely, that of undue influence which the courts below disposed of in a few words. The trial judge (Falconbridge C.J.), came to the conclusion that so far as the ladies were concerned, the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act entirely covered the case. Without examining the effect in law of the notice which Walmsley had of the relation between his debtor and his wife and his only child, Miss Cox, the learned judge concludes: It would add new terrors to the conduct of the banking business, if the law were declared to be that if a person indorsing to effect a loan should suggest the name of his wife or daughter as joint maker of a note, or even if the banker intimated that he would discount a note made by the wife or daughter, that the would-be borrower should be hereby constituted the agent of the banker, so as to bind the banker by his statements or his mis-statements.\nThe same misconception of the case seems to have prevailed in the Court of Appeal. Chief Justice Moss said:\nHe (Walmsley), had no knowledge of the means employed by the defendant E.S. Cox, and the makers have failed to show any facts or circumstances from which notice or knowledge of any infirmity affecting the title to the notes can be attributed to him.\nKnowing that these notes were to be obtained from the appellants as sureties by a man having control over them as husband and father, was not Walmsley bound to ascertain that they knew exactly what they were going to do? Was he not under some legal obligation to inform them of the nature of the transaction and recommend competent and independent advice? If that advice had been taken, is it probable that the gross misrepresentations and fraud perpetrated by the principal debtor would not have been discovered by the solicitor inquiring either from Walmsley or elsewhere, as was done later on, about the time of the institution of this action, when the ladies asked the advice of Mr. Laidlaw, K.C.? The courts below have not dealt with this branch of the case, and in the few remarks I intend to offer I will confine myself to that particular point.\nOur duty is not to find out what would be most beneficial to banks and money lenders. I do not agree, however, that a decision reversing the courts below would add \u201cnew terrors to the conduct of banking business.\u201d The same banks which deal in Ontario find it profitable to have offices in the Province of Quebec, where the law is far more sweeping. In that province no married woman, separated as to property, can bind herself either with or for her husband directly or indirectly, as surety or otherwise, even when fully understanding the facts and having competent and independent advice. In such a case her obligation is absolutely null and void even in the hands of a third party in good faith and for cash value, for instance the holder in due course of a note, at least to the extent to which she failed to take any benefit. I am not aware that any bank, although bound to use extraordinary precautions, has left the Quebec field of operation, or has suffered materially in consequence of this rigourous law, although it has been in force for more than sixty years; (Art. 1301 C.C). If we are able to judge from the law reports of the province, even sharpers have not been frightened, for they are flourishing in Montreal as well as in Toronto. The reports of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for the current year afford an interesting and most remarkable illustration of the application of the Quebec law in Trust and Loan Co. of Canada v. Gauthier[12]. Like the English equity rule respecting undue influence, it is founded on the best interests of society, the peace and harmony of families, which is not only equal but superior to the welfare of banks. Whatever may be the consequences, the law must be applied whether the creditor represents a regular banking house or a mere bucket or shaving shop. If by possibility incorporated banks should place themselves in the position of Walmsley, I do not see how they could receive better treatment. The sooner it is understood that a perfect knowledge of the transaction by all the immediate parties is necessary in matters where confi- dential relations exist, the better for society, the banks and all concerned.\nBut is it not mere irony to compare a regular banker to a common shaver or financial shark? Is it possible to imagine a bank lending for years thousands of dollars upon the mere name of one person in bad repute from a business point of view? Can any one conceive a bank charging interest at a rate varying from one-quarter of one per cent per day to three per cent per month as Walmsley did for years. But it must be added, however, that when he secured the signatures of both ladies, he generously reduced it for the future to one and one-half per cent per month or 18 per 100 per annum. Banks do not enter into mining or other speculations, although they frequently promote them upon the security of shares and other securities furnished by the individual speculators\u2014an operation to which Walmsley, a man of wealth, often resorted, paying a moderate rate of interest, in this instance 5 or 6 per cent per annum.\nThe notes sued Upon were largely the ultimate result of a series of transactions between jobbers or dealers in mining stocks, one having no money and no credit, but any amount of energy and self-confidence and all the illusions peculiar to his profession, and the other having large means enabling him to carry them on to a profitable end. Their dealings were large; sometimes shares were bought on separate account and sometimes on their joint account especially 1980 shares of Crow\u2019s Nest Pass Coal Company; but in every instance Walmsley was always careful to get an absolute transfer of Cox\u2019s interest as security for any balance which might be due to him in any transaction. The Crow\u2019s Nest shares cost $104,940, which was advanced by the Imperial Bank to Walmsley, he getting from Cox, as usual, the full title to the shares which he deposited with the bank. After a few years of more or less unprofitable operations, for Cox at all events, in the fall of 1899, the mining excitement collapsed and Cox was found to be indebted to Walmsley in a large balance, some $13,000, covered by scrip in various mining companies, which, ultimately, all went to grief, except Crow\u2019s Nest Pass Company. As at that time, 1899, there was a great falling off in the value of mining stock generally and Crow\u2019s Nest shares in particular, Walmsley\u2014for reasons it is difficult to understand, as he already had an absolute transfer\u2014exacted from Cox a complete and final release of his interest in these shares which was signed on the 11th of October, 1899, although Cox swears that Walmsley promised him verbally to let him share in the profits, if any, a statement emphatically denied by Walmsley. It was about this time that Mrs. Cox appeared upon the scene. Cox was in great straits for money. Walmsley was demanding the arrears of interest. He knew that Mrs. Cox enjoyed a life interest in the wealthy estate of her father, James Gooderham Worts, securing her an annual income of $10,000, sufficient for the needs of the family, subject to a reversionary interest to her daughter, worth about $200,000, and besides this she had the homestead and furniture in Toronto. Cox brought two notes signed by his wife and indorsed by him, one for $3,000 and the other for $900. Walmsley discounted these notes in October, 1899, after the release of the Crow\u2019s Nest shares was signed. He gave Cox, in cash, $1850 on the first note and $819 on the second, charging a discount of 36 per 100 per annum. When speaking of the last note for $900, Cox writes that\nmuch against my will I persuaded her to give me the inclosed. I do not know why you should always get your own way.\nOf course, these notes were not met and remained on sufferance for some time. In August, 1900, Walms- ley pressed for a settlement. He writes to Cox on the 23rd that he\nwould like to see it closed tomorrow, or otherwise I shall hand matters to my solicitor.\nOn the 29th he repeats the threat. Cox wanted more money for his own use, for neither wife nor daughter ever benefited by the advances made to him even to the extent of one farthing. Cox swears Walmsley suggested that he should get the three notes sued upon signed by his wife and daughter, and he would give him $1,000 more. Walmsley swears, on the contrary, that the suggestion came from Cox himself. Be that as it may, I think the difference in their statements is immaterial. This passage of Walmsley\u2019s evidence is sufficient for the purposes of the case:\nQ. You thought if you could get the note of the girl and the note of her mother, you would agree to renew the old debt and give a fresh advance?\u2014A. Yes.\nOne thing is certain; at all times Walmsley knew of the confidential relations existing between Cox and his wife and daughter, whatever that may mean in law, and did nothing to prevent fraud and misrepresentation by informing either of these ladies of the true state of affairs and recommending them or either of them to take competent and independent advice. He did not do so before Cox applied to the ladies, nor pending the negotiations which lasted a few days, nor before making the fresh advance of $1,000, or rather, to use perhaps more correct language, before paying to Cox what appears to me to be his reward for the violation of his natural trust and protection. As might be expected Cox had a most plausible story; these notes were wanted to carry the Crow\u2019s Nest shares and everything would be all right in the end. Such, he said, was also the opinion of Walmsley, known to the ladies as a shrewd and prudent speculator. The daughter, although affectionate and inclined to please her father, did not like to sign the notes at first, but, after three or four days of persuasion, she was willing to do so. The mother, who had more than once previously been deceived, was very reluctant, as she was at the time of signing the two notes in 1899; so the daughter says; discussions took place in the morning and evening, after breakfast and dinner; many tears were shed. Finally they both signed the notes and the $1,000, less interest, were paid to Cox who was very careful not to divulge to them this little secret.\nI am not prepared to admit, with the judges of the courts below, that Walmsley is not responsible for the false statements and misrepresentations of Cox; but I humbly submit that he knew it was a case of presumptive undue influence, that the daughter was about twenty\u2011three years of age and was living with her father and mother under the same roof, and, finally, that she had an expectant interest in a wealthy estate; he knew that she would not benefit by the transaction to the extent of one cent. Under these circumstances, was it not his duty to inform this affectionate and confiding young lady, having no business experience, to take independent advice? The practical d\u00e9nouement of all these manoeuvres has been that Walmsley, at the time of the trial, had realised or might realise the little profit of over $68,000 out of the Crow\u2019s Nest shares and that the wife and daughter of Cox are condemned to pay him $7,642.73, the principal and interest of the above notes, composed, to the extent of nearly one-half, of arrears of interest.\nThis extraordinary result induced the trial judge to express the hope\nthat the real plaintiff, Mr. Walmsley, relieved by this judgment of any possibility of having to account to Mr. Cox for any shares of the profits, in view of the enormous gain which has eventually accrued to him out of the transaction, would see his way to forbear pressing his suit to the bitter end against these ladies.\nThe expression of such a reasonable hope by a judge who saw and heard the witnesses, was useless. Not only is Walmsley resisting the highly equitable contentions of these ladies; he has even resorted to the extreme process of execution on the furniture of the homestead.\nBut what are the consequences, in law, of such a state of affairs? Is the wife liable because she is considered \u201cin all respects\u201d as a feme sole under the statutory law of Ontario, at least to the extent of her separate property? I will discuss this point later on, after having disposed of Miss Cox\u2019s case. Is she also liable? I have come to the conclusion that she is not, undue influence or fraud in law being presumed.\nAll the authorities agree that even a third party knowing the relation which is the foundation of this legal presumption can derive no benefit from the transaction, unless he establishes that competent and independent advice had been given to the party acting under such influence. Bridgman v. Green, 1755,[13]; Huguenin v. Baseley, 1807,[14]; Molony v. Kernan, 1842,[15]; Archer v. Hudson, 1844,[16]; Maitland v. Irving, 1846,[17]; Cooke v. Lamotte, 1851,[18]; Espey v. Lake, 1852,[19]; Baker v. Bradley, 1855,[20]; Smith v. Kay, 1859,[21]; Nottidge v. Prince, 1860,[22]; Berdoe v. Dawson, 1865,[23]; Sercombe v. Sanders, 1865,[24]; Rhodes v. Bate, 1866,[25]; Kempson v. Ashbee, 1874,[26]; Bainbrigge v. Browne, 1881,[27]; Altcard v. Skinner, 1887,[28]; Liles v. Terry[29]; DeWitle v. Addison, 1899,[30]; Powe\/\/ v. Powell,[31]; Barron v. Willis,[32]; Tunrbull v. Duvah[33].\nThe learned Chief Justice of Ontario, speaking for the Court of Appeal, and dealing with the defence of Miss Cox, finds that she is\na lady of intelligence, knowledge and firm will. She was fully aware of the nature of the act she was called upon to do and of its consequences. She may have been misled as as to the true purposes for which her father needed the notes, hut beyond stating his need and the reasons for it he does not appear to have exercised any control over her will. Apparently she was left without restraint to exercise her own free will and judgment after hearing her father\u2019s statement. Her mother was at first opposed to signing the notes, and to her daughter signing, and there appears to have been a considerable interval between the time when the matter was first broached and the signatures. She does not now say that she did not fully understand and appreciate the explanation of the transaction given by her father, nor has she sworn that she yielded to his parental authority, surrendering her own will to his without the exercise of her own judgment, and the circumstances do not demonstrate that she did. But the title of Walmsley to recover upon the notes is not to be effected by evidence such as offered in this case. Miss Cox had, undoubtedly, the capacity to contract generally. When it is sought to show want of capacity in the particular instance disabling her from incurring liability on the promissory notes in question, the right of the holder in due course should not be taken away unless upon clear and distinct proof of the infirmity and of his knowledge of it.\nI do not think the evidence goes so far as stated by the learned Chief Justice. Miss Cox is intelligent, it is true, but has no knowledge of business. She knew that she was signing notes to help her father, but she knew nothing of the nature of the transaction. She understood, from the repeated statements of her father, that she was helping him in a mining stock specu- Nation which he was carrying jointly with Walmsley. This was all untrue, but she never dreamed of asking him for paper or document showing his interest in the speculation, or of going to Walmsley, or elsewhere, for information, as a competent or independent adviser would have done; she simply believed every statement of her father as gospel truth. She had, undoubtedly, capacity to contract generally, but not under the special circumstances of the case unless she had independent advice. Walmsley knew of the confidential relationship existing between the father and daughter; that she was living with him and her mother in the same house; that she was young and yet under the dominion and control of her father; and, if he took no care to see that she got that independent advice, he did so at his own risk and cannot consider himself a holder in due course within sections 29 and 30 of the Bills of Exchange Act. The expression \u201cholder in due course\u201d, has no magic effect. It means nothing more than the \u201cholder in good faith and for value\u201d known to the commercial law in force before that Act, but he is in no better position under the Act. He had notice of the defect in his title, and knew, or is presumed to have known, of the illegality of the obligation of Miss Cox without competent and independent advice, and for that reason he cannot recover, even under the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act This is fully established by the cases cited above and it will be sufficient to quote from a few of them.\nIn Powell v. Powell[34], Farwell J. said:\nOn the authorities it seems to me not to be a question of actual pressure or deception, or undue advantage or want of knowledge of the effect of the deed. The mere existence of the fiduciary relation raises the presumption and must be rebutted.\nIn Allcard v. Skinner[35], Lord Lindley said: So long as the relation between the donor and the donee which invalidates the gift lasts, so long it is necessary to hold that lapse of time affords no sufficient ground for refusing relief to the donor.\nIn Rhodes v. Bate[36], Sir G.J. Turner, L.J. said:\nAge and capacity are great considerations in cases in which the principle does not apply; but, I think, they are of little, if any, importance in cases to which the principle is applicable. They may afford a sufficient protection in ordinary cases, but they can afford but little protection in cases of influence founded upon confidence.\nIn Liles v. Terry[37], Lopes J. said:\nI do not think that evidence of any explanation by the solicitor of the document or any assistance given by him to enable the client to understand the effect of it is of any avail to prevent the application of the general rule. What the solicitor ought, in such case, to do is to suggest to the client that, in order to make the gift effectual, the client should procure independent professional advice.\nIn Berdoe v. Dawson[38], securities obtained from sons, aged twenty-five and a half and twenty\u2011three years respectively, for their father\u2019s debt were sec aside although the solicitor of the creditor declared positively that they knew what they were doing and that he gave them full information upon the subject and explained everything to them. The Master of the Rolls, Sir John Romilly, said:\nNow one of the principal things which the court always requires, in matters of this description, is, (as Lord Eldon observes in several cases), proof that it was a \u201crighteous transaction,\u201d and the strongest and best evidence is this\u2014that the person giving up his property should have an independent solicitor and independent advice in the matter.* * *\nThe case of Baker v. Bradley[39] is a distinct authority on that subject. The marginal note is this: \u201cA mortgage was made of property by a father and son, immediately after the latter had obtained his majority, to secure debts due from the father, to some extent incurred in improvements on the property and in maintaining and educating the son. The mother joined in the security for the purpose of subjecting to it her separate estate, which she was, however, by a clause not recited or noticed in the mortgage, restrained from anticipating. The son had no separate advice on the occasion. Held, that the mortgage was not capable of being supported as a family arrangement, but was void as obtained by undue influence.\u201d\nIn Sercombe v. Sanders[40], the same eminent judge observes:\nIt is not sufficient to show that a man knew what the actual transaction was, you must also show that he is emancipated from control and had the advantage of a separate solicitor.\nIn DeWitte v. Addison[41], a casemuch similar to the present one, where two daughters, one nearly twenty-three years old and the other just over twenty-one, mortgaged their reversionary interest under a certain will to pay their father\u2019s debts and save him from being adjudicated a bankrupt, Romer J. said:\nI may here state that I repudiate the suggestion made on behalf of the defendants in this case, that the plaintiff must be taken not to have acted under parental influence, within the meaning of that phrase as used in the authorities, because no direct threat by the father is apparent, or because the plaintiff acted from affection for the father, and from that pressure that was brought to bear upon her morally by his pecuniary position and liabilities. Under these circumstances, under this parental influence, under the pressure of the father\u2019s position, she executes the mortgage in question. In the transaction she has no independent advice, in my opinion, within the meaning in which that phrase is used in the authorities that are cited and bear upon a case like this.\nIn the same case on appeal, after quoting the language of Fry J. in Bainbrigge v. Browne[42], Lord Lindley says:\nThen the next point which arises is this: Against whom does this inference of undue influence operate? Clearly, it operates against the person who is able to exercise the influence (in this case it was the father), and, in my judgment, it would operate against every volunteer who claimed under him, and also against every person who claimed under him with notice of the equity thereby created, or with notice of the circumstances from which the court infers the equity.\nIn this case of Bainbrigge v. Browne42, the trans- action was upheld, however, on the evidence. Fry J. added in conclusion:\nI think that the defendants were entitled to come to the conclusion that the children were resident away from their father, not under his control, fully emancipated from him, assisted by the advice of their friends, and by the advice of a solicitor who was bound to do his duty to them.\nIn Huguenin v. Baseley[43], which is looked upon as the leading case upon the subject, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon, says:\nWith regard to the interests of the wife and children of the defendant, there was no personal interference upon their part in the transactions that have produced this suit. If, therefore, their estates are to be taken from them, that relief must be given with reference to the conduct of other persons; and I should regret that any doubt should be entertained, whether it is not competent to a court of equity to take away from third parties the benefits which they have derived from the fraud, imposition or undue influence of others. The case of Bridgman v. Green[44], is an express authority that it is within the reach of the principle of this court to declare that interests, so gained by third persons, cannot possibly be held by them.\nIn Maitland v. Irving[45] the Vice-Chancellor, Sir L. Shadwell, said:\nThere may not have been in the minds of Mr. Brown and Mr. Irving the knowledge of the principles which govern this court. But it seems to me to be very extraordinary that men of mature age, who were carrying on a lucrative business, were told by a gentleman, who was himself unable to perform his contract with them, that he would procure a young lady who was residing with him, who was possessed of a large fortune and to whom he had been guardian, to give them a guarantee for the fulfilment of his contract\u2014it seems, I say, very extraordinary that, with full knowledge of all these circumstances, they should have at once acceded to the proposal without making any inquiry or taking any pains to ascertain whether the young lady was a free agent and perfectly willing, with a full knowledge of the consequences, to do what her guardian said he would invite her or propose to her to do.\nThe last case I wish to quote is Espey v. Lake[46], which is, perhaps, more in point, as the liability of the child, a young lady in her twenty-second year, appeared on the joint promissory note of herself and her step-father, given as surety for the debt of her step-father, in whose house she had been residing with him and her mother for many years. The holder of the note, Lake, was not charged with any misrepresentation or personal negotiations or interviews with the daughter who signed solely on the representations of her mother and step-father. Lake knew of the relations between the step-father and daughter; he was his brother in-law and constantly in the habit of meeting the daughter.\nThe Vice-Chancellor, Sir G.J. Turner, found this knowledge beyound doubt, but nothing more. He said:\nThe loan was to be a loan by Lake to Speakman, the step-father of the young lady. Now, what next took place? I take the circumstance from Lake\u2019s own affidavit in reply to this case. Lake says, \u201cI asked for security, and he, (Speakman), said he had no security to offer but that of his step-daughter, meaning Miss Espey.\u201d It is clear therefore, that Lake knew that the only security he could have was that of the plaintiff, the step-daughter of Speakman, who was, at the time, living in the house with her step-father, and under his influence. Lake, knowing these circumstances, nevertheless took the joint and several promissory note of Speakman and the plaintiff, dated the 1st of January, 1843, for securing the,\u00a3500.\nThe question arose on a motion in restraint of execution. The Vice-Chancellor, Sir G.J. Turner, finally said:\nI take it to be quite clear that the principles of this court go to this extent,\u2014that, in the case of a security taken from a person just of age, living under the influence and in the house of another person, with a relationship subsisting between such other person and the person from whom the security is taken which constitutes anything in the nature of a trust, or anything approaching to the relation of guardian and ward or of standing in loco parentis to the surety, this court will not allow such security to be enforced against the person from whom it is taken, unless the court shall be perfectly satisfied that the security was given freely and voluntarily and without any influence having been exercised by the party in whose favour the security is made, or by the party who was the medium or instrument of obtaining it.* * *\nIn the application of the principles of the court I see no distinction between the case of one who himself exercises a direct influence, or of another who makes himself a party with the guardian who obtains such a security from his ward. The defendant, Lake, left it to Speakman, who had influence over his young ward, as she may be called, to induce her to join in the security, thereby placing her more directly under undue influence than if he had applied for the security himself. Such a security cannot be maintained consistently with the principles of this court.\nIt has been contended that our decision in Trust and Guarantee Co. v. Hart[47], conflicts with this conclusion. I cannot see that it does. The gift in that case was not by the son to his father for the benefit of a creditor, but by a father to his son for the benefit of his grandchildren; it was a just family arrangement, resting on a very different basis from the one involved in this case. As stated by Mr. Justice Taschereau, who delivered the judgment of the court, at p. 559;\nHe, (the donor,) never, in fact, was under his son\u2019s influence. It is a gift by his son to him that might have been suspicious.\nBut is Mrs. Cox standing in a different position from that of her daughter? That is the last question we have to examine. Was she not, like her daughter, known to Walmsley to be under the control and influence of her husband? True, a married woman may validly contract to the extent of her separate property \u201cin all respects as if she were a feme sole.\u201d (Ont. Rev. Stat., 1897, ch. 163). But her daughter, being of age, can exercise the same and even greater rights. Why then a different rule in the determination of undue influence?\nThe point does not seem to be settled by authority binding upon us. There are decisions pro and con which will be found collected in White and Tudor\u2019s Leading Cases in Equity, (ed. 1886), vol. 2, pp. 621 to 641; Kerr on Fraud and Mistake (ed. 1902), pp. 172, 173; and in Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure (1903), vol. 9, pp. 456 to 459. Mr. Justice Cozens-Hardy, in the late case of Barron v. Willis[48], referred to some of these decisions and held that the relation of husband and wife is not one to which the doctrine of Hugenin v. Baseley[49] applies, although he admits that text\u2011writers seem to adopt the opposite view. In appeal, his decision was reversed and the transaction set aside, not on that ground, which was not even discussed by the judges, but on a different conclusion of fact.\nIn a more recent decision rendered by the Privy Council of Turnbull v. Duval[50], a Jamaica appeal, it was conceded that the question was not yet settled, the case turning specially upon the ground of fraud by the husband for which the creditors were held responsible. Lord Lindley said:\nWhether the security could be upheld if the only ground for impeachment was that Mrs. Duval had not independent advice, has not really to he determined. Their lordships are not prepared to say it could not. But there is an additional and even stronger ground for impeaching it. It is, in their lordships\u2019 opinion, quite clear that Mrs. Duval was pressed by her husband to sign, and did sign, the document which was very different from what she supposed it to be, and a document of the true nature of which she had no conception. It is impossible to hold that Campbell or Turnbull & Company are unaffected by such pressure and ignorance. They left everything to Duval and must abide the consequences.\nRelief was granted, but to do so in the present case the point of law must, I conceive, be determined.\nI confess that the view advocated by the text-writers commends itself to my judgment and knowledge of human nature. Can the wife be considered an entirely free agent as long as she lives with her husband in matters where her interest conflicts with that of her husband? Is the mother more capable than the daughter of forming a full and true comprehension of business affairs? Experience teaches us and the law reports establish abundantly that married women, in nearly all cases, are under the control and influence of their husbands and rarely can resist their mere demands and requests, much less their solicitations and supplications, and that these generally prevail, while threat and violence seldom do. The presumptive influence of the husband over his wife so permeates the laws of England that, till recently changed by parliament, all offences committed by a married woman in presence of her husband, except high treason and murder, were presumed to have been committed under coercion. Upon what ground can coercion and undue influence not be presumed in civil matters, when husbands or third parties through them claim extraordinary benefits and unfair advantages from their wives, is more than I can conceive. I cannot see that a material distinction can be made between the case of the mother and that of the daughter; the control may exist on some occasions in a less degree, but it is not a question of degree which may depend upon circumstances; some daughters may be more intelligent and firm than others; boys, especially those trained in business, may be more competent than their sisters; it is conceded that all hold the same legal position and that it always raises the presumption of undue influence. Why a different rule in the case of the wife? Can it be supposed that Walmsley did not know that Mrs. Cox was not free from that influence? He had not only presumptive but positive knowledge of the situation. In 1899, when one of the first notes was signed, Cox writes to him that at last he persuaded her to sign it. I have come to the conclusion that the rule which governs the case of Miss Cox applies also to that of Mrs. Cox and that, in fact, it applies to all near relations or persons placed in the same position of dependence and control. I think that this conclusion comes within the language of Lord Cranworth, in Smith v. Kay[51].\nIn my opinion, although this hill is framed upon the ground of this supposed fraud, the circumstances of the case, as now proved, make it abundantly clear that this fraud was totally immaterial in order to entitle the plaintiff to set aside this bond, upon the ordinary principle of this court which protects an infant or any other person who is from the relations which have subsisted between him and another person, under the influence, as it is called, of that other. My lords, there is, I take it, no branch of the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery which it is more ready to exercise than that which protects infants and persons, in a situation of dependence, as it were, upon others, from being imposed upon by those upon whom they are so dependent. The familiar cases of the influence of a parent over his child, of a guardian over his ward, of an attorney over his client, are but instances. The principle is not confined to those cases, as was well stated by Lord Eldon in the case of Gibson v. Jeyes[52], in which he says, it is \u201cthe great rule applying to trustees, attorneys or anyone else.\u201d\nI have less hesitation in arriving at this conclusion that I am inclined, on the evidence, to think that both these ladies, as in Turnbull v. Duval[53], Bridgeman v. Green[54], Huguenin v. Baseley[55] and Smith v. Kay[56], were, in fact, badly pressed and grossly deceived as to the nature of the transaction and that Walmsley became an active party to the fraud by the promise of $1,000 which it is hardly possible, under the circumstances, not to consider as a reward to Cox for betraying the persons who were entitled to his protection.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action of the respondent against the appellants with costs in all the courts. DAVIES J.\u2014After much consideration and considerable doubt so far as the appellant, Alice R. Cox, the wife of E.S. Cox, is concerned, I have reached the conclusion that the appeal must be allowed as regards both the appellants.\nI rest my decision upon the principle that both the wife and daughter, at the time they signed the notes sued on, stood towards E.S. Cox in the position of parties having confidential relationship with him; that the law, on grounds of public policy, presumes that the transaction was the effect of influence induced by these relations, and that the burden lay upon Walmsley, the indorsee of the notes and the beneficial plaintiff in the action, who took them with notice and full knowledge of the relationship, of showing that the makers had independent advice.\nI concur with my colleagues in holding that the Bills of Exchange Act does not relieve an indorsee getting possession of a note under circumstances and with knowledge, such as in this case, from such burden.\nI also agree that, apart from this beneficial and salutary rule of public policy, the facts would not in themselves be sufficient to justify interference with the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nWith respect to the case of Evelyn S. Cox, the daughter, I content myself with concurring in the judgments prepared by my brothers Girouard and Killam which I have read, and I adopt the reasoning and conclusion of my brother Girouard so far as Mrs. Cox\u2019s case is concerned.\nI admit that the authorities are by no means clear as to whether or not the wife does stand towards her husband within those degrees of confidential relationship requiring independent advice as a necessary condition precedent to the presumption of the validity of the gift or grant from her to him. Cozens-Hardy J. in the late case of Barron v. Willis[57], seemed to think that he was bound by authority to hold that the relationship of husband and wife was not one of those within the doctrine established by Huguenin v. Baseley[58], and the Court of Appeal[59], which reversed his decision upon another point, makes no reference to his judgment on that question.\nIn addition to the cases cited and commented upon by my brother Girouard, and as being at variance with those by which Cozens-Hardy J. thought himself bound, I would refer to Coulson v. Allison[60]. There a widower had married the sister of his deceased wife (a marriage not legal by the laws of England), and it was held, nevertheless, by Lord Chancellor Campbell, that the relationship thus constituted imposed upon the widower claiming the benefit of a settlement made on him by his wife\u2019s sister (with whom he had gone through the form of a marriage), the onus of showing that, at the time of entering into the transaction, she was fully and duly informed of all the circumstances of the case and of the possible consequences of what she was about to do.\nIn the case of McClatchie v. Haslam[61], it was said by Kekewich J. in setting aside a deed given by a wife to secure a debt due by her husband to a society of which he was secretary, that the rule laid down by Lord Westbury in Williams v. Bayley[62], was at least as strong in the case of a husband and wife as of a father and a son.\nA security given by one person for the debt of another, which is a contract without consideration, is, above all things, a contract that should be based upon the free and voluntary agency of the person who enters into it. Where the person giving that security is the wife of the debtor it does appear to me desirable and necessary that the same guarantee of that freedom and voluntary action should be made plain to the court before the security is upheld as would be required in the case of a child and a parent. I would even go so far as to say more desirable and necessary because, in my opinion, the peculiarly sacred and confidential relationship existing between husband and wife renders the exercise of undue pressure more easy and effective on the part of a husband than a father.\nThe influence of a man over a woman to whom he is engaged to be married is presumed to be so great that the court will not only look with great vigilance at the circumstances and situation of the parties, but will require satisfactory evidence that it has not been used. See Page v. Home[63], where, at page 235, Lord Langdale, master of the Rolls, says:\nIt is true that no influence is proved to have been used, but none can say what may be the extent of the influence of a man over a woman whose consent to marriage he has obtained.\nIn the case of Cobbett v. Brock[64], which was an action brought by a married woman to set aside an ante-nuptial security she had given for the debt of a man to whom, at the time, she was engaged to be married and whom she subsequently married, Sir John Romilly, the Master of the Rolls, said:\nI fully adhere to what I expressed in the cases of Cooke v. Lamotte[65] and Hoghton v. Hoghton[66], and, if this were a case between Mr. Brock and his wife, I should require him to prove all the requisites I have pointed out in those cases as necessary to give validity to the transaction.\nSee also Pollock on Contracts (7 ed.), 600-603; Kerr on Fraud (3 ed.), page 172. The law as it prevails in the United States on the question is thus summed up in 21 Am. & Eng. Encycl. (1 ed.) pp. 480-482, under the head of \u201cUndue Influence.\u201d\nNo relation known to the law affords so great an opportunity for the exercise of undue influence as that existing between husband and wife. Owing, however, to the common law disabilities of a married woman, the older cases do not present many instances of the application of the rules governing their transactions with their husbands.\nAnd, after referring to the close scrutiny to which transactions between husband and wife will be subjected in equity, where they will be set aside upon evidence which might be insufficient were the parties in no confidential relation to each other, the text goes on:\nThe principle is independent of any presumption and is universally recognized. Nearly all the courts, however, go further than this and bring the matter in line with the decisions as to agreements between other parties to fiduciary relationship, viz., that a presumption of undue influence exerted by the husband arises which is rebuttable by proof of the fairness of the transaction, full understanding and free agency on the part of the wife and that there was no fraud, concealment or imposition on the part of the husband.\nThe compiler refers to many authorities in support of the doctrine as laid down in the text, the reasoning in which is satisfactory and which seems fully to support the principle above quoted. See also Cycl. Law & Proc. vol. 9, page 456; Bispham\u2019s Principles of Equity (6 ed.), sec. 237; Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence (2 ed.) sec. 963.\nI would also refer to the case of McCaffy v. McCaffy[67], where the same principle was recognized and approved.\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the late case of Turnbull v. Duval[68], seems to have left the question still an open one. On the whole, and after much consideration, I am of the opinion, on grounds of public policy, that the safest and best rule to adopt is to hold that the confidential relations existing between the husband and wife bring them within the rule established by Huguenin v. Baseley[69], and that this appeal should be allowed as regards both appellants.\nAs regards third parties the rule is clear that where a gift has been obtained by undue influence, either presumed or actually proved, a purchaser for value subsequently taking with notice of the equity thereby created or with notice of the circumstances from which the court infers the equity will be bound thereby. Bainbrigge v. Browne[70]. In the case before us, no possible doubt can exist that Walmsley, the beneficial plaintiff, when he took the notes in question, was fully aware of the existence of the relations between Mrs. and Miss Cox and E.S. Cox, and was, therefore bound by the rule.\nKILLAM J.\u2014I agree that the appeal of the defendant Evelyn S. Cox should be allowed and the action dismissed against her, with costs here and in all the courts below.\nAfter the exhaustive examination of the authorities made by my brother Girouard it is quite unnecessary to discuss them further. The equitable principle is well known and firmly established. A child recently come of age and still subject to parental dominion and influence to the extent of not having wholly become a free agent, is not deemed capable of making a binding donation to the parent or of becoming security for the parent or entering into a transaction with the parent under which the latter obtains a benefit, without inde- pendent advice. Family settlements are a class by themselves and do not now require consideration.\nI think that the defendant Evelyn S. Cox was still under the parental dominion when she signed the notes in question, so far as to be entitled to the application of this principle.\nThe plaintiff held the note for the benefit of Thomas Walmsley and was subject to all the equities to which Walmsley was subject. Walmsley had full notice of the relative positions of E. Strachan Cox and his daughter and of the latter\u2019s prospects. This was sufficient to make him subject to the equities between them in taking the note.\nIn my opinion, the Bills of Exchange Act did not affect the exercise of the principles upon which a court of equity raises and enforces trusts or avoids transactions for fraud, actual or constructive.\nThe definition of a \u201cholder in due course\u201d given by section 29 of the Act excludes one having notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated the bill or note, and it appears to me that this is not to be confined to defects recognized by courts of law.\nOn the other hand, it is not shewn that Walmsley had notice of the actual misrepresentations made by Cox to his wife and daughter which operated towards inducing them to join in making the notes in question. In my opinion the presumption arising from the mere relation of parent and child and the circumstances known to Walmsley do not apply to the relation of husband and wife and the circumstances affecting them known to Walmsley.\nIn Field v. Sowle[71], a wife had joined her husband in a promissory note to the plaintiff for money advanced by him to the husband. The wife set up undue influence and coercion, but gave no proof thereof. Sir John Leach M.E. said:\nThe signature of the promissory note by the defendant Sarah Cowle is prim\u00e2 facie evidence to charge her; and it is upon her to repel the effect of her signature by evidence of undue influence and not upon the plaintiff to prove a negative.\nIn Barrow v. Willis[72], Cozens-Hardy J. said, at page 585:\nIt is also settled by authority which binds me, although text-writers seem to have adopted the opposite view, that the relation of husband and wife is not one of those to which the doctrine of Euguenin v. Basely[73], applies. In other words, there is no presumption that a voluntary deed executed by a wife in favour of her husband, and prepared by the husband\u2019s solicitor, is invalid.\nWhile the decision was reversed on appeal[74], it was upon the ground of the giving of a benefit to the son of the solicitor who advised in the transaction.\nIn Turnbull v. Duval[75], Lord Lindley, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, said, at page 434:\nIn the face of such evidence their lordships are of opinion that it is quite impossible to uphold the security given by Mrs. Duval. It is open to the double objection of having been obtained by a trustee from his cestui que trust by pressure through her husband and without independent advice, and of having been obtained by a husband from his wife by pressure and concealment of material facts. Whether the security could be upheld if the only ground for impeaching it was that Mrs. Duval had no independent advice has not really to be determined. Their lordships are not prepared to say it could not. But there is an additional and even stronger ground for impeaching it.\nThe decision rested upon the ground that the security was obtained by pressure to which the appellant\u2019s agent, who was trustee under the will of the wife\u2019s father, was directly a party.\nWhile the Judicial Committee left the point in a measure open, I am of opinion that the weight of English authorities is in favour of the view that the mere relation of husband and wife does not give rise to such a presumption that the giving of a security by a wife for a husband is obtained by undue influence as to place upon the party obtaining it in good faith in other respects the onus of displacing the influence. The trend of modern legislation towards the emancipation of the wife renders the presumption more difficult.\nThere is, however, a further contention that Walmsley had procured Mr. Cox to release to him certain shares of stock held by Walmsley as security for previous notes given by Mrs. Cox, the amounts of which were included in the notes now in question, and that this had the effect of discharging Mrs. Cox from liability on the previous notes and constituted a defence to the present action in favour of her and her daughter, either wholly or pro tanto. This contention was disposed of by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, as follows:\u2014\nIt is true that the amount of the three promissory notes sued on is made up in part by taking into account the two promissory notes previously made by the defendant, Alice R. Cox, and held by Walmsley. These defendants say that their co-defendant, E. Strachan Cox, procured the defendant, Alice R. Cox, to sign them by representing that he was interested in the shares and needed money to pay advances in respect of them. In point of fact, the smaller of the two notes, that for \u00a7900, was not made until some weeks after the release had been given, and although that for $3,000 bears date eleven days previously to the release, it was not discounted by Walmsley until after the release had been agreed upon.\nWalmsley advanced moneys to Cox on Mrs. Cox\u2019s note for $3,000 at different times. As I read the evidence, $600 were advanced upon it upon the 10th of October, 1899, the day before the giving of the release? but the balance not until after the release. The note for $900, as the learned Chief Justice has said, was not made for some weeks after the release.\nBut I am further of opinion that the released shares were not held as security for the $3,000 note at all. When the note was transferred to Walmsley, Cox signed a memorandum in these words:\nIn consideration of Thomas Walmsley making an advance to me of (3,000) three thousand dollars, re-payable on call with interest at\u2026 per cent per annum, I have assigned to him as collateral security for the due payment of said advance, 10,000 shares Diamond Jubilee Mining Dev. Co., Limited, and agree that these and all previous collateral securities shall be held as securities generally, for all advances previously or hereafter made, and I agree to keep up a cash margin thereon of not less than twenty per cent.\nThe released shares had been bought by Walmsley and Cox on joint account and were held by a bank to secure advances to both of them for the purchase. They do not appear to me to come within the terms of the memoradum, which related to securities previously given to Walmsley for loans by him to Cox, and I think that the negotiation by Walmsley of Mrs. Cox\u2019s note should not be deemed to have effected the right of Cox and Walmsley to deal with those shares as their interest might appear to demand.\nThus, the fact that an advance was made upon the note for $3,000 before the release seems immaterial.\nThe other defences raised below were not set up before us.\nIn my opinion, the judgment against Mrs. Cox should stand but that against Miss Cox should be set aside.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Robertson & Maclennan.\n[1] 10 Hare 646.\n[2] 19 Ch.

On the trial of an action for damages it was proved that the elevator was over twenty years old; that it had fallen before on the same day owing to the dropping out of the key of the pinion gear which had been replaced; and the jury found that the vibration and general dilapidation of the running gear caused the key again to fall out occasioning the accident. On appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal maintaining a verdict for the plaintiff:\nHeld, Nesbitt J. dissenting, that the company was negligent in not exercising due care in order to have the elevator in a safe and proper condition for the necessary protection of its employees and was, therefore, liable at common law.\nHeld, per Nesbitt J. that as the company had employed a competent person to attend to the working of the elevator it was not liable at common law for his negligence although it was liable under the Employers\u2019 Liability Act.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario maintaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case which are sufficiently summarized in the above head-note are fully set out in the judgments published in this report. Shepley K.C. for the appellants. The defendants had procured the best style of elevator known when it was made and had always kept it in repair. That was their sole duty at common law. See Hastings v. LeRoi No. 2, Limited[1].\nThe evidence did not show that the falling of the key was due to any want of care and attention on defendants\u2019 part.\nRiddell K.C. and Guthrie K.C. for the respondent. As to the duty of defendants in regard to the elevator, see Am. & Eng. Ency (2 ed.) vol. 10 pp. 945, 953, 957.\nThe duty of defendants was to keep the elevator in a safe condition so as to protect the employees using it. Smith v. Baker[2]; Moore v. The J.D. Moore Co.[3]; Grant v. Acadia Coal Co.[4]; Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[5]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is a frivolous appeal, and the learned judges of the court a quo rightly treated the appellant\u2019s contentions as they deserved by unanimously dismissing them without giving written opinions therefor. The case for the jury was one of inference of fact from the fact clearly proved of the dilapidated condition of this elevator. And their finding that the falling of the key was caused by the vibration and general dilapidation of the running gear is far from being unreasonable. That being so, for us to disturb their verdict would be to usurp their functions.\nI refer to McArthur v. The Dominion Cartridge Co.[6], in the Privy Council, and to what Baron Pollock said in Bridges v The North London Railway Co.[7], and Lord Penzance in Parfitt v. Lawless[8], in the passages I cited, 31 Can. S.C.R. 404. The appeal is dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was an action brought by the plaintiff, one of the workmen employed in one of the defendants\u2019 (appellants\u2019) mills, for injuries received by him while being carried on an elevator of the mill from one story to another in the discharge of his duty.\nIt is necessary, in order to understand the questions put to the jury and the answers to those questions, as well as the contentions of counsel on the argument, that a short outline should be given of the facts.\nThe elevator was one used by the workmen in carrying the material or products on which they were engaged from one part of the mill to another, and in enabling men like the plaintiff to get speedily from one to another department.\nThe elevator had been placed in the mill some twenty years before and had been in use all that time.\nThe chief witness called as to its condition at the time of the accident was one Baker, a machinist in the defendants\u2019 employ. He was not the foreman of machinists, simply an ordinary machinist working with others under the foreman machinist. From Baker\u2019s testimony it is quite evident that the elevator machinery either from age and use or other causes had lived its life. He says he was called upon to make repairs to it ten or twelve times during the year immediately preceding the accident, and that the impression made upon his mind by the examinations he necessarily made was that \u201cthis thing (meaning the elevator and its gear) was in a bad shape of repair and should be renewed at once;\u201d that \u201cthey ought to have a new elevator there as soon as possible because I thought this was very unsafe for anybody to travel on.\u201d Baker made during the twelve months two separate reports to the managers, Morrison and Berry, who succeeded each other during that period, repeating his opinion as above and specially mentioning the pinion gear and the driving gear. The day the accident occurred the elevator fell three times. It was on the third fall the plaintiff was injured. The witness Baker testifies that he was sent to fix the cable or see about it, and that he found the first fall of the elevator due to the cable attached to it having come off the drum and wound around the shaft. This had happened several times previously. The next fall of the elevator which took place a few hours afterwards was found by him to be caused by the dropping out of the key or pin which fastened and held the wheel and the shaft together. The falling out of the pin left the wheel free, and the elevator, as a consequence, simply fell to the bottom of the elevator shaft. Baker replaced the pin driving it home to its place. There was a good deal of dispute as to whether or not in doing this he had been guilty of negligence for which the defendants could be held liable under the Workmens\u2019 Compensation Act but there is no finding of the jury upon the point. A couple of hours after this last repair the pin again came out and unfortunately at the time the plaintiff was in the elevator. The elevator was precipitated to the bottom of the shaft, its gear greatly damaged, and the plaintiff seriously injured.\nIt was common ground on the argument at bar and at the trial also that the primary cause of the accident was the dropping out of the pin or key and the question was: To what cause was this attributable? I think the findings of the jury on this crucial point fully justified by the evidence. In their opinion it resulted from the \u201cvibration and general dilapidation of the running gear.\u201d They also found the defendants guilty of negligence which brought about the accident in not having a competent man appointed to look after the operating of the elevator daily and in not having a set screw placed in front of the pin which fell out.\nThere was no evidence given showing that it was the duty of any person specially to inspect these elevators and to see from time to time that they were reasonably fit for their work. Murdock, the head machinist, testified that when he went to the mill many years previously he changed somewhat the construction of the elevator, putting a chain in instead of a wire cable, and cutting out the grooves in the sheaves which he found too shallow, but that was all he did. Baker, one of the machinists, used to go and repair the elevator machinery when it was reported to him to be out of order, but he does not appear to have reported to his foreman machinist as to the condition of the elevator and its running gear, though on two occasions he did so to the manager of the mill. No evidence of any kind was given as to the system on which the mill was operated. It appeared incidentally that there was a manager, and also that there was a general manager of the company for all their mills, but as to their powers or duties and as to the resources placed at their disposal, if any, to supply or provide new machinery when required, we are left entirely in the dark. From all that appears in evidence all of these powers and duties may have been purposely retained in their own hands by the directors.\nNo question was raised on the argument as to the amount of the damages in case the defendants were held to be liable. Mr. Shepley, on the question of common law liability, contended that in the first place there was no evidence of negligence in respect of the matter which caused the accident, and that the case was governed by the decision of this court in Hastings v. LeRoi No. 2, Limited[9], and that the defendants were entitled to the benefit of the doctrine of common employment.\nOn all these questions I have reached the conclusion that the contentions cannot be maintained.\nIn the case of Hastings v. LeRoi No. 2, Limited9 the main question argued and on which the decision was based was whether Burns, the foreman, through whose negligence in failing to supply a proper hook for the hoisting gear after the defect in the one being used was discovered and reported to him, was a workman of the defendants in common employment with the injured man. The decision turned largely upon the proper construction of the agreement between the defendant company and a firm of contractors for the sinking of a winze in their mine. This court held, affirming the judgment of the Court of British Columbia, that the negligent workman and the injured workman were in the common employ of the defendants, and that under the circumstances of that case the doctrine of common employment could properly be invoked by the company to relieve them of liability. In that case there was a specific act of negligence on the part of a fellow workman which caused an injury to another in the common employment of the defendant company and, on that ground, as I understand it, the case was decided. But in the case at bar, under the findings of the jury and the evidence given, there is not, in my opinion, any room for the invocation by the defendants of the doctrine of common employment as an excuse from a liability which would otherwise attach. The negligence found as responsible for the injury is not that of a fellow labourer of the deceased in the com- mon employment of the defendants but is the negligence of the defendant company itself. It had failed to discharge that plain duty of an employer so clearly and persistently declared by the House of Lords for many years back of \u201cseeing that his works are suitable for the operations he carried on at them being carried on with reasonable safety.\u201d\nThe distinction between the employer\u2019s liability to his servant for injuries occasioned by the carelessness of a fellow workman and that arising out of a breach of the employer\u2019s duty to his workman to provide and maintain suitable and proper machinery and appliances for carrying on his operations with reasonable safety is well pointed out by Lord Cranworth in his celebrated judgment in Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[10]. In reviewing the cases on the subject the noble Lord there said at page 288:\nThis case [Brydon v. Stewart[11]] it will be observed, like that which preceded it, turned, not on the question whether the employers were responsible for injuries occasioned by the carelessness of a fellow workman but on a principle established by many preceding cases namely, that when a master employs his servant in a work of danger he is bound to exercise due care in order to have his tackle and machinery in a safe and proper condition so as to protect the servant against any unnecessary risks.\nThe latter principle is reaffirmed by both Lord Herschell and Lord Watson in Smith v. Baker[12]. The latter learned Lord at page 353 says:\nIt does not appear to me to admit of dispute that, at common law, a master who employs a servant in work of a dangerous character is bound to take all reasonable precautions for the workman\u2019s safety. The rule has been so often laid down in this House by Lord Cranworth and other noble and learned Lords, that it is needless to quote authorities in support of it. He then goes on to quote authorities for the proposition that long before the passing of the Employers\u2019 Liability Act a\nmaster is no less responsible to his workman for personal injuries occasioned by a defective system of using machinery than for injuries caused by a defect in the machinery itself.\nAfter pointing out that many of the enactments of the Employers\u2019 Liability Act were simply declarations of \u201cthe acknowledged principles of the common law\u201d he goes on, at page 356, to say:\nAt common law his (the employer\u2019s) ignorance would not have barred the workman\u2019s claim, as he was bound to see that his machinery and works were free from defect.\nI assume the noble Lord meant by the term \u201cignorance,\u201d as used by him, ignorance of something which he ought to have known. And at page 362 Lord Herschell says:\nIt is quite clear that the contract between employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances, and to maintain them in a proper condition, and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk. Whatever the dangers of the employment which the employed undertakes, amongst them is certainly not to be numbered the risk of the employer\u2019s negligence, and the creation or enhancement of danger thereby engendered.\nThere is then a broad distinction between the liability of the master for his personal negligence or for the condition of his premises or machinery, and that arising out of the negligence in the management or operation of that machinery by the servants to whom he has entrusted it. I venture to think that failure to appreciate this distinction has given rise to many of the difficulties which surround this branch of the law, and that a clear appreciation of it will serve to reconcile many apparently conflicting cases. With respect to the liability of an employer for injuries caused to one of his employee\u2019s by the negligence of a fellow servant, the statement of it laid down by Lord Cairns in Wilson v. Merry[13], seems alike concise, complete and generally accepted. His Lordship said, at page 332:\nWhat the master is, in my opinion, bound to his servant to do in the event of his not personally superintending and directing the work, is to select proper and competent persons to do so, and to furnish them with adequate materials and resources for the work. When he has done this he has, in my opinion, done all that he is bound to do.\nThese oft quoted words when applied to the branch of the law of master and servant, to which the learned Lord was addressing himself, and which he had before him in the case he was deciding, seem to cover the whole ground. It is equally clear to me that they were not intended to cover cases arising out of the master\u2019s liability for injuries caused by defects either in the system or in the condition of his premises or machinery which he either knew or ought to have known about, and of which the injured servant was ignorant. Johnson v. Lindsay & Co.[14], at page 379, where Lord Herschell says:\nI think it clearly means that he (Lord Cairns), did not intend to state the law differently from Lord Cranworth whose opinions in The Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[15] he quotes with approval,\nand Lord Watson at pp. 385-7.\nAs Mr. Beven states the liability at page 738 of his work on Negligence (2 ed.):\nThe master is not liable for the negligence of his superintendent; nevertheless, he is bound to see that his works are suitable for the operations he carries on at them being carried on with reasonable safety. If the master leaves the supervision of his works to his superintendent, the master cannot by doing so escape liability, for the duty is one of which he cannot divest himself. If the superintendent is negligent the master is not answerable, yet, if the appliances with which the men have to work are not reasonably suitable, the neglect is the master\u2019s. The employer cannot escape from liability to a third person for injuries caused by defective premises or machinery on the ground that he had not personally interfered in the construction or management of his works; nor can he do so in the case of his employee, unless these risks are held to be risks incident to the servant\u2019s employment which, by the decided cases, they are certainly not; as Lord Herschell tersely puts it, such an assumption would be equivalent to relieving by implication an employer of his negligence. The effect of the workman\u2019s knowledge of the defects when he enters upon or continues in his master\u2019s employ is an entirely different question, and depends upon the facts of each case as proved and the proper inference to be drawn from them. It is clear that while, on the one hand, the employer is liable to his servants for his own personal negligence in the actual performance of work or for failure to provide appliances for the proper carrying on of the work, or for default in the appointment of competent servants, he is not, on the other hand, liable either for the negligence of the servant injured or that of his fellow servant. While bound to use reasonable precaution and care in providing his employees with reasonably suitable premises and machinery on which and with which to work, he does not insure the absolute safety of the machinery provided by him. If he fails in this duty of precaution and care he is responsible for injuries which may happen to his employees through defects which were or ought to have been known to him and were unknown to the employees. When the necessity of executing repairs springs from the daily or ordinary use of appliances the master is of course bound to provide the means of executing the necessary repairs, and when he has done so it remains for the servants to secure themselves in those matters which can easily be remedied and do not involve the permanent operations of skilled mechanics; and if the employer seeks to escape from liability on the ground that the servant entered upon or continued in the employment with knowledge of the facts the onus lies upon him of proving that the servant took upon himself the risk without the precautions which might or would have avoided it. Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[16]\nI fail to find anything in the evidence relieving the defendants from their common law liability arising out of the injuries caused by the defective elevator. The defect was not one arising out of its daily or ordinary use and which could be met by ordinary repair. It was, on the contrary, one arising from the elevator\u2019s general worn out condition, and from the fact that it \u201chad lived its life.\u201d While it was perhaps impossible to put one\u2019s finger on any specific defect in the gear it was not only possible but reasonable and proper to conclude that it was worn out and dangerous and unfit for further use. The knowledge of these facts is a knowledge which must be imputed to the employer. To refuse so to impute it would be in effect to declare that he could by the simple expedient of employing a foreman relieve himself from his common law liabilities. The worn out condition of the running gear of the elevator having been shewn (of which the workman did not have and could not under the circumstances be assumed to have knowledge) coupled with the injuries to the workman caused by it completed the case for the plaintiff, and no evidence was given of any kind which, in my opinion, justified or excused the defendant company from the results of what I hold to have been its proved negligence. In cases coming within the doctrine of common employment the onus is upon the injured workman of proving negligence on the part of his employer, and in such cases it may well be that the plaintiff must prove either that the workmen by or through whose negligence the injury was caused were incompetent or that adequate materials or resources were not furnished because they are all parts of one whole proposition going to make up the negligence. But I cannot see that such a rule applies to cases lying outside of that doctrine. In such cases the defendant\u2019s negligence is proved when evidence is given shewing damages arising from a failure to provide or maintain that which the law says it is his duty to provide alike in premises, machinery or appliances. Failure to do either one or the other constitutes the negligence and when followed by consequent damages creates the liability. If the employer claims that for some reason he ought to be excused the onus rests upon him to shew it. The case of Allen v. New Gas Company[17] cited in support of a contrary doctrine is not, I venture to say, authority for that doctrine. That case was argued and decided, as appears from the report, exclusively upon the ground of the duty of employers to employ a competent person to take charge of their premises and without reference to their duty to see to the condition of the machinery. The basis of that decision is to be found in the following extract from the judgment of the court at page 254:\nWe think that the mischief in this case arose from the conduct of the plaintiff\u2019s fellow workmen as such and not from the defendants\u2019 default nor from the default of any manager or vice-proprietor, and that therefore the defendants are not liable.\nAny further observations made in the case must be read with reference to this ground work of the deci- sion. The case should be read along with the cases I have already cited and also of those of Vaughan v. Cork & Youghal Ry. Co.[18]; Webb v. Rennie[19]; the judgments of Ch. J. Cockburn and Byles J., in Clarke v. Holmes[20]; and Murphy v. Phillips[21]; with which might be compared Spicer v. South Boston Iron Company [22]. I adopt the language of Mr. Beven, at page 763 of his book, where he says:\nThe master is liable in all cases where there has been neglect in providing proper machinery and competent servants. He is not liable when the injury results from the management of proper machinery by servants not incompetent.\nThis rule is strictly in accord with the jurisprudence of this court as laid down in Grant v. Acadia Coal Co.[23], and McKelvey v. LeRoi Mining Co.[24]; the latter decision being entitled to greater weight from the fact that an application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council was refused.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNESBITT J.\u2014In this case the plaintiff, an employee of the defendants, sued for injury caused to him by the fall of an elevator used in the premises of the employers and which, on the evidence, we must assume the plaintiff was properly using.\nThe plaintiff claims both at common law and under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and the jury have assessed the damages under each branch of the claim.\nIt is to be regretted that the Court of Appeal has not seen fit to give reasons for the affirmance of the judgment of the trial judge, holding the defendants liable at common law. This and other cases of late have been argued at length on the supposition that the case of Smith v. Baker[25], which I shall hereafter refer to, has introduced a modification of the common law rule which had theretofore been assumed to be well settled, and I think it is advisable to re-state that rule and see how far it has been modified and explained, and then to apply the rules to the facts proved in this case complied with the findings of the jury.\nFor his own personal negligence a master was always liable and still is liable at common law. See per Bowen L.J. in Thomas v. Quartermaine[26]. And before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act he was not otherwise liable by reason of the doctrine of common employment, first enunciated by a decision of the Court of Exchequer in the year 1837, in the much discussed case of Priestley v. Fowler[27], and finally established in the year 1858, in the case of Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[28], in which it is to be noted that all the Scotch cases referred to in Smith v. Baker25 were discussed, and in which, after two years consideration, Lord Cranworth finally settled the doctrine of common employment, the effect of which was, as stated by Mr. Ruegg in the sixth edition of his Employers\u2019 Liability Act, at page 27:\nBefore the Act was passed a workman could only recover, if injured in his employment, when he could prove that the employer had personally been guilty of the negligence which led to his injury, and which in the case of large employers was almost, and in the case of corporations quite, impossible. Now a workman is prim\u00e2 facie entitled to recover where the employer\u2014be he private employer or corporation\u2014has delegated his duties or powers of superintendence to other persons and such other persons have caused injury to the workman by negligently performing the duties and powers delegated to them, but the doctrine of common employment, save in so far as it is thus abrogated, remains. I adopt this statement of the law and propose to cite some of the legal authorities which, to my mind, clearly establishes it.\nIn 1868 the case of Wilson v. Merry[29], came before the House of Lords composed of Lord Cairns L.C., Lord Cranworth (who had delivered the judgment in Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[30], and Bartonshill Coal Co. v. McGuire[31], Lord Chelmsford and Lord Colonsay. Lord Cairns points out that, in the Bartonshill Coal Co. v Reid,30 Lord Cranworth explained with great clearness the difference between the liability of a master to one of the general public and his liability to a servant of his own for an injury occasioned, not by the personal neglect of the master himself, but by the negligence of some person employed for him, and then summarises the law relating to the duty of the master towards his servant as follows:\nWhat the master is, in my opinion, bound to his servant to do, in the event of his not personally superintending and directing the work, is to select competent and proper persons to do so, and to furnish them with adequate material and resources for the work. When he has done this he has, in my opinion, done all that he is bound to do. And if the persons so selected are guilty of negligence that is not the negligence of the master.\nIn Howells v. Landore Siemens Steel Company[32], Lord Blackburn points out that a company or corporation must be treated in the same way as an individual on this point, and it is to be noted in this last case that the manager was one appointed pursuant to an Act of Parliament, and yet the company were held not liable for his negligence. And in the same case Lord Blackburn further observes:\nWhen a master personally interferes he is liable for his personal negligence just as the individual servant would be.\nAnd the discussion by counsel makes it perfectly plain that the court, composed of Chief Justice Cockburn and Blackburn, Quain and Archibald JJ., assumed that after the decision in Wilson v. Merry29 the subject was no longer open to discussion, and apparently, as a corporation can only act through managers, it can only be held liable in the very nature of things for failure to select proper and competent persons to superintend and direct the workings and failure to furnish them with adequate material and resources for the work.\nIn 1876 two other cases came before the courts, the first being Allen v. The New Gas Company[33], and the judgment of the court composed of Bramwell, Amphlett and Huddleston BB., was read by Huddleston B., and he points out at page 254 what is necessary to be proved in order to make out a master liable to common law; he says:\nTo establish, therefore, negligence against the defendants, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants undertook personally to superintend and direct the works, or that the persons employed by them were not proper and competent persons, or that the materials were inadequate, or the means and resources were unsuitable to accomplish the work. The onus is upon him, and failing to do so he fails to establish negligence.\nIn the same year Murphy v. Philips[34], was decided in the Exchequer Division in a court composed of Kelly C.B., and Cleasby and Pollock BB. It was an action by a servant against his master for negligence in failing to examine machinery and therefore most apposite to the case at bar. It appeared that the chain had become so much worn by long and constant service that it was at the time in question in need of being repaired, and was in fact in such a condition that if unrepaired it was dangerous and unfit to be used and serious injury was not unlikely to be the result of its being used in its then condition. It was, therefore, a question of whether it was or was not the duty of the defendant as the master and employer of the plaintiff to see and examine from time to time the state and condition of the chains and other machinery employed on his premises in his business, and it was clearly held that it was his duty. And Cleasby B. says:\nNow here I think that the defendant was under an obligation to ascertain that this chain was fit for use in the work in which it was about to be employed, and that it was not in a dangerous condition. This might have been accomplished by the defendant in two ways; he might have appointed a fit and competent person expressly to superintend and see to the examining and testing of the chain, and had he done so he would, of course, have been himself exempt from all liability, or, he might have examined the state of the chain himself.\nAnd Pollock B. says:\nIt is hardly possible to lay down any one general rule with reference to the duty of a master to examine into the state and condition of the machinery that is used in his business, and the question is obviously one of degree; but it is to be noted in the present case that the defendant was aware of the age of this chain.\nPrior to this, in 1865, in a case of Webb v. Rennie[35], Cockburn C.J. directed the jury in reference to the duty cast upon the master respecting the maintenance of machinery as follows:\nIt was his business to know if by reasonable care and precaution, he could ascertain whether the apparatus or machinery were in a fit state or not. It was not enough, therefore, that the master did not know of the danger if, by reasonable care, he might have known, and if, reasonably, he ought to have known, and to have taken the proper means of knowing. It followed that, although he would not be liable merely on account of the negligence of his servants, yet it was his duty either himself to take the proper means of knowing of the danger, or to employ some competent person on to do so. There were many things which a man could not himself know of. Thus, in the case of a manufacturer employing machinery which might be attended with danger to the person employed about it, a danger which might be greatly aggravated by the machinery not being in a proper condition\u2014as, for instance, in the case of a boiler of a steam engine bursting as it would be more likely to do if in an improper condition\u2014the master manufacturer might have no means of personally knowing the condition himself, and the question being whether he had used reasonable care and diligence to ascertain it, all that could be reasonably expected of him would be that he should employ some competent person from time to time to examine it. The master must either ascertain the state of the machinery or apparatus himself or employ some competent person to do so; and if he did employ such a person, and a workman was injured in consequence of that person\u2019s neglect of his duty in that respect, the master would not be liable to one of his servants for such negligence.\nOn the question of onus of proof see also Hanson v. Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Co., (1872),[36] where the court was composed of Byles, Brett, Grove and Willes JJ. See also Griffiths v. London and St. Katharine Docks Company[37], where the cases are fully collected as establishing that at common law it was necessary for a servant to establish, not only his own want of knowledge, but also knowledge on the part of the master; both must be alleged and proved, otherwise the plaintiff must fail. It is argued that Mr. Beven, in his second edition of his work on Negligence, beginning at page 736, lays down the rule that the master does not fulfil his duty by the appointment of a fit and proper person to superintend but that he must himself see that the works are suitable for the operations he carries on at them and that they are being carried on with reasonable safety. I propose showing later that the cases cited by Mr. Beven for this in no sense established any such proposition, but that an examination of the authorities themselves will in every case show either personal superintendence or that the defect or negligence was known to the defendant who, with that knowledge, permitted or possibly allowed the work to proceed, in which case I could understand holding him liable. It is on this ground Webster v. Foley[38], must be assumed to have been decided; see Labatt Master and Servant, p. 1983 & 677, note 3. The doctrine so contended for, I admit, is applicable where the duty is one imposed by statute; that involves very different conditions. In the care of a corporation, which is an abstract personality, or of a person who, without any knowledge of the business, brings into existence an undertaking or industry of which he is entirely ignorant, the cases show that all that can be required is to employ competent persons, to supply adequate materials and means and resources suitable to accomplish the work. Negligence is defined as the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations which originally regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or the doing of something which a prudent or reasonable man would not do. Per Alderson B. in Blyth v. The Company of Proprietors of the Birmingham Water Works[39], at page 784. And, again, in the words of Brett M.R. the neglect of the use of ordinary care or skill towards a person to whom defendant owes the duty of ordinary care or skill; Heaven v. Pender[40]. How, therefore, a corporation, an abstract personality, can do anything but appoint a competent person, etc., I am unable to understand. See Ketllewell v. Paterson & Co. (1886)[41]. How a person entirely ignorant of the undertaking can do otherwise than employ competent contractors for the work and competent persons to supervise it, whose duty it is to see that the machinery, etc., is kept in proper order, I am at a loss to understand. The very attempt on his part to supervise or regulate the operations might be the most disastrous thing possible for the servants, and as put by Lord Cranworth in Bartonshill Coal Company v. Reid[42], the servant, before he goes into the employment, knows whether he is entering into the employment of one who does pretend to know or of one who leaves the whole matter to managers.\nI come now to see whether Smith v. Baker[43], did purport to break in upon the rule I have indicated or to establish any modification of these doctrines. In the first place, it is to be observed that in Smith v. Baker43 the only point which was decided by the court did not involve this question at all. In the report of the case at page 335, Halsbury L.C. says:\nThe objection raised, and the only objection raised, to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, was that he had voluntarily undertaken the risk. That is the question, and the only question, which any of the courts, except the county court itself, had jurisdiction to deal with.\nAgain on page 354 Lord Watson says:\u2014\nThe only question which we are called upon to decide, and I am inclined to think the only substantial question in the case, is this, whether, upon the evidence, the jury were warranted in finding as they did, that the plaintiff did not \u201cvoluntarily undertake a risky employment with a knowledge of the risks.\u201d\nI have mentioned this because the expressions relied upon in argument as being used by the judges in giving judgment were not used in reference to the point decided, nor when examined did they in fact, with one exception which I shall mention, suggest any modification of the common law I have above stated. The first expression occurs at page 339, where Lord Halsbury says:\nI think the cases cited at your Lordship\u2019s Bar of Sword v. Cameron[44], and the Bartonshill Coal Company v. McGuire[45], establish conclusively the point for which they were cited, that a negligent system or a negligent mode of using perfectly sound machinery may make the employer liable quite apart from any provisions of the Employers\u2019 Liability Act. In Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[46] Lord Cranworth who, it is to be remembered, took part in the judgment of Wilson v. Merry[47], after discussing the facts found in Sword v. Cameron44 says as to that case:\nIt is to be inferred from the facts stated that the notices and signals given were those which had been sanctioned by the employer.\nThis comes clearly within the rule of Wilson v. Merry[48], personal superintendence or personal knowledge. Bartonshill Coal Co. v. McGuire49, was an action arising out of the same accident as Bartonshill Coal Company v. Reid51. The Lord Chancellor expressly laid down the rule at page 276 in his judgment in the Reid Case51, which was made part of the judgment in the McGuire Case[49], that the master is not responsible if he has taken proper precautions to have proper machinery and proper persons employed. How he takes proper precautions is employed, as I have indicated above, by Cleasby B. in Murphy v. Philips[50], in cases where he had not the knowledge himself. In that case the accident was caused by the neglect of the engineman, Shearer, as it caused the accident in the Reid Case[51]. And on page 311 of the McGuire Case49 Lord Chelmsford, then Lord Chancellor, states with approval the observations of the Lord Justice Clerk in Dixon v. Rankin[52]:\nThe recklessness of danger on the part of the men is a result of the trade in which the master employs them, and he is bound in all such cases to hire superintendence which will exclude such risks, etc.\nShewing that at common law, even if the master did not personally superintend, if he was aware of and sanctioned the use of improper machinery or inadequate means he was liable. The same question is again referred to at page 353, in the judgment of Lord Watson, where the learned judge cites Sword v. Cameron[53], Bartonshill Coal Company v. Reid51, and Weems v. Mathieson53. I have already dealt with Sword v. Cameron52 and Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid51, and an examination of Weems v. Mathieson[54] will shew that in that case the employer was held responsible for injury caused by the falling of a cylinder insufficiently sustained\nthe manner of the suspension having been suggested by the defendant himself;\nand that this was clearly in the mind of the learned judge at that moment is seen by the very next sentence at the foot of page 354, where he says the main, although not the sole, object of the Act of 1880, was to place masters who do not upon the same footing of responsibility as those who do personally superintend the works of their workmen. The only sentence I do not understand in the judgment of Lord Watson is at page 358 where he says:\nAt common law his ignorance would not have barred the workman\u2019s claim as he was bound to see that his machinery and works were free from defect.\nIf the learned judge is there speaking of the obligation of the master to either himself, or by others competent to do so, inspect and see that machinery is kept in a proper state of maintenance, I agree, but if he means to say that a competent person has been employed whose duty it was to inspect and see that the machinery was kept in a proper state of maintenance, and that that person\u2019s neglect the master is responsible for, it seems to me to be against any authority to be found in the books subsequent to the case of Wilson v. Merry[55]. I think, therefore, that the judges in Smith v. Baker[56], in discussing the Scotch case, did not intend in any sense to qualify the doctrine of Wilson v. Merry55, which case was itself decided some ten years after the last of the Scotch cases referred to, and in which case Lord Cranworth took part and in no way suggested any modification of the language used by Lord Cairns in defining the duty of the master to the servant at common law. I think, therefore, that when a defective system is spoken of which renders the master liable it is a system which he has either personally taken part in or has subsequently sanctioned or had knowledge of, and that the full extent of his duty is as defined in Wilson v. Merry55. I do not see in many cases at the present day how it would be possible for the employer to have any knowledge whatever as to whether a system was perfect or defective; much of such knowledge is technical and all that he can do is to use ordinary care to see that he gets competent contractors to supply his machinery and competent persons to see that the machinery is properly run and properly maintained, and that such persons are supplied with adequate means and materials to so run and maintain the machinery in a reasonably safe condition, and that if any failure to keep the machinery up to date is due to the neglect of such superintendent, in the absence of knowledge upon the part of the employer, he is not liable at common law. Any other rule would, it seems to me, entirely lose sight of the numerous undertakings requiring special scientific knowledge both as to the machinery required and as to the method of running, and as to when it was out of repair, and as a rule such knowledge is not possessed by the people having the necessary capital to create the undertaking and employ labour, but the employer has necessarily to depend upon the skilled knowledge of others.\nI am fortified in the view that Smith v. Baker[57] did not attempt to decide anything more than that \u201csciens was not volens\u201d by the judgment in Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[58], where, although the defendants were held liable for non-maintenance, it appeared that the defendants were aware of the absence of any ladder or proper means of ascending to or descending from the tramway, and A.L. Smith L.J. at page 342, quotes from Lord Herschell as follows:\nIt is quite clear that the contract between employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances, and to maintain them in a proper condition, etc., (and then continues in his own language) This being the master\u2019s duty towards his man, if the master knowingly does not perform it, it follows that he is guilty of negligence towards the man.\nAnd again:\nThis is not the case where a master has provided proper appliances and done his best to maintain them in a state of efficiency, in which case the man has no action against his master, if the appliances became unsafe whereby the man has been injured unless he avers and proves that the master knew of their having become unsafe and that the man was ignorant of it.\nThe case is similar to that of Mellors v. Shaw[59]. When you turn to Mellors v. Shaw58 it is again found to be a case decided upon the ground of the master\u2019s personal negligence.\nI have dealt at perhaps too great length with the English authorities, but my only excuse is that nearly every case at the present day is launched and fought out both at common law and under the Employer\u2019s Liability Act, and we are continually pressed with the argument that the law is not as it was always supposed to be, namely, the law as enunciated by Lord Cairns in Wilson v. Merry[60].\nThe Ontario cases are well summed up in the judgment in Rajotte v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[61]; and Matthews v. Hamilton Powder Co.[62]; and the British Columbia authorities are collected in Wood v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[63], affirmed on other grounds by this court. Much discussion has taken place also in the case of Sim v. Dominion Fish Co.[64], in 1901 at page 69. That case is not entirely satisfactory but I take it that it was established that the boxes supplied were unfit, as will be seen by a reference to the evidence at page 72, and the Chief Justice, at page 75, points out that the uncontradicted evidence showed that the boxes were not fit for the purpose for which they were provided, and then says that from that evidence the inference arose that the defendants had not exercised due care in providing boxes and gave no evidence whatever in excuse for their so doing. I assume that had the defendants proved that they employed competent men with instructions to obtain adequate materials, and that the neglect to provide such adequate materials was that of the persons so employed, that the learned Chief Justice would have held no liability existed at common law, but in the view of the expression of opinion of Huddleston B. in Allen v. The New Gas Co.[65], above cited, to which the attention of the learned judge had not been drawn, I should have doubted whether the plaintiff satisfied the full onus cast upon him. Applying, then, the rules above indicated to the facts of this case, I find that it is proved that there was a head machinist employed who did in fact inspect the elevator from time to time and pointed out the serious defect which he said was remedied, and after that he himself saw another ground of complaint. I find also that Baker, a sub-machinist, did in fact inspect continually and make repairs, and that he pointed out the old and worn condition of the machinery to both the general superintendents of the company, who failed apparently, notwithstanding such inspection and notice to them, to change the pinion gear. I think, therefore, that, as no knowledge was brought home to the company, the case comes clearly within the decision of Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[66] and Matthews v. Hamilton Powder Co.[67], and that there is no liability at common law. But I cannot see upon this evidence and the findings of the jury how the defendants can escape under the Employer\u2019s Liability Act See Henderson v. The Carron Co.[68] The statute is comparatively simple, R.S.O., 1897, ch. 160, sect. 3, s.s. 1 and 2, coupled with section 6, s.s. 1. It is quite true that the under-machinist, when he drove in the key, swears that he did it properly, and that he saw nothing wrong with the machinery, and that he was the person entrusted with the duty of seeing to the remedying of that particular defect, but he had, if defendants are to be believed, and the jury did believe them, already pointed out that the vibration and general dilapidation of the machinery was such that it ought to be renewed, and that, therefore, while the patching up by putting in the key made good the falling out of the key for the moment, the defect which he had pointed out, namely, the vibration and general dilapidation, and which he said he believed brought about the second falling out of the key, still existed and had not been remedied owing to the negligence of the superintendent who must also be said to be a person entrusted with the duty of seeing to the proper carrying out of the business generally, because it is sworn that the superintendent had the general conduct, and it would be for him to give general directions either to the head machinist or to a subordinate machinist, and certainly to give directions for the renewal of machinery, and I think that under this section of the Act there may be various parties in different degrees of authority to whom the work of seeing to defects may be entrusted. I would, therefore, vary the judgment by directing a judgment to be entered for the amount of damages assessed by the jury under the Workmens\u2019 Compensation Act.\nKILLAM J.\u2014It is not disputed that the appellant company was liable, under \u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation for Injuries Act,\u201d R.S.O. (1897) c. 160, for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. The only question is whether or not it was liable at common law.\nI agree with my brother Davies in the opinion that the case falls within the class of cases in which an employer has been held liable on the ground that the state of the appliances was such that there could properly be imputed to him knowledge of the defects or neglect of the duty to know them.\nThe authorities have been very exhaustively and ably discussed by my learned brothers, and it appears unnecessary that I should attempt any further examination of them. Probably, as my brother Nesbitt thinks, the decision in Smith v. Baker[69] has been to some extent misconstrued and misapplied, but it seems to me to be clearly established that the duty of an employer is not satisfied by the instalment of a sufficient set of appliances and the adoption of a sufficient system of working, leaving them to managers or superintendents of apparently sufficient skill to manage or operate. Some responsibility remains in the employer. And while the onus was upon the injured workman, at common law, to show negligence in the employer himself, it might be discharged by evidence of circumstances raising an inference either of knowledge of the defects or of neglect of the duty to exercise care to acquire such knowledge and remedy them. Paterson v. Wallace & Co.[70]; Weems v. Mathieson[71]; Clarke v. Holmes[72]; Murphy v. Phillips[73]; Webb v. Rennie[74]; Webster v. Foley[75].\nIn the present case I agree with the opinion of my brother Davies that the evidence warranted the findings of the jury and the judgment for the full amount allowed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Duvernet, Jones, Ross & Ardagh,\nSolicitors for the respondent: Guthrie & Guthrie.\n[1] 34 Can.

Sedgewick and Nesbitt JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario maintaining the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe action was brought by the widow and infant children of Charles Mitchell who was killed while working at the construction of the iron work on the exhibition buildings in Toronto as an employee of the defendant company. The particular work on which he was engaged at the time was hoisting purlins up to the roof and bolting them to the rafters, being a gang foreman in charge of the men doing such work. There were several modes of hoisting such purlins, and the one used by deceased and his men was, as plaintiffs alleged and the jury found, an improper method, as it would not raise the purlins high enough and they had to be pushed up into place by the men The defendants claimed that a better method was supplied and the gang used the one they did for their own convenience, but the jury found that it was by direction of the defendants\u2019 foreman.\nThe plaintiffs obtained a verdict at the trial, the jury finding that deceased had not voluntarily incurred the risk and the verdict was maintained by the Court of Appeal.\nDuvernet for the appellants.\nJohn M. Godfrey for the respondents.\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting) concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nGIROUARD J. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014The one doubt I have had in my mind as to the soundness of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case was whether the deceased workman had not, by continuing at his work with full knowledge and appreciation of the risks he ran in doing the work with the appliances which were used, necessarily accepted those risks and so relieved the defendants from liability. The jury found that he did know and fully appreciate the risks and they also found that he did not voluntarily incur them. The question is one of great nicety and it is very difficult at times to reach a satisfactory conclusion as to the application of a proper rule. The general law on the point may be accepted as that laid down by Lord Justice Bowen in the case of Thomas v. Quartermaine[1], as explained and modified by the decision of the House of Lords in Smith v. Baker[2], and by the Appellate Court in the still later case of Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[3] Lord Justice Bowen had said that:\nWhere the danger is visible and the risk is appreciated, and where the injured person knowing and appreciating both risk and danger voluntarily encounters them, there is, in the absence of further acts of omission or commission, no evidence of negligence on the part of the occupier (the employer) at all. Knowledge is not a conclusive defence in itself. But when it is a knowledge under circumstances that leave no inference open but one, namely, that the risk has been voluntarily encountered, the defence seems to me complete.\nIn the subsequent case of Yarmouth v. France[4], approved of by Lord Herschell in Smith v. Baker2, Lord Esher and Lindley, L.J., sitting with Lopes L.J. as a divisional court and accepting as such the exposition of the law given by the Appeal Court in Thomas v. Quartermaine[5] engrafted this distinction or qualification upon it; that the question whether a workman was \u201cvolens\u201d or not was a question of fact depending upon evidence adduced in each case.\nThe decision in Smith v. Baker[6] really turned upon the right inference to be drawn from the continuance of a workman in an employment the risks of which he knew and appreciated. What that case really decided is well summarised by Mr. Ruegg in his work on Employer\u2019s Liability, page 170, (5 ed.) as follows:\nThere is no inference to be implied by law even where a workman knows of and appreciates a danger from the fact of his continuance in the employment; the question is one of fact and is for the jury; the consent to run the risk must be proved by the defendant who wishes to rely on the maxim the reason being that a workman does not impliedly take the risk of his employers\u2019 negligence.\nThe latest decision on the question is that of the Court of Appeal in Williams v. Birmingham Battery and Metal Co.[7], where it was held that to enable an employer to successfully invoke the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria he must obtain a finding of the jury upon it in his favour. I adopt as correct the propositions of law which Romer L.J. formulated as established by the decided cases:\nIf the employment is of a dangerous nature a duty lies on the employer to use all reasonable precautions for the protection of the servant. If by reason of breach of that duty a servant suffers injury the employer is prim\u00e2 facie liable; and it is no sufficient answer to the prim\u00e2 facie liability for the employer to shew merely that the servant was aware of the risk and of the non-existence of the precautions which should have been taken by the employer, and which, if taken would or might have prevented the injury. In order to escape liability the employer must establish that the servant has taken upon himself the risk without the precautions. Whether the servant has taken that upon himself is a question of fact to be decided on the circumstances of each case. In considering such a question the circumstance that the servant has entered into, or continued in, his employment with knowledge of the risk and of the absence of precautions is important, but not necessarily conclusive, against him.\nIn the case at bar not only was there no finding that the deceased voluntarily had incurred the risk, but an express finding that he had not. If it is essential to the judgment being entered for the defendant on this single point that he should have obtained a finding in his favour from the jury, then, how can we, in the presence of a contrary finding, declare that deceased did agree to undertake the risk of the defendant\u2019s negligence. Fear of dismissal rather than voluntary action on the workman\u2019s part might have been inferred by the jury in reaching their finding.\nThe evidence of Hall and of the foreman, Bullock, agree that the gin poles which were the safest and best appliances to have used in the raising of the purlins were discarded by the express orders of the engineer, Law, who had as said, \u201csent up the monkeys or davits to be used in place of the gin poles,\u201d and that, as the foreman said, \u201cthey must be used.\u201d The orders to use the monkeys or davits and not the gin poles were peremptory and could not be disobeyed. There is really no substantial distinction between the appliance substituted for the davit and the latter itself. The substitution was rendered necessary by the condition of the particular part of the roof where the men were working. Both were alike defective in compelling the men to descend from the top chord to the lower one so as to raise the purlin out of its place by their personal force and strength, and it was this action of descending to the lower chord which created the extra danger.\nI entirely concur in the reasoning and conclusions of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal on this latter branch of the case. I think the foreman, Bullock, was by his own confession responsible for the use by the men of an unsafe appliance in the raising of the purlins; that, under the statute, the master is liable for his negligence as a person having the superintendence of this very work, and that the evidence did not show that the deceased was a gang foreman or occupied any position of superintendence which gave him control over or made him responsible for the appliances used in the raising of the purlins used in the construction of the building.\nOn the authority of the cases above quoted, and the findings of the jury, I would dismiss the appeal.\nNESBITT J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action founded upon negligence, and I adopt the definition of negligence of Brett M.R. in Heaven v. Pender[8].\nThe neglect of the use of ordinary care and skill towards a person to whom the defendant owes a duty of observing ordinary care and skill by which neglect the plaintiff, without contributory negligence on his part, had suffered injury to his person or property.\nIt is not disputed in this case that the defendants not only employed competent superintendents and sup- plied all necessary means and appliances, but also that the proper appliances to raise the purlins above the upper chord was not used, but that a device contrived by the gang of men, of whom deceased was the foreman, was substituted for a proper appliance as being easier to be used; and it is also not disputed that the deceased who was, as I say, foreman of the gang in question, was a skilled workman and knew and fully appreciated the risk he ran in doing the work with the appliances which were used. It is therefore plain that there was no breach of duty towards the deceased at common law; and the only ground upon which a breach of duty on the part of the defendant is put is that the foreman, Albert E. Bullock, who was immediately above the gang foreman, had seen the men adopt the device in question at various times and had made no objection, and, therefore, while there is no pretence that there is any breach of duty towards the deceased in the actual giving of an order, that there is negligence in superintendence. I doubt if the facts of the case bring it within the subsection \u201cwhilst in the exercise of such superintendence\u201d or that Bullock, as respects this particular operation, was in any way exercising superintendence, but assuming the subsection applied, I am unable, so far as the deceased is concerned. to appreciate a construction of the statute which would bring the defendants within the above definition as failing to do anything \u201cby which neglect\u201d the deceased suffered. I take it that, if the deceased were an unskilled workman and any person in authority either instituted or sanctioned a dangerous system of carrying on the work, the employer would be liable under this subsection which, as I understand it, was enacted in order to make an employer not exercising personal superintendence, liable for those to whom he deputed the super- intendence. But I do not understand that there is any breach of duty or want of care towards a man who has been supplied with the proper appliance, knows how to use it, and is fully cognizant of the danger he runs in using another appliance, to actually forbid the use of the other appliance when it is known that the skilled workman is fully conscious of the risk he runs in himself actually adopting the more dangerous of the two methods of doing the work. An employer is bound to take reasonable care that his men are protected against injury, and to warn them against dangers so that they may be aware of them; but I cannot hold that an employer is bound to stop a workman performing work in a certain way where he knows the workman is perfectly well aware that a safe way is provided for him to do the work and for his own convenience chooses to do it in another way and is injured. This is the very highest that this case can be put. I think this is covered in principle by what is said by Lord Watson in Smith v. Baker[9], at page 357 where he points out that if a servant engages to do work of such a nature that his personal danger and consequent injury must be produced by his own act, he could not recover if he clearly foresaw the likelihood of such a result and, notwithstanding, continued to work, and this was a case where defective machinery was supplied to the workmen I think that if a workman knows that proper means and appliances are supplied to him and, notwithstanding this, for his own convenience, chooses to adopt some other method, knowing and fully appreciating the risk he ran in doing the work, that he cannot be heard to say that his employer (through a foreman), is liable to him in an action of negligence for a want of care in giving him information of danger (for that must be what the negligence consists in), when the foreman already knew that he was perfectly aware of that danger and was taking the course he did to save himself trouble. It is, to my mind, just like the case constantly arising of where the person is entitled to have warning, say of an approaching train, by whistle or by bell. It is clear law that no action of negligence will lie where it is found that the person so entitled to warning knew otherwise of the approaching train and persisted in his course and is run into by the train.\nIn this case it is from the workman\u2019s own particular act that the injury arises, and the jury found that he fully appreciated the risk he ran in performing the act. \u201cWhat good could it have been for the foreman above him to have told him \u201cdon\u2019t do that with gin-poles as it is dangerous.\u201d He knew such to be the case perfectly well.\nI distinguish the case from that of a workman continuing to work with defective machinery where the machinery is used by others over whom he has no control. Here he has the right of selection himself and chooses to take a dangerous course where danger can only arise from his own act. I think he is in such a case, the author of his own wrong and the doctrine of volens is applicable. See Callender v. Carlton Iron Co.[10]; Dominion Iron and Steel Co. v. Day[11].\nI would upon the answers of the jury and undisputed facts, allow the appeal with costs.\nKILLAM J.\u2014Upon the argument of the appeal in this case I was inclined to the view that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, on the ground that the deceased was really the author of his own injury. Further examination of the evidence has, however, convinced me that there was a case to go to the jury and that, upon their finding, the judgment was rightly entered for the plaintiffs.\nWhatever criticism may be passed upon the finding that the deceased was working under protest, it still remains that there was no finding that he voluntarily incurred the risk and that the evidence for the plaintiffs did not so far establish this as to enable the court to take that question from the jury.\nIt is now established that mere knowledge of the risk is not necessarily sufficient to preclude the workman and that the onus is upon the master to show that it was voluntarily incurred.\nI agree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal and that of my brother Davies.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Duvernet, Jones, Ross & Ardagh.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Robinette & Godfrey.\n[1] 18 Q.B.D. 685.\n[2] [1891] A.C. 325.\n[3] [1899] 2 Q.B. 338.\n[4] 19 Q.B.D. 647.\n[5] 18 Q.B.D. 685.\n[6] [1891] A.C. 325.\n[7] [1899] 2 Q.B. 338.\n[8] 11 Q.B.D. 507.\n[9] [1891] A.C. 325.\n[10] 9 Times L.R. 646; 10 Times L.R. 366.\n[11] 34 Can.

A caveat was lodged by the purchasers in the Land Titles Office and, upon the expiration of the time allowed for the redemption of the lands, they applied (in May, 1902,) to the judge of the district where the lands were situated for the confirmation of the transfer under section 97 of the \"Land Titles Act\", 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 28 (D.) The necessary evidence was filed on this application, including a registration abstract, as follows:\n\"LAND TITLES OFFICE FOR THE ASSINIBOIA LAND REGISTRATION DISTRICT.\n\"Regina, 22nd July, A.D. 1902.\n\"Registration Abstract and Certificate of the Title of the N.

KELSO HUNTER,\nDeputy Registrar, Assiniboia Land Registration District.\nThe persons appearing by this record to have any interest in the land were notified of the application by the trustees and an opposition was entered by the company, applicants, who claimed to be interested as mortgagees and that they had the right to redeem the lands by paying the trustees the amount of their purchase money with interest, charges and costs as provided by sec. 2 of the N. W. T. ordinance ch. 12 of 1902, the company alleging that these sums amounted altogether to $90, for which they mailed a cheque to the trustees. This cheque, however, was returned as being tendered by a party without interest in the land and, at any rate, insufficient. Upon the investigation as to the regularity of the transfer to the trustees, Mr. Justice Wetmore, the judge of the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, to whom the application was made, referred the matter to that court, in banco, stating the circumstances and concluding as follows:\u2014\n\"It appeared by the transfer executed by the treasurer that the land in question was sold on the 23rd January, 1897, and that the transfer was executed on the 26th January, 1898.\n\"Only three questions were urged at the hearing or argument against the company's right to redeem;\u2014\n\"1. That the time appointed for the hearing was the 29th of July last, and the company had no right to redeem after that date.\n\"2. That the transfer, immediately upon its execution on 26th January, 1898, by virtue of sections 184 and 185 of 'The School ordinance, 1896,' which was then in force, vested the land and all rights thereto in the applicants. And that ordinance No. 12 of 1901 has no retroactive operation to defeat such vested rights.\n\"3. That under section 179 of 'The School Ordinance, 1896,' the company had no right to redeem.\n\"By virtue of section 140 of \"The Land Titles Act, 1894,\" I refer the matter to the court en banc.\n\"The question submitted is:\u2014Has the company a right to redeem the land?\n\"Dated 22nd November, 1902.\n\"E. L. WETMORE, J. S. C.\"\nThe court, in banco, after hearing arguments upon the reference, answered that the company was not entitled to redeem the lands and that the tax sale transfer should be confirmed. Mr. Justice Wetmore confirmed the sale accordingly and transmitted the record of his investigation and the proceedings thereon to be filed in the Land Titles Office. The company now appeals, raising the following points in the factum, namely:\n(1) Is section 2, chapter 12, ordinances 1901, retroactive?\n(2) If so, are the appellants entitled to redeem?\n(3) If the reply to the last question should be in the negative, were the appellants entitled nevertheless to raise the question that the sale was invalid?\nWhen the appeal came on for hearing in the Supreme Court of Canada, objection was taken by motion, on behalf of the respondents, to the jurisdiction of that court to hear the appeal for the following reasons:\u2014\nCoutl\u00e9e K.C. for the motion. The matter or proceeding on which the judgment of the court below was rendered did not originate in a court of superior jurisdiction and special leave was not obtained under subsec, (i) of sec. 24, of the Supreme Court Act. The judge, designated by the Land Titles Act, 1894, and the ordinances, is referred to, nominatim, as a special examiner on applications for the registration of involuntary transmissions under the \"Torrens System \" ; he did not in any sense constitute or represent a \" court\" of any kind, certainly not a \" court of superior jurisdiction.\" He was merely an officer of the Land Titles Office for a special purpose, the act he performed was ministerial only and merely interlocutory, the final executive function, that is, the issue of the new certificate, being performed by the registrar, after the lapse of the time limited. See Virtue v. Hayes ([1]); Hamel v. Hamel ([2]); Shaw v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([3]); Molson v. Barnard ([4]); Rural Municipality of Morris v. London and Canadian Loan and Agency.Co. ([5]); McDougall v. Cameron ([6]). Moreover, the appel- lants' interest had been cut out and they could not appeal under sec. 139 of the Act; and by confirmation of the transfer and transmission of the record of his investigation to the Land Titles Office, the judge became functus officio, consequently, there could be no appeal, even to the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, the judgment now appealed from is a nullity and, therefore, no appeal lies from that court to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThis case is ruled by The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Little Seminary of Ste. Therese ([7]), where the statute coincided with the enactments in question in this case. In The City of Halifax v. Reeves ([8]), the Nova Scotia statute gave the jurisdiction to issue the certificate to the Supreme Court of that province or a judge thereof, representing that court, in chambers; the petition was filed \"in court\" and the \"summons\" issued by the \"clerk of the court.\" (54 Vict. ch. 58, s. 455, N. S.) Here the application was presented to the judge in person and he ordered the \"notices\" to be served in the same manner as the officer known as the-examiner of titles would do in ordinary cases.\nThe record shows no proof of any interest in the appellants which would entitle them to maintain an appeal either in the court below or in this court.\nEwart K. C. contra. This case cannot be distinguished from the case of The City of Halifax v. Reeves ([9]), which is the latest case decided in this court on such objections as have been raised.\nThe court reserved judgment on the question of jurisdiction and, in the meantime, ordered that the hearing on the merits should proceed.\nEwart K.C. for the appellants. The point involved is whether sec. 2 of the N. W. T. ordinance of 1901 is etrospective. The cases which, determine that vested interests will not be affected by subsequent legislation, unless the statute clearly indicates that intention, are not denied. The contention now is two-fold: (1) The tax purchasers had not a vested right as asserted, and; (2) Even if they had, the ordinance is wide enough to re-open the right to redeem.\nThe N. W. T. legislation assumes to declare that a school district transfer upon a sale for taxes \"shall not only vest in the purchasers all rights and properties which the original holder had therein, but shall also purge and disencumber such land from all mortgages.\" This ordinance is, however, in direct conflict with the Dominion statute (1894, ch. 28, sec. 54) which declares that \"after a certificate has been granted for any land, no instrument until registered under this Act shall be effectual to pass any estate or interest in any land.\" (See also sec. 59).\nThe ordinance, moreover, is only operative when the tax sale is valid, for it expressly excludes the three following cases:\u20141. Where the sale was not conducted properly; 2. Where there were no school taxes in arrear and; 3. Where the land was not liable to be assessed.\nIt is clear, therefore, that the tax transfer had no such effect as that assumed by the court below, and that no estate whatever had vested in the tax purchaser. The right to redeem had expired, but that right was extended by the ordnance under consideration.\nThe only remaining question is whether or not the mortgagees were included under the words \"any person interested in such land.\" It is impossible to contend otherwise, for it is quite clear that the legal estate remains in the mortgagees. The \"person interested\" was some person who would desire to \"redeem the said land.\" The judgment appealed from declaring that there was no person entitled to redeem because all rights to the land had been cut out by the tax sale, is wrong. That interpretation would reduce the paragraph to a nullity. It assumes that there are some persons interested in redemption, and the \"persons\" intended by the ordinance were those who would benefit by the redemption. This is clear by the 3rd section, which provides that upon payment of the taxes and interest, all rights of the purchaser are to sease, that is, to cease as to persons entitled to redeem, and those would be the persons who would be entitled to the land but for the tax sale.\nThat the ordinance is retroactive is clearly shewn by its language\u2014comparing particularly secs. 1, 2 and 4. The whole ordinance, including the particular section in question, is retroactive as that section cannot be separated from the rest.\nCoutl\u00e9e K.C. and Macdougall for the respondents. The Legislature of the N. W. Territories had power to pass the legislation in question dealing with property and civil rights in the territories. Parliament, in enacting the Land Titles Act, dealt merely with matters of procedure and did not, in any way attempt to legislate as to property and civil rights. The Act merely provides a procedure for the purpose of giving certainty to evidence of title. It does not deal with titles themselves; they must exist previously, apart from and outside of that Act, in some way or another. The Land Titles Act declares that, for registration purposes, the passing of the title, on transfer or transmissions, shall, so far as the evidence is concerned, be in suspense until the issue of the new certificate of title; it never intended to affect the validity of an owner's title, nor to diminish his rights, but required certain proofs to be furnished and approved as a condition precedent to the registration, i.e., confirmation of the transfer in the case of involuntary transmissions. In the meantime, in this case, the title vested in the purchaser at the tax sale on the execution of the transfer freed from all encumbrances. All other interests were cut out, likewise all rights of redemption, and the purchasers were entitled to confirmation of their actually existing title, unless the sale could be invalidated on account of fraud, collusion, no taxes being due or exemption from taxation. The Land Titles Act recognizes the validity of these tax titles and provides for their registration; it does not deny the vesting of the title; it provides means for its confirmation and the issue of a certificate as to its indefeasibility. See Jellett v. Wilkie ([10]), per Strong C.J. at pages 289-291.\nThe appellants' interest, if they ever had any, was gone long prior to the application; the trustees had a good title against all the world, although not yet registered. The appellants made no proof of any interest, no mortgage debt is proved. The abstract does not prove it. In fact, it only shews a mortgage from a stranger to the title and without consideration. A mortgage under the \"Torrens System\" is only a lien, at any rate, and conveys no estate. Even if they had any interest to entitle them to redeem, the ordinance requires the redemption to be made before the hearing of the application and they failed to do this. They are, therefore, estopped by the very statute they invoke.\nThe ordinance of 1901 is retroactive only in its provisions as to procedure. The second and third sections do not deal with procedure but with vested rights accruing subsequently and cannot affect rights in property which vested prior to its enactment. Nova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet, non prceteritis. See Maxwell on Statutes, (3 ed.) ch. 8, and the cases there collected, particularly the remarks at pp. 298 to 318; Hardcastle on Statutes, pp. 353, 354, 357. All presumptions are against disturbing vested rights and no statutes should be so construed unless absolutely necessary. There is no such necessity here for the Dominion Act regulating the procedure as to the registration is quite reconcilable with the ordinance creating the title; they are necessary one to the other. We rely upon the authorities cited by the judges of the court below on the reference and the remarks of Mr. Justice Scott In re Kerr ([11]).\nSEDGEWICK J. (dissenting).\u2014I dissent from the decision of the majority of the court for the reasons stated by my brother Killam.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of my brother Davies\nDAVIES J.\u2014As to the question of this court's jurisdiction I entertained great doubts but, being unable to distinguish this case from that of the City of Halifax v. Reeves ([12]), I agree in holding that we have jurisdiction.\nAs to the merits I have reached the conclusion that the appeal must be allowed.\nThe first question to be decided is whether or not the ordinances of the North-West Territories, under which the sale of the lands in question in this appeal took place, were in conflict with the plain provisions of the \"Land Titles Act, 1894,\" and if so, whether such ordinances, to the extent to which they were so in conflict, were ultra vires. The question has lost much of its general importance by the late amendments to the North-West Ordinances bringing them into accord with the Land Titles Act. The ordinances under which the sale of the lands for taxes took place which the appellants claim to redeem not only vested such lands in the purchaser on the execution of the transfer to him, but also\npurged and released such land from all payments, charges, liens, mortgages and incumbrances of whatever nature and kind other than existing liens of the School District or Crown.\nThey further provided that, after the expiration of one year from the date of the transfer, these latter should be conclusive evidence of the assessment and valid charge of the taxes on the lands therein described and that all necessary formalities had been taken and observed and that, afterwards, such sale and transfer should only be questioned or set aside on three specified grounds which are not now in question.\nIt was admitted that, if these provisions were intra vires, the rights of the appellants, whatever they were in the lands in question, had become extinguished and that, unless they were revived by the ordinance of 1901, the appellants were not interested parties within the meaning of the ordinance and had no right to redeem.\nSection 97 of the \"Land Titles Act, 1894,\" amongst other things, enacted that\nupon the completion of the time allowed by law for redemption and upon the production of the transfer of the land in the prescribed form with proof of its due execution by the proper officer and a judge's order confirming the sale, the registrar shall, four weeks after the delivery to him of the transfer and the judge's order of confirmation, register the transferee as absolute owner of the land so sold.\nBy this legislation the production of a judge's order confirming the sale was made just as essential to give any effect to the sale as the production of the transfer itself.\nThe object Parliament had in view was very plain. It desired to give an effective means for the recovery of taxes against lands while providing that owners, mortgagees and others interested should be notified through the confirmation proceedings before their interests in the land should be, by statutory provisions, transferred to another party. The confirmation of the sale became, therefore, as necessary and essential a condition precedent to giving statutory effect to a sale which disposed of and barred third parties' rights as the production and proof of the transfer by the proper officer. The territorial ordinance under which the lands in question were sold changed all that. It dispensed with the necessity of any previous confirmation of the sale by a judge and gave the effect to a transfer by itself and without confirmation as above pointed out by me. If this latter is intra vires it operates pro tanto as a repeal of the 54th, 59th and 97th sections of the Land Titles Act and dispenses with the necessity of a judicial act involving notice to all interested parties which parliament declared to be essential.\nThe power to legislate conferred upon the North-West Territories by the Parliament of Canada was a power given expressly subject to the limitation that it was not to be exercised in a way or to an extent inconsistent with Dominion legislation. In my opinion, the ordinances in question were inconsistent by giving an effect to a transfer alone which the Dominion legislation declared should only be given after the tax sale had been confirmed by a judge. The fundamental error, therefore, of the judgment appealed from is the holding that the present appellant had no interest in the lands in question and that such interest as they formerly had passed by virtue of the ordinances to the purchaser at the tax sale on the execution of the transfer. If these ordinances were intra vires that might well be so held. As they are at variance with Dominion legislation on the special point I cannot agree that any such effect follows the transfer.\nI think the ordinance of 1901 under which these confirmation proceedings were taken were clearly retroactive so as to cover the appellants' interest and that being persons interested in the land, within the meaning of those words in subsec. 2 of sec. 1, they have the right to redeem and to oppose the application for confirmation.\nIf at the time the application was made for a confirmation to this land tax sale the transferees had already acquired vested interests in the land it would require express words in the ordinance to give it a retrospective operation so as to take away these vested interests. But on the construction of the Dominion and territorial legislation reached by me no such vested interests had accrued and the ordinance dealing with' matters of procedure only should have a retrospective operation given to it. See the decision of the Court of Appeal in The Ydun ([13]).\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMEMO. The form of the minutes should be\u2014\n(1.) Order that the appeal be allowed and the orders appealed from be discharged. (2.) Declare that the appellants are entitled to appear and contest the confirmation proceedings and, on such appearance, to prove that they are existing bon\u00e2 fide mortgagees of the lands in question and that, on such proof being given, they are entitled to redeem such lands. (3.) Order that the respondents do pay appellants' their costs of this appeal and of the appeal from Mr. Justice Wetmore's order of the 22nd December, 1903, to the Supreme Court of the N. W. Territories from which the appeal to this court was taken. NESBITT J.\u2014I have arrived at the, same conclusion for the same reasons, and having had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by my brother Davies, I have nothing to add to what he has written.\nKILLAM J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for want of jurisdiction in this court to entertain it. It was not brought by leave, and so, it is not within section 24, subsec. (i) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. The appellant must rely upon subsection (a), under which the right of appeal is confined to\ncases in which the court of original jurisdiction is a superior court.\nWhether the jurisdiction to make the order is to be considered as having been given by the Dominion Act, 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 28, s. 97, or by one of the territorial ordinances referred to, it does not appear to me that the court of original jurisdiction was a superior court.\nBoth the Dominion statute and the ordinances authorised a judge to make an order for confirmation of a sale for taxes, not in the course of or as relating to any proceeding in his court. The judge was simply persona designata, a particular official considered a fitting one to inquire into the regularity of the sale and the propriety of giving effect to it. The case appears to me to come directly within the reasoning of Patterson J. in The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Little Seminary of Ste. Therese ([14]), and to be quite distinguishable from The City of Halifax v. Reeves ([15]). In the latter case the statute authorised the presentation of the petition to the court or a judge. While it was addressed to the Chief Justice or one of the judges of the court, it was apparently filed in the court and a summons issued upon it by the clerk of the court. The court having jurisdiction it could entertain the petition, in which case the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia could properly be said to have been the court of original jurisdiction. In the present case, as the jurisdiction was only in a judge nominatim, and not in the court, the intitling of the proceedings in the court could not give the court jurisdiction or prevent the judge from acting in the matter under the statute. Had it not been that the majority of the court consider that we have jurisdiction, I should not have expressed any opinion upon the merits. But, on this ground, too, I think that the appeal should be dismissed.\nWhen the conveyance in pursuance of the tax sale was made, the jurisdiction of a judge arose under the Dominion statute alone. Whatever the effect of the conveyance, in view of the apparent conflict between the Dominion and the territorial legislation, at any rate all right of redemption under the then existing legislation, was gone and the grantee had acquired a vested right to apply for a confirming order under the Dominion Act and, if the sale and conveyance were valid, to have the order made.\nI think that the subsequent action of the Legislature of the Territories, in establishing a further period for redemption, should not be construed as affecting cases in which the right was gone and conveyance issued. That legislature had no power to interfere with the jurisdiction under the Dominion Act or to interpose a bar to the exercise of that jurisdiction. It could, for its own purposes and in carrying out the enforcement of taxes by sale of the property taxed, require a confirmation by a judge and allow redemption up to confirmation, but this should not be deemed to have been intended to affect transactions finished and closed, in so far as its own previous legislation was concerned, and merely awaiting action by authorities constituted By Dominion legislation for the purpose of the system of land tenure and transfer adopted by the Dominion.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Andrews & Andrews.\nSolicitor for the Respondents: Hugh A.

The municipality has power, under the provisions of the Municipal Code, to authorize the construction of a tramway by an existing corporation notwithstanding that such corporation has allowed its powers as to the construction of new lines to lapse by non-user within the time limited in its charter.\nPer Girouard and Davies JJ. A railway company which has allowed its powers as to construction to lapse by non-user within the time limited in its charter and which does not own a railway line within the limits of a municipality where such powers were granted has no interest sufficient to maintain an injunction prohibiting the construction therein of another railway or tramway. Where a company subject to the Dominion Railway Act, with powers to construct railways and tramways, has allowed its powers as to the construction of new lines to lapse by non-user within the time limited, it is not competent for it to enter into an agreement with a municipality for the construction of a tramway within the municipal limits under the provisions of article 479 of the Quebec Municipal Code.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, confirming the dispositif of the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, (Pagnuello J.) which maintained the plaintiffs action and made absolute the injunction restraining the defendants perpetually from constructing the tramway in question in the suit.\nThe action was for an injunction to restrain the defendants from constructing a tramway being built by them on a highway between the City of Montreal and a point in the Parish of Longue Pointe, and for damages. The grounds of action were:\n1. That the plaintiffs and defendants had, on 6th February, 1899, entered into an agreement, that they would abstain from constructing lines of their respective railways in each other's local territory and that the attempted construction of the railway or tramway in question within the limits of the Parish of Longue Pointe was in violation of this agreement;\n2. That the defendant company had not power to construct the railway in question, as any powers it may have had for that purpose had lapsed under the provisions of section 89 of the Dominion Railway Act, under which the defendants had been placed by a Dominion statute, 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 84, declaring their undertaking to be a work for the general advantage of Canada; and, 3. That the defendants had not complied with the provisions of the Dominion Railway Act as to the deposit of plans and were constructing the railway-along an existing highway without leave from the Railway Committee of the Privy Council.\nThe defence was that the alleged agreement was invalid; that the tramway was being constructed under the authority of a municipal by-law and with the permission of the turnpike company which owned the highway; that the provisions of sections 89, 131 and 138 of \" The Railway Act\" were not applicable to tramways; that the plaintiffs had sold their line of railway so far as it had been constructed and had lost their charter rights and powers by non-user and, consequently, had no interest sufficient to maintain their action.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court maintained the plaintiffs' action in all respects, made absolute the interim injunction which had been issued and condemned the defendants to pay plaintiffs the sum of $500 for damages assessed by the trial judge. On appeal to the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, the dispositif of the Superior Court judgment was confirmed for the sole reasons that it was considered that the plaintiffs had established a sufficient status and interest to sustain their action and that, at the date of the action, the defendants had, by limitation of time, lost their statutory right to construct a new line of tramway such as they had commenced in the municipality of Longue Pointe.\nMacmaster K.C. and Campbell K.C. for the appellants. The legislation specially affecting the rights and powers of the appellants consists of the Quebec statutes 48 Vict.ch. 74; 49 Vict. ch. 85; 51 Vict. ch. 65 and the Dominion Act,\u201457 & 58 Vict. ch. 84, besides the Dominion and the Provincial Railway Acts and the Municipal Code. The company have power to construct railways and tramways in the Island of Montreal and it is submitted that, as regards tramways, the provisions as to limitation of time in the \"Railway Act\" do not apply. There are many distinctions to be drawn between railways and tramways, and provisions necessary and applicable to one would be quite out of place in respect to the other. See definitions of \"tramway\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica and Standard Dictionary, also Larousse, Dictionnaire, vo. \"Tramway\"; Matson v. Baird & Co.([1]).\nIt is submitted that the intention of the Legislature was to confer upon the company the power to build one or more railways direct from the centre of the city towards adjacent municipalities that could not easily be reached by the Montreal Street Railway, but that in those cases where the municipalities could be reached by extension of the Montreal Railway Company's system, then the appellants could construct a tramway. Powers to build a railway or to build a tramway are given in the statute in the alternative, and the two words have a distinct and different meaning. The ordinary policy which limits the time for the construction of a railway is due to the fact that railways have powers of expropriation and to cross or use highways by authority of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council; but, in the case of tramways, this policy is not applicable, because a tramway, in using the streets, does so under the control of the local authorities and upon terms dictated by them. The Railway Act defines \" railway \" in sec. 2, sub-sec. (q) \u2014to mean \" any railway which the company has authority to construct or operate, and includes all stations, depots, wharves, property and all works connected therewith, etc.\", whilst sub-sec. (w) defines \"undertaking \" as meaning \"the railways and works of whatever description which the company has authority to construct or operate.\" If \"'railway\" as defined includes or is equivalent to \" tramway,\" even when the powers are given to a company in the alternative, then \"railway\" must read as having the same meaning consistently throughout the Act and such a reading would be inconsistent. For instance, if section 307 applies to tramways, nearly every tramway in Canada must have been a Dominion railway, and the extensions made from time to time under contracts with municipalities would have been illegal unless the tramways had had their charters extended by Parliament The provisions relating to fares, tickets, traffic arrangements, servants and tolls would all apply to tramways if the word \"railway\" is equivalent to \" tramway.\" The result would upset existing practices. See dicta in the case of The Toronto Railway Co. v. The Queen ([2]), and the express reservation made by the Privy Council in the same case ([3]).\nExcept upon the construction that their tramways are railways within the meaning of the Railway Act it cannot be argued that the appellants' power to build tramways has expired for there is no time limited for the construction of tramways.\nOn the other hand the respondents' powers for the construction of new lines of railway expired under the provision of the Quebec statutes, 58 Vict. ch. 64, sec. 29 and 62 Vict. ch. 75, sec 6; they have sold, the whole of their constructed line and have no interest to maintain the injunction and no business interest to be protected.\nThe respondents were not serving the Parish of Longue Pointe as part of their local territory and the construction of the tramway in question is not a violation of the agreement as to invasion of territory. Under any circumstances the appellants, as an existing corporation, could construct the tramway under the provisions of Art. 479 of the Municipal Code and any agreement to the contrary would be ultra vires and invalid as against public policy. It is not possible to construe the contract as enabling the respondents to exclude others from Longue Pointe while not building itself in that municipality and not seeking traffic there. The clear intention in giving the two companies power to construct over the same territory was to ensure to such territory the advantages of tramway connection with Montreal; and while it might not be the policy that both should construct to the same point or in the same districts, it certainly was not the policy that the two companies enjoying those powers might by agreement between themselves exclude any locality from the advantages of connection with either of them.\nAs to damages none were proved and no details could be given. Strictly speaking the plaintiffs could not by any possibility sustain damage owing to the presence on the Longue Pointe road of ties and rails the property of the appellants. The construction had only been commenced for a day when they took their action. Nothing but the actual operation of the railway could cause any damage to anybody and as this had not taken place there could be no damage.\nLafleur K.C. and Beaudin K.C. (Lemieux K.C. with them) for the respondents. The statute 62 Vict. ch. 75 (Que.) was assented to on the 10th of March, 1899, and it recognized the contract invoked by the plaintiffs dated 6th February, 1899. It is in evidence that this contract was passed as the result of opposition which the appellants made to the proposed amendments to the respondents' charter granting extended powers, and that, as the result of a compromise, the agreement was embodied in the form of a contract, and the plaintiff's became bound by the statute not to establish, build or operate branches in territory in which appellants had built their electric railway, so long as the latter should not extend its line into the limits of Maisonneuve, Longue Pointe, Pointe-aux-Trembles and Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies. The contract on the part of the appellants recites this clause of the statute, and then sets forth that \"The Chateauguay & Northern Railway Company undertakes not to construct its line on the territory of the party of the second part (The Park and Island Railway Company), and the said party of the second part undertakes not to construct its line on the territory of the party of the first part.\" There is evidence to the effect that the territory of the respondents included, at that time, the municipalities of Maisonneuve, Longue Pointe, Pointe-aux-Trembles and Rivi\u00e8re des Prairies, they having there constructed their line of railway, while the appellants' territory was included in the line from the City of Montreal to Sault au Recollet, Cartierville and Lachine. The breach of this contract is sufficient cause for the injunction and for damages. As the appellants are subject to the Dominion Railway Act and have not complied with the provisions of its sections 89, 131 and 138, they have no power to construct the tramway in question, nor to enter into any agreement in respect to it The Municipal Code cannot help them for they are governed entirely by the Railway Act and, consequently, they have no statutory authority and their works are an intrusion upon and an obstruction of the highway. The respondents hold lands and are ratepayers in the municipality and are entitled to the injunction against an improper use of the highway and to protect their business interests being interfered with by a rival company in the manner complained of.\nThe judgment was delivered on the 25th of May, 1904, all the judges who heard the arguments being present except His Lordship the Chief Justice, who took no part in the judgment rendered.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs, for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Killam.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs, for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.\nDAVIES J.\u2014In this case I am of the opinion that the appeal must be allowed on the ground that the respondents (plaintiffs) had not at the date of their present action sufficient legal interest to entitle them to the injunction prayed. The trial judge, under a mistaken idea as to the meaning of the amendment in the plaintiffs' charter extending the time for the construction of the railway it was authorized to build, held that the plaintiffs' powers existed at the time of the commencement of the action. The Court of King's Bench while pointing out his error and holding that the plaintiffs' power of construction had ceased and that the company had previously sold the portion of the railway constructed by it going from Maisonneuve, a suburb of Montreal, to Bout de l'Isle, comprising thirteen miles of road, held, nevertheless, that there was no positive proof that these thirteen miles constituted all the plaintiffs' constructed line and that the court should therefore assume that the plaintiffs had sufficient legal interest to bring and maintain the action. I cannot accede to this conclusion.\nThat the company's powers of construction had expired is admitted; that the portion of the line they had constructed was sold and disposed of by them is proved and not challenged; and the defendant company in its pleadings expressly stated that at the time of the institution of the action, and for more than two years previously, the plaintiff company had no railway or works. The plaintiff company did not answer this allegation and did not attempt to prove that at the time of the institution of the action they had any railway or works. It is true that the Montreal Terminal Railway Company, to whom the plaintiff company had sold its constructed line of railway, had, in June, 1902, before the plaintiffs' powers of construction had expired, conveyed back to the plaintiffs certain lands upon which a railway might be built from Bout de l'Isle to the City of Montreal. But, as a matter of fact, that plaintiff company had allowed its chartered powers of constructing a railway to expire, and the mere possession of several pieces of land a long way off from the tramway, the construction of which was sought to be enjoined, but without any power of railway construction, would not of itself constitute such a legal interest as would be necessary to enable it to maintain such an action as this. The question is not whether the corporate existence of the plaintiff company had ceased, but whether their chartered powers of constructing railways or other works having ceased, their interest to oppose the construction by another company of such railways had not ceased, and, in my opinion, as they had sold and parted with all the line of railway they had constructed and gave no evidence of the possession of any property which the contemplated construction of the railway by appellant company would necessarily injure, I do not think they could maintain this action.\nThis conclusion, if correct, would dispose of the appeal and make it unnecessary to say anything upon the very important questions raised at the hearing, first, as to what was the legal effect of the agreement made between the companies whereby the appellant company contracted not to build a railway in certain parts of the Island of Montreal designated as u the territory \" of the respondents; and, secondly, whether the chartered powers of the appellant company had expired and whether they were bound by the provisions of the Dominion Railway Act. But there are good reasons why the other important points should be dealt with and disposed of. And, right at the threshold of the first question upon the agreement, I desire to say that I entertain grave doubts whether it is not void for uncertainty. It speaks of the \"territory\" of the plaintiffs and the defendants but does not describe nor define what is meant by territory. It is quite admitted that the words do not cover all of the territory across or over which the companies respectively had chartered powers to build railways, and I doubt whether it would be possible to determine from the agreement itself what was meant or to admit oral evidence which would explain it.\nPassing by that objection, however, I am of the opinion that the courts ought not to enforce and will not enforce an agreement by which a chartered company undertakes to bind itself not to use or carry out its chartered powers. I do not think such an agreement ought to be enforced because it is against public policy. If enforceable it practically amounts to an amendment and limitation of the chartered powers granted to, the company by Parliament. Who can tell whether Parliament would have granted the limited powers only had they been asked or would have agreed to pass an amending Act limiting these powers or the areas within which they were exercisible as the agreement contemplated? Of course if it is lawful for a company possessing special statutory powers to bind themselves for a consideration not to exercise them in part they can do so in whole. The courts have no right to speculate whether Parliament would or would not have granted these chartered powers to the defendant company over the limited area. Parliament alone can enact the limitation, and neither courts of justice nor companies can substitute themselves for Parliament. If the principle is once conceded that chartered companies which have obtained powers from Parliament, presumably for the public good, can by contract with a rival company, or with others, limit themselves and their successors not to use those powers in whole or in part, the most serious consequences might result and the chief object of Parliament in chartering companies authorized to construct railways in certain sections of country or to promote legitimate rivalry and competition in such construction, might be defeated. The stronger company could in all cases buy up the weaker and a premium would be given to the creation of what are called, at the present time, \"Trusts\". I do not think the courts should lend their aid in any way to defeat the policy and object of Parliament with regard to the powers it has conceded to companies, even if the officials for the time being controlling those companies should agree to a limitation of their powers, and the then existing shareholders confirm the agreement.\nThe question has already been discussed by the House of Lords in the case of Ayr Harbour Trustees v Oswald ([4]), where it was decided that an agreement by a public body not to use their special powers was invalid, and this whether the body be one which is seeking to make a profit for shareholders or a body of trustees acting solely for the public good.\nIn that case Lord Blackburn says:\nI think that where the legislature confers powers on anybody to take lands compulsorily for a particular purpose, it is on the ground that the usiner of that land for that purpose will be for the public good. Whether that body be one which is seeking to make a profit for shareholders, or, as in the present case, a body of trustees acting solely for the public good, I think in either case the powers conferred on the body empowered to take the land compulsorily are intrusted to them, and their successors, to be used for the furtherance of that object which the legislature has thought sufficiently for the public good to justify it in intrusting them with such powers; and, consequently, that a contract purporting to bind them and their successors not to use those powers is void. This is, I think, the principle on which this House acted in Staffordshire Canal v. Birmingham Canal ([5]), and on which the late Master of the Rolls acted in Mulliner v. Midland Railway Co. ([6]).\nIn the United States similar conclusions have been reached by the courts. In Chicago Gas Light Co. v. Peoples' Gas Light Co., ([7]) a contract by a corporation, authorized to manufacture and sell illuminating gas in a city, to discontinue such manufacture was held ultra vires and void; similarly held in Re Appeal of Scranton Electric Light and Heat Co. ([8]).\nThen as to the powers of the appellant company under its charter to construct the road under the Municipal Act, The original charter obtained by it from the. Quebec Legislature was superseded by the later charter obtained by it from the Parliament of Canada, 57 & 58 Vict., ch. 84. In this last Dominion charter the defendant company is declared to be a body corporate within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. The undertaking of the company is declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and the Railway Act of Canada is made to apply to the company and its undertaking instead of the Acts of the Province of Quebec and the Railway Act of Quebec. Nothing is said expressly as to the time within which its chartered powers are to be exercised, but as the \"Railway Act\" of the Dominion was expressly made applicable to it, we turn to the latter Act and find section 89 expressly prescribing that if the railway authorized by any special Act is not finished and put in operation seven years from the passing of such special Act, then the powers granted by such Act or by the Railway Act shall cease and be null and void as represents so much of the railway as then remains uncompleted.\nIt is therefore perfectly clear to me that these chartered powers terminated on the 23rd July, 1901, and that at the time the company began the construction of what is called the tramway under contract with the Municipality of Longue Pointe acting under the Quebec Municipal Act, its powers of construction were utterly at an end, so far at any rate as the new proposed work was concerned.\nThe only answer attempted to be made to this argument was that the work the appellant company proposed to build was a tramway and not a railway, and this because it was to be built on a highway and not through the lands of private persons. But without entering upon these fine distinctions between railways and tramways I think the answer is a simple one.\nBoth by their Provincial and by their Dominion charters the company defendant were authorized to construct and operate railways or tramways from certain points in the City of Montreal to the various municipalities situated on the Island of Montreal. They could do either one thing or the other, or both, but whatever mode of construction they adopted was by the Act 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 84, declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and subject to the provisions of the Railway Act. It would be preposterous to suggest that if the defendants called their works of construction a railway they would be obliged to complete it within the seven years prescribed by the Railway Act, whereas if they called it a tramway they could construct it at any time that might suit their convenience.\nThe learned judges of the court of appeal in dealing with the attempted distinction have come to the conclusion that it cannot have the effect of relieving the defendants from the limitations and subsequent disabilities resulting from section 89 of the Railway Act, and I fully concur in that conclusion.\nIn the result, therefore, I am of the opinion that the appellants' powers of construction having expired it was not competent for them to enter into any agreement with the municipalities for the construction of a tramway so called under the Municipal. Act; and that as they had chosen to seek powers from the Parliament of Canada and obtained them on the condition and basis that their undertaking was a work for the general advantage of Canada and to be subject to the provisions of the Railway Act of Canada instead of the Acts of the Province of Quebec, any work they undertook pursuant to the powers by that special Act given must have been completed subject to all the provisions of the Railway Act which were applicable to the undertaking.\nI do not think, however, their agreement not to exercise their chartered powers can be invoked as ground for obtaining an injunction, such agreement being in derogation of their chartered powers; but as I am also of opinion that the respondent company had not the interest necessary to maintain the action, the appeal should in my opinion be allowed, the injunction dissolved, and the action dismissed.\nKILLAM J.\u2014I agree with my brother Davies in thinking that the contract upon which the plaintiff company relies is one which should not be enforced by the courts. In Doane v. Chicago City Ry. Co. ([9]), Gray J. laid down a principle, which I conceive to be sound,\nthat an agreement by a corporation exercising a franchise for the public convenience, that it will not exercise it where the convenience may be thereby promoted, is invalid.\nIn that case an agreement by a street railway company with a private individual that it would not construct more than a single line of railway upon a certain street was held to be unenforceable. The principle is supported by Thomas v. The West Jersey Railroad Co. ([10]); Gibbs v. The Consolidated Gas Co. of Baltimore ([11]); and Central Transportation Co. v. Pullman's Palace Car Co. ([12]), as well as by the cases to which my brother Davies has referred.\nBefore the passing of the Act of the Quebec Legislature, 62 Vict. c. 75, containing the prohibition against the Chateauguay Company building in municipalities in which the Park and Island Company had built so long as the latter should not extend its lines into the municipality of Longue Pointe and other municipalities, the Parliament of Canada had passed the Act 57 & 58 Vict. c. 84, declaring the undertaking of the Park and Island Company to be a work for the general advantage of Canada and the company a body corporate and politic within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, and expressly authorizing the company to construct railways or tramways from the City of Montreal to the various municipalities in the island of Montreal.\nIt seems impossible, then, for either company to rely upon the Quebec Act, 62 Vict. c. 75, as impliedly sanctioning an agreement on the part of the Park and Island Company to abandon any of its corporate powers.\nThe Park and Island Company was proceeding with the construction of a tramway authorized by the municipal authority under the powers given by the Municipal Code, Art. 479. The municipality did not attempt to exercise the extended powers given by the Act 63 Vict. c. 61. It appears to me that the direction in that statute to give the preference to the Chateauguay and Northern Railway Co. or another specified company applied only to the arrangement authorized by the Act, and in no way limited the power of the municipality under the Municipal Code.\nI am also of opinion that it is not open to the Chateauguay and Northern Railway Company to raise any objection to the status or corporate powers of the body authorized by the municipality to construct such a work, or to set up its non fulfilment of the conditions prescribed by the Railway Act of Canada. By art. 479 of the Municipal Code, a municipal council may authorize an incorporated company, a natural person, or a firm, to construct and operate tramways in the municipality, and, for this purpose, to lay its rails on and run its cars over the public highways. As the Chateauguay and Northern Railway Company had no exclusive or preferential rights in these respects, and no interest which could entitle it to object to the municipal council conferring these powers upon natural persons or partnerships, it could have no right to question the corporate powers of another corporation with which the council might choose to deal or the fulfilment by the latter corporation of conditions precedent required by its charter.\nIf for any reason the work of the Park and Island Railway Company will constitute an unlawful erection or obstruction upon the highway, the Chateauguay and Northern Railway Company is not shewn to have such an interest in the highway, or to have suffered, or to be likely to suffer such damage by its obstruction as to warrant it in maintaining the action.\nIn the view which I take, the expiration of the period with in which the Chateauguay and Northern Railway Company should have completed its works and its want of present ownership of a railway are not important as affecting the result of this case.\nWhatever railways, or powers to construct railways or tramways, the Chateauguay and Northern Railway Company may possess, it does not appear to me that the Park and Island Company has done or threatens anything which is or would be a violation of any legal right of the Chateauguay and Northern Railway Company.\nI would allow the appeal, and dismiss the action with costs in all courts\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Campbell, Meredith, Macpherson & Hague.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Lafleur, MacDougall & Macfarlane.\n[1] 3 App. Cas. 1082.\n[2] 25 Can.

On a motion to quash the appeal, the appellant filed affidavits shewing that, according to the mortality tables, used by assurance actuaries, upon the plaintiff's average expectation of life, the cost of an annuity equal to the pension claimed would be over $7,000.\nHeld, following Rodier v.

His statement alleges, in substance, that as a member of the Montreal Police Force he has been a member of the respondent benefit society since its incorporation until the thirty-first of March, 1902 ; that his resignation was accepted to date from the first of April, 1902 ; that he has paid his contributions up to the thirty-first of March, 1902 ; that, according to the by-laws and rules of the society, he then became entitled to a life pension of sixty-two dollars and fifty cents per month, but that the society refused to admit his claim and to inscribe him on its list of pensioners. His conclusions are: Pourquoi le demandeur conclut \u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9fenderesse soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer au demandeur la somme de soixante-deux piastres et; cinquante cents pour la pension due du premier avril au trente avril, (1902) ; \u00e0 ce que par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir il soit de plus d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le demandeur \u00e0 le droit d'\u00e9tre reconnu comme pensionnaire de la d\u00e9fenderesse et d'\u00eatre inscrit sur la liste des dits pensionnaires aux termes de l'article 33 des r\u00e8glements, comme ayant droit sa vie durant \u00e0 une somme de $62.50 ; et \u00e0 ce qu'ordre soit donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse d'inscrire le dit demandeur sur la dite liste sous toutes peines que de droit ; \u00e0 ce que par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir, la d\u00e9fenderesse soit de plus condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer au dit demandeur la dite somme de $62.50 durant la vie du demandeur, et ce au fur et \u00e0 mesure que la dite pension deviendra \u00e9chue ; le premier paiement devant se faire le premier juin prochain et ainsi continuer de mois en mois durant la vie du dit demandeur.\nUnder the authority of Rodier v. Lapierre ([1]) ; Mac-donald v. Galivan ([2]) ; La Banque du Peuple v. Trottier ([3]); O'Dell v. Gregory ([4]); Talbot v. Guilmartin ([5]); and numerous other cases in the same sense, the case is clearly not appealable.\nMr. Beaudin, in support of the right to appeal, whilst conceding that, under the authorities, he could not invoke the future rights of the appellant, yet contended that the case is appealable upon the ground that the matter in controversy exceeds two thousand dollars in value, the conclusions of the action, as he argued, asking that the appellant be inscribed on the respondents' list of pensioners and the assurance companies' mortality tables shewing that, at his age, as appears by affidavits produced, the cost of an annuity equal io what would be his pension would be over seven thousand dollars. But that contention cannot prevail. The assurance tables are not guides for us in the matter of ascertaining the pecuniary value of the demand. That value is a contingent one depending upon his life and has not the certainty required to give us jurisdiction.\nThe motion to quash is granted and the appeal is quashed with costs as if quashed on motion in limine.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant : Beaudin, Cardinal,Loranger & St. Germain.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Leblanc & Brossard.\n[1] 21 Can.

B. 219) distinguished.]\nAlthough a railway company may have failed to properly maintain a bridge under their control so as to ensure the safety of persons travelling upon their trains, the mere fact of such omission of duty does not constitute evidence of the gross negligence necessary to maintain an action in damages for the death of a gratuitous passenger.\nJudgment appealed from, (9 B. C. Rep. 453) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] in banco, reversing the judgment at the trial and ordering judgment to be entered for the defendants with costs,\nThe company owns and operates a railway on its own lands on the Island of Vancouver between Cumberland, in the Comox district, and Union wharf, on the sea shore, about ten miles distant. The railway was carried across the Trent river, about seven miles from Cumberland, by a bridge which broke as the train (on which deceased, Richard Nightingale, was travelling) was passing over it and he was killed. The deceased had a contract with the company for repairing this bridge by adding two additional piers and, at the time of the accident, some of his workmen were engaged upon the contract. Deceased was then residing at Cumberland and could have reached the works by a passenger train or by the highway, but he entered the cab of the locomotive engine which was hauling a freight train towards the bridge in order to visit his work there. There was no conductor on this train and the engine driver had no authority to carry passengers and had been instructed that he should not allow persons to travel on his train without special permission. from competent authority. It appeared, however, that, from time to time, the company's officers and servants and other persons authorized by the manager and master-mechanic were in the habit of travelling by this train. The death of deceased occurred at the time of the accident, on 17th August, 1893, in respect of which the company was, in another case,[2] indicted and convicted for breach of duty in omitting, without lawful excuse, to maintain the bridge in proper condition to avoid danger to human life.\nThe action was brought by the plaintiff as administratrix of the deceased, for her benefit, as his widow, and for the benefit of her infant children under the \"Families Compensation Act\"[3], and the liability of the defendants, at common law, was also relied. upon. At the trial, before Mr. Justice Irving with a special jury, judgment was entered for the plaintiff upon the findings of the jury. By the judgment now appealed from,[4] the judgment at the trial was set aside by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, in banco.\nJ. Lorne McDougall for the appellant.\nLuxton, for the respondents, was not called upon for any argument.\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nDAVIES J \u2014I concur in the result of the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nNESBITT J.\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe highest that the position of the deceased can be put is that he was riding on the engine in question by tacit permission. The rule laid down in Moffatt v. Bateman[5] is that, in case of a gratuitous passenger, gross negligence must be shewn, and there cannot be any pretence that the evidence in this case fulfils that description. The driver in the Bateman Case[6] was the defendant himself and the plaintiff was with him at the defendant's express request.\nThe recent case of Harris v. Perry & Co.[7] was pressed upon us as extending the rule laid down in Gautret v. Egerlon[8]. We do not think that the case can be so viewed. That case simply decided that the leaving of a loaded truck upon the tracks was in the nature of a trap or was equivalent to such an act of wrongdoing as to amount to gross negligence. If the case is assumed to be a departure from the law, as previously laid down, we would not follow it. We think the doctrine of liability sufficiently extended already in the case of bare licensees.\nWe agree in the judgment of the court below. The opinions of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Martin contain a very valuable collection of the authorities.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nKILLAM J. concurred in the judgment for the reasons stated by Nesbitt J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.

That owing to improper couplings, the car in which the deceased was riding became detached and uncoupled from the rest of the train while the train was going at a high rate of speed, and the officials and employees of the company-defendant in charge of said train, took no precaution to avoid said car from running into the forepart of the train on which collision occurred, and owing to the shock resulting there-from the deceased was thrown down and killed.\nOn the 12th May, 1903, counsel for both parties agreed on the following facts to be submitted to the jury and by them answered in the cause, subject to the right to object :\n1 Was J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re on the 28th day of January a passenger on a train owned and operated by the defendant and running between the City of Montreal and the Village of Marieville ?\u2014Yes.\n2. Did the said J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re meet with an accident on the said date ?\u2014Yes.\n3. Did the said J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re receive injuries by the said accident, which resulted in his death ?\u2014Yes.\n4. Was the accident due to the fault and negligence of the company defendant, its servants or employees ?\u2014Yes.\n5. Were the couplings between the cars of the said train improper and defective ?\u2014Yes.\n6. Were the brakes on said train in working order ?\u2014No.\n7. Was the bell cordon said train in proper working order ?\u2014No.\n8. Was the said J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re the son of the plaintiff?\u2014Yes.\n9. Was the said J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re the main support of the said plaintiff and his wife, the mother of the said J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re ?\u2014 Yes.\n10. Was the said J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re travelling at the time of the said accident on a free pass containing the following condition ?\u2014Yes. \" The person accepting this free pass, in consideration thereof, assumes all risk of accident and expressly agrees that the company shall not be liable under any circumstances, whether of negligence by their agents or otherwise for any injury to the person or for any loss or injury to the property of the passenger using it. If presented by anyone other than the person named hereon, or if an alteration, addition or erasure is made upon this pass, it is void, and conductors will take it up and collect fare.\n\" The right to cancel this pass at any time is reserved by the company.\"\n11. Was said condition accepted by the said Franch\u00e8re ?\u2014No.\n12. Was said pass issued for value received by the defendant or its auteurs ?\u2014Yes.\n13. Was the said J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re at the time of the accident riding in the baggage car of the said train ?\u2014Yes.\n14. Was it against the rules of the said company to ride in a baggage car ?\u2014No.\n15. Did the said plaintiff suffer damage by reason of the death of the said J. Arthur Franch\u00e8re, and if so, to what amount ?\u2014Yes ($5,000), five thousand dollars. Unanimous on all questions.\nAt the trial, which took place on the 11th June, 1903, the jury answered the questions as above indicated, and the trial judge thereupon entered judgment for the plaintiff for the sum found by the jury.\nThe defendant appealed to the Court of Review which affirmed, without stating any reasons, the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe defendant now appeals here taking exception to questions 6 and 7 on the ground that the plaintiff's declaration contained no suggestion of any negligence as to the questions inquired into by questions 6 and 7, and claiming that the whole case of the plaintiff was that the accident had been caused through the fault of the company and its employees * * * * *\n1. Owing to improper couplings ; and,\n2. Because the officials in charge of the train took no precaution to prevent the car which had been detached from running into the forepart of the train.\nThe defendant claims that the assignment of facts was fixed before the case came on for trial subject to the right of the parties to move before the judge to strike out, add to, or amend any of the facts so assigned as provided by article 427 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The defendant admitted negligence under question 5, and the importance of eliminating questions 6 and 7 and the answers thereto is that the negligence found would bring it under section 243 of the Railway Act of 1888 and within the provision entitling a party to recover notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary. I am inclined to think that the appellant should have required particulars under clause 3 of the declaration and that not having appealed from the assignment of facts is not entitled to invoke article 427 to claim the right to object to evidence being offered of the negligence found in answers to the questions 6 and 7. In any event on a new trial the plaintiff could and would no doubt amend his declaration to which the defendant would be entitled to plead, and on such new trial evidence could be gone into of the negligence so found.\nThe appellant also objects to the misdirection of the learned trial judge on the question of the measure of damages and in directing the jury as to the acceptance of the condition on the back of the pass by the deceased. The learned judge read the document which is in the following terms :\nCette vente est faite en consideration du droit, par les pr\u00e9sentes accord\u00e9 au dit Jacques Franch\u00e8re et \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, leur vie durant ou la vie durant de Pun d'eux, de voyager, gratis (sans payer) sur tout le parcours du dit chemin, tant et aussi souvent et longuement qu'il leur sera loisible, sans charge extra pour leurs paquets et bagages ordinaires, et dans les chars que les dits Jacques Franch\u00e8re et son \u00e9pouse choisiront ou choisira, pour leur plaisir ou utilit\u00e9. Tel privil\u00e8ge et droit de passage gratis \u00e9tant transf\u00e9rable par les privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s \u00e0 deux des enfants des dits J. Franch\u00e8re et son \u00e9pouse, la vie durant de ces derniers ou de Pun d'eux. A l'effet du privil\u00e8ge pr\u00e9sentement accord\u00e9, la dite compagnie devra livrer aux dits Jacques Franch\u00e8re et son \u00e9pouse tous papiers, billets de passage ou tickets n\u00e9cessaires.\nWhich I translate textually as follows :\u2014\n\u201cThis sale is made in consideration of the right by these presents granted to the said Jacques Franch\u00e8re and to his wife during their life or the life of either of them, to travel free (without payment) on the whole length of the said road, as much and so often and at such length as will be possible to them, without any extra charge for their bundles and ordinary baggage and in the cars that the said Jacques Franch\u00e8re and his said wife will choose, for their pleasure or use. Such privilege and the right of free passage being transferable by the persons to whom the privilege is given to two of the children of the said J. Franch\u00e8re and his wife, during the life of the latter or of either of them.\n\" For the effect of the privilege now granted, the said company should deliver to the said Jacques Franch\u00e8re and his wife all papers, passenger notes or necessary tickets.\"\nIt was argued that the deceased could have presented this deed and demanded his free passage on the train, and that he in no sense came within the cases establishing that a person travelling on a free pass issued with such a condition as is contained on the back of the pass in this case was not entitled to recover from the railway company for the negligence of its servants. In the case of transportation issued strictly under the document in the case of either Jacques Franch\u00e8re or his wife that would be so, but as I read the document it is an agreement to give free passage to Jacques Franch\u00e8re and his wife or to any two of their children whom they substitute in their place. If that is the proper construction, then, if the railway company issue the pass to five persons, that is three of the family of Jacques and Mrs. Franch\u00e8re, then, surely they can say that as they are giving something not called for by the deed, something that is merely gratuitous, that as to the three persons to whom they are extending the gratuity the considerations relative to an ordinary free pass would apply I would think it clear, too, that even the parties entitled under the deed could agree with the railway company that, if the railway company would do something over and beyond that which was required by the deed, they, on their part, would, in consideration of such \"extra \" upon the part of the railway company, agree to limit or release the liability of the railway company to themselves. I should think that that must be clearly the case and that therefore a very serious question arose, and that as to at least three of the parties this was a free pass, and that as to the other two, namely, the persons mentioned in the deed, they had a perfect right to agree with the rail-way company that if the railway company would carry three other members of the family also free, that all five would agree to make no claim against the railway company for negligence resulting in their injury. I need only refer to the cases collected in Provident Lije Society of New York v. Mowat ([14]) to shew that any person receiving a pass, such as was issued in this case, with the conditions indorsed on the back of it, and having same in possession from year to year, would be presumed to have consented to the conditions. See also Robertson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([15]). I therefore think that upon this branch of the case the learned trial judge clearly misdirected the jury, and that any finding of non-acceptance would be against the weight of evidence and the proper con- clusions to be drawn that the verdict must be set aside.\nOn the question of the assessment of damages the effect of the charge of the learned trial judge is best shewn by the following language :\nYou have had before you here an expert who comes and tells you that the cost of an annuity is $683 for $100 a year to a man of the age of the old gentleman who is now the plaintiff before you. He is supposed according to the tables of mortality, to live for seven and a half years. It will be for you to say what annuity he is entitled to from all the evidence you have heard. That is to say, as regards his own support and that of his wife ; I want to eliminate from this the support of Mr. Bouthillier and of any other person who may be in that house.\nBy restricting yourselves to the strict line of your duty taking into consideration what this old gentleman and his wife were entitled to under the circumstances I have mentioned to you, you will reach the conclusion that\u2014if they should get anything\u2014they should get an annuity of four hundred or five hundred or six hundred dollars a year, whatever amount you think in your consciences that this young man could have paid. That is what you have to do, and it is upon the basis of that amount that your verdict must be reached.\nThis direction is, I think, clearly erroneous. I think that it should have been pointed out to the jury that they must consider the circumstance also that the son was running behind in his payments to creditors ; that he might be cut off by disease or accident at any moment, when the payments to the father would cease. I cannot do better than cite from the language of Mr. Justice Brett.\nTo the best of my belief, the invariable direction to juries, from the time of the cases I have cited until now, has been \" that they must not attempt to give damages to the full amount of a perfect compensation for the pecuniary injury, but must take a reasonable view of the case, and give what they consider under all the circumstances a fair compensation.\" I have a clear conviction that any verdict founded on the idea of giving damages to the utmost amount, which would be an equivalent for the pecuniary injury, would be injust. Founding my opinion on that conviction, on the declaration of it by Parke J., and on the ordinary direction of judges, which directions have not been for years challenged, I conclude that the direction that I have enunciated is the legal, and only legal, direction. A direction which leaves it open to the jury to give the present value of an annuity equal in annual amount to the income lost for a period supposed to be equal to that for which it would have continued if there had been no accident is a direction, as it seems to me, leaving it open to a jury to give the utmost amount which they think is equivalent for the pecuniary mischief done, and such a direction is a misdirection according to law. And such, in my opinion, was the direction in the present case of the Lord Chief Baron. Rowley v. London & N. W. By Co. ([16]).\nThis case has been adopted by the Court of Appeal in England on the 30th of last month in Johnston v. Great Western Railway Company ([17]).\nThe appellants also objected to the learned trial judge telling the jury that they were entitled to consider the needs of the plaintiff's wife during the lifetime of the plaintiff. The action was taken only for the plaintiff and not in a representative capacity, and I think, under the Code, damages recoverable are the same as under Lord Campbell's Act, and I entirely agree with the rules laid down by my brother Killam when Chief Justice of Manitoba in a case of Davidson v. Stuart ([18]). The cases are there fully considered and referred to and I adopt the conclusions he arrives at in that case and I think all that the jury were entitled to consider in this case were the reasonable pecuniary benefits to be derived by the father himself.\nThe verdict itself is evidence that the jury utterly failed to appreciate the proper measure of damages. They have given a present cash sum for a larger amount than could be suggested was likely to be contributed from year to year during the balance of the life time of the father. If the jury were to give a sum which at present expended would produce as a certainty at the present time the sum mentioned as usually contributed by the son it would, in my judgment, under the doctrine of Rowley's Case ([19]) be too large. not being under all the circumstances a fair compensation taking into consideration the chances of the support being out off by accident or death or other causes at any time ; but to give at least double such a fixed amount, as they have done in this case, stamps the verdict as one which must have been given under a misapprehension of the proper measure of damages to be adopted. It is very difficult under Lord Campbell's Act to get a jury to understand that they cannot give solatium for wounded feelings, etc., but that their verdict must only be for such a sum as there is reasonable proof of a reasonable expectation of a pecuniary benefit.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and a new trial directed.\nKILLAM J.\u2014At the trial counsellor the company moved to have certain questions which had been assigned to be submitted to the jury struck out, and the refusal of the trial judge to strike out the 6th and 7th questions has been urged as one ground for granting a new trial. Art. 498 of the Code of Civil Procedure makes the insufficiency. or defectiveness of the assignment of facts a ground for granting a new trial ; but by art. 499,\nthe defects in the assignment of facts must be such as to prevent a trial of the material issues.\nAs the declaration did contain a general allegation of negligence and as the defendants pleaded to the declaration, assented to the assignment of facts, subject to revision by the trial judge, and went down to trial without previously raising any objection, it does not appear to me that the trial judge was absolutely bound to strike out those questions or the Court of Review to disturb the judgment on the ground of his refusal to do so, or of the reference to the jury of the questions objected to.\nIn view however, of the findings of negligence in the answer to the 6th and 7th questions, the direction respecting the acceptance of the pass appears unimportant. These findings are not challenged otherwise than by the objection just mentioned, and it is not disputed that the defects came within the provisions of section 243 of the Railway Act of Canada, 51 Vict. ch 29, noncompliance with which renders the company liable, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary. The evidence seems to me to have amply warranted the finding of the jury that the pass was issued for value, and we need not consider the application of the section to the case of a person riding by mere license of the company, without consideration.\nIt does not appear to me \"to have been erroneous to receive evidence of the mother's chance of life. The jury would have the right to take into account the probable effect of the mothers life and the father's liability to maintain her upon the action of the deceased in making contributions to his father if he had not been killed.\nI entirely agree, however, that the direction to the jury upon the question of damages was erroneous upon the other ground pointed out by my brother Nesbitt. But, as the only question upon which there was any error was a question of damages, I think that justice would be done by refusing to allow the appeal if the plaintiff will consent to a reasonable reduction of damages.\nBy article 500 of the Code of Civil Procedure ;\nA new trial is not granted on the ground of misdirection * * * unless some substantial prejudice has been thereby occasioned ; and if it appears that such prejudice affects a part only of the matter in controversy, the court may direct a new trial as to such issues only.\nAnd by article 503 ;\nIf the amount awarded by the verdict is grossly excessive, the court may refuse a new trial, provided that the plaintiff agrees that it be reduced to an amount which the court considers not excessive\nin this case, say $2,500.\nWhile the latter article was probably intended to apply only to cases in which the jury has been properly directed, yet I think that its spirit may be applied in dealing with an application for a new trial on the ground of a misdirection as to damages, and the new trial refused, if in that way the \" prejudice \" can be removed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants : Lafleur, MacDougall & Macfarlane.\nSolicitors for the respondents : Greenshields, Greenshields, Heneker & Mitchell.\n[1] Q.

Joyce v. Hart (1 Can. S. C. R. 321) ; Levi v. Reed (6 Can. S. C. R. 482) ; Laberge v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society (24 Can. S. C. R. 59), and Kunkel v. Brown (99 Fed. Rep. 593) referred to.

R. 285) distinguished.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and maintaining the plaintiffs' action for a balance of $775.40, after deduction, from the amount of the demande, of $1,524.60 which had been realised upon a conservatory sale pending suit.\nThe action was for $2,300, the price of a cargo of lumber shipped by the plaintiffs to the defendants and delivered at the St. Gabriel Lock, in Montreal, on barges, but which the defendants refused to receive under their contract. After the action had been instituted, by the consent of the parties and to save expense, the plaintiffs sold the lumber in dispute for $1,524.60 and gave credit for that amount on account of the sum claimed by the action. The Superior Court dismissed the action with costs, but, on appeal by the plaintiffs, that decision was reversed by the judgment now appealed from and judgment was ordered to be entered in favour of the plaintiffs, after deduction of the $1,524.60, for the balance of the amount claimed with costs.\nBuchan K.C. for the motion. The amount remitted for cash received on the conservatory sale constituted a retraxit leaving only the balance of the original demand in controversy between the parties, a sum less than that required to give this court jurisdiction to hear an appeal. Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats et de Placements ([1]) ; Cowen v. Evans ([2]) ; Beauchemin v. Armstrong ([3]). The circumstances take this case out of the technical rule, because the plaintiffs and defendants acquiesced in the conservatory sale and the credit given and, consequently, the amount of the demande was actually reduced before the trial\nBisaillon K. C. contra. The consent was made \" with out prejudice to any of the rights of either of the parties\" as a conservatory measure; no retraxit was filed ; no reduction of the demande was effected, and, in the trial court, the plaintiffs' action was dismissed. There is, in effect, no modification of the amount in dispute, no difference between what the plaintiffs demanded by the action originally and what they have recovered. This case is governed by the decisions since the amendment of the Supreme Court Act in 1891, including Coghlin v. La Fonderie de Joliette ([4]), and The Citizens Light and Power Co v. The Town of Saint Louis ([5]). The cases in point are collected under the heading \" Controversy Involved \" in Coutlee's Digest, pp. 48 to 69.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is a case where the amount demanded by the declaration and the amount recovered are different. Now, the amount demanded was over $2,000. And the fact that the amount recovered and now in controversy upon the appeal is less than the appealable amount, cannot, under the amendment of 1891 to section 29 of the Supreme Court Act, affect our jurisdiction. Joyce v. Hart ([6]) ; Levi v. Reed ([7]); Laberge v. The Equitable Assurance Society ([8]) ; Kunkil v. Brown ([9]). The cases of Cowen v. Evans ([10]) ; Cowen v. Evans ; Micheli v. Trenholme ; Mills v. Limoges ; The Montreal Street Railway Co. v. Carri\u00e8re ([11]), relied upon by the respondents, in support of their motion, were governed by the law as it stood before that amendment. In Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats et de Placements ([12]), the appeal was quashed because the appellants' interest did not amount to $2,000, and it was not a case where there was a difference between the amount claimed and the amount recovered.\nThe case of Beauchemin v. Armstrong ([13]) also invoked by the respondents, is clearly not in point. There, subsection 4 of section 29 did not apply because it was not a case where there was a difference between the amount demanded and the amount recovered, costs not forming part of the amount so as to affect our jurisdiction where the right to appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute under that subsection.\nThe motion to quash is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bisaillon & Brossard.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J.

Where leave to appeal per saltum has been granted on the ground that the court of last resort in the province had already decided the questions in issue the appellant should not be allowed to advance new grounds to support his appeal.\nAppeal, per saltum, from a decision of the Judge in Equity of New Brunswick in favour of the plaintiff and maintaining an injunction to restrain defendant from selling the land claimed by plaintiff.\nThe bill in this case prayed for a decree declaring the rights and title of the plaintiff in and to certain land in Bathurst, N.B., and for an injunction to restrain defendant from advertising for sale or selling said land. Defendant had advertised a sale and a temporary injunction was granted, and the Judge in Equity ordered the title to be tried out in an action of ejectment which was done and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. Defendant then moved before the Supreme Court of the Province for judgment or a new trial both of which were refused The Judge in Equity then made the final decree declaring the plaintiff owner in fee of the land.\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick having decided the issues on the motion for a new trial defendant was granted leave to appeal per saltum.\nGormully K.C. and Fred. Taylor for the appellant. The decree granting the perpetual injunction is not warranted either in fact or in law. The onus of establishing adverse possession is on the party alleging it and the adverse possession must be clearly proved. The evidence of adverse possession must be clear, and mere unconnected acts of trespass are entirely insufficient for title to be barred by the Statute of Limitations. Handley v. Archibald[1]; Sherren v. Pearson[2]; McConaghy v. Denmark[3]; Poignand v. Smith[4]; Doe d. Des Barres v. White[5]; Proprietors of Kennebeck Purchase v. Springer[6]; Griffith v. Brown[7]; Pike v. Roberlson[8]. The authorities are that for title to a town lot to be barred by adverse possession, the evidence of unquestionable acts of ownership must be particularly clear; Bowen v. Guild,[9]; some jurisdictions even hold that the lot must be built on or fenced in: Garrett v. Belmont Land Co.[10]. The circumstances of the present case shew that this lot, on the sea-shore, was practically used by the public as part of the street, and unless there were some buildings or improvements of a more or less permanent character thereon, or some cultivation of the soil, it is evident that there could not be that exclusive and notorious adverse occupancy which the law requires. The doctrine of adverse possession is to be construed strictly and cannot be made out by inference but only by clear and positive proof. It also appears that the plaintiff and his grantors had no adverse possession of the lot between high and low watermark. While the tide was in, this portion of the lot was an open highway for the general public. Therefore the plaintiffs' possession could not be of that continuous character which is required to bar title by adverse possession: Mayor of St. John v. Littlehale[11]. The court, at the trial of ejectment, misdirected the jury; (a) As to what constituted a title; (b) By telling the jury that it did not appear that the defendant was in actual possession of the lot; (c) By directing the jury that acts of possession would be sufficient if they are acts done on the land which a man would be apt to do if he in fact owned it; and (d) By directing the jury that the evidence shewed that the possession of the plaintiff and his grantors in this case was not interrupted.\nThe findings of the jury do not authorize entering a verdict for the plaintiff and the learned judge was in error in so ordering. The findings are merely that the plaintiff and his grantors had been in actual and open possession of the lot from 1876 until the present time and, during that time, exercised acts of ownership over it. Even admitting these findings to be supported by the evidence, the facts so found are not sufficient to constitute title under the Statute of Limitations. The leading text writers establish that, to bar title by adverse possession under the Statute of Limitations, there must be an actual occupancy, clear, definite, positive and notorious. It must be continous, adverse and exclusive during the whole period prescribed by the statute and with and intention to claim title to the land occupied. Washburn, Real Property, (4 ed. vol. 3 p. 489: Angell, Limitations, (6 ed.) p. 410; Adams, Ejectment, (4 Am. ed.) p. 579.\nIn the present case there was no finding that this possession of the plaintiff and his grantors was adverse, continuous, actual, exclusive and under a claim of ownership.\u2014all of which are necessary for the statute to apply. Nor was the attention of the jury called to these as requisite. Indeed, there could have been no such finding by the jury on the evidence. Consequently the plaintiff's case was not made out. Ward v. Cochran[12]; McConaghy v. Denmark[13]; Sherren v. Pearson[14]; Doe d. Shepherd v. Bayley[15]; Young et al. v. Elliott et al.[16]; Taylor v. Horde[17]; and note in 2 Smith's Leading Cases (11 ed.) 648.\nThe issue at law directed by the court was not carried out by the plaintiff in the spirit of the order, as, in his bill, the plaintiff claimed a documentary title and tried the issue on a claim by adverse possession.\nThe bill is without equity and the Court of Equity had no jurisdiction over the matter. Indeed, it is very doubtful under what head of equity jurisprudence the plaintiff attempted to bring himself. He alleges that the defendant Miller had instructed the defendant Kerr to sell the water lot and that he verily believes that the said defendants are maliciously endeavouring to annoy him and to cast a cloud upon his title. There is no allegation in the bill that it is probable that the defendants would sell the water lot or make any conveyance thereof; nor does the plaintiff allege that he believes that they will do so unless enjoined, but we are left with the bald statement that Miller has instructed Kerr to sell the lot. Even assuming that the sale would be an irretrievably ruinous matter as regards the plaintiff and his claim to the water lot, there are no allegations that such danger is of such imminent and probable nature as to warrant a recourse to a Court of Equity in aid of a legal right. Fletcher v. Bealey[18].\nThe bill prays an injunction restraining the defendants from casting a hypothetical cloud on the plaintiff's title to the lot. As regards casting a cloud on the title, the plaintiff, in his ejectment proceedings, admitted that he had no documentary title to the land, and in his proceedings as well as in the statement of claim on which they were based, contended that he was entitled thereto absolutely by reason of adverse possession for the statutory period. Accordingly, as the plaintiff had no title to the lot in question, any basis for a bill in equity to remove a cloud on title, or to prevent a cloud on title, is absolutely wanting. Even assuming that a court of quity would interfere under any circumstances, the plaintiff, in effect, by his own statement, had no title to be clouded.\nIn the second place, no precedent can be found where a bill in equity has been allowed against a party claiming a legal title to real property merely because of such claim being made. The rule stated by Page-Wood, V. C., in Talbot v. Hope Scott[19] is that the court cannot interfere with a legal title of any description unless there be some equity by which it can affect the conscience of the defendant. As the plaintiff's right is one clearly triable at law, there is no ground for a court of equity interfering. Earl of Bath v. Sherwin[20]. The decision in the present case, if correct, would establish that a party can force another to contest, in equity, a legal right at a time that is entirely in his own discretion. No precedent can be found for such a doctrine. Best v. Drake[21].\nHere there had been no previous verdict; but, on the other hand, the plaintiff had brought an action against the defendant Kerr and discontinued, paying defendant's costs\u2014precisely the reverse of Best v. Drake (1); and yet, in Best v. Drake (1), the Court of Chancery held that it had no jurisdiction This is a fundamental principle of equity; Brooking v. Maudslay Son & Field[22].\nThen, the issue ordered was futile; Browne v. Smith[23]; and the form of the decree is wrong, and in this case a bill quia timet cannot lie. We also refer to Hayward v. Dimsdale[24]; White v. Mellin[25]; Bonnard v. Perryman[26]; Ansdell v. Ansdell[27]; Shepherdson v. McCullough[28]; Harris v. Mudie[29] at page 422; Ontario Industrial Loan Co. v. Lindsey[30]; Buchanan v. Campbell[31]; and Truesdell v. Cook[32].\nTeed K. C. for the respondent. The substantial question is, who had the better title or right to the bank or shore lot? The question of title was litigated and tried as between the appellant and respondent in the action of ejectment and found in favour of the respondent, that finding was confirmed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick en banc, and the question was thereby res judicata as between the parties. If the appellant was dissatisfied therewith he should have appealed to this court from the decision on the ejectmerit, and not having done so, he is precluded from questioning or impugning it on this appeal.\nWhen the matter came before the judge in equity upon the hearing, when the decree in equity appealed from was pronounced, he was bound by the decision of the full court in the ejectment action that the title was in the respondent, and was bound to follow that decision, and make a decree in accordance therewith The Supreme Court is the court of appeal from the Equity Court, and how could the judge in equity, upon the same identical questions both of law and fact, declare that this decision given on the same case and questions by his immediate court of appeal was bad and wrong, and how could he make a decree contrary thereto? The judge in equity was bound by the decision of his immediate court of appeal, and therefore his decision is right, or at all events it does not lie in the mouth of the appellant to say it is wrong. Under the old English chancery practice, an issue or action at law tried by order out of chancery was not determined by a court binding upon chancery, and therein lies the distinction between that practice and the practice in the present case. How could the judge in equity under the facts and evidence before him, decree that the title was other than in respondent. The practice as laid down in Daniel and in Smith on Chancery Practice is, that upon the suit coming on for hearing on further directions, after the trial of an action or issue at law, the only evidence of title offered is the postea in such action or issue. There was nothing before the judge in equity to shew that it was erroneous.\nThis appeal is taken from the decree in equity only, and not from the decision in the ejectment action. Such last mentioned decision, therefore, stands unimpeached and that decision, being the judgment of a superior court, and the final court of appeal for the province, cannot be attacked collaterally in this appeal but is final and conclusive until directly appealed from and reversed.\nThe respondent further contends that the decision in the ejecment action, and the decree appealed from, based thereon, are correct;\u2014(a) Because under the evidence on the trial, the respondent made out a full and complete title by possession for over twenty-five years by himself and those under whom he claimed, and therefore, was entitled to recover; and\u2014(b) That even if the respondent had not made out a possession for twenty years, he at all events, proved a possession prior to that of the appellant and is entitled to recover. Prior possession, though less than twenty years, is sufficient to recover against one without title. Asher v. Whitlock[33].\nThe order of the Equity Court under which the action of ejectment was brought directed the bringing of that action to try the title, and in no event should the case be tested by the old rules relating to the trial of ejectments whereby it was urged or held that a plaintiff in ejectment must fail if the legal title was shewn outstanding in some one else. The respondent submits that the legal title, in whomsoever vested, was extinguished by the possession of the respondent, and those under whom he claimed. The meaning of the decree directing the action of ejectment was to try which of the claimants had the better right to the land in dispute. The appellant proved no title or right of any kind whatsoever to the lot in question; no pretence of proof of possessory title; no proof of documentary title from any one that ever owned or possessed it. The bill has equity in substantially alleging that the defendants had put a cloud upon the title. For this there is no remedy at law and recourse must be had to a court of equity. The practice in New Brunswick is to order an issue in ejectment to inform the conscience if the Court of Equity. This was the old English practice. See remarks of Eldon L. J. in Pemberton v. Pemberton[34].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014In this case I understand that we are all of opinion that upon all the points of law or of fact taken in the courts below the appeal should be dismissed. But the majority of the court are of opinion that we should allow the appeal upon a ground admittedly never taken in the courts below. Now, this is an appeal per saltum granted by the registrar though strenuously opposed by the respondent. In my opinion, under such circumstances, no new point of law is open to the appellant. We should not so easily give to an appellant the right to constitute this court a court of first instance. It is rather singular, not to say more, for an appellant to obtain leave to appeal per saltum upon the ground that the provincial court of sppeal has passed upon the points involved, and subsequently to be allowed to raise a new point in this court.\nI do not take part in this judgment.\nSEDGEWICK J., also dissented from the judgment of the majority of the court.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nNESBITT J.\u2014This action was begun by a bill in equity the plaintiff seeking to have the defendant restrained by an injunction from advertising for sale, or selling, or conveying, or professing or pretending to sell or convey a certain water lot in the Town of Bathurst and also praying for a decree declaring his rights in and title to said lot. Subsequently an order was made for the plaintiff to bring ejectment against the defendant. Ejectment was according brought and a verdict was rendered in favour of the plaintiff, and the record is indorsed stating that the jury had found that the plaintiff, on the 5th July, 1901, was and still is in possession of the land as in the writ alleged. Afterwards, the Judge in Equity, no counsel appearing for the defendant, granted a decree the material part of which is as follows:\nWhereupon, and on hearing the plaintiff's bill, the record and postea in the ejectment suit read, and what was alleged by the said counsel for plaintiff, it is now declared that the plaintiff, George Robertson, is absolutely entitled in fee simple to the water lot or shore lot situate in front of the Robertson Hotel, in the Town of Bathurst, in the County of Gloucester, and hereinbefore and in the plaintiff's bill mentioned, and it is ordered that the defendants John Kerr and John Miller mentioned, and each of them be and they and each of them are hereby perpetually enjoined and restrained henceforth altogether and absolutely from advertising for sale or conveying or professing or pretending to sell, assign or convey the said water lot or shore lot.\nAn appeal was allowed per saltum to this court. I I do not think that we are at liberty to discuss the evidence at the trial or to consider whether the charge of the learned trial judge and the finding of the jury was correct; and I think, therefore, the point shortly turns on whether or not the bill was demurrable for want of equity.\nThat objection to the making of a decree could be taken on that ground at the hearing, notwithstanding that the defendants had answered and had not demurred, is clear. See Jones v. Davids[35]; Hollings-worth v. Shakeshaft[36]; Webb v. England[37]; Ernest v. Weiss[38]; Morocco Land and Trading Co. v. Fry[39]. In some of these cases costs were refused on a dismissal of the bill at the hearing, upon the ground that the defendant could have raised the defence by demurrer. Substantially what is in dispute is the title to the lot in question, across the road from the hotel of the plaintiff, which the plaintiff claimed to have obtained a title to by various acts of possession and for the purposes of this judgment he must be presumed to have obtained such title, although if we were at liberty to discuss the evidence I think a very different result would follow. The defendant, Miller, also claimed to be the owner and issued the following advertisement:\nI will sell at public auction in front of the Telegraph Office in Bathurst, on Saturday, January 27th, at eleven o'clock a.m., the water lot owned by the late William End fronting on Water Street, in five lots forty feet each in breadth. Terms ten per cent of purchase money to be paid at sale, balance on delivery of deed, about ten days afterwards.\nN.B.\u2014The sale of the above named lot was postponed last August on account of Mr George Robertson bringing a suit in the Supreme Court claiming title. He has discontinued his suit and paid costs.\n(Signed) JOHN KERB, Auctioner.\nBATHURST, 19th January, 1900.\nWhereupon the plaintiff filed his bill in equity as 1 have before stated. I can find no authority for the interference of the Court of Equity in such a case. A most interesting discussion of when the court will interfere on behalf of a plaintiff in possession against a defendant not in possession and claiming possession and threatening to come upon the estate is shewn in the case of Lowndes v. Bettle[40], where Vice Cancellor Kindersley reviews all the authorities. I find no case that goes further than that case, and in the United States it seems there is no general rule that can be relied on as determining what constitutes such a cloud on a title as would authorize the interference of the Court of Equity for its prevention. Generally an action at law or a suit in equity will not be entertained unless there is an actual disturbance of right, Exceptions to this rule are and have been long recognized in a Court of Equity, and the jurisdiction of that court is often exercised to prevent as well as to redress injury. A mere fear of suit, or that any one merely questions one's title, or even asserts a hostile title, will not justify the court in intervening and cause litigation which might not otherwise arise. A sale of the land of the true owner as the property of a mere stranger with whom he is not connected from whom he does not mediately or immediately trace title cannot cast a cloud on his title. See Armstrong v. Sanford[41]; Montgomery v. McEwen[42]; Pixley v. Huggins[43]; Welch v. May[44]. In Ontario, Sir Henry Strong, then Vice Chancellor, in Truesdell v. Cook[45], said as follows:\nI am of opinion that in a proper case where the plaintiff having a legal title has done all he can to assert his title at law, a bill may be maintained in this court to compel the delivering up of a deed which appears to be void at law, provided it is a registered instrument. I find no authority for saying that the existence of an unregistered deed, passing no interest, and not appearing to be a link in the title, can give ground for the jurisdiction\"; but the registration has such a tendency to embarrass the title of the true owner that there would be a great want of remedy if this court could not decree cancellation in such a case.\nNo higher authority than the learned Vice Chancellor upon equitable doctrines can be cited in this country. See also Ontario Industrial Loan and Investment Company v. Lindsey et al.[46].\nIn New Brunswick the doctrine that conveyances of land in the actual adverse possession of another are void is still in force. Upon the allegations of the bill any conveyances which the defendant Miller might make would be void as against the plaintiff.\nWhile I agree that the Court of Equity will always mould its decrees to meet changing circumstances, I think we should not bring the court into the reproach that equity was measured by the length of the chancellor's foot by departing from apparently well settled doctrines. I agree with the view expressed by my brother Sedgewick that the court will always leave the right open for interference in any case where it is deemed necessary in the interest of justice to prevent the placing of a cloud on a title of any one, but I do not think this case calls for the intervention of the court.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the plaintiff's bill of complaint dismissed, but without any costs of the suit or of the appeal, as the defendants did not raise the objection to the maintenance of the suit either by demurrer or at the hearing or otherwise in the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Geo.

S. N. S. (1900) c. 171 ss. 6 and 8\u2014Contract price.\nUnder the Mechanics' Lien Act of Nova Scotia R. s. N. s. (1900) ch. 171 a lien for machinery for a mill does not attach until it is delivered and if the contractor for building the mill has then been fully paid there is nothing upon which the lien can operate as by sec. 6 of the Act the owner cannot be liable for a sum greater than that due to the contractor.\nB., holder of more than half the stock of a pulp company for which he had paid by cheque, and also a director, offered to sell to the company land, build a mill and furnish working capital on receipt of all the bond issue and cash on hand. The offer was accepted and all the stock, issued as fully paid up was deposited with a trust company and the cash, his own cheque and the price of five shares, given to B. The stock was sold and, from the proceeds, the land was paid for, the working capital promised given to the company and the balance paid to B. from time to time, as the mill was constructed. The machinery was supplied by an American company but when it was delivered all the money had been paid out as above.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (36 N. S. Rep. 348) that as all the money had been paid before delivery the company was not liable under the Mechanics' Lien Act to pay for the machinery.\nHeld also, that sec. 8 of the Act which requires the owner to retain 15 per cent of the contract price until the work is completed did not apply as no price for building the mill was specified but the price was associated with other considerations from which it could not be separated. Appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe respondent company was incorporated on the 11th March, 1898, by chapter 135 of the Nova Scotia Acts of that year, for the purpose of manufacturing pulp wood, with a capital of $550,000, divided into 5,500 shares of $100 each, with power to issue bonds not to exceed in the whole the amount of the issued stock of the company. The first meeting of the provisional directors of the company was held on the 28th September, 1898. At this time the stock list consisted of Mr. Burrill's subscription for 2,745 shares, and four additional shares which had been subscribed by other persons; one share was later on subscribed for by one of the appellants, who became a director of the respondent company. These shares were subsequently paid in full, amounting to $500. Nothing beyond this was ever paid by any one. Burrill deposited with the company his cheque for $68,625 as a payment in respect of the shares for which he had subscribed, but the cheque was never paid, nor intended to be paid, and was deposited, as Burrill says, to make the company's position legal. The company was prohibited, by section 16 of its charter, from commencing operations until half the capital stock had been subscribed and 25 per cent of such subscriptions paid up. At the first meeting of the provisional directors, held on the 28th September, 1898, Burrill, who was a director of the respondent company, made a proposition to sell the company certain Lands and properties, to build and equip a pulp mill, and to pay to the company $55,000 as working capital, in consideration of receiving the company's whole bond issue, amounting to $250,000, the balance of the company's stock, viz., 5,495 shares (including the stock for which he had subscribed), to be issued as fully paid, and the money in the treasury of the company, $69,125, being his own cheque and the $500 paid for the five shares already mentioned. This offer the provisional directors accepted, on the 29th September, 1898. At the time Burrill did not own the lands and property which be offered to sell to the respondent company; he merely held options entitling him to purchase the same.\nNothing further was done until the 17th of September, 1899, when a meeting of the shareholders of the company was held at Montreal, at which the agreement between Burrill and the provisional directors was ratified, bonds to the extent of $250,000 and the balance of the stock was delivered to the National Trust Company, and Burrill was paid the money in the treasury of the company, amounting to $69,125, consisting of his own cheque for $68,625 and the $500 which had been paid for five shares. The bonds were sold, and realized $237,030, and, 2,500 shares were also sold for 15 per cent of their face value. In all from the sale of bonds and stock $274,000 was realized, less some commission paid to brokers.\nThe property was conveyed to the company by deed dated the 7th October, 1899. The property was paid for out of the moneys realized from the sale of the bonds and stock, and the respondent company was paid the $55,000 as working capital. The pulp mill had still to be built and equipped with the best modern and improved machinery, according to Burrill's contract with the company. After payment by the Trust Company for the property conveyed to the respondent company, and after providing the working capital of $55,000, there still remained with the Trust Company, in December, 1899, a balance of $72,113.47. This money was paid out to Burrill from time to time as the construction of the mill progressed, on the certificate of Faulkner, who had been appointed inspector of the work by the respondent company, the first payment being one of $10,000 made on the 31st December, 1898.\nOn the 11th May, 1900, Burrill made a contract with the appellants for the supply of the machinery for the mill. On the 23rd of November, 1899, the Trust Company made its last payment to Burrill, thereby exhausting the $72,113.47. The mill was not then finished, as Faulkner, the inspector, knew.\nOn the 23rd of November, 1900, the plaintiffs shipped the machinery, which reached Weymouth on the 25th December, 1900. The plaintiffs began to instal the machinery on the 14th January, 1901, and finished installation on the 28th February, 1901. The respondents received from the plaintiffs notice of the completion of the contract on the 11th March, 1901. The plaintiffs filed a lien on the 28th March, 1901 and began this action on the 23th May, 1901.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Meagher who held that plaintiffs were entitled to a lien for $18,000 the price of the machinery with interest. This the full court reversed and dismissed the action.\nPellon K.C. and R. V. Sinclair for the appellants.\nH. A. Lovett and F. H. Bell for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nNESBITT J.\u2014The facts are very fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Graham in the court below.\nThe case may be disposed of upon one short ground, namely, that section 8 of the Mechanics' Lien Act is not applicable to such a transaction.\nAssuming, but without deciding, that, in a case of this kind, a lien could be acquired as against the defendant company for materials, etc., supplied to Burrill, yet, by section 6 of the Act, E, S. N. S, 1900, ch. 171,\nexcept as in this chapter is otherwise provided, a lien shall not attach so as to make the owner liable for a greater sum than the sum payable by the owner to the contractor.\nThe plaintiffs acquired no lien by their contract with Burrill. No lien could attach until the machinery was actually furnished or the work done. Long before that the full consideration had been paid. The only ground upon which the plaintiffs can hope to maintain a lien as against the defendant company would be that section 8 of the Act applies, and we think that that section does not by its terms apply to a case where there was no price specified or capable of being ascertained for the erection of the building, but the contract price of the building was blended with considerations for other matters from which it could not be separated. And we adopt the reasoning of the cases in Massachusetts referred to in the judgment below, to which may be added Ellenwood v. Burgess[2]; Angier v. Bay State Distilling Company[3].\nWe think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Sandford H.

(1900) ch. 73 (Assessment Act) exempted from taxation \"the road, rolling stock * * used exclusively for the purpose of any railway, either in course of construction or in operation, exempted under the authority of any Act passed by the legislature of Nova Scotia.\" Prior to the passing of this Act the appellants' railway had always been exempt from taxation but all former assessment Acts were repealed by these Revised Statutes so that it was not \"exempted\" when the latter came into force. By 2 Ed. 7., ch. 25, assented to on March 27th 1902, the word \"exempted\" was struck out of the above clause and in May, 1902 the appellants were included in the assessment roll for that year for taxation on their railway.\nHeld, by Taschereau c. J., that under the above recited clause the railway was exempt from taxation.\nHeld, by Sedgewick, Davies, Nesbitt and Killam JJ. that if the railway could be taxed under the Assessment Act of 1900 the rate was not authorized until the amending Act of 1902 by which it was exempt had come into force and no valid tax was, therefore, imposed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in favour of the defendant on a case stated between the parties.\nThe following is the case stated for the opinion of the court.\n\"1. The plaintiff is a body corporate, whose chief place of business is at Sydney, in the County of Cape Breton. The plaintiff is and was, at all times hereinafter referred to, the lessee of certain property belonging to the Dominion Coal Company, Limited, a certain other body corporate, doing business in the County of Cape Breton. Such property, of which the plaintiff is and was lessee as aforesaid, included the road, rolling stock, bed, track, wharves, station houses, buildings and other plant of or used in connection with that certain railway system owned by the said Dominion Coal Company, Limited, and known as the Sydney and Louisburg Railway, the same being hereinafter referred to as \"the property.\" The property is and was used exclusively for railway purposes, namely, for the purpose principally of carrying coal from mines of said Dominion Coal Company, Limited, leased to plaintiff, and also of carrying passengers and freight by railway and the operating of a railway between Sydney and Louisburg, and the same is wholly situate within the county of Cape Breton aforesaid, and is and was used exclusively for railway purposes, and is and was in operation under the authority of an Act of the Legislature passed by the province of Nova Scotia and has been so used and operated under the authority of said Act since a date prior to the first day of January, 1901.\n\"2. That previous to the coming into force of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, the property was exempt from taxation by virtue of chapter 44 of the statutes of Nova Scotia for the year 1892, and chapter 5 of the statutes of Nova Scotia for the year 1895. Said chapter 44 of the Acts of 1892 was repealed by said chapter 5 of the Acts of 1895, and said chapter 5 of the Acts of Nova Scotia, 1895, was repealed immediately upon the coming into force of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, hereinafter referred to.\n\"3. That under and by virtue of the provisions of chapter 73 of the Revised Statutes, 1900, the assessors for the districts of the municipality of the county of Cape Breton, within which the property was situate, assessed the respective portions of the same respectively situated within the said respective districts, and prepared and completed the assessment rolls respectively for the said respective districts in the form prescribed and pursuant to the provisions of said chapter, and duly signed said respective assessment rolls after having first duly attached to each roll the certificate required by said chapter to be made by said assessors, and prior to the 15th day of November, 1901, and within the time limited by said statute, duly forwarded and returned to the clerk of the Municipality of the County of Cape Breton aforesaid, said assessment rolls for the said several districts. The plaintiff in and by said assessment rolls was assessed in respect of the property in said several districts in the following amounts, as follows, namely:\nDistrict.\nAmount of Assessment on \"The Property\"\nOld Bridgeport\n$ 300,000\nHillside\n15,000\nLouisburg\n16,000\nBridgeport\n6,000\nPort Morien\n48,000\nCatalone\n16,500\nSydney Forks\n18,000\nLingan and Victoria Mines\n18,000\nBateston\n24,000\n$ 461,500\n\"4. Forthwith upon the completion of the said assessment rolls, the assessors of said districts duly gave notice of the assessment in accordance with the requirements and provisions of section 16 of said chapter 73.\n\"5. That on or before the 4th Tuesday of December, 1901, the assessment roll for each polling district in the said municipality of the county of Cape Breton, was duly revised and corrected by the Board of Revision and Appeal for said municipality and a true copy of such assessment roll for each of said districts as aforesaid was duly transmitted by the said clerk of the municipality to the assessors for each of such districts, who did forthwith post up the same in some public and conspicuous place within each of such districts in pursuance with requirements of section 34 of said chapter 73.\n\"6. No appeal was asserted from the said assessments of \"the property\" or from any part thereof by the plaintiff or by the Dominion Coal Company, Limited, or by any person or persons whomsoever. The court for the hearing of appeals from the assessments duly met for the hearing of such appeals in the County Court House, at Sydney, in the county of Cape Breton on the fourth Tuesday of January, 1902, and all appeals were duly heard, and all reductions and increases of assessments rendered necessary by the decision of the said court as well as all transfers of assessments from one person to another, and all other necessary changes, corrections, alterations and additions made by said court were duly written or minuted upon the assessment roll by the said municipal clerk in red ink in pursuance of the requirements of said section 48 of chapter 73.\n\"7. The assessment roll as finally passed by the said court was duly certified by the said clerk of the said municipality as so passed in pursuance of the provisions of section 61 of said chapter 73, and the said assessment roll as finally passed and certified as aforesaid was by the said clerk of the municipality laid before the Municipal Council for the said municipality at its next regular meeting, which meeting took place at Sydney aforesaid, commencing on Tuesday, the 6th day of May, 1902, and was the first annual meeting held by the said Municipal Council after the completion of said assessment roll as aforesaid.\n\"8. The said Municipal Council at said meeting duly made estimates of all sums which were required for the lawful purposes of the municipality for the then current year, making due allowance in such estimates for the abatements, losses and expenses which may occur in the collection of the taxes, and for taxes which may not be collected or collectable; and at said meeting, the said Municipal Council did duly authorize the levying and collection of a rate of so much on the dollar on the assessed value of the property and income assessed in the assessment roll as the Council deemed sufficient to raise the sum required to defray the expenses of the said municipality for the then current year including any deficiency from any preceding year pursuant to the requirements of section 125 of chapter 70 of the Revised Statutes, 1900. The rate so authorized as aforesaid was\u2014\u2014 on the dollar.\n\"9. The clerk of the said municipality as soon after the first day of April as the provisions of chapter 73 permitted, determined from the said assessment roll the municipal rate and poor rate, and did prepare a collection roll for each district in each municipality in pursuance of the requirements of section 71 of the said chaptre 73. The following are true and correct extracts from such collection rolls as aforesaid, and contain all matters relating to the property:\nName of District.\nValuation.\nPercentage for Municipal Rate.\nAmount of Municipal Rate.\nPer cent age of Poor Rate.\nAmount of Poor Rate.\nTotal Amount of Municipal and Poor Rate.\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nOld Bridgeport.\n30,000\n2 40\n720.00\n.21\n63.00\n783.00\nHillside.\n15,000\n2.04\n306.00\nnone.\nnone.\n306.00\nLouisburg\n16,000\n2.10\n336.00\n2.07\n11.20\n347.20\nBridgeport\n6,000\n2.20\n132.00\n.35\n21.00\n153.00\nPort Morien\n48,000\n2.08\n1000.00\nnone.\nnone.\n1000.00\nCatalone\n16,500\n2.00\n330.00\nnone.\nnone.\n330.00\nSydney Forks..

The said chapter 73 of the Revised Statutes, 1900, is a revision, classification and consolidation of said chapter 5 of the statutes of Nova Scotia for the year 1895, and such revision, classification and consolidation are contained in the report of the commissioners appointed to revise, classify and consolidate the public general statutes of Nova Scotia. Such report of the said commissioners was made in writing and not printed, and did not and does not contain in section 4, subsection (p), of said chapter 73, so revised, classified and consolidated as aforesaid, the word \"exempted.\" The said word was, however, written in lead pencil in the margin of the said report opposite said subsection with a mark of interrogation after it, by some person unknown, and not by any of the commissioners appointed to revise the said statutes. The said word \"exempted\" was not inserted in said report by any alteration or amendment made by said commissioners, but the said word \"exempted\" was printed erroneously and accidently.\n\"11. The Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, were duly brought into force on the first day of February, 1901, by virtue of a proclamation of the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia in Council, duly made and dated the 24th day of December, 1900, under and by virtue of the provisions of chapter 44 of the Acts of the Province of Nova Scotia for the vear 1900.\n\"12. The whole of the said report of said commissioners was printed pursuant to section 2 of said chapter 44 of the Acts of Nova Scotia for the year 1900; also the Acts and parts of Acts referred to in section 2 were incorporated with the chapters referred to in said section, and the amendments of said section referred to were made therein, and the schedule \"A\" referred to in said section amended accordingly. A printed roll of said chapters and amended schedule referred to in section 5 of said chapter 44 was duly attested under the signature of the Lieutenant-Governor and countersigned by the Provincial Secretary and deposited in the office of the Provincial Secretary pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of chapter 44, and after such deposit as aforesaid the Governor in Council duly made a proclamation hereinbefore referred to, which is contained in pages 3 to 5, inclusive, of volume 1 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, and is hereby referred to by the parties hereto and made a part of this case. The said printed roll contained said chapter 73; but sub-section (p) of section 4 thereof contained the following word, \"exempted,\" as will appear on reference to said chapter at page 621 of volume 1 of the said Revised Statutes, and the said chapter 73 as printed in said Revised Statutes is a true and correct copy of the roll so printed and deposited as aforesaid.\n\"13. By chapter 25 of the Acts of the Province of Nova Scotia for the year 1902, it is enacted that the said word \"exempted\" be stricken out of the said subsection (p) of section 4 of the said chapter 73 of the Revised Statutes of 1900, and said chapter 25 was passed on the 27th day of March, 1902.\n\"14. On the 17th of January, 1903, the solicitor for the Municipality of the county of Cape Breton received from the solicitors of the Dominion Iron & Steel Co. the following letter:\nThe Dominion Coal Company, Limited, has authorized us to state that, upon being shown the records of the various sections, that assessment was actually made af the right of way of the Sydney and Louisburg Railway, it will pay the amount assessed.\n\"In other words, if it is clear that the amount you state was actually assessed, the Company will give you a cheque immediately. \"It desires at the same time to point out that this county is the only county in the province to take advantage of what was well known to the whole country to be simply a slip of the Commissioners\u2014a slip which was rectified at the next session of the House\u2014and it also desires to state that in its opinion an unfair advantage has been taken of what is well known to the whole of Nova Scotia, including the Warden and Councillors of this county, as simply a printer's error.'\n\"And on the 14th of February, 1903, the solicitor of the said Municipality of the county of Cape Breton received from the solicitors of the Dominion Iron and Steel Co., the following letter:\n\"Re county assessment against Coal Company. Referring to the recent letter which I sent you, stating that the Dominion Coal Company would pay the amount of the claim of Cape Breton county for taxes. You remember that the Warden stated that he took the responsibility of saying that there was no mistake in having the word 'exempted' inserted in the clause (p) of section 4, chapter 73 R. S. I had reason to believe that there was a mistake, but I had nothing official, and I supposed that the Warden had received something official when he stated publicly that there was no mistake.\n\"Now I find that his authority was some legal gentleman in Halifax, who examined the original draft for him.\n\"I have a letter from Mr. F. H. Bell, one of the commissioners, who revised the statutes, and I enclose a copy of this letter. I am advised that Judge Graham, Hon. A. Drysdale and Mr. F. T. Congdon and Mr. A. A. McKay, will all subscribe to the statement contained therein. \"We, therefore, shall be obliged to ask the warden to recall this statement, which he made in public, and we are also obliged to recall the letter which we wrote to you.\n\"We shall be happy to agree on a case immediately to be submitted to the courts, if you care to follow the line we intended some time ago.\n\"Or you might formally seize an engine and we will replevy. Of course, if you propose to seize the engine, you will give us notice a few days ahead, so we can be ready with our bond to replevy the engine.'\n\"15. The engine, for the recovery of which this action has been brought, was duly seized and levied upon under a warrant of distress issued against the plaintiff and directed to the defendant, a collector, commanding him to levy upon the goods of the plaintiff a certain sum, and the said engine, at the time of such levy, was the property of the plaintiff. The said warrant was issued in respect of rates and taxes upon 'the property' for the year 1902, the liability for the payment of which is denied by the plaintiff.\n\"The question for the opinion of the court is whether 'the property' is exempted from taxation imposed under said assessment hereinbefore set out.\n\"If the court shall be of opinion in the affirmative, then judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff against the defendant for a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the said engine, and for plaintiff's costs of the action, including the costs of this special case to be taxed.\n\"If the court shall be of the opinion in the negative, then judgment shall be entered for the defendant against the plaintiff directing a return of the said engine to the defendant, the same having been seized by the sheriff of the County of Cape Breton under an order of replevin issued herein for the sum of $4,926.40 and for the defendant's costs of this action, including the costs of this special case, to be taxed.\n\"Dated at Sydney, this 2nd day of Nov., 1902.\nW. H. COVERT,\nSolicitor for plaintiff company.\nW. CROWE,\nSolicitor for defendant.\"\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held that the question of law submitted should be answered in the negative and that the property of the plaintiffs mentioned in the first paragraph of the special case was not exempted from taxation under the assessment set out therein. The plaintiffs appealed to this court.\nLovett for the appellants. The history of the Assessment Act may be inquired into. United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co.[1]; Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States[2].\nThe assessment roll may be looked at to see if the Act as printed agrees with it. Taff Vale Railway Co. v. Davis & Sons[3]; Carter v. Molsom[4].\nThe history of the Act shows that it was never intended to tax railways, and the construction put upon it by the court below would render the clause meaningless. Curtis v. Stovin[5]\nAssuming that the railway could be taxed, the tax was not imposed until the assessment roll was made up; Nicholls v. Cumming[6]; City of London v. Watt & Sons[7]; and when that was done the Act of 1902 was in force and the railway was exempt. Borden K.C. for the respondent. The printed roll is made the original by R. S. N. S. (1900) ch. 44 sec. 5.\nA mistake cannot be imputed to the legislature. Richards v. McBride[8]; Commissioners of Income Tax v. Pemsel[9].\nExempting Acts are to be strictly construed as involving taxation on the rest of the community. Maxwell on Statutes (3 ed.) p. 303. The People v. Commissioners of Taxes[10]; Henderson v. Township of Stisted[11].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and that judgment should be entered for appellants upon their action upon the ground that sec. 4 (p) of ch. 73 R. S. N. S. read in the light of the history of the legislation on the subject, exempts the engine in question from taxation.\nSedgewick, Davies and Killam JJ. concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Nesbitt.\nNesbitt J.\u2014I do not think it necessary to deal with any of the interesting questions raised by the appellant other than the short point that, assuming the legislation in question valid and the property liable to taxation from 1st February, 1901, to 27th March, 1902, the tax rate never was authorized until 6th May, after the Act had been passed exempting the property from taxation, and therefore no valid tax was imposed. There is no doubt that the Act passed on the 27th March, 1902, speaks only as to the future.\nThe judgment in the court below, after setting out sections 61-62 of the Assessment Act, failed to notice that by section 128 of the Municipal Act, being chapter 70 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1900, it is provided as follows:\n(1) The assessment roll for the municipality certified by the clerk shall be laid before the council at the first annual meeting after its completion.\n(2) The council shall make estimates of all sums which are required for the lawful purposes of the municipality for the then current year, making due allowance in such estimates for the abatement, losses and expenses which may occur in the collection of the taxes and for taxes which may not be collected or collectable; and the council shall authorize the levying and collection of a rate or rates of so much on the dollar on the assessed value of the property and income assessed in the roll as the council deems sufficient to raise the sum required to defray the expenses of the municipality for the then current year, including any deficiency from any preceding year. 1895, c. 3, s. 63, part.\nAnd we think that, until this section was complied with, the liability was not fixed. The saving clause, section 10 of the Interpretation Act, cannot, therefore, be appealed to, and I think that the appeal must be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.
