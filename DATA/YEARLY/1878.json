Grand Junction Railway Co., (1878) 1 S.C.R. 696\nDate: 1878\u201101\u201128\nEdward Oscar Bickford (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Grand Junction Railway Company (Defendant) Respondents.\n1877: June.\nPresent: The Chief Justice, and Ritchie, Strong, Taschereau, Fournier, and Henry, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nRailway Company\u2014Delivery of Railway iron\u2014Right of Property and Lien after contract of sale\u2014Power of Company to mortgage their road\u2014Doctrine of ultra vires.\nThe Grand Junction Railway Company, a corporate body, having the statutory power to borrow money, issue debentures, bonds, or other securities for the sum so borrowed, to sell, to hypothecate or pledge the lands, tolls, revenues and other property of the Company, and also power to purchase, hold and take any land or other property for the construction, maintenance, accommodation and use of the Railway, and to alienate, sell or dispose of the same, entered into a contract with one Brooks for the construction of their road. When Brooks required the iron necessary for the undertaking, he was unable to purchase it without the assistance of the Company, and he thereupon authorized the officers of the Company to negotiate for its purchase. In consequence, a Mr. Bell, solicitor of the Company, as agent of Brooks, and with the approval, in writing, of the President of the Company, entered into a written agreement, dated Toronto, 9th June, 1874, with the Defendants (Bickford and Cameron) for the purchase of the iron, which was to be paid for as delivered on the wharf at Belleville by the promissory notes of Brooks, and a credit of six months was to be given from the time of the several deliveries of the iron. By that agreement, also, Brooks agreed to obtain from the Railway Company an irrevocable power of attorney enabling the Bank of Montreal, who advanced to Bickford the money necessary for the purpose of buying the iron, to receive the government and municipal bonuses, and to procure from the Company a mortgage for $200,000 on that portion of their road (44 miles) on which the iron was to be laid\u2014the mortgage to be sufficient in law to create a lien on the 44 miles of railroad, as security for the due payment of the notes of the said Brooks, but not to contain a covenant for payment by the Company. On the 30th of June, 1874, a more formal agreement, under seal, was executed, which did not vary in any material respect the terms of the preceding agreement. On the same day a power of attorney (upon which was endorsed by Brooks a written request to the Company to give the said power of attorney), and a mortgage (upon which also was endorsed by Brooks a request to grant the said mortgage), were executed by the Company under their corporate seal to one Buchanan, then manager of the Bank of Montreal, in Toronto, as a trustee. The Bank of Montreal having made advances to Bickford in the ordinary course of their business dealings to enable him to purchase the iron, it was all consigned to their order by the Bills of Lading, and, when delivered on the wharf at Belleville, was held by the wharfingers subject to the order of the Bank, the whole quantity stipulated for by the contract being so delivered ready for laying on the track as required.\nThe Bank of Montreal and Bickford caused to be delivered, from time to time to Brooks by the wharfingers at Belleville, all the iron he required to lay on the track, being about 2,000 tons, and about an equal quantity remained on the wharf unused. Brooks having failed to meet his promissory notes for the price of the iron, Bickford recovered judgment at law against him to the amount of $164,852.96. The Bank then sold the iron remaining on the wharf for the purpose of realizing their lien, when Bickford became the purchaser thereof at $33.50 per ton for the rails and $50.50 for track supplies. Bickford was removing the said iron when the Company filed a Bill in Chancery asking for an injunction to restrain the removal of the iron. A motion to continue the injunction was refused on the 11th October, 1875. The Defendants (Bickford, Cameron and Buchanan) then answered the Bill, and on the 18th January, 1876, by consent, a decree was made referring it to the Master to take the mortgage account, to ascertain and state the amount due to Bickford and Cameron for iron laid or delivered to or for Plaintiff\u2019s use on the track, and also the amount due (if anything) in respect of iron delivered at Belleville, but since removed, and to report special circumstances, if requisite.\nThe Master found due upon the mortgage $46,841.10, the price of iron actually laid on the track, and interest; and that nothing was due in respect of the iron delivered at Belleville but subsequently removed. On appeal to Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot the Master\u2019s report was affirmed, and on an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, it was held that the mortgage was ultra vires, and the Master\u2019s report was affirmed.\nHeld: On appeal (reversing the judgment of the Court of Chancery) that the proviso in the mortgage was in its terms wide enough to sustain the contention of the mortgagee to claim the price of all the iron delivered on the wharf at Belleville, and that the memorandum endorsed by Brooks on the mortgage should not be construed as cutting down the terms of the proviso, but was intended as written evidence of Brooks\u2019 consent to the mortgage and to the loss of priority in respect of the mortgage bonds to be delivered to him under the contract.\nHeld, also: (reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario) that the statutory power to borrow money and secure loans, cannot be considered as implying that the Company\u2019s powers to mortgage are to be limited to that object; and therefore that the mortgage executed by the Company on a portion of their road in favor of the Trustee Buchanan, being given within the scope of the powers conferred upon the Company to \u201calienate, sell, or dispose\u201d of lands for the purpose of constructing and working a Railway, was not ultra vires.\nQuery? Whether the rights of a corporation to take lands, operating the Railway, taking tolls, &c., are susceptible of alienation by mortgage in this country?\nHeld, also: That under the Pleadings and Decree in the cause, the objection that the mortgage was ultra vires was not open to the Company in the Master\u2019s office, or on appeal from the Master\u2019s Report. Appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal brought by the Defendants, Bickford and Buchanan, from an order of Proudfoot, V.C., confirming the Master\u2019s report in a suit in the Court of Chancery.\nThe Respondents, on the 25th March, 1872, entered into a contract with Alphonso Brooks for the construction of the Grand Junction Railway from Belleville to Lindsay. He entered on the work, and had, in June, 1874, done grading and other work on the line to the value of $327,000, according to the certificates and estimates of Mr. Shanly, the Company\u2019s Engineer.\nThe contract provided for payment to Brooks at the rate of $19,000 per mile; being $6,000 in Government or municipal aid or cash, $1,000 in paid up stock, and $12,000 in first mortgage bonds of the Company.\nIn June, 1874, Brooks required the iron for at least part of the road to enable him to proceed with its construction, and being unable to purchase it without the assistance of the Company, he authorized the officers of the Company to negotiate for its purchase, and accordingly Mr. Bell, the Solicitor for the Company, having at the same time written authority from Brooks to act for him, and Mr. Kelso, the President of the Company, came to Toronto, and, on the 7th of June, 1874, entered into the written agreement with the Defendants, Bickford and Cameron, for the purchase of the iron rails and track supplies for the road from Belleville to Hastings, 44 miles, about 4,000 tons.\nOn the 30th of June, 1874, a formal contract, under seal, between Brooks and the Defendants, Bickford and Cameron, was executed, and the Respondents then executed in pursuance of the terms of the contract, a power of attorney and a mortgage deed, in favor of the defendant Buchanan, then the Manager of the Bank of Montreal in Toronto, the Defendant Bickford having arranged with the Bank to obtain advances of money from it to enable him to buy the iron to fulfil the said contract, and the said Buchanan being named as the trustee to receive and to hold the said securities under the said contract.\nBy the first agreement Bickford and Cameron agreed to sell to Brooks the iron rails required for the 44 miles already referred to, which were estimated at about 4,000 tons, and the fish\u2011plates, &c. The price of the rails was fixed at $47.50 per ton, and of the fish-plates, &c., at the rate of 4\u00bc cents per pound, \u201call delivered at the wharf at Belleville, free of duties; Brooks to pay wharfage and harbour dues (if any); a credit of six months to be allowed, but the notes of Brooks at three months to be given and to be renewed for three months, interest being added to all such notes at 7 per cent. per annum, to be given from time to time for the iron as delivered.\u201d Brooks also agreed to procure and give as collateral security for the notes, an irrevocable power of attorney, authorizing an officer of the Bank of Montreal to receive the Government and municipal bonuses; and to procure from the Company a mortgage for $200,000 on the 44 miles of railway to be executed, to an officer of the bank as collateral security for the notes to be given as the iron was to be delivered. The agreement contained the following stipulation: \u201cThe said mortgage from the Company to be sufficient in law to create a lien on the said 44 miles of railroad, as security for the due payment of the notes of the said Brooks, but not to contain a covenant for payment by the Company.\u201d The mortgage was to be the first and only first security or charge on the 44 miles. The Company\u2019s President gave a written approval of this agreement.\nThe agreement of the 30th June, 1874 which was a more formal document under seal, did not vary in any material respect the terms of the preceding agreement.\nThe power of attorney authorized Buchanan to receive the Government and municipal grants, and to this power a copy of the contract was annexed.\nUpon this document, Brooks indorsed a request to the Company, in the following terms: \u201cI, Alphonso Brooks, named within, hereby request the Grand Junction Railway Company to grant the within power of attorney to said Buchanan, within named, and I hereby covenant and agree with the said Company, that the granting said power or anything contained therein, shall not in any wise prejudice, affect, or waive, or vary any contract with the said Company for the construction of their railway; but the same shall in all respects continue valid, anything herein contained not with-standing.\u201d The mortgage, bearing date the same day, was executed by the Company under their corporate seal to Buchanan, by which, after reciting the contract for the purchase of the iron, and an agreement by the Company to execute the instrument as collateral security for the due payment of the notes to be given by Brooks for the price of the iron from time to time as it was delivered, which notes were to be received and held by the Bank of Montreal, the Company assumed to grant all the track and right of way and land taken and used by the Company, in and between the Town of Belleville and the Village of Hastings, with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto, and the franchise and powers of the railway between Belleville and Hastings, subject to defeasance upon payment of the promissory notes, which Brooks should give in pursuance of the contract of purchase, not exceeding in all a principal sum of $200,000. The mortgage is expressed to be made in pursuance of the Act respecting short forms of mortgages, and contains a proviso authorizing the mortgagee on default, on one month\u2019s notice, to enter upon and lease or sell the lands. It contains an express declaration of intention that it should operate as, and be a lien on, all that section of the Company\u2019s railway, to secure collaterally the payment of the notes referred to in the contract; and that in case of default, the mortgagee\u2019s sole recourse should be against the property included in the mortgage, and not against the Company for the amount of the consideration; and that it was not intended to give the mortgagee or the vendors any right of action against the Company in respect of the purchase money of the iron. Upon this is indorsed a written request by Brooks, exactly similar in effect to that previously extracted.\nThe shareholders in the Respondents\u2019 Company sanctioned the agreement, and authorized the execution of the mortgage.\nThe Appellant Bickford then promptly commenced the delivery of the iron on the wharf at Belleville, in pursuance of the contract, and ultimately delivered all that was required to complete the road to Hastings, being the quantity mentioned in the Master\u2019s Report. The laying of the iron on the track was needlessly delayed by Brooks, notwithstanding Bickford\u2019s urgency, as little or none of the iron had been laid at the beginning of November, 1875, although over 3,000 tons had then been delivered at Belleville, and it was evidently useless to deliver more during that season. Brooks was willing to dispense with the delivery of the remaining 1,000 tons at that time, but the Respondents refused to do so, and Bickford was compelled thereby, at a great and useless extra expense, to deliver the said 1,000 tons.\nThe Bank of Montreal, having made advances to the Appellant Bickford in the ordinary course of their business dealings with him, to enable him to purchase the said iron, it was all consigned to their order by the bills of lading, and when delivered on the wharf at Belleville was held by the wharfingers subject to the order of the Bank. This arrangement was known to the Respondents and contemplated at the time of the original agreement.\nBrooks gave his promissory notes, from time to time, for the price of the iron as delivered on the wharf at Belleville, in pursuance of the contract, and Bickford afterwards, on 8th September, 1875, recovered judgment at law against Brooks on these notes and for the balance then remaining due on the whole purchase money of iron delivered, being the sum of $164,852.96.\nThe Bank of Montreal and Bickford caused to be delivered to Brooks by the wharfingers at Belleville all the iron he required to lay on the track as fast as he required it, and were ready and willing to deliver the whole of it to him as he required it for that purpose, but he only laid about half the quantity delivered at Belleville, and ironed that part of the road from Belleville to Sterling, 20 miles, when in December, 1874, he stopped work on the road, and has never since done anything upon it.\nOn 3rd June, 1875, the Respondents cancelled and declared at an end Brooks\u2019 contract for building the road.\nThe Bank of Montreal collected, on account of the Appellant Bickford, the sum of $27,500 from the Municipal Aid Trustees, and $40,000 from the Government of Ontario under the power of attorney from the Respondents, which moneys have been credited on account of the price of the iron.\nIn the latter part of June, 1875, Bickford, with the assent of the Company, removed 563 tons of the iron from Belleville, and sold it to the Northern Railway Company.\nAs no arrangements had been made by the Respondents up to September, 1875, for going on with the work, the Bank of Montreal which had delayed any action up to that time, at the request of the Respondents, advertised for sale by auction at Belleville, on the 20th September, 1875, all the iron then remaining there unlaid, and on that day it was offered for public sale and knocked down to the Appellant Bickford at $33.50 for the rails, and $50.50 for track supplies, that being the full value thereof in June and September, 1875, as subsequently found by the Master. Bickford did not pay this price in money to the Bank, but having sold part of the iron to another Railway Company, he transferred to the Bank the moneys and securities obtained from that Company, and, in October, 1875, he removed 1,165 tons of the iron from Belleville to Port Stanley to carry out the last mentioned sale.\nAbout 495 tons of the iron rails and track supplies delivered on the wharf at Belleville under the contract with Brooks have never been removed and still remain there.\nSince the spring of 1875 no work of any kind has been done on the railway, and that part of it on which the iron was laid has never been used for traffic.\nThe Respondents filed their original Bill in Chancery on 2nd October, 1875, praying for a declaration that a large quantity of railroad iron (about 4,000 tons) had been delivered under the contract already mentioned, and that the Defendants in that suit were not entitled to remove the same, or that the said Plaintiffs (now Respondents) had acquired, by reason of having given certain securities to the Bank of Montreal, an interest in the iron, and for an injunction to restrain the removal thereof.\nAn injunction was thereupon obtained ex parte, restraining the Defendants therein named from removing the railway iron placed upon the wharves of the Plaintiffs at Belleville, until the 8th October, 1875, and until a motion to continue the injunction should be disposed of.\nThe motion to continue that injunction was, on the 11th October, 1875, refused.\nThe Defendants Bickford, Cameron, Buchanan and the Bank of Montreal, then answered the said Bill.\nIt does not appear that the Defendant Brooks, named as a party in the Bill, was ever served with it, and he never put in any answer, or appeared in any proceeding as a party to the suit.\nThe Defendants Bickford and the Bank of Montreal and Buchanan having, in January, 1876, caused the lands of the Plaintiffs to be advertised for sale, under the power of sale in the mortgage, the Plaintiffs amended their Bill, and prayed that it might be declared that the securities held by the Bank of Montreal and Buchanan had been fully satisfied, and for an injunction to restrain the sale of the said mortgaged premises, and gave notice of motion for an injunction accordingly.\nOn the 18th January, 1876, a decree by consent was made, referring it to the Master to take the mortgage account to ascertain and state the amount due for iron laid or delivered to or for the Plaintiff\u2019s use on the track, and also the amount due (if anything) in respect of iron delivered at Belleville, but since removed, and to report special circumstances if requisite; and it ordered payment of the amount found due, within thirty days after the making of the report, and that in default of such payment, the mortgagee should be at liberty to use all or any of his rights and remedies.\nOn the 9th February, 1876, the Master made his report, finding the amount due on the mortgage security to be $46,841.10 for iron laid or delivered, to or for the Plaintiffs\u2019 use, on the track of the railway, and finding nothing due on account of iron delivered at Belleville, but since removed, but reported specially that the Defendant Bickford had delivered on the wharf at Belleville 4,036 tons of rails and 295 tons of track supplies, of which 1,983 tons of rails and 144 tons of track supplies were delivered to Defendant Brooks for the use of Plaintiffs\u2019 railway, and 1,592 tons of rails, and 135 tons of track supplies were sold by Bickford to other parties and removed from Belleville, and 450 tons of rails, and ten tons of track supplies still remained on the wharves at Belleville, subject to the order of the Bank of Montreal.\nFrom that Report the Defendant Bickford appealed, and the appeal having been heard before Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, was, on the 15th March, 1876, dismissed for the reasons stated in the judgment of the learned Vice-Chancellor, and which will be hereinafter referred to in the judgment of the Court.\nThe Defendants Bickford and Buchanan then appealed to the Court of appeal for Ontario.\nThe Appeal having been argued, the Court of Appeal, by a preliminary judgment, directed it to be re-argued by one Counsel on each side. The case was re-argued, and on the 15th June, 1876, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, the judgment of the Court being delivered by Mr. Justice Moss.\nFrom that Judgment the Defendant Bickford appealed to the Supreme Court.\nMr. Hector Cameron, Q.C., for Appellant:\nThe consent decree in this case was for the purpose of getting a decision of the case made by the Respondents Bill as amended, and that could only be got at after \u201cascertaining the amount due on the mortgage for iron laid or delivered to or for the Plaintiffs\u2019 use on the track, and also the amount due (if anything) in respect of iron delivered at Belleville, but since removed.\u201d The Master, in taking the account of the moneys due to the Appellant under the mortgage, did not charge the Company with the price of the whole amount of iron delivered to the Company pursuant to the contract, giving credit to the Company for the amount realized by the sale mentioned in the pleadings, after default on the part of Brooks and the Company, but charged them only with the quantity actually laid on the track.\nOn appeal, Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot affirmed the report on the construction of the instruments. The Court of Appeal for Ontario held on appeal that the proper construction of the instruments would cover whatever Brooks owed the vendors for iron delivered on the wharf at Belleville, but that the Respondents had no power to pledge their road except for the iron laid down, and for that reason alone declared the report of the Master should be affirmed. The principal point, therefore, to be agreed before the Court is, whether the mortgage was ultra vires, and whether, under the pleadings and proceedings in the cause, it was open to the Respondents to raise on the appeal the contention that the mortgage was ultra vires.\nThe Bill does not in any way impeach the validity of the mortgage, but, on the contrary, affirms it, and by the original Bill claims, that by virtue of having given it, the Company had acquired an interest in the whole of the iron delivered, and a right to prevent the removal of that not laid, while, as amended, it seeks only to raise the question of the amount secured by the mortage and intended so to be, according to the proper construction of the instrument.\nThe Respondents cannot be allowed at the hearing in appeal to change their attitude and proceed as for the cancellation of an illegal instrument; in other words, they cannot \u201capprobate and reprobate,\u201d and a Bill so framed, would have been demurrable. Cawley v. Poole[1]; Stevens v. Guppy[2]; Rawlings v. Lambert[3].\nThe rule is that a Bill can only be filed against a mortgagee for the purpose of redeeming the mortgage. Rogers v. Lewis[4]; Harding v. Pingey[5].\nAnd after decree is pronounced, the accounts are to be taken simply on the footing of what is due under the terms of the mortgage. Kerby v. Kerby[6]; Pollock v. Perry[7].\nThe Bill is not one for relief from a void or illegal transaction on equitable terms, and contains no sufficient submission to such terms as the Court might think fit to impose, without which relief will not be granted. The offer to pay what, if anything, shall appear to be due, upon taking the accounts, is based only on the allegation that the amount secured by a valid mortgage had been paid. See Parker v. Alcock[8]; Jervis v. Berridge[9]; Athen\u0153um Life Assurance Co. v. Pooley[10]; Re Cork & Youghal R.W. Co.[11]; Re Durham County Building Society[12]; Brice on Ultra Vires[13].\nUnder the decree, it is not open to the Respondents to contend that the mortgage is ultra vires, or that the amount due on it should be reduced to the value of the iron actually laid on the road.\nThe very fact of taking an account on a mortgage before the Master affirms the validity of the mortgage.\nThe case of Penn v. Lockwood[14] relied on by Respondents is not an authority to the contrary, and if it be, it is not supported by principle or the practice of the Court.\nIn Equity, on taking the account under a mortgage in the Master\u2019s office, the amount really advanced under the security was always a matter of proof, and nothing more was done in Penn v. Lockwood than enquire as to this point.\nThat was a foreclosure suit, and the mortgagor was Defendant, whereas here the Respondents, the mortgagors, were Plaintiffs, and not only do not question the validity of the mortgage by their Bill or by the consent decree, but actually affirm it.\nCorporations should not be allowed to set up their incapacity whenever it is inconvenient for them to carry out their engagements. See Brice on Ultra Vires[15], and cases there referred to. Nor do the other cases relied upon by the Respondents, in support of their contention that the Company are entitled at any stage to set up the invalidity of the mortgage, apply. All they go to show is, that in appeal, you can urge a new argument, but not a new ground.\nThe Respondents cannot repudiate their own act, solemnly executed by deed of which they have got the benefit, unless, at any rate, by a substantive proceeding for that purpose, supported by proper allegations and evidence.\nScott v. Colburn[16]; Anglo-Australian Ass. Co. v. British Prov. Ass. Co.[17]; In re Electric Telegraph Co. of Ireland; Troup\u2019s case[18].\nThe mortgage in question is a valid security, and within the power of the Respondents to make.\nNow the Court of Appeal, although they admit the power to mortgage for securing the price of the iron laid down, yet hold the mortgage to be ultra vires because it was not made to secure a loan of money under s. 9, ss. 11, of the Railway Act, and was given on a part of the line only, and that even if the Company had power to make such a mortgage as security for a debt, there was no debt of the Company to be secured, Brooks being the debtor and this mortgage being given as collateral security that he would pay.\nThe validity of the mortgage connot depend on the proper application to the use and benefit of the Company of money or property acquired on the faith of a mortgage given by the Company.\nIf this Company had power to mortgage to secure the value of iron delivered at Belleville for the use of their Railway, provided that iron were laid on their track, they cannot be relieved from liability or their mortgage be held void because their contractor failed and neglected to lay it by his own default.\nRe Contract Corporation & Vale Co.[19]\nThe following cases show, beyond a doubt, that the power to mortgage specially given by the Railway Act does not exclude the power to mortgage for a purpose within the object of the Company\u2019s incorporation.\nTaylor v. Chichester & Sandhurst Railway Co.[20]; Australian S.S. Co. v. Mounsey[21]; Gibbs & West\u2019s Case, Re International Insurance Co.[22]; Re Patent File Co., ex parte Birmingham Banking Co.[23]; Green\u2019s American edition of Brice, p. 127, and the American cases there cited; Allen v. Montgomery Railway Co.[24]; Mobile & Cedar Point R.R. v. Salmon[25]; Riche v. Ashbury Railway Carriage Co.[26]; Shrewsbury & Birmingham Railway Company v. North Western Railway Company[27]; 2 Redfield on Railways,[28].\nThe power given by sub-sec. 2 of sec. 9, ch. 66 Con. Stats, of Canada, to a Railway Company to \u201calienate, sell and dispose of land, for the purposes of their road, clearly includes a power to mortgage.\u201d The Respondents wanted the iron for their road, and being practically the buyers of the iron, they had power to give the mortgage to secure the price without express legislative authority. Brice on Ultra Vires[29].\nThe power to mortgage in order to carry out the purposes of the incorporation, will not be taken away by implication. Maxwell on Statutes[30]; Angell & Ames on Corporations[31]. The Appellant does not raise any question of franchise in this case, but contends that although this mortgage may be ineffectual to pass the franchise of the Company, it is nevertheless valid to pass the property. The Legislature might, however, recognize a sale or foreclosure of the property under the mortgage and reserve the franchise in favor of the mortgagor. See Ontario Act, 38 Vic. c. 47, sec. 7 and 8.\nGreen\u2019s Brice, page 125, and American cases cited there.\nAppellant also contends that this Company is not now, and never has been, a completed Railway used by the public, but is merely some land acquired by the Company, (with no evidence that any of it has been taken under the compulsory powers of the Act) on which land the iron of the Appellant has been laid under an express agreement, that he should have a lien upon it, until the price of the iron delivered for the use of the Company to be laid on their land, is paid for in full, which agreement the Company now seek to repudiate. The arguments based on the rights of the public do not apply to such a case. Greenstreet v. Pans[32]; Angell & Ames on Corporations[33].\nThe argument against the validity of the mortgage resting on the consequences of a foreclosure, sale or ejectment, would equally apply against the validity of a mortgage expressly authorized on a loan of money under the Railway Act. The question is not however, what remedy has a mortgagee, but is the mortgage a valid charge on the property of the Company. 2 Redfield on Railways[34]; Mississippi and Missouri Railroad Company v. Howard[35]; Madison, &c. Ry., v. Norwich Savings Society[36]; East Boston Freight R.R. Co. v. Eastern R. Co.[37]; Bardstown and L.R.R. Co. v. Metcalfe[38].\nThe fact that there is no covenant by the Company to pay the money secured by the mortgage cannot render it invalid as a charge on the land, and there is no evidence of any improper reason or intention for the omission of the covenant. See Benjamin on Sales[39].\nThe Appellant also submits that as a matter of law, the Appellant, as vendor, either directly or through the Bank of Montreal, had the right and power to remove any part of the iron unlaid on the track, without rescinding the contract of sale, and was only bound to give credit on the contract price for the value at the time of the removal of the iron so removed. Benjamin on Sales[40]; Page v. Cowasjee[41].\nAs a matter of fact he has sustained a loss of $14.00 per ton on the iron so removed. The question is, who is to bear the loss; the Appellant, who, it is admitted, fully performed his part of the contract, or the Company.\nMr. J. Bethune, Q.C, for Respondents:\u2014\nThe power of attorney and mortgage, given at the request of Brooks, carefully provide that they shall not prejudice, alter or affect the contract between the Company and Brooks, which show that the Company did not mean to undertake any greater liability to Bickford than they were under to Brooks, and that they would not be liable to pay more than might be coming to Brooks, nor until the terms on which it was payable were complied with. Greater regard is to be paid to the intention than to the precise words. Raymond v. Roberts[42]; Strong v. Barnes[43]; Rogers v. Kneeland[44]; Makepeace v. Harvard College[45]; Morss v. Salisbury[46]; Sawyer v. Hammott[47], Ford v. Beech[48].\nRespondents submit that the contract, the power of attorney and endorsement, as also the mortgage and the endorsement on it, must be read and construed together.\nThe effect of the transaction was an equitable assignment to Bickford & Cameron, or for their benefit of what might become due to Brooks, and nothing more. It is not reasonable to suppose that the Company would consent to become liable for iron they were not certain of being laid on their track, or that it was intended that the mortgage would be considered as a security for iron to be in Bickford\u2019s power to remove. Moreover, the Company, not having power to mortgage the property of the Company, except to secure the payment of moneys borrowed to make or maintain the road, the mortgage in question is and was ultra vires and void.\nRespondents are entitled at any stage to urge arguments to sustain a judgment in their favour, and their right to contend that the mortgage was ultra vires, though no such contention was made in the Master\u2019s office, cannot be denied. It is, moreover, a legal question arising on the very face of the instrument. Fitzmaurire v. Bayley[49]; Withy v. Mangles[50]; Bain v. Whitehaven and Furness Junction Ry. Co.[51]; Misa v. Currie[52]. The question of ultra vires was raised merely in order to reduce the amount due under the mortgage, and not to destroy it altogether; and the Company were therefore entitled to urge that point, though not raised by the pleadings. The case of Penn v. Lockwood[53], is an authority for such a practice.\nAlso, by referring to the decree, there seems, as Mr. Justice Moss says in his judgment, \u201cto be a special reason for holding that the point might be taken under the decree. What was the real controversy between the parties? Undoubtedly that of the Company\u2019s liability in respect of the iron delivered at Belleville, but not placed in the road. The decree contains an express reference to find \u2018the amount due (if anything) in respect of iron delivered at Belleville, but since removed.\u2019 Due by whom or in what manner? It must mean upon the security of the mortgage, because the Company had excluded, by the instrument itself, any other kind of liability.\u201d\nFurther, the Company, while asserting the invalidity of the mortgage, sought relief from the Court upon the usual conditions imposed in such cases by the Court, of paying for the benefits received by them from the transaction. See Athen\u0153um Life Assurance Co. v. Pooley[54]; Re Cork and Youghal Ry. W. Co.[55]; these are cases which prove that this condition of relief may be imposed in Chancery.\nAs to the power of mortgaging its corporate property, Respondent contends that it is not a power incident to a Railway corporation, and can only be conferred upon it by express legislative enactment.\nCommonwealth v. Smith[56]; Hendee v. Pinkerton[57]. By Con. Stat. Can., cap. 66, sec. 9, sub.-sec. 11, power is given to Railway corporations to borrow such sums of money as may be expedient for completing, maintaining and working the Railway, and to mortgage or pledge the lands, tolls, revenues, and other property of the Company, for the due payment of the said sums and interest thereon.\nThe Legislature, having expressly given the power to mortgage under certain circumstances, has thereby excluded the right to mortgage under other circumstances.\nWhere the intention of the Legislature, express or implied, appears to be that a corporation shall not enter into a particular contract, every Court, whether of law or equity, is bound to treat a contract entered into contrary to the enactment as illegal, and therefore wholly void.\nRiche v. Ashbury Railway Carriage Company[58]; Shrewsbury & B.R.W. CO. v. North Western Railway Co. & S.U. Ry. & Car. Co.[59]; South Yorkshire Ry. & R.D. Co. v. Northern Ry.[60].\nThe intention of the Legislature seems to have been that a mortgage might be given to secure a debt due by the Company, and for satisfaction of which the shareholders might be compelled to pay the amounts they had subscribed; that such a mortgage should be given upon the whole property of the road as a going concern.\nThe mortgage in question was given upon a portion of the road only, and was not given to secure repayment of moneys borrowed by the Company.\nEven if the Company had power to make such a mortgage as security for a debt, there was no debt of the Company to be secured. The mortgage in question was simply given as collateral security for the payment by Brooks to Bickford of any liability of the former under his contract with the latter, and was therefore beyond the power of the Company, and invalid.\nThere was no liability of the Company for satisfaction of which the shareholders might have been compelled to pay the amounts they had subscribed. On the contrary, the mortgage in question contains an express declaration of intention that it should operate as, and be a lien upon, the section of Railway covered thereby to secure collaterally the payment of the notes referred to in the contract, and that in case of default the sole recourse of the mortgagee should be against the property included in the mortgage, and not against the Company.\nIf the money had actually gone into the road, the mortgage would come within the meaning of sec. 9, sub.-sec. 11, but if the mortgage is for money or iron, as in this case, which has not gone to build the road, it should be declared void. The American cases cited by the Appellant\u2019s counsel cannot apply, as each State has its own legislation. The following cases show that a different policy is adopted in the various States. The Bridgeport City v. The Empire Stone Dressing Company[61]. The Bank of Genesee v. The Patchins Bank[62].\nAs to the rights of the mortgagees the Respondent refers to the following cases: Galt v. The Erie & Niagara Railway Company[63]; Peto v. The Welland Railway Company[64]; The Corporation of the County of Welland v. The Buffalo & Lake Erie Railway Company[65]; and also to the Common Pleas case of Galt v. The Erie and Niagara Railway Company[66]. In concluding, Respondent submits that the moment the case was referred to the Master on a consent decree, he is not confined to the facts in the Bill. The case of Kerby v. Kerby[67] supports this view. Whether the objection that the mortgage was ultra vires, not having been raised in the Master\u2019s office, could be taken on appeal, is, in fact, a point of practice decided by the Court of Appeal, and this Court is generally supposed not to reverse the finding of the Court of Appeal on a question of procedure and practice, and should not declare the matter not to be properly before the Master.\nMr. Cameron, Q.C., in reply:\u2014\nThis is not merely a question of practice in the Master\u2019s office, but one of pleading and legal principle.\nIt is said the effect of endorsement was to limit the Company\u2019s liability to what they might owe Brooks. If so construed, it would actually destroy the value of the mortgage, whilst, in fact, the consideration was for the iron Appellant would deliver at Belleville for the use of the Company. Bickford never guaranteed that the iron would be laid on the track.\nJUNE 4th, 1878.\nThe Court ordered a re-hearing on the following points:\u2014\n1st. As to the effect of the provision in the agreement between Brooks and Bickford that the vendors, should retain their lien and ownership of the iron until laid on the track. 2nd. Supposing the mortgage valid, what was its effect upon the property of a Railway never a going concern?\nMr. Hector Cameron, Q.C.:\u2014\nThe contract was an executory contract. When the iron was delivered on the wharf at Belleville, it became an executed contract on the part of the vendor, and when vendee gave his notes it was an executed contract on the part of the vendee. The Bank, however, had a perfect right to retain the jus disponendi, and, as stated in Benjamin on Sales, sec. 794, the Bank had a special property analagous to that of a pawnee, and when the purchaser was and continued in default the Bank had a perfect right to sell the property. See Ogg v. Shuter[68].\nIt was never intended the property should pass to Brooks, so that it might be seized for Brooks\u2019 debt. It was, moreover, at the Company\u2019s express demand that all the iron was delivered; and the moment a loss was incurred by Brooks\u2019 default, the Company became liable, under their mortgage, for the damages suffered, that is the difference between the contract price and the market value on a re-sale[69].\nAs to the effect of the mortgage, when the Legislature gives the right to a Company to mortgage for a special purpose, there is no reason why their land and property should not pass. Our Courts and Legislature have sanctioned the entire foreclosure of a railway under a mortgage. In any case this mortgage is certainly valid as to lands not compulsorily taken, and there is no evidence that any lands were so taken. Brice on Ultra Vires,[70].\nMr. Bethune, Q.C.:\u2014\nThe property never passed, and the intention was to always give to the Bank an independent ownership which cannot be said to have ever been transferred to Brooks. See Benjamin on Sales[71]; Hilliard on Sales[72]; Parson on Promissory Notes,[73]; Stevens v. Wilkinson[74].\nBrooks\u2019 notes were given for property which never passed, and the Company cannot be said to have ever intended to become responsible for damages. This is clearly shown by the words of the proviso.\nAs to the second point, the clear intention of the Legislature was that a company might execute a mortgage for the purpose of completing, working and maintaining, not or maintaining the railway.\nThe mortgage only seems incident to the mere issuing of the debentures. If you can treat this mortgage as a mortgage of so much land, the result would be that the road would be stopped by getting a specific mortgage on one part of the road. The object of the charter was to have a perpetual running road, and the power of mortgaging is only given by Statute in a modified way, for there is no power of winding up given to the Company.\nMr. Cameron, Q.C., in reply:\u2014\nHow the mortgage may be enforced is not in dispute here. If the power of mortgaging were not given, no Railroad Company in Canada could ever build a railway. There are many reasons why Railroad Companies in this country should be given the power to mortgage what in England it would be illegal to mortgage. In this country railways are often built by the aid of large tracts of land, and surely the power to mortgage them must have been intended to be given by the Legislature.\nJANUARY 28th, 1878.\nSTRONG, J., delivered the Judgment of the Court.\nThe judgment of the learned Vice-Chancellor, on the appeal from the Master\u2019s Report, proceeded upon the ground that the liability of the Railway Company under their mortgage was to be subject to the state of the accounts between Brooks and the Company, and that they were not to be liable to the Bank to any greater amount than that in which they should be found indebted to Brooks under the contract of the 25th of March, 1872. This restriction of the mortgage to a mere subrogation to the rights of Brooks against the Company was, in the opinion of the Vice-Chancellor, the proper construction of the agreement, power of attorney, mortgage and memorandum endorsed, all read together. We are unable to concur in this view, and, we think, the true answer to it has been given, by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in his judgment. The memorandum endorsed is not to be construed as cutting down the terms of the proviso in the mortgage deed, by the stipulation that the contract was not to be varied, but was intended to conserve written evidence of Brooks\u2019 consent to the mortgage and to the loss of priority in respect of the mortgage bonds to be delivered to him under the contract, which the mortgage would, of course, have taken precedence of.\nAll the surrounding circumstances point to this as the natural construction, and it is no strain upon the words of the memorandum itself so to interpret it. This reading makes the memorandum consistent with the sealed agreement; the restrictive interpretation adopted by the Vice-Chancellor would give rise to a conflict of meaning between the memorandum and the agreement, both executed on the same day. It is needless to dwell further on this point, for we entirely adopt the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice on this part of the case.\nThe objection that promissory notes, secured by the mortgage, were only to be given by Brooks and Bickford, under the agreement, as the iron was delivered into Brooks\u2019 possession, to be laid on the railway, and not when the iron was delivered at Belleville, is also, in our opinion, correctly answered by the judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal. The first informal memorandum of agreement, that of the 9th of June, 1874, made between Brooks and Bickford and Cameron, makes it clear that what was then intended was that the notes should be given on the delivery on the wharf at Belleville, for it contains these words \u201call delivered on the wharf at Belleville free of duties, the said Brooks to pay wharfage and harbour dues (if any), a credit of six months to be allowed, but the notes of the said Brooks at three months to be given and to be renewed for three months, interest being added to all such notes, at 7 per cent per annum, to be given from time to time as delivered.\u201d This was the agreement of which the contract under seal of the 30th June was intended to be a more formal expression. The argument in support of this contention, founded on the provision that the mortgage was to stand as a security only for the balance uncovered by the bonuses, and Government grant, which were not payable until the iron was laid, is, as the Chief Justice demonstrates, sufficiently refuted by the terms of the agreement \u201cand all moneys received from such bonuses and aid to be credited on the amount secured by said mortgage.\u201d We are at a loss to see that Brooks\u2019 covenant with Bickford to proceed with diligence in laying the track has any bearing on the point. This objection, therefore, also fails; it was indeed but faintly pressed in argument here.\nThe objection that the mortgage ought not to be considered as a security for the iron removed by Bickford, appeared at first more serious than either of those before alluded to. The agreement for the sale of the iron was, of course, a mere executory agreement, not amounting to a bargain and sale of specific chattels, but so soon as the iron was deposited on the wharf it became appropriated to the purposes of the agreement, and, if no contrary intention had been expressed in the contract, the property would have passed to Brooks, the vendors retaining merely a lien until the time arrived for laying the iron on the railway, and it was delivered to Brooks for that purpose.\nThe contract, however, did control the passing of the property, for it contains this stipulation in favor of the vendors:\u2014\u201cThe said vendors to hold their lien and ownership on the iron until laid down on the track, when the several grants and bonuses are payable.\u201d In the face of this provision no property passed, unless the word \u201cownership\u201d is to be read otherwise than in its primary meaning, a construction there is no ground for. The law on this subject is clear. On an agreement for the sale of chattels ascertained at the time of the contract, or afterwards specifically appropriated to the purposes of the contract, the property ordinarily passes at the time of sale or as soon as the appropriation takes place, but this is only a presumption of intention, which may be controlled by the express provision of the parties. In the present case the parties have clearly expressed their intention, that the property should not pass to the vendee, until it was delivered to him to be laid upon the railway. The case of Page v Cowasjee[75], referred to in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, is therefore inapplicable. It was argued that the removal of the iron constituted a failure of the consideration of the notes pro tanto which could have been set up in defence to an action on the notes, and that if the whole price had been paid, a proportion could have been recovered back in an action for money had and received. The case, however, being that it was too late to set up the failure of consideration, as judgment had been recovered whilst the money had not been paid, a Court of Equity would, it was suggested, restrain execution on the judgment, in order to obviate the needless circuity of first paying the money, and then suing for its recovery; in other words, it would be inequitable to enforce execution under such circumstances.\nWe are of opinion, however, that this contention is not entitled to prevail, inasmuch as the consideration for the promissory notes was the vendors\u2019 covenant contained in the sealed contract of the 30th June, 1874, as distinguished from the performance of that covenant, and, as this covenant was partly performed by the delivery at Belleville, that is, performed as far as the vendors could perform it, there was not such an entire failure of consideration as would have entitled Brooks, if the money had been actually paid, to recover back, in an action for money had and received, an amount equal to the proportion of the price paid for the iron removed. The recovery of that money would not have left the parties in statu quo, and therefore the purchasers\u2019 remedy would be a cross action on the agreement. The rights of the parties would be therefore properly adjusted, in taking the mortgage account, by charging the full amount of the promissory notes against the mortgagor, and then, under the general direction to make just allowances, deducting the reduced value of the iron at the time of its removal.\nThe question which next arises relates to the jurisdiction of the Master, to whom the reference was made by the decree, to entertain the question of the validity of the mortgage. In point of fact, at least as far as we can see on the face of the record, that point was not raised before the Master, but this can make no difference, for it was quite competent to the Court below to consider any objection which could have been set up in the Master\u2019s office. It has been objected that this is a point of practice on which this Court, as an appellate jurisdiction, should not disturb the decision of the Court below; but, without conceding that this objection has any force, it must be remembered that the decision appealed from is not that of the Court of Chancery, which is the Court whose practice is in question, but of the Court of Appeal, before which the point was discussed for the first time. However, we do not consider that any authority would warrant us in declining to review the judgment of the Court below on this head, for the single reason that it is not confined to a mere question of discretion, or even a pure point of practice, but involves the decision of a very substantial question\u2014one going to the very merits of the cause\u2014the proper construction and effect of the terms of compromise which the parties had agreed to and had embodied in the decree. The general practice of the Court of Chancery of Ontario, according in this respect with that which prevailed in England before the abolition there of the office of Master, is, that a question such as this, the invalidity of a mortgage deed, should be raised by the pleadings and adjudicated on by the Court at the hearing of the cause. We can find no exception to this cardinal rule of equity procedure save in some few respects, where the general orders of the Court of Chancery in Ontario have authorized the Master to deal with matters of account which formerly required special directions in the decree, and which have no relation to the present case. If the doctrine of the Court of Appeal were to prevail, it is hard to suppose any case in which the Master, under a reference to take the account in a mortgage suit, might not assume the jurisdiction to decide on the validity of the mortgage deed. If the mortgagors are to be at liberty to say in the Master\u2019s office, there is nothing due on this mortgage deed, because it was beyond the powers of the Respondents as a corporation to make it, why should they not also be heard to say, there is nothing due because the deed was obtained by fraud? Unless some arbitrary line is to be drawn, the right of the Master, under such a reference, to enquire into the validity of the deed would, according to the doctrine of the Court below, be coextensive with that of the Court at the hearing, em- bracing every case in which, a mortgage might be impeached upon a ground which would have entitled the mortgagor to have had it wholly set aside by decree or to have had the mortgagee\u2019s bill for foreclosure dismissed. We know of no authority for any such delegation of the functions of the Court to the Master. The case of Penn v. Lockwood[76] has been relied upon as an authority for such a mode of procedure, but we are unable to see that it has any application. That was a case, in which, under a former practice of the Court of Chancery in Upper Canada, the Defendant, having made default in answering the Bill in a foreclosure suit, a decree was issued on pr\u00e6cipe, as of course, from the Registrar\u2019s office without any judicial intervention. The terms of the decree were those appropriate to a foreclosure suit directing the Master to take the usual accounts. This was at a time long anterior to the repeal of the usury laws. On proceeding with the account in the Master\u2019s office it appeared that the mortgage had been given to secure a loan of money, but that it covered an amount in excess of the money actually advanced and legal interest, whereupon the Master reported the actual loan with interest at six per cent. alone, as the amount due, disallowing to the mortgagee the illegal interest. This was the only course the Master could have pursued; strictly confining himself to the account, he enquired into the consideration for the mortgage, and finding that the amount secured on its face comprised usurious interest, he disallowed it; if he had proceeded otherwise and taken the amount secured as the true mortgage debt, he would have unjustly charged the mortgagor with money which was not recoverable. If the principle which the Court of Appeal have applied in this case had been acted on in Penn v. Lockwood, the Master would have found that the mortgage being illegal nothing was due, for it was only in suits for redemption, where the mortgagor asked the aid of the Court, that the payment of principal and legal interest was imposed as a conditional term of relief; in forclosure suits the Court, if usury were proved, dismissed the Bill. The practice of imposing such terms in redemption suits was an exception to the well established general rule that the measure of a party\u2019s equities is the same in all cases without regard to his position on the record as Plaintiff or Defendant. Hanson v. Keating[77]; Gibson v. Goldsmid[78]. Had the Master in Penn v. Lockwood gone to the extent which the Court below have gone in the present case, he must have found that the mortgage was wholly void, and have reported that nothing was due in respect of it. Therefore, for the reason alone that the principle on which the Court of Appeal proceeded was at variance with the established practice, and that no authority has been cited in support of the decision but the case of Penn v. Lockwood, which is distinguishable on the ground that the Master was there dealing with the account, and so within the limits of his jurisdiction, we should be prepared to reverse the order under appeal.\nThere is, however, the further objection that the terms of the decree in the present case, read and considered in connection with the proceedings in the cause, and with what had taken place between the parties excluded any such power in the Master.\nAt the date of the consent decree, the Respondents had amended their Bill, and given notice of motion for an injunction to restrain the sale under the power in the mortgage, upon the ground that having regard to the fact that a portion of the iron had, as already mentioned, been removed and sold by Bickford, the mortgage was a satisfied security. Whilst this motion was pending the parties agreed to terms of compromise, which the decree in question was intended to carry out. The first clause of the decree directs the Master to ascertain and state the amount due on the mortgage security in the Bill mentioned, and to find the amount due for iron laid or delivered to or for the Plaintiffs\u2019 use on the track, and also the amount due (if anything) in respect of iron delivered at Belleville, but since removed, and to report special circumstances if requisite. The object obviously being to get a decision, under this consent decree, of the case made by the last amendment to the Bill\u2014namely, that the Appellants were not entitled to recover for the iron removed, the only point remaining in dispute, a decision which, as involving matter of account, could be more conveniently arrived at on an appeal from the Master than on a motion for the injunction. If, therefore, the general rule of practice had warranted the setting up of the defence of illegality in the Master\u2019s office for the first time, we should have thought that this decree, having regard to its peculiar wording and to the circumstances under which it was made, ought to be construed as excluding any enquiries but those specifically mentioned in it.\nWe have also to differ from the learned Judges of the Court below in the opinion which they formed as to the validity of the mortgage. The objection to it, which has been sustained by the Court of Appeal, is that it was beyond the powers of the Railway Company to create such a security. It cannot be success- fully contended, in the face of many decisions to the contrary, both in England and America, of Courts of the highest authority, that a statutory corporation is incapable of mortgaging its property, unless its incapacity to do so is either expressly declared, or is to be gathered by implication from the terms of the Act of Incorporation. In other words, no enabling power is requisite to confer the authority to mortgage, but prim\u00e2 facie every corporation must be taken to possess it. Ashbury Carriage Co. v. Riche[79]; Re Patent File Company[80]; Scott v. Colbourn[81]; McCormack v. Perry[82]; Pennock v. Coe[83]; Dunham v. Railway[84]; Galveston Railway Co. v. Cowdry[85]; Australian Steamship Co. v. Mounsay[86]. If its rights in this respect are limited, it must be by force of some disability imposed by the instrument creating it, whether that instrument be a Statute or a Royal Charter; and such a disability may be deduced either from the object of the corporation being limited to certain specific objects, or from its property being subject to charges or trusts in favor of the public with which a mortgage would be inconsistent. The deed of charge in question in the present case, purports to give, in security for the payment of iron to be used in the construction of the Respondent\u2019s railway, all the lands of the Company, as well as its franchises and powers. The Act of Incorporation, which creates the Company and authorizes the construction of the railway, neither confers upon nor takes away from the Company the power to mortgage its lands or other property. It incorporates with it, however, the provisions of the General Railway Act[87], including that contained in section 9 sub-section 11 of that Act which authorizes the Company to borrow money, issue debentures, and to mortgage the lands, tolls, revenues and other property of the Company for the payment of such loans and debentures, and also that contained in section 9 sub-section 2, giving the Company authority to \u201calienate, sell and dispose of lands acquired for the construction, maintenance and accommodation of the Railway.\u201d The power to borrow money and secure the loans cannot, we think, be considered as implying that the Company\u2019s powers to mortgage are to be limited to that object, but it indicates that, in the view of the Legislature, borrowing money was not so obviously within the necessary general powers of the Company as to be considered as conferred without express words. Another reason for not attributing any such effect to the express power to mortgage just referred to is this: at the date of the passing of the original Railway Act, from which the clause in question in the Consolidated Act has been taken, the usury laws were in force, and this section gives authority to borrow at the rate of eight per cent. interest. Again, it is not merely a power to mortgage to secure loans which is created by the section in question, but it authorizes the borrowing on debentures which are to be secured by mortgage. Further, it empowers the Company to \u201chypothecate, mortgage, and pledge\u201d not merely its lands, but also its tolls, revenues and other property; thus giving enlarged powers as to the property which may be subjected to the mortgage. It seems to us, therefore, out of the question to say that this sub-section can either be construed so as to exclude the general power of the Company incidental to its existence as a corporation to deal with its property by way of mortgage, or, that it can have any restrictive influence on the express powers conferred by sub-section 2 of section 9 of the same Act.\nThe next enquiry must be, if this mortgage was within the scope of the powers conferred upon the Company to construct and work a railway. In other words, was it given for a purpose tending to effect the objects for which the Company was called into existence? The iron rails, for the price of which the mortgage in question was actually given, were indispensable to enable the Company to carry out its undertaking. This iron the Company might, if they had so chosen, have purchased directly from the vendors. It was found more convenient, however, to make a contract for the construction of the railway, by which the contractor undertook to furnish the iron. There was nothing, however, in the circumstance that the construction and completion of the line of railway had been made the subject of contract, which took away from the Company the power which they originally possessed of purchasing iron, and, if they thought fit, of securing the payment of the price upon any property which, in other respects, they were free to give as security. Then, on what principle could it be suggested that having this power of purchasing iron directly and giving security for the price, the Company were disabled from mortgaging their property as a collateral security in aid of their contractor. This, it must be borne in mind, does not concern the powers of the directors merely, but it is a question of the powers of the corporation itself in its dealings with strangers. The answer to the enquiry before made seems included in this statement of the powers of the Company. They have power under the general law of corporations to mortgage for any purpose in furtherance of the object of incorporation; the object of the incorporation being the construction of a railway for which iron rails were absolutely requisite, they had power to give a mortgage to secure the price of rails, and they have done no more than that in the present case. That they have given the mortgage as sureties for the contractor, and not as the direct purchasers of the iron, can make no difference; indirectly, they having given it to secure the price of the rails, and the secondary liability, to which they have subjected their property, is as much in furtherance of their undertaking as if no contractor had been interposed between them and the Appellants; in short, the Company were, in effect, the sub-purchasers from Brooks of the iron which the latter had purchased from the Appellants, and in order to obtain the property instead of paying money, they gave the mortgage to secure the original price.\nHad the mortgage been given for any object foreign to or inconsistent with the purposes of of the incorporation, then, no doubt, it would have been ultra vires of the Company. A familiar instance of a Railway Company exceeding the limits of its undertaking, is afforded by a well known case, in which such a corporation added to its legitimate business that of a line of steamships. Had this mortgage been given in aid or furtherance of any similarly unauthorized enterprise, it would, of course, have been ultra vires, but it is manifest that such was not the case here, and that the sole object of the corporation was to attain the end for which it had been created. There remains the further enquiry: Was this mortgage inconsistent with any statutory destination of the property of the Company subject to the mortgage? In this connection it must be borne in mind that the single question before the Court is that concerning the validity of the mortgage, and that it is premature to discuss the nature and extent of the remedies to which the Appellant may be entitled. We have only to recall the terms of the decree under which this contention has arisen, and which consist of a reference to ascertain the amount due, to be satisfied that the question of the Appellant\u2019s right to any particular remedy has been excluded by the decree, which expressly concedes the right to sell, if the money found due should not be paid within thirty days from the date of the Report. That the Appellant may have threatened and actually intended to offer for sale the franchises of the Railway Company is therefore immaterial in the consideration of this appeal; in short, it is not under the judicial notice of the Court. I apprehend the Respondents will not be precluded from enforcing any remedy which they may have ever possessed to restrain any illegal act, which the Appellant may purpose to commit under color of availing himself of his legal remedies to realize the money secured by his mortgage. But the question of what these remedies may consist is wholly beside the present controversy.\nIf the mortgage comprises any property which the Company were free to give in security, it can make no difference that it also includes other subjects, which were so impressed with a charge or trust in favour of the public, that it was beyond the power of the Company to deal with them.\nThe Court below have determined that this deed was wholly void, but if it creates a good charge on any single parcel of land which it purports to affect, this cannot be the correct conclusion. The charge is on all the lands of the Company situate in the town of Belleville, and Villages of Sterling and Hastings, and in the several townships designated, and on the franchise and powers of the Railway between the town of Belleville and the Village of Hastings. Then are all the lands of a Railway Company so dedicated to public uses, or so impressed with a public trust that it is ultra vires of the Company to deal with them by way of mortgage? On the answer to this must depend the correctness of the decision appealed from. Assuming for the present purpose that the principles enunciated by the English Court of Chancery in the case of Gardener v. The London, Chatham & Dover Railway Company[88] are applicable to the permanent way, station houses, and station grounds actually required for the use and purposes of the Railway, it surely cannot be said that a Railway corporation, constituted as the Respondents\u2019 Company is, may not legally acquire and hold other lands, which it requires for no such uses. All practical experience demonstrates that a company of this kind, at the completion of its works, usually finds itself to have acquired property in land not required for the purposes of its working, lands which it may have been compelled to acquire as part of other property which it could not dispense with, or which, though purchased or taken as necessary for the use of the railway, have, in the event, been found to be superfluous. Is the Company, then, to be prohibited from dealing with, such lands, the retention of which, in their hands, as so much unproductive stock, can subserve no possible purpose of public utility? The answer to this enquiry in the negative would be obvious on general principles, even if a specific enactment did not afford it. But we have this answer embodied in the written text of the law itself, for by section 9 sub-section 2 of the General Railway Act[89], express power is conferred upon the Company to alienate, sell and dispose of lands which they may have acquired for the construction, maintenance, accommodation and use of the railway. This right of alienation includes lands acquired in the exercise of compulsory powers as well as those obtained by conventional purchase. That the words \u201calienate, sell or dispose\u201d include a power to mortgage as well as that of absolute disposition, requires no demonstration.\nMr. Justice Ritchie has suggested how important a power of mortgaging surplus lands is in this country, for a reason which would have no existence in England. The practice has prevailed, in all the Provinces, of making large statutory grants of wild lands from the public domain in aid of the construction of railways, Were Railway Companies disabled from mortgaging, the use of such grants would be greatly diminished. The power of mortgaging lands so granted, has been expressly recognized as one of the ordinary powers of a Railway Company by the Supreme Court of the United States. Tucker v. Furgusson[90], Farnsvorth v. Minnesota and Pacific Railway Co.[91]\nFor these reasons it is impossible to maintain the order of the Court of Appeal in the absence of evidence establishing the fact that the Company had no lands other than those required for the permanent way and station grounds, and otherwise for the efficient working of the railway. The mortgage cannot be pronounced wholly void on the ground now under consideration, unless this is shown. It lay upon the Respondents, who seek to avoid the mortgage, to prove this, but there is not the slightest evidence of it.\nTherefore, conceding for the present that the mortgage, if confined to the franchise, and to the railway and its adjuncts, would have been void as being a charge on subjects extra commercium, it does not follow that it may not be a good charge on other lands over which the Company had power of free disposition, and for that reason alone the order of the Court below should be reversed.\nIt is proper, however, to guard against the supposition that we express any opinion as to whether, if this mortgage had been confined to the railway itself and its franchises, it would have been wholly void and inoperative. Speaking for myself alone, and without expressing any decisive opinion, I think there was much force in the argument that a Court of Equity would give effect to such an instrument, at least to the extent of treating it as a good equitable charge upon the net earnings of the railway, a view which would have been quite sufficient to have sustained this appeal.\nFurther, the use of the word \u201cfranchise\u201d seems to have led to some confusion in considering the rights of mortgagees of railways in this country. Strictly, the expression is not accurate as applied to a corporation constituted by Act of Parliament; it should be confined to corporations created by Royal grant or charter, the word \u201cfranchise\u201d meaning a privilege granted by the Crown in the exercise of the Royal prerogative[92]. It has, however, been sometimes applied to statutory corporations in a more extended signification than even analogy warrants, as meaning not only the right conferred on a number of individual persons to constitute a corporate body, but also as importing powers in derogation of private rights of property conferred on such a body by Statute.\nThe right to be a corporation is not, of course, susceptible of alienation by mortgage or otherwise, but it is not easy to find any conclusive reasons why other powers, such as those of taking lands, operating the railway, taking tolls, and exercising the other rights and powers usually conferred on railway companies, should not be susceptible of transfer, the transferees being, of course, subject to all trusts and burdens in favor of the public which the original Company was liable to. Very high American authority, including that of the Supreme Court of the United States[93], points to one solution of this difficult question, whilst English decisions maintain the opposite view; and it was contended by Mr. Cameron, in his very able argument on behalf of the Appellant at this bar, that the circumstances of this country and the conditions under which railways are constructed here, warranted the adoption of the American in preference to the English doctrine, as being more favorable to the rights of the holders of bonds and debentures issued for borrowed capital. We express no opinion on this point, other grounds suffice to decide this appeal, but it was thought right to notice the argument and to say that we still consider it an open question which this Court may yet be called upon to decide without any prejudice from the present determination.\nThe same may also be said of the point much pressed by Mr. Cameron, that a mortgagee of a railway which has been abandoned and become an abortive undertaking before its construction has been completed, and which remains nothing more than so much land, may be entitled to very different remedies from those to which the holder of such a security may be restricted upon a completed line\u2014a going concern\u2014such-as Lord Cairns in his judgment in Gardener v. The London, Chatham & Dover Railway Company[94] likens to \u201ca fruit-bearing tree,\u201d a simile very inapplicable to land in this country, originally designed for a railway which has been abandoned. When such a case is presented for decision, it will, in my opinion, deserve attentive consideration.\nThe judgment of the Court being to reverse the order of the Court below, the minutes of the order to be drawn up on this appeal will be as follows:\nREVERSE the order of the Court of Appeal of the 15th day of June, 1876, and also that of the Court of Chancery of Ontario, of the 15th day of March, 1876.\nREFER it back to the Master of the Court of Chancery to review and alter his report by finding the amount due on the mortgage security in the pleadings mentioned to be the balance remaining due for principal and interest for the price of all the iron delivered on the wharf at Belleville by the said defendant Bickford, for the defendant Brooks, which said price was found by the said Master in his report, to be the sum of $219,830, after deducting from the said sum the value of the iron mentioned in the said report of the Master, as having been removed from Belleville by the said defendant Bickford, at the rate already found by the said Master, and specified in his Report, with liberty to the Master to report any special circumstances material to the question of damages.\nORDER that the Respondents pay to the Appellant his costs of this appeal, and also the costs in the Court of Appeal, as well as those of the motion by way of appeal from the Master\u2019s Report in the Court of Chancery.\nAttorney for Appellant:\u2014Hector Cameron.\nAttorneys for Respondents:\u2014Bethune, Osler & Moss.\n[1] 1 H. & M., 66.\n[2] 3 Russ, 185.\n[3] 1 J. & H., 462.\n[4] 12 Grant, 259.\n[5] 10 Jur., N.S., 872.\n[6] 5 Grant, 587.\n[7] 5 Grant, 593.\n[8] 1 Younge, 361.\n[9] L.R. 8 Ch., 351.\n[10] 3 DeG. & J. 294.\n[11] L.R. 4 Ch., 748.\n[12] Wilson\u2019s Case, L.R. 12, Eq., 521.\n[13] P. 117.\n[14] 1 Grant, 547.\n[15] Preface, p. 11.\n[16] 26 Beav., 276.\n[17] 3 Giff. 521, 4 DeG.

J., and Ritchie, Strong, Taschereau, and Fournier, J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nArbitration\u2014Award, finality of\u2014Finding specifically on each of the matters in difference.\nPlaintiffs brought ejectment to recover possession of certain lands in the Parish of P. After cause was at issue, under a Rule of reference, all matters in difference were referred to arbitration, and the arbitrators were to have power to make an award concerning the Glebe and Church Lands at P., and to make a separate award concerning the School Lands at P. The powers of the arbitrators were to extend to all accounts and differences between the said Parish and the late Rector, and the Defendant, as Executrix of said Rector, as also between the said Defendant individually and the Parish.\nThe arbitrators made two awards. First, as to the School Lands, they awarded that the Defendant was indebted to the Plaintiffs, as such Executrix, on the school moneys in the sum of $1,400; that the Defendant should pay that sum to the Plaintiffs; and that judgment should be entered for the Plaintiffs for that amount. Secondly, as to the Glebe and Church Lands, they awarded that the Plaintiffs were entitled to recover the lands claimed on the writ of ejectment, and ordered judgment in ejectment to be entered for the Plaintiffs with costs of suit; and, after reciting that all accounts respecting the receipt and disbursements of all moneys received from the interest, rent, and sale of these lands by the late Rector, or his agents, or by the Defendant, as his Executrix, were also referred to them, as well as all accounts and differences between the said Parish and the Defendant individually, they further awarded, that the Defendant should \"pay to the Plaintiffs the sum of $1 in full of the same,\" saving and excepting the matters in controversy respecting the School Lands, on which they had made a separate award; and that judgment should be entered for the Plaintiffs for the said sum of $1. They also awarded that the Defendant should pay all the costs of the reference and award.\nHeld,\u2014That the awards sufficiently specified the claims submitted and the various capacities in which such claims arose. That the first award, being against the defendant in her representative capacity, could not be considered against her personally, and negatived any claim of that kind, and was also an adjudication against the Defendant that she had assets; and that the finding in the second award that the Defendant should pay $1 could be considered a finding as against her in her individual capacity for that sum, and, as to the claims of the Plaintiffs against her for moneys received by her husband or by her as Executrix, as a finding against the Plaintiffs on their claim. That the part of the second award, directing payment of the costs of the reference and award was bad, but might be abandoned.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, setting aside the award made between the parties.\nThe Plaintiffs brought ejectment to recover possession of certain lands (about four acres) in the Parish of Parrsboro', in the County of Cumberland, in Nova Scotia. The action was begun 22nd May, 1876. The lands were described in the writ, and the Defendant pleaded that Plaintiffs were not entitled to the possession of the property described in the writ and declaration, or any part thereof.\nAfter the cause was at issue, it was agreed, on 21st September, 1876, by consent of the parties, that the cause and all matters in difference between the parties be referred to the award of three arbitrators. In the rule of reference the two arbitrators named were John M. Hay and Angus McGilvray, and the third was to be chosen by them. The award of the arbitrators, or of any two of them, was to be final. The arbitrators were to have full power and authority to examine, investigate and award, either separately or in one, of and concerning all accounts respecting the receipts and disbursements of moneys received from the interest, renting and sale of the glebe and church lands and the buildings thereon, at Parrsboro', by the late Rev. W. B. King, or his agents, or by the Defendant, as his executrix, and all and every matter connected therewith, and all and every account existing or pending between the said Parish and the said Rev. W. B. King, or the Defendant, as executrix, or otherwise.\nThey had like authority to hear, examine, &c., and to take evidence and make an award concerning the receipts and disbursements of moneys received from the sale of the school lands at Parrsboro', and the rents, issues and profits of the same, and every matter connected therewith, adjusting the accounts and settling the balance due thereon; Provided, in such last-mentioned case their award should be separate from any other award or awards in the suit.\nThe arbitrators were to have power to order judgment to be entered in the cause, either for the Plaintiffs or Defendant, with or without costs, or to order judgments to be entered for both Plaintiffs and Defendant, with or without costs, as they should find the several issues, either for or against either party.\nIt was agreed that the powers of the arbitrators should extend to all accounts and differences between the said Parish of St. George and the late Rector, and the Defendant as executrix of said Rector, as also between the said Defendant individually and the Parish, so that the said award might, in all respects, be final and conclusive between all the parties in difference.\nThe two arbitrators named in the submission (John M. Hay and Angus McGilvray) named Thomas Jennings as the third arbitrator; and on the 13th January, 1877, the three arbitrators made two awards.\nIn the first, it was recited, amongst other things, that certain disputes which had arisen between the parties respecting the receipts and disbursements received for the sale of school lands at Parrsboro', and the rents, issues and profits thereof, were referred to them; that they had heard the parties, their counsel, attorneys, witnesses and evidence produced on behalf of either party, and duly weighed and considered the same; and as it was provided by the rule that they should make a separate award concerning the school lands:\nThey, therefore, awarded that the Defendant was indebted to the Plaintiffs, as such executrix, on the said school moneys, in the sum of one thousand four hundred dollars, and they awarded \"that the Defendant do pay to the Plaintiffs the said sum of $1,400, and that judgment be entered for the Plaintiffs for that amount.\" The second award, dated the same day, signed by all the arbitrators, stated that the rule of Court, amongst other things, recited that the cause and all matters in difference between the parties had been referred to them; that they had heard and examined the parties, their counsel and attorneys, and all witnesses and evidence adduced on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Defendant, and had duly weighed and considered the same; they awarded and adjudged, of and concerning the premises, that the Plaintiffs were entitled to recover the lands claimed in the writ of ejectment in the cause, and ordered that judgment in ejectment be entered for the Plaintiffs, with costs of suit.\nThey further recited, that by the rule of Court, all accounts respecting the receipt and disbursements of all moneys received from the interest, rent and sale of the glebe and church lands at Parrsboro' by the late W. B. King, or his agents, or by the Defendant as his executrix, were also referred to them, as well as all accounts and differences between the said Parish of St. George and the Defendant individually. They further recited that they had heard the parties, their witnesses, evidence, counsel and attorneys of and respecting the same; and having duly weighed and considered the same, they awarded that the Defendant should pay to the Plaintiffs the sum of one dollar in full of the same, saving and excepting the matters in controversy respecting the school lands, on which, as required by the rule, they had made a separate award; that judgment should be entered for the Plaintiffs for the said sum of one dollar. They also awarded and adjudged that the Defendant should pay all the costs of the reference and award.\nOn the 6th February, 1877, a rule nisi was obtained to set aside the awards on the following grounds:\n\"1st. That the said award or awards, is and are not, nor is either of them, final and conclusive, or in accordance with the requirements of the rule of reference herein.\n2nd. Because the arbitrators did not determine and decide all matters submitted to them under the said rule of reference and the evidence in the cause.\n3rd. Because the arbitrators have not, as they were required to do, determined and passed upon all accounts respecting the receipts and disbursements of all moneys received from the interest, rent and sale of the glebe and church lands, and the buildings thereon, at Parrsboro', by the late Rev. W. B. King or his agents, or by the Defendant, as his executrix, as well as all accounts and differences between the said Parish of St. George and the said Defendant individually.\n4th. Because the said arbitrators did not make their award of and concerning the receipt and disbursement of moneys received for the sale of the school lands at Parrsboro' and rents, issues and profits of the same, and every matter connected therewith, adjusting the accounts and settling the balance due thereon, as required in and by the said rule of reference.\n5th. Because the said award or awards, and both and each of them is and are uncertain and inconclusive, and do not finally determine the matters referred to the said arbitrators in and by the said rule of reference.\n6th. Because the said award is illegal, uncertain and void.\"\nThe rule was granted on the affidavit of the Defendant's counsel stating the nature of the action. That the Defendant was the widow of the late Rev. W. B. King, who was in his lifetime Rector of Parrsboro', and she was executrix of his will. That Defendant claimed there were large amounts due to her husband in his lifetime by Plaintiff, and to her as his executrix and in her individual capacity; and it was agreed by the parties to have all matters in difference referred to arbitration, and the rule of reference was entered into, and the usual plea in ejectment pleaded pro form\u00e2 in the suit. That the accounts between the Plaintiffs and the late Rev. W. B. King in his liftime, and the Plaintiffs and Defendant, as executrix, since his death, were fully gone into and investigated before the arbitrators, and they made their awards. The affidavit concludes that the deponent is advised and believes that the awards so made are not in accordance with the rule of reference, and do not find the separate liability of the late W. B. King in his lifetime, or the liability of the Defendant, as his executrix, since the death of the said W. B. King, or of the Defendant in her individual capacity.\nThe case was argued, and, on the 17th of March, the rule was made absolute, with costs.\nFrom that decision the Plaintiffs appealed to this Court. Mr. Gormully, for the Appellant:\u2014\nThe Court below ought not to have set aside the award, because, under the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia[1], the grounds for setting aside the award should have been specifically set forth in the rule to shew cause.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Was this objection taken in the Court below?]\nIt does not appear by the printed case, but I am instructed it was. He cited the following authorities in support of this contention, and pointed out that in Nova Scotia the Statute required the grounds to be specifically stated:\u2014Boodle v. Davies[2]; Grenfell v. Edgecomb[3]; Gray v. Leaf[4]; Staples v. Hay[5].\nAs to the merits of the case, Appellants contend that the awards are perfectly good. By the rule of reference made with the consent of both parties, a direction was given to the arbitrators to make two awards\u2014one respecting the school lands and one respecting the glebe lands. The arbitrators made two awards which have been set aside in the Court below. The objection to the award respecting the school lands in the Court below was, that it was not sufficiently final, and that it was not sufficiently certain. The arbitrators, after reciting that certain disputes were referred to them, and that they had heard the parties, their counsel and attorneys, as well as all witnesses and evidence produced for or on behalf of either party, and having duly weighed and considered the same, (the word \"same\" here necessarily means everything referred to them,) awarded that the Defendant, as executrix, was indebted to the Plaintiffs in the said school moneys in the sum of $1,400, and that the said amount should be paid to the Plaintiffs. There was nothing in the rule requiring the arbitrators to decide as to amount due by the Defendant in her different capacities; and the following authorities support Appellant's contentions, that such an award cannot be set aside on the ground of uncertainty; Russell on awards[6]; Boodle v. Davies[7].\nNeither is there, on the face of the award, anything to show that the arbitrators have not finally adjudicated on all the matters referred to them. On this point reference was made to Birks v. Trippett[8].\nNeither is the school lands award objectionable because it finds that the Respondent is indebted, as Executrix, to the Appellants in the sum of $1,400, and directs the Respondent to pay that sum to the Appellants, and the submission by the Respondent to refer is a submission to the arbitrators of the fact, whether the Respondent, as executrix, has assets or not; and the finding is a finding of assets, and creates a personal liability to pay. Worthington v. Barlow[9].\nThe other award as to the glebe lands, being an award de premissis, is final and conclusive. The leading case is The Duke of Beaufort and The Swansea Harbor Trustees[10]. See also Harrison v. Creswick[11]; and the most recent case of all Jewell v. Christie[12].\nMoreover, the arbitrators had power under the said rule to award generally, as they have done, and were not bound to find separately the state of the account between the late Mr. King and the Appellants; between the Respondent, as executrix of the late Mr. King, and the Appellants; between the Respondent individually and the Appellant. The two cases relied upon by the Court below are Rule v. Bryde[13] and Whitworth v. Hulse[14].\nIn these cases the question was whether the award was in accordance with the true construction of the submission, and whether it was the intention of the parties that the arbitrators should award separately on some of the matters, as, for instance, to determine the right to costs. It is submitted that, by the terms of the rule of reference here, it appears that the arbitrators were empowered to find generally as they have done; and if the terms of the rule on this point were doubtful, it was the duty of the Respondent to request the arbitrators to find specially on each matter in difference, and it does not appear that any such request was made. Dibben v. Marquis of Anglesea[15].\nAn award, though bad in part, is not necessarily bad altogether; if the good part is severable from the bad, the award will stand as to so much as is good. As to the school land award, the entry of a verdict for the Appellants, and the direction of the arbitrators as to the costs of the reference and award, even though in excess of the powers of the arbitrators, are severable from the rest of the award, and do not invalidate the same. As to the glebe land award, the entry of a verdict for the Appellants for one dollar, even though in excess of the powers of the arbitrators, is severable from the rest of the award, and is mere surplusage, and does not invalidate the same.\nDoe d. Body v. Cox[16]; Howett v. Clements[17]; Rees v. Waters[18].\nAn award will not be avoided, unless it is very clearly made out that some matters in difference had not been considered by the arbitrators and determined by the award. Russell on Awards[19]. Even silence of the arbitrators as to some matters is sometimes presumed to be a decision thereupon. Cargey v. Aitcheson[20]; The Duke of Beaufort and Swansea Harbor Commissioners[21].\nMoreover, the Courts will presume everything in favor of the validity of an award, and will make every reasonable intendment and presumption in favor of its being a final, certain, and sufficient determination of the matters in dispute; and where specific differences are recited in the award and determined thereby, the Court, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, will presume that the recited differences were all the matters in difference between the parties. See Russell on Awards[22].\nThe Court will be astute to answer objections to the award.\nMays v. Cannell[23]; virtually over-ruling Doe v. Horner[24].\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., for Respondent:\u2014\nIt is argued on the part of the Appellant that even silence upon one subject is sometimes to be presumed to be a decision thereupon. Now, each case must be governed by its own facts. If the submission is specific and requires that the arbitrators must find specifically on matters referred to them, and they do not, then their award is not final. The case of The Duke of Beaufort and The Swansea Harbour Trustees[25] is quite consistent with this view.\nNow, what is the submission here? The Respondent is an executrix, and it was sworn that she claimed moneys not only as executrix but also in her individual capacity.\nIt was one of the matters of the reference, and Respondent had a right to expect that the arbitrators would adjust these several amounts before making their award.\nIt was the duty of the arbitrators to have found specifically respecting the Glebe and Church Lands at Parrsboro' and also the School lands at Parrsboro'; it was their duty to have adjusted the accounts as to both of said subject-matters, and to have found and declared how such accounts respectively stood between the deceased, Rev. W. B. King, in his lifetime, of the one part, and the Appellants; and between the Respondent, as his Executrix, of the one part, and the Appellants; and between the Respondent in her individual capacity and the Appellants.\nSee Whitworth v. Hulse[26].\nWhere two substantive matters are referred, and the arbitrator finds only on one of them, the award is bad altogether as not being conclusive.\nHaywood v. Philips[27]; Rider v. Fisher[28]; Fisher's Digest[29]; Stone v. Philips[30].\nThe arbitrators had no power over the costs of the reference and award; and the award No. 2, as to these costs, is in excess of their authority. See Russell[31].\nIt was also contended that the Respondent should have requested the arbitrators to award specifically on these different subject-matters. But here it was not a doubtful case. It was not, therefore, the Respondent's duty to ask the arbitrators to do what they were clearly directed to do by the submission.\nKillburn v. Killburn[32]. Mr. Gormully in reply:\nThe award respecting costs may be cured by striking out those words, this is surplusage and it may be disregarded by the parties. Admitting that different issues were raised by the submission, it is submitted, however, that the authorities cited show that a general finding was sufficient.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\nWhatever may have been the views taken by the Courts at one time as to the necessity of an arbitrator minutely specifying in the award all questions discussed before him on a reference, such is not the doctrine of the modern cases. In Harrison v. Creswick, in the Exchequer Chamber[33], Parke, Baron, refers approvingly to the rule laid down in the notes to Birks v. Trippett[34], when an award professes to be made de premissis:\nEven when there is no award of general releases, the silence of the award as to some of the matters submitted and brought before the arbitrator does not per se prevent it from being a sufficient exercise of the authority vested in him by the submission. An award is good notwithstanding the arbitrator has not made a distinct adjudication on each or any of the several distinct matters submitted to him, provided it does not appear that he has excluded any.\nHe refers to the authorities cited for the position by the learned editor, and proceeds:\nWhen an award is made de premissis, the presumption is that the arbitrator intended to dispose finally of all the matters in difference, and his award will be held final, if, by any intendment, it can be made so. The rule is this, when there is a further claim made by the Plaintiff, or a cross demand set up by the Defendant, and the award, professing to be made of and concerning the matters referred, is silent respecting such further claim or cross demand, the award amounts to an adjudication that the Plaintiff has no such further claim, or that the Defendant's cross demand is untenable; but, where the matter so set up, from its nature, requires to be specifically adjudicated upon, mere silence will not do.\nHarrison v. Creswick was approved of in The Duke of Beaufort and The Swansea Harbour Trustees[35]. There Williams, J., said:\nThe cases have long ago settled, that, where several cross claims are the subject of a reference, and the arbitrator by his award directs a sum to be paid by one party without mentioning the cross claim, his silence is tantamount to a negation of the cross claim.\nWilles, J., in his judgment in the same case, referring to the arbitrator stating his award to be made de premissis, says:\nThe use of that expression is unnecessary now; for, the Court will assume that the award is made upon all the matters referred, unless it is apparent on the face of it that it is not so made.\nHe then refers to the argument that it might be difficult, if necessary in future proceedings to rely on the award, to show that the arbitrator intended to negative the claim in that action (for severance), and says:\nThat is only an objection of form;\nAnd adds further on:\nI apprehend it would always be competent to the parties, in case a question should at any time arise as to whether or not the claim for severance damage was really disposed of by the award, to aver that that was a matter in difference before the arbitrator; and then the finding, as it now stands, would show that the arbitrator negatived the existence of any foundation for the claim.\nHe referred to, and quoted from, the case of In re Brown and The Croydon Canal Company[36] as sustaining that view.\nHarrison v. Creswick was approved of in Jewell v. Christie[37].\nI do not think Whitworth v. Hulse[38] in any way interferes with the cases to which I have referred. The argument against the award as to the Glebe and Church Lands is: suppose she were hereafter sued by the Plaintiffs for a claim against her in her representative character, for monies received by her husband in his lifetime, or by her as Executrix, could this award be set up as a defence to the action?\nIt seems to me, the cases to which I have referred are authority that it could; and the observations of Willes, J., in the case of The Duke of Beaufort and The Swansea Harbour Trustees, already cited, that the Defendant might in such a case aver it was a matter in difference; and then the finding of the arbitrators that she pay the Plaintiffs one dollar in respect of the same, may, I think, under the authorities, be considered a finding as against her in her individual capacity for that sum, and as to the claims of the Plaintiffs against her for money received by her husband, or by her as Executrix, as a finding against the Plaintiffs on their claim; and if she had any set off as to such claim the finding is against such set off or counter claim.\nAs to that part of the award which directs the Defendant to pay the costs of the reference and award, it was admitted on the argument that it was bad, and there is no doubt the Plaintiffs may abandon it, as they offer to do, and they can be restrained from enforcing that part of it if they attempt to do so.\nThe other award, as to the school lands, seems to me still less liable to objection, for the award is against the Defendant in her representative capacity, and cannot be considered against her personally, and, of course, negatives any claim of that kind. As to the suggested difficulty as to her not having assets, the award against her as Executrix and that she do pay the said sum, and that judgment be ruled against her for that amount, is an adjudication against her that she had assets. The case of Worthington v. Barlow[39] established that doctrine, and I am not aware that it has ever been questioned.\nIn the affidavit filed it is not suggested that Defendant has not assets, or that there is any fair objection to the award, or that the arbitrators did not really decide on all the matters referred to them. The objection taken is a mere technical one, and it seems strange if there were any merits in the application or any real apprehension of difficulty from any omissions in the award, that the facts shewing such difficulty were not brought to the notice of the Court, that the matters might be referred back to the arbitrators under the Statute permitting a reference of the award to the arbitrators to amend it.\nSince that power has been given to the Courts in England, they seem less inclined to allow mere technical objections to prevail; and when there is any serious objection to the form of the award and even the substance from some omission of the arbitrator, it is referred back to be put right.\nThe appeal will be allowed with costs and the rule nisi in the Court below to set aside the awards will be discharged with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellants: C.

The charge was subsequently investigated by a Committee of the House, who reported that it was unfounded. Two days after the House resolved, that, in preferring the charge without sufficient evidence to sustain it, W. was guilty of a breach of privilege. On the 30th April, W. was ordered to make an apology dictated by the House, and, having refused to do so, was declared, by another resolution, guilty of a contempt of the House, and requested forthwith to withdraw until such apology should be made. W. declined to withdraw, and thereupon another resolution was passed ordering the removal of the said W. from the House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, who, with his Assistant, enforced such order and removed W. W. brought an action of trespass for assault against the Speaker and certain Members of the House, and obtained a verdict of $500 damages.\nHeld, on appeal, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Nova Scotia has, in the absence of express grant, no power to remove one of its members for contempt, unless he is actually obstructing the business of the House; and W. having been removed from his seat, not because he was obstructing the business of the House, but because he would not repeat the apology required, the Defendants were liable.\nKielley v. Carson[1] and Doyle v. Falconer[2] commented on and followed.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, discharging a rule nisi to set aside verdict and for a new trial.\nThis was an action brought by the Respondent, a member of the House of Assembly of the Province of Nova Scotia, to recover $10,000 damages against the Appellants.\nThe Plaintiff, by his declaration, alleged:\n1. \"That the said Defendants, on the 80th day of April, 1874, assaulted and beat the Plaintiff, and with force and violence ejected and expelled the Plaintiff from the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia, and from his seat in the said Assembly.\"\n2. \"That the Plaintiff was and is a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia, and being lawfully in his seat in the said House of Assembly where the said Legislative Assembly meets for the transaction of business, the said Defendant assaulted and beat the Plaintiff, and with force and violence illegally ejected and expelled the said Plaintiff from the said Legislative Assembly, and from his seat therein.\"\n3. \"That being a Member of the said Assembly, as in the second count mentioned, and being in his place in said Assembly, the said Defendants, on the day and year in the second count mentioned, and on divers other days and times between that day and the commencement of this suit, assaulted and beat the Plaintiff, and caused him to be seized and illegally and wrongfully ejected and expelled from the said Assembly, and from his seat therein, and caused the said Plaintiff to be kept so ejected and expelled from thence hitherto.\" 4. \"That the Defendants on the day and year aforesaid, and on divers other days and times between that day and the commencement of this suit, assaulted and beat the Plaintiff, and ejected and expelled him from the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia, of which he is and was a Member, and from his seat therein, and have kept and continued to keep the said Plaintiff ejected and expelled from the said Assembly, and have thereby prevented and hindered the Plaintiff from enjoying his rights and privileges as such Member and discharging his duty as such Member.\"\n5th. \"That the Defendants assaulted and beat the Plaintiff, and he claims $10,000 damages.\"\nThe Defendants pleaded ten pleas:\nThe 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 pleas traverse each count severally.\nThe 6th plea traverses the severally counts generally, suggesting that they are for the same cause of action,\nThe 7th plea is a special plea to the whole declaration, denying the committal of the alleged trespasses, and stating \"that Plaintiff, being in his seat illegally and against the lawful resolution of said Assembly, and in contempt thereof, and hindering, obstructing and delaying the business thereof, and creating a disturbance, and using violent, abusive, disorderly and unbecoming language in said Assembly on said days and divers other days, one Angus M. Gidney, the Sergeant-at-Arms of said Assembly, for the preservation of the order of said Assembly, requested said Plaintiff to depart from said Assembly, whereupon said Plaintiff departed voluntary from said Assembly.\"\nThe 8th plea discloses the grounds of defence, setting out the facts and circumstances under which the alleged ejection and expulsion occurred, (and which are also set out in the other pleas hereafter given), and the Defendants justification therefor. The 9th plea is to the same effect, and adds, that the order, resolutions and proceedings of the House of Assembly, ordering that the Plaintiff be kept temporarily removed from the House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, until he should signify to the Speaker that he was prepared to make an apology required by the House, were, \"according to law, custom and practice theretofore used and practised, and which might be and were necessary to be used and practised by said Assembly, and which always of right did belong to said House to remove interruptions and obstructions to the deliberations and business of said Assembly by its members and others during its sittings, and which authority had heretofore so far and further been exercised and enjoyed by said Assembly in like cases, and by legislative assemblies in other parts of the Dominion of Her Majesty the Queen.\"\nThe 10th plea is also a plea of justification, specially alleging, amongst other things, \"That on the 26th April, 1874, Plaintiff, in his place in the said House of Assembly, then in session, contrary to the established rules and practice of the House, no motion or question being before said House, proceeded to speak and falsely charged the Honorable William B. Vail, then present in said House of Assembly, with falsifying certain public records, viz., the original map of surveys in the County of Guysboro'; also the only legal record of lands granted in that County;\" said Plaintiff then also charged said Honorable William B. Vail, 'that after the grants had passed, he purposely ordered the name of William Esson to be expunged, and the names of other persons to be interlined in the records, and that this had been done after the grants had passed, and after the signature of Governor Doyle had been appended to the grants and the record.' The said Plaintiff at said time and place called for certain record books from the Crown Land Office, and proceeded to say that 'those books would not be safe if allowed to remain in the Crown Land Office, under the control of said Honorable William B. Vail,' charging and implying in his said speech that said Hon. William B. Vail had corruptly altered the public records, and that he would do so again; that during the said sitting, in reply to a speech of the said Honorable William B. Vail, the Plaintiff, after reiterating the said charge, proceeded to say that 'if it could be proved he had made it without foundation, no one would be more happy than he would be to make every apology.' That after an investigation of said charges, demanded by said Honorable William B. Vail, by a committee chosen unanimously by said Assembly at said meeting, a report was, on the 24th April, 1874, presented to said House then in session, as follows \u2014\n'Committee Room, April 24th, 1874.\n'The Committee appointed to investigate the charges made by Douglas B. Woodworth, Esq., member for Kings County, on the sixteenth day of April last past, in the House of Assembly against the Honorable Provincial Secretary, of having altered certain records in the Crown Land Office, after the same had been signed by the Governor and Provincial Secretary, beg leave to report that after having fully investigated the charges preferred, we find that said charges are altogther unfounded, and that the evidence produced has completely exculpated the Honorable Provincial Secretary therefrom.'\n'Donald Archibald, Chairman.\n'Thomas Johnson.'\n\"That the said report was, after debate, unanimously adopted and entered on the journals of the said House of Assembly, the said Plaintiff being present and not calling for a division on the vote thereon; that after the unanimous reception and adoption of said report by said House of Assembly, at the same sitting, another resolution was submitted of and concerning said Plaintiff and the said charge made by him in said House, in the words following: 'Whereas Douglas B. Woodworth, Esq., member for the County of Kings, did, in his place in the House of Assembly of this Province, on the 16th day of April instant, charge the Honorable the Provincial Secretary with having altered certain records of the Crown Land Department after the same had been signed by His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, and the said Honorable Provincial Secretary and the Commissioner of Crown Lands, which said charge involved a high crime and misdemeanor. And whereas the said charge has been fully investigated by a committee of this House, and has been ascertained to be utterly unfounded, and the said Provincial Secretary has been completely exculpated therefrom, as fully appears from the report of the committee adopted by this House. And whereas, the said charge was preferred without due and proper investigation by the said Douglas B. Woodworth, and was accompanied by expressions tending to lead the House to believe that said charge was founded on fact and could be sustained; therefore resolved, that this House feel it to be their duty to express the opinion, that in preferring such a charge without adequate and sufficient evidence to sustain the same, or the proper and necessary preliminary investigation requisite to the formation of a correct opinion thereon, the said Douglas B. Woodworth has been guilty of a breach of privilege, and that he be dealt with according to the rules and practice of Parliament.'\"\nBy this plea also the Appellants allege, that this report was adopted and entered on the Journals of the House, and, after stating what took place in the House on the 28th and 30th April, conclude by saying, that the Plaintiff refused to obey or comply with a resolution of the House requiring Respondent to appear at the bar of the House and apologize to the House for having preferred a charge against another member without due and sufficient consideration, \"whereupon the Sergeant-at-Arms, the said Angus M. Gidney, and the said James L. Griffin him assisting, in obedience to the orders and requirements of the said Assembly, required the said Plaintiff to retire from the said Assembly, and that said Angus M. Gidney and said Assistant used as little force as possible in said behalf, and the said Plaintiff retired from said Assembly.\"\nThe case came on for trial at Halifax, on the 18th November, 1875, before Mr. Justice Macdonald and a jury.\nThe following are the material facts of the case as disclosed by the evidence.\nThe Plaintiff, at the time of the assault, was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia; the Defendant J. C. Troop was Speaker; the Defendant A. M. Gidney was Sergeant-at-Arms; the Defendant, J. S. Griffin, was Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms; and the other Defendants were respectively members of the said Legislative Assembly.\nThe Honorable W. B. Vail was also a member, as well as Provincial Secretary of the Province.\nOn the 16th of April, 1874, the Plaintiff, in his place in the House, used substantially the following words: \"I now, in my place in this House, publicly charge the Honorable Provincial Secretary with falsifying certain records, viz.: The original map of surveys in the County of Guysboro', and the only legal record of lands granted in that County, mentioned in certain grants, containing in the whole 17,000 acres of land granted to William Esson. I charge the Hon. Provincial Secretary, that after the grant had passed, he purposely ordered the name of William Esson to be expunged, and the names of other persons to be inserted in the records. I charge that this had been done after the grants had passed, after the signature of Governor Doyle had been appended to the grants and the record.\"\nThe Plaintiff was not called to order, nor were his words taken down.\nMr. Vail, having asked for a committee to investigate the charges, the House adopted a resolution appointing a committee of three members for that purpose. The committee sat and heard evidence, in the presence of the parties and their counsel, and on the 24th of April the committee, (one member refusing to concur and submitting a separate report) reported to the House their finding upon the said charge as follows: \"The committee, appointed to investigate the charges made by Douglas B. Woodworth, Esq., member for the County of Kings, on the 16th day of April last past, in the House of Assembly, against the Hon. the Provincial Secretary, of having altered certain records in the Crown Land office after the same had been signed by the Lieutenant-Governor and Provincial Secretary, beg leave to report that after having investigated the charges preferred, we find that such charges are altogether unfounded, and that the evidence produced has completely exculpated the Honorable Provincial Secretary therefrom,\"\nThis report was received and adopted by the House, and thereupon the following resolution was moved and seconded:\n\"Whereas, Douglas B. Woodworth, Esq., member for the County of Kings, did, in his place in the House of Assembly of this Province, on the 16th of April, instant, charge the Honorable the Provincial Secretary with having altered certain records of the Crown Land Department after the same had been signed by his Honor the Lieutenant Governor and the Hon. Provincial Secretary, and the Commissioner of Crown Lands, which said charge involved a high crime and misdemeanor;\n\"And Whereas, the said charge has been fully investigated by a committee of this House, and has been ascertained to be utterly unfounded, and the said Provincial Secretary has been completely exculpated therefrom, as fully appears from the report of a committee adopted by this House;\n\"And Whereas, the said charge was preferred without due and proper investigation by the said Douglas B. Woodworth, and was accompanied by expressions tending to lead the House to believe that the said' charge was founded in fact, and could be sustained;\n\"Therefore Resolved, That this House feel it to be their duty to express the opinion, that in preferring such a charge, without adequate and sufficient evidence to sustain the same on the proper and necessary preliminary investigation requisite to the formation of a correct opinion thereon, the said Douglas B. Woodworth has been guilty of a breach of privilege, and that he be dealt with according to the Rules of Practice of Parliament.\"\nThis resolution was passed by the House on the 28th April, and on the same day the House, on motion of the Attorney General,\n\"Resolved, That Mr. Woodworth do appear at the Bar of the House, and with the doors open, make the following apology:\n'Being convinced, that in making the charge, I did so without sufficient evidence to authorize me in my place in Parliament to accuse a member of this House of so serious an offence, I do now apologize therefor to this House, and trust to be excused by the House for having preferred such a charge without sufficient and due consideration.'\"\nMr. Woodworth (the Plaintiff) having stated, in his place in the House, that he did not intend to make such an apology, on the 30th of April, on motion of the Attorney General, it was\n\"Resolved, That this House is of opinion that Mr. Woodworth, in making the charge against the Hon. Provincial Secretary, on the 16th April, inst., viz.: of having altered certain records of the Crown Land Office, after the same had been signed by the Governor and Hon. Provincial Secretary, did so without foundation, and without sufficient evidence to justify him in making so grave an accusation, and, therefore, that Mr. Woodworth do appear at the Bar of the House, and with the doors of the House open, make the following apology, viz.: Being convinced, that in making the charge, I did so without sufficient evidence to authorize me in my place in Parliament to accuse a member of so serious an offence, I do now apologize therefor to this House, and trust to be excused by this House for having preferred such a charge without sufficient and due consideration; and Mr. Woodworth, in his place in the House, having declined to make the apology dictated in that resolution, the following resolution was adopted by the House:\n\"Resolved, That the refusal of Mr. Woodworth, the member for the County of Kings, to make the apology dictated by this House, is a contempt of this House:\n\"Resolved further, that this House cannot consistently with its dignity, admit Mr. Woodworth to take his seat until he comply with the order of this House, and, therefore, he be required forthwith to withdraw from this House until such apology be made.\"\nThe Speaker then and there, having enquired if he, Mr. Woodworth (the Plaintiff), was prepared to withdraw, and the Plaintiff having declined to do so, the following resolution was adopted:\n\"Douglas B. Woodworth, Esq., member for the County of Kings, having this day taken his seat without having made the apology dictated by this House in the resolution of the twenty-eighth day of April, inst., and having refused to withdraw from the House in obedience to the resolutions just passed by the House;\"\nTherefore Resolved, That the said Douglas B. Woodworth be forthwith removed from this House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, and be excluded therefrom until he shall have signified to his Honor the Speaker that he is prepared to make the apology required by this House.\nMr. Woodworth was then, in pursuance of such resolution, removed by the Sergeant-at-Arms and his Assistant.\nThe rules for the regulation of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia were also put in evidence. The 12th, 13th and 32nd were the only rules referred to in support of Appellant's contention, and are as follows:\n\"Rule XII.\u2014Whenever any disorderly words have been used by a member in debate, notice should be immediately taken of the words objected to; and if any member desire that they may be taken down, the Speaker or Chairman, if it be the pleasure of the House, or Committee, will direct the Clerk to take them down; and they shall be noticed in the House before any other member has spoken, or other business intervened: or otherwise, he who is offended may move at any time during the same day, and before such offending person go out of the House, that such member may not go out of the House till he gives satisfaction in what was by him spoken; and in case he desire, or the House command him, to explain himself, he is immediately so to do, standing in his place, which, if he refuses to do, or if the House be not satisfied with his explanation, then he is to be subject to the censure of the House.\"\n\"XIII. Though freedom of speech in debate be the undoubted privilege of the House, yet, whatsoever is spoken in the House is subject to the censure of the House.\"\n\"XXXII. In all cases, not herein otherwise provided, the House shall be guided by the usage and forms of the Imperial Parliament.\"\nThe learned judge, in his charge to the jury, after explaining the nature of the action and the pleadings, and what the law was, in his opinion, on the powers of Provincial Assemblies, made use of the following words:\n\"As the matter stands, you are to consider whether, on the one hand, turning the Plaintiff out at the time and in the manner proved was, in point of fact, necessary on the ground that he was an obstruction to the business of the House, in which case he would have no right of action; or, on the other hand, whether or not he was removed, not because he was such an obstruction, but merely for a contempt in refusing to make an apology for a past offence. If you find the latter to be the case, that is, that the exacting of the apology was a penalty for a past offence, and that the Plaintiff was turned out merely because he would not repeat that apology, though not obstructing the business, you ought to give him a verdict.\"\nThe jury rendered a verdict for the Plaintiff, with $500 damages.\nOn the 1st December, 1875, the Defendants moved to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial, on the grounds that the verdict was contrary to law and evidence; for the erroneous admission of evidence; for the erroneous rejection of evidence; for the mis-direction of the learned judge, and on the points taken at trial. After argument, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia discharged the rule, Wilkins, J., dissenting.\nThe question submitted for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada was, whether the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia has the inherent power, in dealing with one of its members in relation to his conduct within it, to punish him for contempt?\nMr. Walker and Mr. A. F. McIntyre for the Appellants:\nThe main question raised by this appeal is, whether or not the privilege claimed by the House of Assembly of the Province of Nova Scotia to punish for contempt existed, and if so, whether they had power to remove the Respondent. The Court below proceeds, on the supposition, that at the time of the removal there was no offence, and that it was a punishment for a past offence.\nHis delictum was continuing at the moment of his removal. It has always been treated as a continuous contempt. The resolution for removing the Respondent was, not only for taking his seat without making the apology, but also for refusing to comply with an order of the House; the manner in which this refusal was made is a subject for the Court to enquire into. The resolutions were passed in the following order:\n1st. Declaring Respondent guilty of a breach of privilege.\n2nd. Requiring Respondent in his place in the House to answer charge and then withdraw till question determined;\n3rd. Requiring charge read, Respondent to reply, and withdraw till question determined;\n4th. Reciting previous resolutions, and requiring Respondent to withdraw till question determined; 5th. Requiring apology to the House at the Bar of the House;\n6th. Requiring Respondent to withdraw until apology made;\n7th. Reciting refusal to withdraw and refusal to apologize, and ordering Respondent's removal.\nNow, the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia has Supreme legislative authority in the Province, and has, when sitting, the inherent right of protecting itself from insult and indignity, when offered in its presence, and of ejecting and expelling a member guilty thereof, or of a breach of privilege. The evidence in this case clearly established the fact that the Respondent was guilty of disorderly conduct, and refused to obey the orders of the House. The House had, therefore, the inherent right to make and pass the resolutions and orders above referred to, in vindication of their privileges from wrong and insult,\nBurdett v. Abbot[3]; Beaumont v. Barrett[4]; Fenton v. Hampton[5]; Anderson v. Dunn[6]; Cushing on Leg. Assemblies[7].\nThe following authorities clearly show that the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia has the power to deal summarily with contempts:\nStockdale v. Hansard[8]; Stockdale v. Hansard[9]; In re The Sheriff of Middlesex[10]; Gossett v. Howard[11]; Hensman on the Constitution[12]; Amos on the Constitution[13]; Fulton's Constitutional History[14]; Thomas's Cases Constitutional Law[15]; Brougham's British Constitution[16]; Cox's British Commonwealth[17]; Cox's Institution of British Government[18]; Bowyer's Constitutional Law[19]; Fischel on the English Constitution[20]; Tiffany on Constitutional Law[21]; Pomeroy's Constitutional Law[22]; Kent's Com.[23]; May on Parliamentary Practice[24]; Lex Parliamentaria[25].\nMoreover, there are cases decided here which favor Appellant's contention, that it has been the practice of Houses of Assembly in other British North American Colonies to consider the House the sole and exclusive judge of its own privileges and what is a breach thereof, and its action is conclusive upon Courts of Law. See May on Parliamentary Practice[26]; The Speaker of Victoria v. Glass[27]; McNab v. Bidwell[28]; Lavoie's Case[29]; Cuvillier's Case[30]; Monk's Case[31]; Tracey's Case[32]; and the recent case of Ex-parte Dansereau[33].\nIf the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec can exercise that right, surely it cannot be denied to the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia. Moreover, this case is distinguishable from the cases of Kielley v. Carson[34], and Doyle v. Falconer[35]. The House, in this case, did not attempt to punish for the contempt by committal, which is a judicial power, but merely exercised their power of removal.\nThe Appellants contend also, that the Judge at the trial mis-directed the jury in charging them that expulsion was a punishment for a past offence, and that when removed Respondent was not misbehaving or obstructing business, and that the House had no right to exact an apology as a condition to his remaining in his seat.\nThe learned counsel also cited the following authorities:\nAs to practice of Congress and Houses of Representatives in the United States, and in the several States forming the Federal Union\u2014\nPotter's Dwarris on Statutes and Constitutions[36];\nHough on American Constitutions[37].\nAs to the Constitution of Nova Scotia prior to Confederation\u2014\nClarke's Colonial Law[38]; McGregor's British America[39]; Howard's Laws of British Colonies[40].\nAs to Tenth Plea being proved\u2014a sufficient justification not being demurred to\u2014\nEdwards v. Walter, et al,[41].\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., for Respondent:\u2014\nThere was no breach of privilege in publicly charging the Provincial Secretary with falsifying certain records. The charge was preferred in Respondent's undoubted right as a member of the Legislature\u2014a right established and recognized by the law of Parliament. In strict parliamentary practice, when a statement by a member has been adopted as the ground of a proceeding by the House, any irregularity in it is waived. If, on the other hand, the charge could, by any possibility, have been treated as a breach of privilege, it should have been exclusively dealt with under Rule 12 of the Rules of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. Now, in this case, the Respondent was not called to order, nor were the words alleged to have been spoken immediately taken down, according to the practice; but, after a reference to a committee had been ordered, and a report had been made, to the effect that the charges were unfounded, the House proceeded to pass several resolutions, and finally to order that the Respondent do appear at the Bar, and there make an apology; all of which is contrary to English precedents and the rules of the House of Assembly. Moreover, there are no instances in which it can be shown that a Member has ever been ordered to apologize from the Bar of the House, it having been authoritatively laid down that no Member shall appear at the Bar unless as a criminal. See May's Parliamentary Practice[42], Bourke's Precedence[43].\nIt is contended, that a resolution of the House is binding, and that the Courts cannot enquire into the facts. This brings us to discuss the question of the sovereignty of a Colonial Legislative Assembly within its own walls. The state of the law in relation to the House of Commons in England is, that the House has the sovereign power to decide what is a contempt of its own authority, and if the ground of such decision is not stated, the adjudication is not open to be reviewed by a Court of Law; but, if the grounds are given, Courts of Law have power and jurisdiction to examine into questions of breach of parliamentary privilege and of contempt, and to determine whether or not the pretension is supported by the proceedings that have taken place. Gossett v. Howard[44]; Harrison v. Wright[45]; Stockdale v. Hansard[46]; Potter's Dwarris on Stat.[47].\nBut the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia, established by chap. 4, R. S. of N. S., 4th series, has no such authority as to the punishment of contempt and breaches of privilege as the House of Commons possesses.\nKeilley v. Carson[48], overruling Beaumont v. Barrett[49]; Doyle v. Falconer[50], on which case Respondent principally relies.\nOne branch of the Legislature has no power to increase its own powers and jurisdiction such as rule 32 of the Nova Scotia House is contended to confer.\nSee May on Parliamentary Practice[51]; Chap. 22 of the Acts of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, 1875. Also despatch of Minister of Justice, as to partial allowance of same.\nThe exercise of the powers of the House in this case was a judicial act, which required lengthy investigation and the examination of witnesses to ascertain whether the charge preferred by the Respondent was sustained or not, and its alleged falsity (as so found by the committee) was what the House resolved to be a breach of privilege, not the mere making of the charge. The House, in requiring an apology, was adjudicating on a past offence; but Colonial Legislatures have no such power, according to the clearly expressed opinion of Baron Parke in Kielley v. Carson, cited above.\nThe cases cited by Appellants are not applicable to this case, for here the charge is against a responsible Minister of the Crown. See the Parliamentary Debates in the English House of Commons in the following cases, in which grave charges having been preferred against Ministers, they were investigated and either affirmed or negatived; but no attempt was ever made to punish the Member who had preferred the charge. In fact, such a course would be a direct invasion of our system of Parliamentary and Responsible Government. Case of Mr. Daniel O'Connell, 26th February, 1838[52]; Case of Mr. Ferrand[53]; see Sir Robt. Peel's speech thereon[54]; Case of Mr. Cobbett[55]; Case of Col. Davies[56]; Charges against Lord Melville in 1805; Duke of York, 1809; Earl of Chatham, 1810; Lord Eldon, 1825; Earl St. Vincent, 1826; Sir James Graham, 1844; Lord Stanley, 1845; Lord Palmerston, 1850; Lord Westbury, 1865, and many others.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nAll my early reading, historical, political and legal, led my mind to give a ready assent to the doctrine, that it is one of the incidents to the possession of supreme legislative power, however limited the sphere for the exercise of that power (and though controlled by the Legislature of the Empire), that the Legislature exercising such power should have the right to punish parties for contempt. If they cannot do so, they are shorn of much of their dignity, and, in many respects, their influence and usefulness will be much impaired.\nNo doubt there have been occasions on which, before the beginning of this century, the right of the House of Commons to the possession of all the privileges and powers claimed by them has been questioned by the Courts; and Lord Holt's well known resistance to their claims, when unreasonable, has challenged the admiration of the Bar, wherever respect is had for judicial integrity and firmness.\nNevertheless, though some of the rights and privileges claimed have been defined by Act of Parliament, other important ones have not been given up. In the important case of Burdett v. Abbot[57], which was exhaustively argued, Lord Ellenborough, C. J., gave an elaborate judgment, affirming the right of the House of Commons to commit for contempts.\nIn one part of his judgment, his Lordship used these words:\nI have already said, that a priori, if there were no precedents upon the subject, no legislative recognition, no practice, or opinions in the courts of law recognizing such an authority, it would still be essentially necessary for the houses of parliament to have it; indeed, that they would sink into utter contempt and inefficiency without it. Could it be expected, that they should stand high in the estimation and reverence of the people, if, whenever they were insulted, they were obliged to wait the comparatively slow proceedings of the ordinary course of law for their redress? That the Speaker, with his mace, should be under the necessity of going before a grand, jury to prefer a bill of indictment for the insult offered to the house? They certainly must have the power of self vindication and self protection in their own hands; and if there be any authenticity in the recorded precedents of parliament, any force in the recognition of the legislature and in the decisions of the courts of law, they have such power.\nIn another part of the judgment he uses these words:\nThe necessity of the case would, therefore, upon principles of natural reason, seem to require that such bodies, constituted for such purposes, and exercising such functions as they do, should possess the powers which the history of the earliest times shews that they have in fact possessed and used.\nI make but one further quotation from the concluding part of his judgment:\nIt is made out that the power of the House of Commons to commit for contempt stands upon the ground of reason and necessity, independent of any positive authorities on the subject; but it is also made out by the evidence of usage and practice, by legislative sanction and recognition, and by the judgments of the courts of law, in a long course of well established precedents and authorities.\nThis judgment was pronounced in 1811, and similar doctrines and principles were laid down and acted upon by the courts and the legislatures of different colonies; reference was made to these cases in the argument before us. It does not appear that the right of colonial legislatures to commit for contempt was, after that, successfully resisted. It was questioned in Beaumont v. Barrett[58], decided in the year 1836, on appeal from Jamaica. It was argued that the Legislative Assembly of that island had no power to commit for contempt. The appellant had, by order of the Legislative Assembly, been committed for contempt in publishing a libellous article in a newspaper. The action was trespass, and the defendant justified under the warrant and resolution of the Assembly. On the arguments in the Courts of Jamaica two points were made: 1. Whether the Assembly possessed the power of committing for any contempt which was not an immediate obstruction to the due course of its proceedings; 2. Whether, if they possessed the power, it had been shown by the pleas to have been properly exercised. The question was also expressly raised, whether the House of Assembly of Jamaica possessed the power to commit for an alleged breach of their privileges. The opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was delivered by Parke, Baron, affirming the right of the House of Assembly to commit for contempt.\nThe Lords of the Council present, when the matter was argued before the committee, were Parke, B., Bosanquet, J., and the Chief Judge in Bankruptcy (Erskine).\nThe next time the question came up in the Privy Council was in 1842, in the case of Kielley v. Carson[59]. The case was twice argued, and when finally decided, there were present Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst, Lord Brougham, Lord Denman, Lord Abinger, Lord Cottenham, Lord Campbell, Shadwell, V. C., Tindall, C. J., Parke, Baron, Erskine, J., and Dr. Lushington. The opinion of their Lordships was delivered by Baron Parke, who had pronounced the judgment in Beaumont v. Barrett. It was held, virtually reversing Beaumont v. Barrett, that the House of Assembly of Newfoundland had no power to commit the plaintiff for contempt for having used threatening language to a Member of the House for what he had said, in his place in the House, respecting the plaintiff The following language is used in deciding the matter before the Judicial Committee:\nThe question, therefore, whether the House of Assembly could commit by way of punishment for a contempt in the face of it, does not arise in this case. Their lordships are of opinion, that the House of Assembly did not possess the power of arrest with a view to adjudication on a complaint of contempt committed out of its doors, and consequently, that the judgment of the Court below must be reversed.\nIn another part this language is used:\nTo the full extent of every measure which it may be really necessary to adopt to secure the free exercise of their legislative functions, they are justified in acting by the principled the common law; but the power of punishing any one for past misconduct as a contempt of its authority, and adjudicating upon the fact of such contempt, and the measure of punishment as a judicial body irresponsible to the party accused, whatever the real facts may be, is of a very different character, and, by no means, essentially necessary for the exercise of its functions by a local legislature, whether representative or not. All these functions may be well performed without this extraordinary power, and with the aid of the ordinary tribunals to investigate and punish contemptuous insults and interruptions.\nAnother quotation:\nThey are a local legislature, with every power reasonably necessary for the proper exercise of their functions and duties, but they have not what they have erroneously supposed themselves to possess, the same exclusive privileges which the ancient law of England has annexed to the House of Parliament.\nIt will be observed, that this case was decided after the decision in Stockdale v. Hansard[60], and The Sheriff of Middlesex Case[61], by the Court of Queen's Bench, cases in which the right to the privileges claimed by the Houses was discussed with great power and ability.\nLooking at the time this decision was made, 1842, we find, that the question as to the powers and privileges of the House of Commons in England had been raised and discussed under circumstances which seemed at one time, to be likely to lead almost to a collision between the Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench and the House of Commons. The Court of Queen's Bench, notwithstanding the strong opinions expressed by some of the leading statesmen of all parties, and the report of a Committee of the House of Commons, adopted by the House, affirming the privilege contended for in Stockdale v. Hansard, decided against those privileges, and affirmed the right of the plaintiff to maintain an action for libellous matter contained in parliamentary documents printed and sold by the defendants, by the order and permission of the House of Commons. Lord Campbell's argument for the defendant, on the demurrer to the plea setting up the privilege, as reported in 9 A. & E., occupies nearly 100 pages.\nThe matter was again brought to the consideration of the Court, on an application to compel the Sheriff to pay over the money made under a writ of venditioni exponas, issued in another suit of Stockdale v. Hansard[62], and in the case of The Sheriff of Middlesex[63], brought before the same Court, on a writ of habeas corpus. The Sheriff had been brought to the Bar of the House and examined, touching the execution of the writs of fieri facias and venditioni exponas, in the last named suit of Stockdale v. Hansard, and on the 21st of January, 1840, the House resolved, that the execution had been levied in contempt of the privileges of the House, and that the Sheriff should be ordered to return the amount. After that, and after they had again appeared at the Bar, and after the resolutions had been communicated to them, the House resolved:\nThat William Evans, Esq., and John Wheelton, Esq., having been guilty of contempt and breach of the privileges of this House, be committed to the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms attending this House, and that the Speaker do issue his warrant accordingly.\nThey were thereupon taken into custody for not returning the money in obedience to the order of the House. The resolutions of the House affirmed that the power of publishing such of its reports, votes and proceedings, as it might deem necessary, was an essential incident to the constitutional functions of Parliament, more especially of that House as the representative portion of it; that, by the law and privileges of Parliament, the House had the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to determine upon the existence and extent of its privileges, and that the institution, or prosecution of any action, suit or other proceeding, for the purpose of bringing them into discussion, or decision, before any Court, or Tribunal, elsewhere than in Parliament, was a high breach of such privilege, and rendered all parties concerned therein amenable to its just displeasure and to the punishment consequent thereon. Other resolutions were passed, having reference to a report published by Messrs. Hansard, under the orders of the House, respecting the islands of New Zealand, and declared that to bring, or assist in bringing, any action against the Messrs. Hansard for such publication, would be a breach of the privileges of the House. They also directed Messrs. Hansard not to defend an action with which they were threatened, for publishing the report.\nThese resolutions are referred to in the case of The Sheriff of Middlesex[64], having been passed on the 30th May, 1837, and the 1st of August, 1839.\nTo get over the difficulty, an Act was passed on the 14th April, 1840, 3 & 4 Vic., Chap. 9.\nThe privileges and powers contended for by the House of Commons, and the refusal of Lord Denman and the Court of Queen's Bench to yield assent to these pretensions, naturally attracted the attention of the leading legal minds in England, and when the case of Kielley v. Carson came on for discussion and consideration before the Committee of the Privy Council in 1842, the great lawyers before whom the case was then argued, were, no doubt, fully prepared to consider it in all its bearings, and pre-eminently qualified to decide it, from their high legal attainments, and most of them having also been members of the House of Commons.\nFenton v. Hampton, in 1858[65], was an appeal to the Queen in Council from a decision of the Supreme Court of Van Dieman's Land. Present: Lords Justices Knight Bruce, Turner, Pemberton Leigh, and L. C. Baron Pollock. The opinion of the committee was delivered by Pollock, C.B. The case was for the committal for contempt of a person not a member of the Legislative body (the Comptroller-General of Convicts in the Island), for refusing to give evidence before a committee, and to attend at Bar when ordered. The committal was by the Legislative Council of the Island, the only legislative body in the Colony, and which had been created by Statute. The Chief Justice in the Island (Fleming) held, that the Council had no power to commit for contempt, and that the warrant, being general, was bad. Horne, J., held, that the law of Parliament was introduced as part of the law of England, and that there was power to commit for contempt; but he also held the warrant was bad, as the plaintiff had had no opportunity of defence, it not appearing he had been called to the Bar to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt. The leading counsel, in arguing the case before the Committee, were Thesiger and Kelly, Q. C.'s. Pollock, C. B., in giving the opinion of the Committee, directly repudiated Mr. Justice Horne's position, that the Lex et consuetudo Parliamenti had been introduced by the Statute introducing the Law of England, and also rejected the ground that it was an incidental power, and said there was no distinction between that Legislature created by Imperial Statute and those of Jamaica and Newfoundland created by the Crown. He said:\nIf the Legislative Council of Van Dieman's Land cannot claim the power they have exercised on the occasion before us, as inherently belonging to the supreme legislative authority which they undoubtedly possess, they cannot claim it under the Statute as part of the common law of England (including the Lex et consuetudo Parliamenti), transferred to the Colony by the 9 Geo. 4, chap. 83, sec. 24. The Lex et consuetudo Parliamenti apply exclusively to the Lords and Commons of this country, and do not apply to the supreme Legislature of a Colony by the introduction of the common law therein.\nThis case seems applicable to the extent of approving of Kielley v. Carson, and shewing Beaumont v. Barrett not supportable on the grounds of usage or statute.\nDill v. Murphy[66] was an appeal from the Supreme Court of Victoria to the Privy Council. Present: Lords Cranworth and Chelmsford, and Lords Justices Knight Bruce and Turner, February, 1864. The case arose on a committal for contempt in publishing a libel on a member of the House of Assembly. The statute of the Imperial Parliament, establishing the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, authorized the Legislature, by an act, to define the privileges, immunities and powers of the members. The Colonial Legislature passed an Act declaring:\nThat the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of Victoria respectively, and the committees and members thereof respectively, should hold, enjoy and exercise such and the like privileges, immunities and powers as, and the privileges, immunities and powers of the said Council and Assembly respectively, and of the committees and members thereof respectively, were thereby defined to be the same as, at the time of the passing of the Constitution act, were held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland, and by the committees and members thereof, so far as the same were not inconsistent with the Constitution act, whether such privileges, immunities or powers were so held, possessed or enjoyed by custom, statute, or otherwise.\nBy the same act, printed copies of the Journals of the House of Commons were made prima facie evidence upon any inquiry touching such privileges, immunities, &c.\nThat act received the Royal assent in 1857, before committing of the trespasses complained of in the suit. The question raised under the pleadings on demurrer was, whether by the statute referred to, the privileges contended for were sufficiently defined by the words used. The opinion of the Committee was delivered by Lord Cranworth, holding that under the words of the act, the Colonial Legislature had the same power to commit that the House of Commons had in England. Kielley v. Carson, and Fenton v. Hampton were referred to in argument, and their authority not in any way questioned.\nDoyle v. Falconer[67]\u2014before the judicial Committee of the Privy Council; present: Lord Westbury, Sir James William Colville, and Sir Edward Vaughan Williams\u2014is the next case in the order of time before that tribunal, and is very important. It was an appeal from the Court of Common Pleas of Dominica. The action was brought by the plaintiff (the respondent), a member of the House of Assembly of Dominica, against the appellant, the Speaker, and two members of the House.\nThe material facts were set out in the pleas of the defendants, and were to the following effect, that the plaintiff, when debating a question before the House contrary to its established rules and practice, was called to order by the Speaker, persisted in his speech, and addressed insulting words to the Speaker, which, pursuant to motion, were noted down as follows: \"Who the devil are you to call me to order? You are a disgrace to the House.\" It was thereupon resolved, that the plaintiff had been guilty of a high contempt of the House, and that he should be held in such contempt until he should have apologized. The defendant (the Speaker), therefore called on him to apologize. He refused to do so, saying he had said nothing requiring an apology, and continued to address the House. The Speaker again called on the plaintiff for an apology, when he replied: \"You may tell me that I am in contempt one hundred times if you like, but I will speak. You may move it one hundred thousand times. I repeat what I have said: you are a disgrace to the House, you were expelled from the House for robbery; the minutes of 1845 can shew it.\" The House, by resolution, referred to what had before taken place, and to the fact, that whilst he was in contempt he interrupted and obstructed the business before the House, and it was thereupon resolved, that the plaintiff, for his disorderly conduct and contempt of the House, be taken into the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms, and that the Speaker do issue his warrant committing the plaintiff to the common gaol during the pleasure of the House; whereupon the defendant Doyle issued his warrant to the Sergeant-at-Arms, who arrested him under it, and delivered him to the custody of the Keeper of the gaol, who, under another warrant issued by the defendant Doyle, reciting the same matter, detained him under its authority. The pleas were demurred to and issue also joined on them. On argument of the demurrer, judgment was given in favor of the plaintiff. The case was afterwards tried before the Chief Justice, in July, 1864, when a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff, with \u00a3770 damages. Exceptions were taken, to the ruling of the Judge and admission of evidence, and a rule nisi obtained to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial, on the exceptions taken, and on the ground of excessive damages. The rule was argued, but subsequently abandoned, the learned counsel intimating his intention to appeal from the judgment on the demurrer as well as the refusal to non-suit, to Her Majesty in Council. Whereupon judgment was entered against the defendant, and execution awarded. The appeal came on for hearing. The material question raised on the appeal was against the judgment of the Court on the demurrer, and that alone was argued.\nMr. Mellish, Q. C., and Mr. MacNamara were for the appellants; and Sir Roundell Palmer and Mr. Leith for the respondent.\nThe appellant's Counsel, in argument, stated, that two questions were raised by the pleadings: First, had the Lower House of Assembly in the Island power to commit one of its members, by way of punishment, for contempt committed against it in its presence; and, secondly, assuming the existence of this power, are the pleas which set forth the several facts sustainable. They contended that, assuming that it had been decided by the cases of Kielley v. Carson and Fenton v. Hampton, that the House of Assembly had no power to punish for a contempt committed out of the House, this was a different question, the contempt and obstruction which the House had proceeded to punish had been committed by one of its member in the presence of the Assembly itself. They referred to the language of Baron Parke, in giving judgment in Kielley v. Carson, to show that the question under consideration in Doyle v. Falconer, did not arise in that case, but that he assented to the proposition that \"an assembly had the right to protect itself from all impediments to the due course of its proceedings. To the full extent of every measure which it might be really necessary to adopt, to secure the free exercise of their legislative functions, they are justified in acting, by the principles of the Common Law.\" They then contended, the power exercised was incident to the House of Assembly as necessary to its independence and security as a Legislative body.\nThe respondent's counsel contended, even if Colonial Assemblies are entitled to protect themselves from all impediments to the due course of their proceedings, and therefore to remove obstructions offered to their deliberations, that that is a different thing from assuming to punish by imprisonment, which can only be done by a Court of Record, or by the Imperial Parliament by the Lex Parliamenti. They referred to Kielley v. Carson, Fenton v. Hampton, and Dill v. Murphy, to show that no such power was possessed by Colonial Legislatures, and in re Brown[68] to show that the House of Kings in the Isle of Man had not, merely from its being endowed with legislative functions, the power to commit for contempt.\nSir James W. Colville, in giving the judgment of the Committee, refers to Kielley v. Carson, as deciding conclusively that the Legislative Assemblies in the British Colonies have, in the absence of express grant, no power to adjudicate upon or punish for contempt committed beyond their walls. He speaks of the constitution of the Committee before whom it was argued for the second time, as making that case an authority of singular weight, and says, if the elaborate judgment then pronounced had, in terms, left open the question in the case (they were called on to decide), it had stated principles which went far to afford the means of determining that question.\nHe refers to the privileges of the House of Commons, and says that the power of punishing for contempt belongs to it by virtue of the Lex et consuetudo Parliamenti, a law peculiar to and inherent in the two Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nThat there was no resemblance between a Colonial House of Assembly, being a body which has no judicial functions, and a Court of Justice, being a Court of Record. There was no ground for saying that the power of punishing for contempt, because it is admitted to be inherent in the one, must be taken by analogy to be inherent in the other. He then proceeds to discuss the question, whether the power to punish and commit for contempts committed in its presence is necessary to the existence of such a body as the Assembly of Dominica, and the proper exercise of the functions which it was intended to execute. He then proceeds:\nIt is necessary to distinguish between a power to punish for a contempt, which is a judicial power, and a power to remove any obstruction offered to the deliberations or proper action of a legislative body during its sitting, which last power is necessary for self preservation. If a member of a Colonial House of Assembly is guilty of disorderly conduct in the House whilst sitting, he may be removed, or excluded for a time, or even expelled; but there is a great difference between such powers and the judicial power of inflicting a penal sentence for the offence. The right to remove for self security is one thing; the right to inflict punishment is another. The former is, in their lordships' judgment, all that is warranted by the legal maxim that has been cited, but the latter is not its legitimate consequence. If the good sense and conduct of the members of the Colonial Legislatures prove, as in the present case, insufficient to secure order and decency of debate, the law would sanction the use of that degree of force which might be necessary to remove the person offending from the place of meeting and to keep him excluded. The same rule would apply, a fortiori, to obstructions caused by any person not a member. And whenever a violation of order amounts to a breach of the peace, or other legal offence, recourse may be had to the ordinary tribunals.\nHe then refers to the argument that the dignity of an Assembly exercising Imperial Legislative authority in a colony, and the importance of its functions, require more efficient protection than what had been indicated. That it was unseemly and inconvenient to subject the proceedings of such a body to examination by the local tribunals, and that it is but reasonable to concede to it a power which belongs to every inferior Court of Record. He also refers to the objection made to such a power being possessed by these Legislatures,\u2014it is a power of a high and peculiar character, in derogation of the liberty of the subject, and carries with it the anomaly of making those who exercise it Judges in their own cause, from whom there is no appeal, and that, if it might be safely intrusted to magistrates who would all be personally responsible for the abuse of it to some higher authority, it might be very dangerous in the hands of a body which, from its very constitution, is practically irresponsible. He added, that their lordships were not at liberty to deal with considerations of this kind; suggested the possibility of enlarging the existing privileges of the Assembly by an act of the Local Legislature, passed with the consent of the Crown; referred to the case of Dill v. Murphy, as showing that extraordinary privileges of the kind, when regularly acquired, would be duly recognized, and concludes: But their lordships, sitting as a Court of Justice, have to consider not what privileges the House of Assembly of Dominica ought to have, but what by law it has. In order to establish that the particular power claimed is one of those privileges, the appellants must show that it is essential to the existence of the Assembly, an incident sine quo res ipsa esse non potest. Their lordships are of opinion that it is not such an incident.\nIn the case of The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria v. Glass[69], decided in 1871, Kielley v. Carson, Beaumont v. Barrett, Fenton v. Hampton, Doyle v. Falconer, and Dill v. Murphy, are cited, and the authority of the later cases is not in any way questioned. The case affirms Dill v. Murphy, and holds that a general warrant, reciting that a person had been adjudged by the House of Assembly to have been guilty of a contempt and breach of privilege, without setting forth specific grounds of such contempt, is good.\nThe case of Anderson v. Dunn[70], decided in the Supreme Court of the United States, in 1821, followed Burdett v. Abbot[71], holding that the House of Representatives had, by necessary implication, a general power of punishing and committing for contempts, and was referred to in Doyle v. Falconer, but the Judicial Committee did not consider themselves at liberty to follow that case, after the decisions of that tribunal in Kielley v. Carson, and Fenton v. Hampton.\nIn many of the States of the American Union, the Legislature have asserted the right to punish for contempts as a power incident to, and necessary to be possessed by, those bodies, in order to the proper and efficient exercise of the powers possessed by them.\nIn fact, the practice and principles laid down by, and acted on, in the British House of Commons in reference to its privileges, seem to have been instinctively (if I may use the term) adopted by all legislative bodies modelled on the English system possessing supreme legislative authority, however limited its sphere, as incidental and necessary to the exercise of their high functions; and, I must confess, that it is with the greatest reluctance I recede from the opinion which prevailed so universally and for so long a time, and was sustained by such high authorities. I, nevertheless, feel compelled to yield to the high authority of Kielley v. Carson, decided by Judges of such very great acumen, on due consideration, and after so full an argument, and followed and approved of, as it has been, by the Privy Council in all the cases brought before that tribunal in which the question has been raised, and by the judicial decisions in all the Colonies that I am aware of, except in the case of Ex-parte Dansereau[72], in the Province of Quebec, where the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench seems fully warranted by the terms of the provincial statute.\nI may mention, that in the case of The Queen v. Gamble and Boulton[73], it was held, that a member of the Provincial Parliament was privileged from arrest in civil cases, and that the period for which the privilege lasted was the same as in England, and the learned Judge, who delivered the opinion of the Court, said:\nAnd while, apart from our own statutes and judicial decisions, I see nothing in the decisions in Beaumont v. Barrett et al, or the more recent case of Kielley v. Carson, at variance with the assertion and enjoyment of this privilege by our own Legislature, I am confirmed in my own opinion of its existence by our general adoption of the law of England, by the provision for suits against privileged parties contained in our Statute of 1822, and in the Statutes of Canada, 12 Vic., chap. 63, secs. 22 & 23; 13 & 14 Vic., chap. 55, sec 96; and by the uniform decisions of our Courts since the former act, and also, as I am informed, before it.\nHe then refers to the conflicting decisions in the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal, in the case of Cuvillier v. Monro[74].\nThe Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec seem to have conferred on the House of Assembly in these Provinces extensive powers to enable them effectively to exercise their high functions and discharge the important duties cast on them. It may be necessary still further to extend their powers. The Legislatures of the other Provinces will probably consider it desirable to take the same course, and in that way unmistakably place these tribunals in the position of dignity and power, which it is desirable they should possess.\nLooking at the facts of the case before us, the question arises, what was the Defendant doing at the time he was forcibly removed from his seat in the House that justified the use of the force and violence to which he was subjected?\nIt is not doubted that he had the right to occupy a seat in the House, and the judgments referred to decide that he could not be deprived of that right, unless he was offering some obstruction to the deliberations or proper action of that body during its sitting. The only obstruction that he offered to their deliberations or proper action, and the only disorderly conduct in the House at the time he was removed from it to which the resolutions point, is that he refused to make an apology dictated by the House.\nWhat, then, had the plaintiff done to cause him to be considered as guilty of a breach of the privileges of the House? On the 16th of April he charged a member of the House, who filled the office of Provincial Secretary, with altering certain records of the Crown Lands Department after the patents recorded had been signed by the Lieutenant Governor and the Commissioner of Crown Lands. If he believed the charge to be true, and had reasonable grounds for such belief, it was his duty to bring the matter to the consideration of the House that it might be enquired into, and applying the same rule that would prevail even in an action for a malicious prosecution, he would be justified in making the charge if he had reasonable and probable cause for doing so. The facts brought out on the trial and enquiry before the committee appointed clearly established, that, in truth, the Hon. Provincial Secretary did not alter the records referred to after they were signed by the Lieutenant-Governor. On the contrary, the alterations were made before being signed, and were not made by the gentleman charged, but, in consequence of his refusal to sign the documents as they were originally prepared; and the alterations were made in the book where the deeds were recorded, at the suggestion of an officer of the department, so as to make them, as registered, correspond with the conveyances as actually issued. The plaintiff's attention had been in some way directed to the matter, and he examined the book and papers in the Crown Lands Office, and saw that the name of Mr. Esson, the gentleman who was the grantee in many of the deeds, had been erased and other names written over the erasure. The object originally of inserting the name of Mr. Esson in the deeds was, that he might not be obliged to get conveyances from the parties who were the original applicants for the land, but who had transferred their rights to him. The Provincial Secretary would not sign the grants, unless the names of the parties originally applying were inserted.\nThe grants, as originally drawn up, were destroyed, new ones prepared, and they were the only ones ever perfected by having the great seal affixed to them, or the Governor's signature, or the signature of the Provincial Secretary. The alterations were made in the record book, as already mentioned, at the suggestion of an officer of the department, to avoid having the leaves taken out of it, they being numbered; and so the name of the party originally applying for the grant of land was inserted in the place from whence Mr. Esson's name was erased. From the evidence, the reasonable inference is, that the Provincial Secretary was aware of this being done, and was an assenting party to it.\nWithout going into the matter whether the plaintiff did receive information at the Crown Lands Office which went to the extent of affirming that the signature of the Lieutenant-Governor was affixed to the grant on the 20th December, which was, undoubtedly, a considerable time before the name of Esson was erased from the record of it in the book, it is obvious, that the documents in the office which he did see gave grounds for believing that something irregular had taken place, and he may have honestly believed that the alterations had been made in the grant after it had been signed by the Lieutenant-Governor, and, if so believing, he would naturally think it was his duty to call the attention of the House to the matter with a view of having it investigated. He was not at that time considered as in any way violating the rules of the House, or entrenching on its rights and privileges. In fact, it was thought necessary to enquire into the matter, and the result of the enquiry clearly shewed, that the grave charge of altering the record of grants after they had received the signature of the Lieutenant-Governor was not correct. After that, it would not be unreasonable to suppose, that the gentleman making the charge would express his satisfaction that the enquiry had shown that it was not well founded, though, at the time he made it, he believed it to be true, and considered he had reasonable grounds for such belief. He does not appear to have taken this course, which, perhaps, would have satisfied the House, and the difficulty that followed might have been avoided.\nBut a statement or complaint made by a member of the legislature, in his place in the house, with a view of having an enquiry in any matter in which the public have an interest, or, I apprehend, in which even a private person feels aggrieved, takes higher ground of privilege than an ordinary complaint made in a matter in which a party has an interest, asking to have his complaint legally investigated.\nWhen the member makes his statement, he exercises the right of freedom of speech, and, in making charges against gentlemen holding official positions, very great latitude is allowed in the use of vituperative language. If the language used is unparliamentary, it may be taken down, and the House decides upon it. If not called to order, and the House considers it necessary for its own dignity to enquire into the matter, it takes the initiative and appoints a committee, or institutes an enquiry, as the case may be. The member has only exercised his right of freedom of speech in bringing the matter to the attention of the House. If that body is to be considered as the grand inquest of the Province, who are to devise the means of correcting abuses and insuring good government in matters within their control, it must be the right and privilege of all parties, whether members of the legislature, or private citizens, to place their grievances, or the public wrongs complained of, before the body properly authorized to investigate them and grant redress. The member of the legislature, exercising his right of speech, makes a complaint. If the subject matter of his complaint turns out on an enquiry not to be true, we have not been shewn any authority or precedent where a member can be charged with being guilty of a breach of the privileges of the house for so doing. If the house thinks the enquiry ought not to be made, and refuses to take it up, and the member persists in bringing it forward, so as to obstruct the business of the house, it may be that he might then become liable to the censure of the house, and, if he persisted in the interruptions unreasonably, he might, to quote the words used in Doyle v. Falconer, \"be removed or excluded for a time, or even expelled.\" But the house, having thought it was a matter which required their attention, took it up and ordered an investigation, and, after that, I fail to see how they could properly declare, that what the member had done was a breach of their privileges. It seems to me, therefore, the very foundation of the other proceedings fails, and what was subsequently done cannot justify the expulsion of the plaintiff from the seat which he had a right to occupy. Even in England, the courts will see whether what the House of Commons declares to be its privileges really are so, the mere affirmance by that body that a certain act is a breach of their privileges will not oust the courts from enquiring and deciding whether the privilege claimed really exists. That, 1 understand, is the effect of Stockdale v. Hansard[75]. Lord Denman said, at p. 147:\u2014\nIn truth, no practical difference can be drawn between the right to sanction all things under the name of privilege, and the right to sanction all things whatever, by merely ordering them to be done. The second proposition differs from the first in words only. In both cases, the law would be superseded by our assembly; and, however dignified and respectable that body, in whatever degree superior to all temptations of abusing their power, the power claimed is arbitrary and irresponsible, in itself the most monstrous and intolerable of all abuses. * * * When the matter falls within their jurisdiction, no doubt we cannot question their judgment; but we are now enquiring whether the subject matter does fall within the jurisdiction of the House of Commons. It is contended, that they can bring it within their jurisdiction by declaring it so. To this claim, as arising from their privileges, I have already stated my answer. It is perfectly clear, that none of these Courts could give themselves jurisdiction by adjudging that they enjoy it.\nTaking the resolutions as the ground of the action of the assembly, I fail to see how the matter put forth by them was a breach of the privileges of the house. We must, as the law is now decided to be, examine the validity of the grounds put forth[76].\nUnder the practice in the English Parliament, or in the Legislature of Nova Scotia, as far as I am informed, the making, by one member against another, of an unfounded charge which has been inquired into by the house, does not constitute a breach of privilege. The cases referred to on the argument of Mr. Dunscomb's charge against Sir James Graham, and Mr. Cobbett's against Sir Robert Peel, shew the length to which vituperative charges are sometimes made in the House of Commons in England, and how they are dealt with; and the recent case of Mr. Plimsoll may have some bearing on the subject. But if the house yields to the charge, so far as to order an enquiry, then the matter is pursued by them, and it seems to me that after that they cannot properly say the party giving the information has been guilty of a breach of their privileges. And in the present case none can doubt that it was a matter which properly called for enquiry, though the charge, as made by the plaintiff in reference to it, was not sustained. It would be laying down a very unsatisfactory rule, to make the contingency of a report of a committee being favorable or unfavorable to a charge the ground of declaring a member of the house guilty or not guilty of a breach of its privileges. One of the first and greatest of its privileges is free speech, and one of the advantages of free legislative bodies is the right of exposing and denouncing abuses by means of such free speech.\nThe House, having declared the plaintiff guilty of a breach of its privileges, in making the charge referred to, required him to appear at the bar of the House, with the doors open, and make the following apology, which was dictated by the house, viz.:\nBeing convinced that in making the charge I did so without sufficient evidence to authorize me, in my place in parliament, to accuse a member of so serious an offence, I do now apologize therefor to this House, and trust to be excused by this House for having preferred such a charge without sufficient and due consideration.\nWhat right had they to require him to make this apology? Was it necessary to do so in order to go on with the public business? He had made the charge several days before that, so that the offence, if it were an offence at all, had been committed in a way apparently not interfering with the proper action of that body; so there would be no pretence that he was to apologize for that. Then the other alternative is, that this was a punishment inflicted on him by the House for the offence they had declared him guilty of, viz.: a breach of the privileges of the House. Doyle v. Falconer declares they have no power to punish even for a contempt; therefore, I think it clear they have no such power by resolving that a party had been guilty of a breach of their privileges, when, in truth, they failed to show that any privilege which they possessed had been interfered with. It may be here observed, that many persons would consider being compelled to make an apology of the kind here dictated a greater punishment than being sent to prison for the remainder of the session, and it can hardly be said, that being compelled to make such an apology by order of the House is not a punishment.\nThey followed up the order requiring an apology, the plaintiff having declined to make it, with a further resolution, that such refusal was a contempt of the House; that the House could not, consistent with its dignity, admit the plaintiff to take his seat until he complied with the order of the House, and that he be required forthwith to withdraw from the House until the apology was made. He having taken his seat without making the apology, it was resolved, that he be forthwith removed from the House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, and excluded therefrom until he signified to the Speaker that he was prepared to make the apology required by the House; and thereupon the plaintiff was removed from the House by the Sergeant-at-Arms and his assistant, two of the defendants.\nIt cannot be pretended, that on his removal from the House on the 28th of April, he was then obstructing their deliberations by the charge he had made on the 16th of April, twelve days before, and they do not, in any way, by their resolutions so assert. If he was removed as a punishment for his contempt in not obeying the order of the House as to making the apology dictated, the decided cases show they had not the power to punish for such a contempt, though in the face of the House, as his refusal did not necessarily interfere with or interrupt the business of the House; or, if it did, the interruption arose from the act of the House, and not of the plaintiff.\nIf it be admitted that the making of the charge, no exception being taken to it at the time, was not a violation of the privileges of the House, it would seem strange indeed, if a refusal to make an apology, based on the ground of the plaintiff having been guilty of such a breach of privilege, could properly be declared a contempt.\nIt seems to me to be a subtilty and refinement not warranted by the facts to hold, that the order excluding him from his seat was not in the nature of punishment, either for the alleged breach of the privileges of the House, or the alleged contempt in not obeying the order of the House to make the apology. If he signified his willingness to make the apology, he would be purged from his contempt.\nI do not suppose it is pretended, that if the House ordered the removal of a member from his seat, without assigning any cause therefor other than that the House had ordered him not to appear again in the House, or to occupy his seat, and yet he was in his seat, that that would be a justification for the trespass and force used in removing him from the place which, but for the order, he would have a right to be in, and where it was his duty to attend. So here, the matter suggested as a justification for the plaintiff's removal, according to the principle of the last decided cases, no more authorises it than the disobedience of the order not to appear in his seat would justify it in the case above supposed.\nAs to the extraneous matter referred to, not recited in the resolutions of the House of Assembly, as the ground on which the plaintiff was removed from his seat, I will only say, that the language used by the plaintiff on several occasions seems to have been peculiarly offensive, but the attention of the House does not appear to have been drawn to it, and I fail to see how that could be a justification of the trespass complained of, and it is not stated in the resolutions as a ground for directing his removal from his seat.\nThe learned judge who tried the cause left it to the jury to say whether the plaintiff was removed because he obstructed the business, or as a punishment for a contempt in refusing to apologize for a past offence. I quote the following paragraph from his charge: As the matter stands, you are to consider, whether, on the one hand, turning the plaintiff out at the time and in the manner proved was in point of fact necessary, on the ground that he was an obstruction to the business of the house, in which case he would have no right of action; on the other hand, whether, or not he was removed, not because he was such an obstruction, but merely for a contempt in refusing to make an apology for a past offence. If you find the latter to be the case, that is, that the exacting the apology was a penalty for a past offence, and that the plaintiff was turned out merely because he would not repeat that apology, though not obstructing the business, you ought to give him a verdict.\nI think the law thus laid down is correct, and that the finding of the jury ought to be sustained. The jury having found that the plaintiff was removed from his seat, because he would not repeat the apology for the past offence, and not because he was obstructing the business of the house, and as I consider that, in that view of the facts, the plaintiff has made out his case, and in law is entitled to retain his verdict, the tenth plea seems of little consequence. It would seem absurd to send down an issue to be tried when it must fail, either as to the facts or the law. It was stated on the argument, and not denied, as I understood it, that by the practice in Nova Scotia pleas may be withdrawn from the consideration of a jury by a judge at the trial, and that an issue so withdrawn from the jury is never sent down for another trial when the facts contained in it have been in effect passed upon by the jury.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nI think a series of authorities, binding on this Court, clearly establish that the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia has no power to punish for any offence not an immediate obstruction to the due course of its proceedings and the proper exercise of its functions, such power not being an essential attribute, nor essentially necessary, for the exercise of its functions by a local legislature, and not belonging to it as a necessary or legal incident; and that, without prescription or statute, local legislatures have not the privileges which belong to the House of Commons of Great Britain by the Lex et consuetudo Parliamenti. In this case, to afford a good defence, defendants were bound to allege, and prove, all the circumstances which made it right and proper for them to interfere with the Plaintiff at the time they caused him to be removed from his place in the House of Assembly,\u2014such interference being prima facie against right. The allegations and circumstances shown in this case afford, in my opinion, no justification for Plaintiff's removal; he was not then guilty of disorderly conduct in the House, or interfering with, or in any way obstructing, the deliberations or business, or preventing the proper action of the House, or doing any act rendering it necessary, for self-preservation or maintenance of good order, that he should be removed.\nThe Defendants cannot condemn and punish for one offence, and justify for another. We cannot look at what the Plaintiff may have said or done on previous occasions. It is possible there may have been occasions when his language and conduct may have been such as would, with a view to the preservation of good order, decorum, and the efficient discharge by members of their legislative duties, have justified action being taken by the House; but whether this may have been so or not cannot affect the present enquiry. The simple question now is, were Defendants justified in removing plaintiff for the avowed cause for which he was removed? The misconduct Plaintiff was charged with was having preferred a charge against the Provincial Secretary \"without adequate and sufficient evidence to sustain the same, or the proper or necessary preliminary investigation requisite to the formation of a correct opinion thereon,\" and for doing which the House resolved, Plaintiff \"had been guilty of a breach of privilege,\" and adjudged Plaintiff to appear at the Bar of the House, and, with the doors of the House open, make a certain dictated apology; which Plaintiff having declined to do the House then resolved, that it could not, consistently with its dignity, admit Plaintiff to take his seat until he complied with the order of the House, and that he be required forthwith to withdraw from the House until such apology be made. Plaintiff having declined to withdraw, the House then resolved, that Plaintiff be forthwith \"removed from the House by the Sergeant-at-Arms and be excluded therefrom, until he shall have signified to the Speaker that he is prepared to make the apology required by the House,\" and the Plaintiff, in pursuance of such resolution, was removed from the House by the Sergeant-at-arms and his assistant, two of the Defendants.\nIt appears that rumors were afloat relative to the Crown Land Office, and Plaintiff, as a member of the Legislature, went there for information, and, in consequence of what he there heard and discovered, in his place in the House of Assembly made the charge. If the Plaintiff believed, and had reasonable grounds for believing, the charge to be true, or honestly and fairly believed the public interests demanded that it should be investigated, and, in the bon\u00e2 fide discharge of his public duty, brought the matter in a decorous and proper manner under the consideration of the House, he was, no doubt, acting in the proper discharge of his duty as an independent representative of the people, and not open to reproach, still less punishment. When the charge was so made the House do not appear to have taken exception to the manner or language in which it was made (which under the circumstances might, and very possibly ought, to have been done), nor did the House require the Plaintiff to present a prim\u00e2 facie case, nor require to be stated any ground on which the charge was based, nor was the Plaintiff required to satisfy the House that there was reasonable or probable ground for the charge, nor did the House in any way resolve that the Plaintiff in making the charge, either as to manner or matter, was out of order; but, on the contrary, ordered the charge to be investigated by a committee, which committee, after investigation, found, and no doubt properly found, the charge unfounded, and that the evidence completely exculpated the Provincial Secretary. But a minority report stated reasons which, in the opinion of the member signing it, justified Plaintiff in demanding the investigation which had just then taken place. It is clear, that the mere fact that the evidence did not sustain the charge could not be a breach of privilege. If there were reasonable grounds for making the charge, then the Plaintiff performed but a public duty in laying it before the Legislature. Before the committee the Plaintiff appears to have offered evidence to show the information he received at the Crown Land Office, and which, he alleged, justified him in putting forward the charge and bringing it under the notice of the House; but this evidence a majority of the committee appear persistently and determinately to have refused to permit to be given, and the House, without further evidence or trial, or even calling on Plaintiff for an explanation, as Lord Denman expresses it, \"with one voice, accused, condemned and executed\" the plaintiff in this proceeding.\nI can see nothing whatever to justify this action of the House. They undertook to exercise judicial functions they clearly, under the authorities, did not possess. They had no power, for the cause alleged, to adjudge Plaintiff guilty of a contempt, or breach of privilege, and subject him to the galling punishment of making a most humiliating apology, not as a member in his place in the House, but as a culprit at the bar of the House, with the doors of the House open; still less ought this to have been done without calling on Plaintiff for any explanation, and without any evidence, trial or investigation whatever of the offence of which they adjudged him guilty.\nI think the verdict and judgment of the Court below right, and the damages, under the circumstances, moderate.\nStrong and Fournier, J. J., concurred.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nI must acknowledge the singularity of the position I occupy in the present case. If I decide in favor of the Appellants, I am consistent with myself, and I can safely say that my opinion is supported: 1st. By numerous judgments rendered in the same sense for the last seventy years without interruption in the Province of Lower Canada, now the Province of Quebec, by the highest court of law; 2nd. By several judgments rendered in England by the highest tribunal of the land; 3rd. By the judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States of America[77].\nIf, on the contrary, and on the strength of several judgments rendered in England overruling those hinted at by me as English decisions, I change my opinion, and am induced to reject the present appeal, I consider it would amount to a declaration on my part, that all our decisions in the Province of Quebec, as well as all the previous judgments rendered in England in the same sense, were against law. This proposition I cannot admit willingly.\nA short reference to the cases in which these judgments were rendered will certainly account for my fears of inconsistency with myself.\nThere were in February, 1832, at the city of Quebec, the two cases of the Queen v. Tracey and Duvernay[78], in which the Court of King's Bench unanimously decided, that the legislature of the then Province of Lower Canada possessed the power of committing for contempt in a case of libel by the press, and that this power was incident to that branch of the legislature (the Legislative Council) ex necessitate rei; that it had in itself the elements of its own preservation, did, in fact, possess those rights which are inherent to similar bodies, and without which it would be constantly exposed to contempt and destruction.\nThe same decisions as to the Province of Quebec, then Lower Canada, are to be found in the following cases as reported: 1st. Exparte Louis Lavoie,[79]; 2nd. Exparte Monk, in the year 1817[80]; 3rd. The case of Mr. Young, in 1793; 4th. The case of exparte Dansereau, in 1875, in which case I sat as a member of the Court of Appeals of the Province of Quebec[81].\nAs to the English cases, I quote Burdett v. Abbot[82], and Beaumont and Barrett[83]. But these last English cases were, to a certain extent, overruled by the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Kielley v. Carson,[84].\nI, for one, have the greatest respect for all the decisions of the highest court of England, and should consider myself bound by the judgment in Kielley v. Carson, as one of the last leading decisions, were it not for a material difference I observe between that and the present case, which was one of contempt committed within the House, and during its sittings, and not one merely of contempt committed outside of the House. I infer this difference from the summary of the report and the reasons of Baron Parke in Kielley v. Carson, above mentioned.\nThe contempt complained of in the present case was committed within the House, and during its sittings. It was incumbent on the House, I apprehend, to notice the contempt, and it was accordingly done. The words made use of by the Respondent on the occasion in question were uttered by him as a member of the House, and were of such a character as to be derogatory to the honor of the House, and particularly to that of one of its members, who was accused by the Respondent of no less a crime than that of forgery. The House could at once pass a sentence of condemnation against him for using such language, so derogatory to its dignity, and so offensive to one of its members, and so calculated to disturb the proceedings of the assembly and to create disorder; but the House thought it more fitting to challenge the accusation by appointing a committee to enquire into and report on the circumstances of the case. The committee reported that the respondent had no grounds whatever to justify such an accusation, and ordered him to make an apology to the House, which, it is true, was a written one, and on his refusal to make the apology he was expelled from the House. Now, I do not think, that should our decision be against the Respondent, it would be contrary to that of the Privy Council in Kielley v. Carson, which was, as I said, for a contempt outside of the House. Had the House allowed this conduct of the Respondent to pass unchallenged, it would have exposed itself to the mockery of the public, it would have been a cruel treatment of one of its members, and exposed the future legislation of the Province to such a danger as to deter candidates for parliamentary honors from coming forward, The sentence of expulsion was not for a past or condoned offence, but for a continuing offence from the first moment of the Respondent's utterance of an unfounded accusation. It was a necessity for the House to resent the charge, and protect one of its members, after enquiry, which was, in fact, due to the Respondent himself, and to the member against whom it was preferred. So far, it seems evident to me, that the case of Kielley v. Carson, far from being adverse to the pretensions of the appellants, does, in fact, support them.\nBut a new feature, and, I may say, a great complication, has been brought into the case by the judgment of the Privy Council in England in the case of Doyle v. Falconer[85], which judgment is to the effect, that the Legislature of Dominica did not possess the power of punishing a contempt, even if committed in its presence and by one of its members. I am forced to submit to this judgment of the highest tribunal of England in Doyle v. Falconer. This judgment being the last on the subject is binding on this court, as much as the ruling in Kielley v. Carson, before its overruling by Doyle v. Falconer[86], would have been. I, therefore, declare, though most unwillingly, in favor of a confirmation of the judgment appealed from.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nWhilst agreeing with the general conclusions arrived at by my learned brethren, but holding views in some respects different, I have considered it right to express them. The Law of Parliament is defined by Coke[87] and Blackstone[88], those eminent legal authorities, thus: \"As every Court of Justice hath laws and customs for its direction, some the civil and canon, some the common law, others their own peculiar laws and customs; so the High Court of Parliament hath also its own peculiar law, called the Lex et consuetudo Parliamenti.\" \"This law,\" says May, in his treatise on the law, privileges, proceedings and usage of Parliament[89], \"is admitted to be part of the unwritten law of the land, and as such, is only to be collected, according to the words of Sir Edward Coke, 'Out of the rolls of Parliament and other records, and by precedents and continued experience.'\"\n\"The only method,\" says Blackstone[90], \"of proving that this or that maxim is a rule of the common law, is by showing, that it hath always been the custom to observe it,' and \"it is laid down as a general rule that the decisions of Courts of Justice are the evidence of what is common law.\" After quoting the foregoing, May says: \"The same rule is strictly applicable to matters of privilege and to the expounding of the unwritten law of Parliament;\" and adds, \"but although either House may expound the law of parliament, and vindicate its own privileges, it is agreed that no new privilege can be created.\" As far back as 1704 it was resolved and agreed by the House of Lords and House of Commons:\nThat neither Houses of Parliament have power, by any vote or declaration, to create to themselves new privileges, not warranted by the known laws and customs of Parliament[91].\nThe Lex et consuetudo Parliamenti, by all the late decisions, have limits. They cannot be added to and new cases of privilege adjudged, even by the House of Commons of England. If that body punished for an offence, not one by the law and custom of Parliament, and thereby created a new privilege, is it to be said that there is at the present day no judicial tribunal to give relief, and that the resolution of the House of Commons should be above judicial enquiry? I cannot so think, for such would be contrary to the principles laid down by several learned judges in England, and now generally accepted as the rule and law. If the warrant of a Speaker, under an order of the House for the arrest of a member, or other party, disclosed on the face of it the nature of an alleged contempt, all the later decisions of the judges in England insist upon the right of the courts to inquire whether the grievance was or was not a contempt under the law and customs of Parliament, and such decisions, most pointedly expressed, have been long submitted to by the House of Commons. Lord Denman and other eminent judges held this doctrine, and it is not now questioned, and in one of his highly learned and exhaustive judgments on this point, he says there is no power in England above the law. If, therefore, the House of Commons has jurisdiction as a court only from the law and custom of Parliament, and the right to commit for a contempt is held to rest solely thereon, whence came the right of the Local Legislature of a Province to try and adjudicate upon a matter of alleged contempt? It cannot be claimed, that what the House of Commons, after centuries of political contests, with the voice of the nation to back it, found it necessary to assume in the peculiar relations existing, in the shape of judicial functions, which the nation ratified as necessary to curb and control judges more immediately under the control of despotic sovereigns, should be at all necessary or proper in regard to Provincial Legislatures. Involved in the latest and most learned decisions of the judges in England may be fairly assumed is the proposition, that the House of Commons depends solely on the law and custom of Parliament for its right to adjudicate for a contempt, and that, as a new privilege, it could not now be assumed. In the one case, the life of the Constitution of the country was often endangered, and might have been wholly lost, but for the assumption of this power by the House of Commons of England; in the other, no such consequences could arise. The Constitutions of the Provincial Legislatures were never subject to such perils. Derived from \"Orders in Council\" and \"Instructions\" to Lieutenant-Governors, and, of later years, from acts of Parliament, and the Provincial Judges being from the earliest times felt to be independent of executive interference, the same necessity never existed, as it did formerly in England, for a legislative balancing power over them.\nIt is claimed, as necessary to the proper discharge of their functions, that the Provincial Local Legislatures should have the right to adjudicate in regard to cases of alleged contempt in relation to those bodies; and the jurisprudence of the United States is referred to as a fitting guide to us; but the reasons that might be sound in regard to Congress and the State Legislatures do not at all justify the adoption of the same power by the Provincial Legislatures. While under the Constitution of the United States the General and State Legislatures are each, in its proper sphere, paramount, and have inherent constitutional rights and privileges, the Provincial Legislatures are now the creatures of an act of Parliament by which their functions are comparatively limited and confined to certain subjects, and which, by other acts of Parliament, may be abridged or altered, from time to time.\nI cannot discover how any Provincial Assembly could obtain any right to exercise judicial functions, unless by legislation; for there are no laws or customs peculiar to each which would give the right by which an alleged contempt could be tried. Without receiving by legislation the same power as is exercised by the House of Commons, and without law or custom of Parliament of their own to warrant such a trial, how did they get it? I have tried in vain for any source from which it could have come.\nIt is, however, contended, that the power to try one of its own members, or others, for a contempt, is necessary to the due exercise of its functions by a Provincial Assembly. I confess I cannot see it. It is admitted on all sides that such Legislative Assembly can exercise the right of ejection of a member from the legislative hall, if necessary to the carrying on of debate or business, and may continue to exclude him so long as his presence is an obstacle to the exercise of the functions of the body. The body can, for like cause, remove every other impediment to its legitimate business, and if proceedings should be taken to recover damages for such ejection or removal, the justification will depend on the necessity. It is objected, however, that a member may continue to obstruct, and it would, therefore, be necessary to have him expelled or ejected for a given time. It is true, that such a contingency might arise, but the same might be apprehended to arise in other bodies where obstruction would be relatively as injurious as in a Provincial Assembly. In the numerous civic organizations throughout the Dominion it is not less necessary that obstructions by members, or otherwise, should be prevented, and the same may be said of church and other meetings where order is to be preserved. In none of these does the right exist to try a member, or another, for a contempt, and still there is no complaint that the functions of any of those bodies have been obstructed in consequence of the absence of that power. The comparatively few cases that are found in Provincial and Imperial records as to Provincial cases would be a strong argument against the necessity for the exercise of the power to adjudicate upon charges of contempt. One of the most important principles underlying the successful and proper administration of justice is, that those who pass upon the facts, and those who expound the law, should be without interest or prejudice; and how, then, are such principles maintained when the same excited (it might be political) majority occupied at the same time the position of accusers and judges. I am told such is the case in the House of Commons in England; but I answer, first, that a body like the latter, numbering hundreds, drawn from the first-class men of the kingdom, actuated by the highest aspirations, and supported, resting on and reflecting, day by day, the highest toned public opinion, is not to be compared with a Provincial Assembly, drawn, as a rule, not from the ranks of first-class public men, and whose numbers, being comparatively small, may be expected to become more bitterly excited by political squabbles, and whose supporters on both sides, out of the Legislature, would, in many cases, subordinate their judgments to their political proclivities, and thus a suitable controlling public opinion could not safely be relied on. It is well understood that it is an anomalous power that is exercised by the House of Commons in England. It obtained it through the exigencies of stirring political events, running over centuries, no parallel to which can ever arise in any Province under the British Crown, and for which, therefore, neither a preventive or remedy, through a Provincial Assembly, will ever be necessary. The trial of contested elections has, after centuries, been withdrawn from Parliament in England, and also in Canada, and transferred to the ordinary legal tribunals because of the difficulty in obtaining in the former a disinterested and reliable tribunal. The parliamentary records of all countries exhibit ample proof of this. Those records exhibit, however, glaring cases of arbitrary and high-handed injustice to individuals whose humiliation it suited the interest of partizan majorities to procure. Public opinion in England long ago frowned down such proceedings, but, I fear, such a public feeling would be found totally inadequate therefor in many Provinces of the Empire for many years to come. I am, from these considerations, strongly of opinion, that to deny to Provincial Assemblies the power to adjudicate on cases of alleged contempts would be, if an evil, a much less one than might result from admitting it.\nThe case of Kielley v. Carson[92], referred to by the learned Chief Justice, to my mind, virtually settles this point. It is founded on principles previously expounded and approved, and which have continued to be approved and acted on ever since. I could not, if I would, run in the face of that judgment and the subsequent decisions in conformity with its principles. We might, under the law as now administered in England, consider the nature of the alleged contempt; and, I must confess, that were the jurisdiction of the Assembly sufficient, I would experience great difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the cause assigned was a sufficient one. I can hardly agree to the propositions that a member making, in his place, a charge against another member who is a public officer\u2014even, if by accident a member of a Local Government\u2014but failing in sustaining it before a tribunal selected at the instance of the accused to try it, would be guilty of a breach of privilege because of such failure; or, that the Hence, or a majority of it, composed as it might be of the political friends of the accused, on the report of two of a committee of three, which formed the tribunal before mentioned, resolving that such charge was made without sufficient inquiry, could legally require the accuser to adopt, and, at the bar of the House, read and make an apology to the House in certain words and terms prescribed; or, that his refusal to do so was a contempt of the House, and that he should be ejected from and kept out thereof until he informed the Speaker of the House that he was prepared to make that apology. A great deal might possibly be urged on both sides of the propositions just mentioned, but they are subordinate to the question of jurisdiction raised, and our decision as to that renders anything further respecting them unnecessary. I, therefore, agree that the appeal herein be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellants: Robert L. Weatherbe.\nSolicitor for Respondent: Samuel E.

Q.)\u2014Multiplicity of charges\u2014Bribery and undue influence-\u2014Agency\u2014\u2014Dringing on Nomination and Polling days.\nThe petition was in the usual form, charging bribery and corruption on behalf of Respondent and of his agents; and treating by Respondent's agents on the nomination and polling days. In the bill of particulars, the petitioners formulated ninety-eight different charges, but, in appeal, they only insisted upon seventeen charges, seven of which attached personally to the Defendant, and ten to his agents. The Respondent was examined on his own behalf, and there were, in all, 280 witnesses heard.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Montreal dismissing the petition on all the charges, was unanimously affirmed, except as to the charge of bribery and undue influence by one Robert, hereafter more particularly referred to; and it was\nHeld: 1st. That the evidence of a candidate on his own behalf in the Province of Quebec is admissible.\n2nd. That when a multiplicity of charges of corrupt practices are brought against a candidate, or his agents, each charge should be treated as a separate charge, and, if proved by one witness only and rebutted by another, the united weight of their testimony, without accompanying or collateral circumstances to aid the Court in its appreciation of the contradictory statements cannot overcome the effect of the evidence in rebuttal, and that, in such a case, the candidate is entitled to the presumption of innocence to turn the scale in his favor.\n3rd. That drinking on the nomination or polling day is not a corrupt practice sufficient to avoid an election, unless the drink is given by an agent on account of the voter having voted or being about to vote.\n(39 Vic, ch. 9, sec. 94 D., compared with 17 & 18 Vic, ch. 102, ss. 4, 23 & 36 Imp.)\n4th. That a candidate, charged by his opponent with having no influence, is not guilty of a corrupt practice, if, in a public speech, in reply to the attack, he states \"that he had had influence to procure more appointments for the electors of the County than any member.''\nThe evidence on the Robert charge was to the following effect: Robert, long before the election was thought of, together with members of his family (the Pare family), exhibited a strong desire to obtain an employment for his brother-in-law the Edouard Honor\u00e9 Ouellette. Robert, being a political supporter, a client and a personal friend of Mr. Laflamme, asked him on different occasions if he could procure his brother-in-law {Ouellette) a place. The first time he spoke to him with reference to it was about a year previous to the election but he did not say anything to him on that occasion about his father-in-law (Par\u00e9), Roberts evidence on this part of the case then goes on as follows: \" Q. On what occasion did you speak to him (Mr. Laflamme) about it? A. It was when the question of an election arose that I spoke to him about it. Q. Last fall? A. Yes. Q. What was the date at which you spoke to him regarding the Pare family? A. I cannot positively say, but it was four or five weeks before there was question of the election It was then spoken of in the County and out of the County. Q. That was during the election? A. Yes. 0. At all events it was at the time the election was spoken of? A. Yes. 0. \"What did you say to him regarding your brother-in-law and your father-in-law? A. I went to see Mr. Laflamme on different occasions, when I had some accounts to give him to collect and I said to him: It would greatly please the par\u00e9 family if you could procure a place for my brother-in-law.' Q. Did you say to Mr. Laflamme in what way it would please the par\u00e9 family? A. I said this to him: ' It might, perhaps, prevent them from voting at the coming election.' Q. When you told Mr. Laflamme that the Par\u00e9 family could be useful to him by not voting what 15\u00bd did Mr. Laflamme say? A. He simply told met that he would think of me, and that if a vacancy occurred, he would do his best for me \"Mr. Laflamme, on the other hand states \"He (Robert) had asked me, not during the election, but many months before, I believe, so far as my memory goes, a year before there was any talk of an election, to try and secure some office or occupation; with a slight remuneration, for his brother-in-law (Mr. Ouellette.) I told him that I would consider his claims; that he was one of my best supporters; and, if I saw any occasion where it would be possible for me to support his claim, I would do so. The thing remained in that way; and previous to the election particularly, there was never one word said or breathed on that subject between Mr. Robert and myself. I never asked him to use this promise, and never intended to do so it Was merely because he was a personal friend of mine and a man of respectability and importance that I promised to consider his claim, as I was justified as the Representative of the County in doing.\"\nEvidence was given that Robert attended three or four meetings of Respondent's Committee, organized at Lochia the checked lists and reported his acts to some of the members of the Committee.\nBefore the election, Robert repeated to the Pare family what had taken place between him and Mr. Laflamme. At the time of the election Robert, while conversing with the Par\u00e9s in the family circle, was informed by one of them \" they would vote for Girouard (the defeated candidate), but that they would not make use of their influence.\" He then told them \"Do as you please: they will use your votes as an objection to giving Mr. Ouellette a place.\u201dThis conversation was not reported by Robert to any member of the Respondent's Committee.\nHeld. 1. That the Respondent, having a perfectly legitimate motive in promising Robert to try and get an office for his brother-in-law\u2014his desire to please a political friend and supporter was not guilty of a corrupt act in making such promise; and further, that the act of Robert, in relation to the votes of the Pare family, even if a corrupt one, was not committed with the knowledge and consent of the Respondent.\n2. That whether Robert was Respondent's agent or not the conversations which took place between him and the Pare family do not sufficiently show a corrupt intent on his part to influence their vote and that he is not guilty of bribery or undue influence within the meaning of the Statute. [Richards, C.J., and Strong, J., dissent.] Per Richards. C. J. and Strong, J that there was sufficient evidence to declare Robert to be one of Respondent's agents. [Henry, J, dissents.]\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Mr. Justice Dorion, of the Superior Court for Lower Canada, district of Montreal, dismissing the election petition against the return of the Honorable R. Laflamme as the member elect representing the County of Jacques Cartier, in the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada.\nThe election took place on the 28th November, 1876, and the petition against the return of the Respondent was fyled on the 8th day of January following; and on the 8th of July the judgment of the learned Judge in the Court below dismissing the petition was delivered.\nThe petition was in the usual form, charging bribery, corruption and undue influence on behalf of Respondent and of his agents.\nIn their bill of particulars and the additions which they made to them during the trial, the Petitioners brought ninety-eight special charges against the Respondent or his agents.\nEvidence in support of these charges was given by one hundred and eighty witnesses on behalf of the Petitioners and over one hundred were heard on behalf of the Respondent. On the argument the Petitioners abandoned 77 of their accusations and insisted upon 21 charges, eight of which attached personally to the Defendant, and thirteen to his agents.\nBefore the Supreme Court the Appellants confined themselves to seventeen charges which are more fully set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice, and were known as:\u20141st. Paquin's case. Paquin was a ferryman and conductor of the mails between Isle Bizard and Ste. Genevieve, upon whom Respondent was alleged to have exercised undue influence in a conversation with reference to the mail 2nd. Foley's case\u2014a day laborer employed by the Public Works Department on the Lachine Canal, whom the Respondent is accused of having sought to intimidate for having answered him \"it is all right,\" when informed by Foley that he did not intend to work for or against him, or to vote for him; 3rd. Chaurett\u00ea's case \u2014a charge of personal corruption against the Respondent for having had Chaurette appointed returning officer; 4th. Lafleur's case\u2014a voter, who was advised by Respondent to vote if his name was still upon the votes s list, although actually possessing no other qualification to be a voter, accused of personating; 5th. The Ouellette case\u2014the only charge on which the Court was not unanimous in affirming the finding of the Court below. In the bill of particulars the charge is in these words:\u2014\"Pending the said election at Lachine the said Placide Robert grocer of the same place, and agent of the Respondent, acting with his special knowledge and instruction promised a situation to Francois Par\u00e9 and Alphonse Par\u00e9, both electors at Lachine, for the said Edouard Honor\u00e9 Ouellette son-in-law of the said Francois Par\u00e9, and also to the latter personally, if the said Francois and Alponse Pare would refrain from voting at the said election, and if the said Edouard Honor\u00e9 Ouellette would use his influence in favor of the Respondent; and that, in fact, the said Francois and Alphonse Pare refrained from voting at the said election. \" 6th. Corrupt treating by Respondent and his agents, under which charge arose the question if treating by agents on the nomination or polling day is a corrupt practice when the drink has not been given on account of the voter having voted or being about to vote; 7th. Speeches by Respondent, 1st at Pointe Claire, 2nd at Ste. Genevieve, 3rd at Isle Bizard, 4th at Ste. Anne 5th at St. Laurent, and 6th at Lachine; 9th. Speeches by agents; 10th.

Justinien Belanger', as agent of Respondent, is accused by one Augustin Hurtubise, of having offered him the keeping of light nouses, if h\u00e9 would be in favor of Respondent's party; 12th. Boudrias case\u2014an alleged offer of money by one Latour at the lock in St, Anns 13th.

Gravel's case\u2014Mr. Gohier, as Respondents agent, is charged with having corruptly given drink to one Jean Baptiste Gravel, to such an extent as to render him entirely insensible, with a view to prevent him from voting; 16th. Brunet's case\u2014agents of Respondent charged with having taken electors from Montreal to Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve in their vehicle, and treated and paid money to induce them to vote for Respondent and lastly, 17th. The Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve quarry case. The charges of this case are as follows:\" 1st. Conspiracy between Defendant's agents and Mr. Rodgers, proprietor and workers of the quarry, to threaten the quarrymen employed there with immediate dismissal if they voted against the Defendant, and to send to Pointe Claire on voting day those who persisted in voting against the Defendant; 2nd. Employment given to Fran\u00e7ois Meloche in the quarry to influence his vote; 3rd. W. S. Hemming Antoine St. Denis and Edouard St. Jean, Defendant's agents, threatened to turn out from their work in the quarry the voters who worked under their control, with the object of aiding the Defendant's election; 4th. The same agents, on the eve of voting, tried to send to Pointe Claire those men who persisted in desiring to vote against the Defendant, or in not abstaining from it.\nThe material facts of the charges above set out fully appear hereafter in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice; and as the evidence given in support and against these charges is reviewed at length in the judgments of the Court a separate statement is unnecessary.\nMr. Dalton McCarthy Q.C., and Mr. C. P. Davidson Q. C., for the Appellants, argued that the Respondent\u2019s evidence in his own behalf was inadmissible under the laws of the Province of Quebec, citing and commenting on 38 Vic., cap. 8, s. 56, Q.; 37 Vic., cap. 1, ss. 45, 49, D.; Art. 251, C. C. P.; Taylor on evidence ([1]); Gilbert sur Sirey ([2]); Soulanges, Shefford and Jacques Cartier election cases ([3]); and that treating by agents on the nomination or polling day is a corrupt act sufficient to avoid an election and referred to the Bodmin case ([4]) Car rickfergus case ([5]); The North Wentworth case ([6]); The North Grey case ([7]); The South Essex case ([8]); The Montreal West case ([9]); Mr. Justice Caron's opinion in the Portneuf case ([10]); and The Bonaventure case ([11]).

Monk contra; contended that all members of the House of Commons were to be tried by the same law; and that if the evidence of a Member was admissible in the Province of Ontario when his seat was contested, the evidence of a Member representing a County in the Province of Quebec was also admissible. He referred to and commented on The Dominion controverted Elections Act, 1874 ([56]); C. C. L. C. ([57]); C. C. P. L. C. ([58]).\nThe learned counsel then commented at length on the facts, and maintained that the judgment appealed from was based upon the most reliable appreciation of the evidence adduced, and that the numerous authorities cited by the Appellant's counsel were not applicable. The following, among many other statutory provisions and authorities were also cited and relied on:\n1st. As to the Ste.

As to accumulation of charges and appeals upon questions of fact: Muskoka case ([80]); Gray v. Turnbull ([81]); Gray v. Turnbull ([82]).\nMr. Dalton McCarthy, Q. C., replied.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Honorable Mr. Justice Dorion, of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, dismissing the petition of James Somerville and others complaining of the undue election and return of the Hon. Rodolphe Laflamme to the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada for the electoral district of Jacques Cartier in the Province of Quebec. Before this Court the charges Were formulated under seventeen different heads; and, I have no doubt in bringing the case before us, the parties have endeavored as well as they could, to arrange and distribute the large mass of evidence in the best manner to facilitate the consideration of it by us. And, I think they are entitled to the further credit of eliminating and discarding a large mass of evidence given in the Court below, which has relieved this Court from plodding through lengthy depositions (made longer and less intelligible by being taken down in the form of question and answer) the contents of which when understood and mastered would have been entirely useless.\nAfter the experience of nearly a quarter of a century in the judicial office, I may be permitted to say, that no cases have come before me which have caused the amount of labor care and perplexity that election cases have. No doubt one great cause of the difficulty to the Judge arises from the circumstances under which the witnesses give their evidence in these cases.\nAn election has been held, the passions and feelings of the electors of, perhaps, a large section of country have been excited to an extent which rarely prevails in this country, except during election contests. The supporters of either party have exerted their energies to the utmost for the success of their candidate, and the result is the return of a candidate as a member by a small majority. The friends of the unsuccessful candidate are at once impressed with the idea that they have been defeated by illegal and disreputable means, and they immediately endeavor to have the decision against them obtained by such means, reversed as speedily as possible. They file their petition, and then proceed before the election court to have the case tried. The heat and the excitement which prevailed in the electoral division is then transferred to the election court. The witnesses are too apt to shew by their conduct and their manner of giving evidence, that they are actuated by the same partizan feelings as witnesses that influenced them as voters and some of them act as if they thought they ought to support their party by their oaths as zealously as they did by their votes. The audience is often numerous and composed of partizans, whose feelings enter more or less into the legal contest as they did into the political one. All this adds much to the perplexity and difficulty of the Judge in evolving the truth from the testimony given by the excited witnesses. This difficulty is expressed in the language used by an election judge in Ontario, which I extract from a case now lying before me:\nThe difficulty which I have experienced in evolving truth from the greater part of this mass of evidence has been great beyond what can be conceived, arising from the fact that the manner in which many of the witnesses gave their evidence\u2014who, from the intimate connections with the Respondent in his business relations, and in connection with the canvass on his behalf should reasonably be expected to be able to place matters in a clear light\u2014has left an impression on my mind that their whole object was to suppress the truth ([83]).\nBut the Judge who tries the cause in the first instance has many advantages over those who are called upon to review his decision. He sees the witnesses hears their answers, sees whether they are prompt, natural, and given without feeling or prejudice, with an honest desire to tell the truth or whether they are studied evasive and reckless or intended to deceive As the case goes on the Judge is able to form a conclusion (oftentimes difficult to arrive at) which is more satisfactory to him than if he had been deprived of the opportunity of seeing or hearing the witnesses. Then again, if any misunderstanding arises as to what the witness has said, it can be put right at once. The object for which a witness is called, and the point to which his evidence is directed, is understood. If any doubt arises in the mind of the Judge as to what particular part of the case the testimony of the particular witness is to be directed, on application to the counsel that doubt can at once be solved. The views and opinions of the Judge in disposing of a case, who has these advantages in considering the evidence, are more likely to be correct than those of an Appellate Court who have not those advantages. I have endeavored to point out how profitable it is to have the living rather than the dead testimony as to which I shall presently give the language of the late Sir J. Coleridge. As I have already observed, these election cases impose great trouble and perplexity on the Judge, even under the most favorable circumstances. But when Courts are called upon, on appeal in these cases, to reverse the decisions of the Judge who tried the case on matters of fact, their labour and perplexities, are, as far as my experience goes, very much increased. After the testimony has been taken down, it may be submitted to the consideration of parties not engaged in the first trial, who may see points and discrepancies in the evidence not suggested at the trial l matters omitted, or rather not proven by evidence which were taken for granted and as to which if attention had been drawn to them, the difficulty could have been removed at once, these are brought forward, and the Appellate Court must consider them and also the conflicting evidence, without the advantage possessed by the Judge below. His views as to the proper decision arising from the effect of the whole of the evidence on his mind the manner of giving that evidence by the witnesses being an important element in leading his mind to the proper conclusion; and yet, perhaps, he could not say he believed one particular witness more than another and when the testimony is read, one witness would appear as much entitled to credence as the other. The difficulty of understanding and rightly appreciating a large mass of evidence, when it is only read, is thus referred to by the late Sir John T. Coleridge, in giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in The Queen v. Bertrand ([84]).\nThose of their Lordships who have been used. on motions for new trials, to hear the Judge's notes of evidence read, probably know well by experience how difficult it is to sustain the attention, or collect the value of particular parts, when that evidence is long; * * *But this is far from all. The most careful notes must often fail to convey the evidence fully in some of its most important elements, those for which the open oral examination of the witness in presence of prisoner, Judge and Jury, is so justly prized. It cannot give the look or manner of the witness, his hesitation, his doubts, his confidence or precipitancy, his calmness or consideration: nor could the Judge properly take on him to supply any of these defects. * * * It is, in short, or it may be, the dead body of the evidence, without its spirit which is supplied, when given openly and orally by the ear and eye of those who receive it.\nIn addition to this, when the evidence is taken down as it has been in this case, in the form of question and answer, it swells to an enormous bulk and the labour and perplexity of the Judge in understanding it is enormously increased. I think I can truly say that I have spent more time in endeavouring to master the details of the evidence in this case than in any that has ever come before me, and I have been compelled in doing so to transcribe nearly the whole of what is really the evidence that pertains to the case.\nAt the same time, as I have already intimated, it is but justice to the parties to say, that they have really endeavored to place the case before us relieved as much as they could relieve it, from a mass of matter which would have further increased our labours; and by the arrangement of the evidence under the different heads they have very much facilitated the reference to it as applicable to each particular case.\nThe first question for consideration is, whether the Respondent could, on the trial of the petition, give evidence for himself. As I understand the matter after the evidence in the cause was given the Respondent appeared before the Court on the second day of June and, being duly sworn, made the following declaration which is set out in the case as filed in this Court. After referring to many of the circumstances detailed in the evidence, and denying the statements made by some of the witnesses and explaining others, he concludes:\nThese are the only facts upon which I intend. to offer any explanations, but I am ready to answer any questions that may be put to me.\nRespondent's own counsel put a question. It was objected to by petitioners, on the ground of Respondent not being examined as a witness, but merely tendering his own declaration The objection was over-ruled and the question answered. The Petitioners declined to put any question to Mr. Laflamme, he not being a witness in the case. The statement of his evidence then concludes as that of all the other witnesses; \"And further deponent saith not.\"\nUnder sub. sec. 7 of the 3rd section of \"The Dominion controverted Elections Act of 1874,\u00b0 it is provided that subject to the provisions of that act, the Courts shall have the same powers, jurisdiction and authority, with reference to an election petition and the proceedings thereon, as if such petition were an ordinary cause within its jurisdiction. In any election case in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, I apprehend that the usual \"practice in suits in that Court would be pursued, except when the provisions of the Controverted Elections Act may make a difference. In relation to S the examination of the parties to the suit in an ordinary case, they cannot, as I understand, in the Province of Quebec, offer themselves as witnesses; and if that practice is to be followed in election cases in that Province the Petitioners may properly urge that the evidence of the Respondent should be excluded.\nNo one at all familiar with these cases can doubt, that it is of the greatest importance that the Respondent should be able to give testimony on his own behalf on the trial of an election petition. Many circumstances during the progress of an election contest arise which can only be satisfactorily explained by the Respondent; and it is certainly desirable that his testimony should be heard as well on his own behalf as against himself. The history of the legislation on the subject is a brief one. The statute for trying election petitions before judges was passed in England in 1868. The Dominion Statute for the same purpose was passed in 1873, adapting the English Statute to the state of things existing in the Dominion. The Legislature of Ontario adapted the English Act to the circumstances of that Province, and passed their Statute in 1871, in February; and the general election for that Province was held in the month of March of the same year. A number of cases arose out of that election and were tried before the Judges of the Superior Courts of Law and Equity in Ontario. So that at the time of the passing of the Dominion Statutes in 1873 and 1874 the course of procedure in the trying of these petitions in England, and which was followed in Ontario must have been known to the framers of those statutes; and it seems to me that they intended that the same course should be followed here that prevailed in England, so far as could be consistently with the Act and the rules to be made under it. Now, the practice which prevailed in England at that time on these trials before the Judges was to hear the parties as witnesses; and the reading of the cases there decided shows how desirable it was that they should be witnesses. I think the reference in the Statutes to the manner in which these election petitions, touching the election of the members of the House of Commons, are dealt with in England, shows that it was intended the same course should be followed here. Under the 44th section of the Dominion Statute of 1874, power is given to the Courts to make general rules and orders for the effectual execution of the Act and the intention and object thereof, and the regulation of the practice and procedure and costs with respect to election petitions, and the certifying and reporting thereon. And the 45th section provides that until the rules have been made by the Judges of the several Courts in pursuance of the Act,\nAnd as far as such rules do not extend the principles, practice and rules on which election petitions touching the election of members of the House of Commons in England) are at the time of the passing of this Act dealt with, shall be observed by the Courts and Judges thereof.\nIt will be observed that the authority to make rules refers to the regulation of the practice, procedure and costs. But the 45th section refers to the principles as well as the practice, and I think contemplates something beyond the new rules that were intended to be made.\nThere has been some discussion as to the effect of this word principles in the section of the English Statutes which refer to the decisions of election committees, but I cannot say that it throws much light on the subject we have now to consider. I think we will not be going beyond what the legislature had in view, by requiring the Courts to observe the practice and principles on which election petitions were dealt with in England, in holding that the parties to an election petition touching the election of a member of the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada, can be witnesses on the trial of the petition and examined on their own behalf. I believe that practice has prevailed in the cases tried throughout the Dominion, and, as far as I understand the question, has never been raised, either in the Province of Quebec, or any other Province, until it was brought up in this case.\nThe Local Act, ([85]) for the trial of controverted elections in the Province of Quebec provides that the rules of evidence in the local election cases shall follow the English Law.\nI do not think the provisions of the Dominion Statute, relative to preliminary examination of parties, and the production of documents, afford any argument against a party being called as a witness or examined on his own behalf. It merely enables a party to be examined before the trial and the information so obtained may induce the petitioner to abandon his petition or the facts elicited may be of such a character that the Respondent will be advised to abandon the seat. It is similar to proceedings which may be adopted in Chancery and under the Common Law Procedure Act, but these proceedings do not in any way interfere with the party so being examined becoming a witness on the trial. I therefore think we may consider the Respondent's declaration under oath properly receivable in this case.\nThe first case referred to in the factum is Paquin's case.\nThe evidence is to the effect that\nMr. Laflamme asked him (Paquin) what he intended to do about the election. He answered: \"I cannot do anything for I have already had troubles about that.\"Whereupon Mr. Laflamme said,\" I have already been the means of establishing a post office at Isle Bizard, and you have been appointed mail carrier; if you do not sign for me, . do not sign against me.\" \"He then asked me,\"says Paquin, \"if I was going to sign at all. I answered I was not, and that is all that was said.\"\nMr. Trepannier, a witness, said:\nMr. Laflamme asked him, Paquin, \u201c what are you going to do this year?\" He answered: \" I have already had troubles; I don't vote this year.\" Mr. Laflamme said, \"if you do not vote for me, you will not hurt me by not voting at all. \" Mr. Paquin said, \" I will not vote at all.\" Mr. Laflamme said to him: i it was through me that you got the mail.\"\nI do not consider these words, used by Respondent, were calculated or intended to intimidate; at most they seem to me to be addressed to the man to convince him he ought not to vote against him (Mr. Laflamme), because he, as representing the County, had got the mail established at that place, and that it was through him that he got the mail. I have seen no case going so far as to say that this is intimidation or undue influence. I, therefore think in this matter the decision of the learned Judge was corret.\nFoley's case.\nFoley's evidence is to the following effect: Michael Conway, the Superintendent of the Lachine Canal, came to his (Foley's) house in Lachine on Saturday afternoon, and informed him that he understood that a party had made a complaint in Mr. Laflamme's office about his (Foley's) working for the government, and not supporting the government candidate. Conway said he must come in and make it all right with Mr. Laflamme, or he would have to discharge him. Foley said he was not going to take any part in the election. He had always worked on the Conservative side He did not take any part in the election.\nOn reexamination, Foley repeated: He told me he heard I was going to be discharged, and that I had better go and see Mr. Laflamme. I said, I did not know where Mr. Laflamme's office was. He said he would meet me at the station, which he did on Monday morning, and we both went down to Laflamme's together, and he (Conway) introduced me to Mr. Laflamme.\nConway sat down and remained during the interview. He (Foley) said he went to Mr. Laflamme's office to tell Mr. Laflamme he need not thank him for coining there, as he was not going to vote for or against him. In reply to a question, he said:\nI told him of course, that I was working for the government, and did not want to take any part in the election, and that I was not going to vote for him. I said if that would do, it would be all right, but if it was not they could do as they pleased about discharging me. He said that would do.\nIn answer to another question, he said:\nI did not tell him how I was going to vote. I told him I was not going to vote for him; that I would not work on either side. I think he said it was all right if I did not work on either side, but remained quiet.\nHe thought Mr. Laflamme knew he was a Conservative and that he had voted against him at a former election\nHe added:\nWhat Conway said to me was told as a friend.\nMichael Conway said:\nI heard it reported that Foley was going to take an active part against the Government candidate, and as he was employed under the Government, I thought it my duty, as a friend of Foley, and as a Superintendent of the Canal, to tell him, that as he was making his living there, I did not think it was wise for him to take an active part against Mr. Laflamme, and that if he took my advice he would vote for whom he 'pleased, and not take an active part in it at all. I make it a point to make my men attend to their business and not take active parts in elections. I made no objection to his working in the election whatever; I simply gave him my advice. It was rumored around he was going to take an active part in the election. I swear I did not advise him not to vote. The promise I got from Foley was, that he was going to see Mr. Laflamme and see what he was going to do. He suggested it himself, and I went with him to introduce him to Mr. Laflamme, and to show him that the man did not intend to interest himself in the election but attend to his work\".\nNo person, to the knowledge of the witness Conway, made any complaint against Foley. It was rumored. He said:\nI introduced him to Mr. Laflamme, and he told Mr. Laflamme he was employed by the Government, and that he heard he was going to lose his place. He told Mr. L, he did not intend to work for or against him; or to vote for him. I think Mr. Laflamme said he was perfectly satisfied.\nIn answer to a question, he said:\nWhen I first saw him (Foley) I went to his house, and told him there was a great deal of noise about his going to take an active part in opposition to the Government candidate: and, as he was employed by the Government, I thought it would not be advisable for him to take an active part in the matter more than to vote for whom he pleased. Foley said: I will go and tell Mr. Laflamme that I am not going to work for or against him; or vote for him.\nOn cross-examination, he said:\nI did not tell Foley that I heard he was going to be turned off. I told him, I heard it rumored he was going to take a very active part on the other side; and, he being employed by the Government, I told him as a friend, not to interfere, but to attend to his work, and vote for whom he pleased. It was not the purport of what I said to him that it was reported in the office that he was going to be discharged if he took any part in the election. I did not say so, nor did I mean it.\nFoley states he voted at the election.\nIn relation to this case we must confine ourselves strictly to what took place in Mr. Laflamme's presence. If Foley had said to Mr. Laflamme, \" Mr. Conway informs me a complaint has been made against me in your office about my working for the Government and not supporting the Government candidate, and that I must come and make it all right with you, or he will discharge me;\" and had further said, \" he did not want to take any active part in the election, but he was not going to vote for him; and, if that would do, it would be all right; but if it did not, they could do as they pleased about discharging him.\" If Mr. Laflamme had, after that, boldly said ' that would do,\" I think that would afford strong grounds for assuming that he knew and approved of the threat that Foley would be discharged if he exercised his franchise. I doubt if what he did say ought fairly to lead to the same conclusion. Mr. Laflamme might have thought this man had some idea that if he did not support the Government candidate he would be dismissed, and came to him to tell him what he intended to do, and to see what Mr. Laflamme would say to that. The answer \" that would do, \" I do not think necessarily implies if he did vote he would be dismissed.\nConway's account of what took place in Mr. Laflamme's office does not differ much from that of Foley.\nIf Mr. Laflamme had been made aware that direct threats had been made to discharge Foley, if he did not satisfy him, it would have been his duty to have informed Foley that he had not authorised any such threats to be made, and that he entirely disapproved of them. Whilst the law would not require him to tell an elector, situated as Foley was, to do all he could against him, it required that he should not approve of threats being used to deter the elector from the exercise of his franchise.\nI think it would not have been out of place for him to have told Mr. Conway it was not his duty to bring the workmen on the canal to his office to explain what they intended to do, to see if that would be satisfactory. If, as a friend of Foley\u2014the latter having been represented as an active partizan against Mr. Laflamme\u2014he thought it was unseemly for him in the position he occupied to take an active part in. politics, and as his friend advised with him, not threatening him, not to make himself conspicuous; if, on such friendly advice, Foley had assured him he did not intend to take a part in politics, he might, as such friend, have assured Mir. Laflamme that the representation that Foley was active against him was untrue. But bringing Foley to Mr. Laflamme's office to answer, as it were, a charge against him, certainly looks as if it was intended he should be impressed by the interview. Conway denies having told Foley that, if ho did not make it all right with Mr. Laflamme, he would discharge him. If the case were to turn on what Conway told Foley, I would hesitate before giving credence to Conway's rather than Foley's account of it. Foley did go to Mr. Laflamme's office. Conway did accompany him, and he did explain to Mr. Laflamme that he did not intend to take any part in the election, and he did allude to the circumstance that his course as to the election might lead to his discharge, \" to losing his place.\" The demeanor of the two men would, of course, assist in determining which of the two statements should be most relied on. Conway according to his account of the transaction, was a high toned public officer, who, whilst allowing every man to exercise his right of voting freely, thought it unseemly for persons in the employ of the government to take an active part in politics; and having heard that Foley was taking an active part against the government candidate, as his friend, went to advise him not to render himself obnoxious by such a course; and, as his friend, and at Foley's request, went with him to show him where Mr. Laflamme's office was, to enable him to explain to that gentleman the course he intended to pursue; and that he did not threaten to discharge him if he did not make it all right with Mr. Laflamme. I must confess, on reading the whole of the evidence given by Foley and Conway, that this view of the case did not seem to me the most correct one to take. I do not see, however, that I can, on the evidence, consider Conway Mr. Laflamme' s agent. It is true he was in favor of Mr. Laflamme, and probably brought some voters to the poll for him, and asked others if they were going to vote for him. I do not consider Conway bringing Foley to Mr. Laflamme's office so made him aware that Conway was acting for him, as to constitute him an agent for whose acts he was responsible.\nI therefore, as to this charge, think we should decide in favor of Respondent.\nChaurette's case\nIn his evidence Chaurette says he met Mr. Laflamme at Pointe Claire on the nomination day, and he said to him:\nI have heard that you would not put your name to propose me. I answered, it is true.\" He then said to me: \u201cI have appointed you Deputy Returning Officer.\nFurther on he said, in answer to the question:\nDid you tell him that you could not vote for him? Answer \u201cYou know that I have always been for you.\"\nThe next question was:\nWas it upon that that he told you he had appointed you Deputy Returning Officer? Answer Mr. Laflamme and Mr. Anthem St. Denis coming on one side of the side walk and I on the other, on nomination day, in passing Mr. Laflamme stopped and told me \" I have heard that you would not put your name to propose me,\" and I said to him: \" Yes, I do not like my name to appear.\" Upon that he told me \" I have appointed you Deputy Returning Officer,\" and I answered him, \" that will be the way to keep me quiet;\" because I was appointed Deputy Returning Officer, and being appointed as such I remained quiet, but I did not lose my right of voting. Nevertheless, one may get excited during elections and be glad to find friends.\nOn cross examination he stated:\nBefore the nomination day I did tell some of Mr. Laflamme's friends that I would vote for him but that I would not sign his nomination ticket. I did not like to come forward. Mr. Laflamme might have known before the nomination day that I was for him. 1 told him to leave me alone and that I would always be the same man, but that I would not work. My appointment as Returning Officer did not change my opinion.\nIt does not strike me that this evidence shows that Chaurette was bribed to support Mr. Laftamme by his being appointed Deputy Returning Officer. The difficulty has arisen from Mr. Laflamme saying he had appointed Chaurette Deputy Returning Officer. I should have thought it was the duty of the Returning Officer to appoint his deputies, under the 28th section of The Dominion Elections Act of 1874 and that it was a matter in which the candidates would not interfere The law casts the duty on the Returning Officer, and he ought to make the selection of proper, qualified persons without reference to the candidates. It is of great importance that these officers should be men who would not be influenced in the discharge of their duties by political feeling or prejudice; and if it is understood they are to be the nominees of a candidate, the public will not have the same confidence in them as if selected by the Returning Officer himself from those he consider qualified by intelligence and honesty to discharge the duties properly. It seems to me the Returning Officers ought to make their own selections of their deputies, and be held responsible for their selections.\nLabeur\u2019s case.\nThis voter, who is accused of personation, is an advocate and resides in Montreal. His father of the same name is a farmer and resides at Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve. In 1875, the son was the owner of property in the parish and voted at the election for the Local Parliament the father had property in the village of St Genevi\u00e8ve, and in the parish, and his name was on the two lists of voters. The son sold his property which was in the parish in the fall of 1875, and the question arose, whether, having sold his property, he could vote supposing his name to be on the list, and whether his name was really on the list, though the person whose name was mentioned on the list was described as a farmer, the voter being an advocate. It appeared from the evidence that the land which the younger Lafleur had owned was on Main Street, and that of the elder Lafleur was described \" Property on the Main Street;\" and the property formerly owned by the younger Lafleur would be described in the same manner, but the name would not be the same. I suppose this means the father would be \" farmer.\" The property was sold to Mr. Gauthier. His name was not on the list. The Secretary-Treasurer of the Corporation, in reply to a question, said this property, which did belong to Mr. Lafleur, advocate, was not mentioned on the list. I think by this is meant unless coming within the description put opposite the elder Lafleur's name. One of the questions referred to was, whether the younger Lafleur's name, having been on the list for 1875, it could properly be removed without giving him notice. It is not contended that the young man pretended to be the father, but that he pretended to be the man whose name was on the list and he was not that man The man named on this list was either his father or himself; he, in fact, contended it was himself. If there had been a mistake in putting farmer as the matter of description of the person, then young Lafleur might honestly have supposed he had a right to vote; and if the name was not intended for him then the land he had owned was not assessed at all as I understand it. I do not think it appears in a manner at all satisfactory that these parties did not believe young Lafleur had a right to vote. He thought so himself, and swore in his vote; and I do not think under the head of personation the legislature intended to deter a man from voting who claimed the right to vote on his own behalf and believed he had that right. If this young man had never owned this property, had never had a right to vote, and merely, because the name of his father being the same as his own, would insist on voting, though he was an advocate and his father a farmer and the Lafteur named was described as farmer, then it might be said in one sense he had been guilty of personation; or if the property were assessed to the man to whom he had sold it, and the entries had been all properly made, and the description of the land could only apply to his father, there would then be more ground for imputing wilful fraud. But I do not feel warranted in deciding against the Respondent as to personal complicity in the matter, or that the election should be avoided on account of anything done by his alleged agents in respect of this vote.\nAs to treating on election and nomination days.\nSection 94 of The Dominion Elections Act of 1874, 37 Vic, cap. 9, substantially re-enacts sections 4 and 23 of the Imperial Statute of 17 and 18 Vic, cap. 102. Section 4 is similar to the first paragraph of sec. 94 of the Dominion Act, and the last paragraph of that act is similar to sec 23 of the Imperial Statute. Tinder sec 36 of the Imperial Statute, corrupt treating avoided the election; and though under that act the candidate was not eligible for re-election for the same constituency during the existing parliament, and is still punishable in the same way for corrupt treating, yet he is not declared incapable of voting and holding certain civil offices, as he is by the subsequent act of the Imperial Parliament ([86]), for seven years when found guilty of bribery. But under, sec. 23 of the Imperial Statute of 1854, the persons giving refreshments to voters on polling days are only liable to the penalty of 40 shillings for each offence. Sec. 98 of the Dominion Statute declares any wilful offence against amongst others sec. 94 shall be a corrupt practice within the meaning of that act. Sec. 101 declares the election void when it is found on the trial of an election that any corrupt practice has been committed by any candidate or his agent at an election, and sec. 102 further punishes the candidate when such practices have been committed by or with the actual knowledge and consent of any candidate at such election The fact that a corrupt act has been committed must, of course, be proved at the trial of the election petition or of an indictment.\nMr. Justice Willes in the Bodmin case ([87]) refers to what he supposes was the reason of the 23rd section being introduced into the English Statute, when the 4th section referred to corrupt treating and punished it under the 36 section. The learned judge said :\nIt would seem to have been usual in former times, and no doubt was the practice, at least up to the year 1854, when the Corrupt Practices Act was passed, without any improper design upon the voters, and with a view to profusion, which some might dignify by the name of hospitality, to give every voter who came up pledged for a candidate at the election, or who voted for candidate, refreshment. either by opening a common table at some inn, where the voters breakfasted before they went to the poll or where they had refreshments before they left the town after polling, and before they returned to their homes.\nThe learned Judge then referred to Bodmin's case ([88]), where it was reported to the House that a system was pursued (which the learned Judge had no doubt was general) as soon as a voter had polled his vote of giving him a ticket for 5th. worth of refreshments. He then proceeds :\nI cannot help thinking that that was the sort of corrupt practice with which whether corrupt or not the Legislature was dealing in the 23rd section of the Statute; and, also, I am inclined to believe, though I cannot precisely cite my warrant for believing it, that where a farmer, for instance, came from a distance to vote at a County election, it was not uncommon to have such an open table as that to which I have referred, not for the purpose of catching people's vote by the attraction of the meal, but simply, as it was then thought, reasonable, and was not uncommon. If to give a voter something to eat on the day of poling had been in itself treating, the 23rd section would have been unnecessary\u2014the 4th section, dealing with corrupt eating, would have been sufficient to dispose of the case. Moreover, if it had been intended by the Legislature in making that sort of practice which prevailed here and elsewhere illegal, as no doubt it is now, by the 23rd section, to make it also amount to corrupt treating within the meaning of the 4th section, the Legislature would have so declared itself in the 23rd section.\nThis seems to me to explain the origin of the 23rd section of the English Statute, and the reason why it was passed. It is substantially re-enacted under the last paragraph of the 94th section of the Dominion Statute, and made a corrupt practice but to make it a corrupt act the meal, drink, or refreshment, must be given on the day of nomination, or on the polling day, and on account of the voter having voted, or being about to vote. This, perhaps, would make the illegal act a corrupt practice, though the refreshment was not given with a corrupt intent. The observations of Mr. Justice Willes shew clearly that it was not enacted for the purpose of preventing drinking on the nomination or polling days. The provisions in the Ontario Statute compelling the closing of taverns and shops where liquors are sold on election and nomination days and the furnishing and selling or giving away of liquors to any person within the municipality during the period mentioned, were evidently framed for a different purpose from the paragraph under discussion in the Dominion Statute.\nThe drinking on the nomination or polling day not being a corrupt practice, unless the drink was given on account of the voter having voted or being about to vote, and the evidence not shewing that the alleged drinking on those days was for any such reason, the question raised on that ground must be decided in favor of the Respondent. This view, I think, accords with the opinion expressed by Chief Justice Meredith in the Portneuf case ([89]), to which we were referred, and does not conflict with the decision of Mr. Justice Torrance in the case tried before him\u2014as I understand, the drink given in that case was on account of the voters having voted or being about to vote.\nCorrupt treating by Respondent and his agents,\nI have gone over the evidence carefully as to the treating by Respondent, and I do not think there is any case made out against him.\nThe first case referred to is treating on the nomination day at Charlebois' tavern, Lachine. I have already expressed my opinion that the last paragraph of sec. 94 of the Statute refers only to furnishing refreshments to electors, on account of the electors being about to vote or having voted. There several electors being present treated each other in turn. There is nothing to show it was done on account of their being about to vote within the meaning of the Statute. It is not pretended that Respondent treated hut that the treat was with his consent and approbation. The law applicable to the North Wentworth case was different. I don't think it appears that the drinking was with his consent or approbation, and if he had attempted to interfere he might have been properly told it was a matter which did not concern him; that is, if these gentlemen chose to ask each other to drink because they are friends and neighbours, and it was considered as a mere act of courtesy, which seems to have been the case.\nI fail to see that the Respondent drinking at Bellair\u2019s on the evening of the 22nd (if he did drink, which is not shewn with positive certainty,) was corrupt treating. Mr. Rodgers, who was a contractor, choose to treat all round, as he says, and it does not appear that his doing so would in any way corrupt the electors as to voting, or that it was intended for that purpose. I should not infer from reading the evidence of what occurred on that occasion, that there was any corrupt intent on the part of Rodgers, who was particularly referred to, nor any thing to show that in accepting the treat Mr. Laflamme, if he did drink with the rest, corrupted anybody or intended so to do.\nAs to corrupt treating by persons alleged to be Respondents agents, though there appears to have been more or less drinking during the canvass and about the time of the election, much of it appears to be of the character which prevails through the country when a number of people meet for purposes other than elections, such as horse races, and other meetings where there is a good deal of talking and discussion going on, and in the interludes between conversations some man calls for liquor a short time after another does the same and if the number of persons assembled is not too great, the habit, I apprehend, is to ask all who are near to join in drinking. If there are a great many people present they are apt to form into small knots, and so join in drinking. I do not think drinking under such circumstances can be called corrupt treating. There was not during this election, as far as I can understand, that profuse expenditure for drink that used to prevail to the great injury of all concerned in it. From the perusal of the whole of the evidence I do not think there can be any pretence that what would be called general treating prevailed at the election or during the canvass, and certainly none to the extent which would justify the setting aside the election on that ground. The amounts charged by Belair, the hotel-keeper at Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve and Sauv\u00e9 at Pointe Claire for board of parties acting on behalf of Mr. Laflamme, seems rather extravagant, and some money may have been spent there for drink during the election day. Mr. Doyon, whose expenses were paid by Respondent, and was one whose board he paid, speaks of treating, taking a couple of glasses of wine with whom he did not know on nomination day it may have been that he treated when Perry and Howard were at Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve and treated a few friends at Sauv\u00e9's on nomination day\u00bb He does say he never treated an elector during the whole time of the contest. He says he took some of the election money to pay those expenses (that is for treating). He, I assume, may have treated electors without knowing it. Without being quite satisfied with the explanations given by the witnesses as to this treating, particularly by persons who were strangers in the county and were there to act on behalf of Mr. Laflamme yet considering the custom of the county to which I have referred, I do not feel warranted in holding that the treating proved to have taken place was corrupt within the meaning of the Statute. Nevertheless it cannot be too seriously impressed on all those who may be in any way acting to further the election of a candidate, and who can properly be considered agents the absolute necessity of avoiding the furnishing of refreshments to electors during the contest, whatever may be their motive in doing so. When a course of conduct, which, in view of surrounding circumstances, may bear a favorable construction, but is considered open to serious objection, is followed after repeated warnings, Courts and Judges will feel less inclined to put the favorable construction on such conduct and will have less hesitation in deciding that parties who will persist in acting recklessly after repeated warnings intend to act illegally.\nI do not, therefore, think the charge of corrupt treating by Respondent or by his agents is made out.\nI understand the view I take as to corrupt treating is similar to that cited by Mr. Justice Patterson in the Lincoln election case, 'which has been so long pending in Ontario, and that I expressed in the Kingston case.\nSpeeches by Respondent:\u2014\nAs to the speeches by Mr. Laflamme, I have gone over the evidence very carefully more than once, and am not prepared to say, taking it as a whole, that we would be warranted in setting aside the election, in consequence of what he said in addressing the electors on various occasions, after the finding of the learned Judge who tried the case\nI have considered the powerful arguments of Mr. Justice Wilson in the Muskoka case and others that were addressed to us by Mr. McCarthy in the discussion of the matter before this Court and must say that speeches, pressing on the consideration of the electors that a particular candidate ought to be supported, because he has the power to distribute patronage and because as a Minister of the Crown he has the power of conferring material benefits upon a constituency, he ought, therefore, to be preferred and supported rather than a candidate not possessing such advantages are calculated to influence the electors in the choice of their members and in that way interfere with the freedom of election. At the same time the fact exists when the candidate before the people has that power; and to say that he has it can hardly be said to be more than recalling? to mind any other fact When done openly, can it be said to be done corruptly? Besides, it is one of the features of our representative system that as to some matters, those of a local character, a representative is bound to attend to the interests of his constituents; and, when he can do so consistently with his duty to the whole country his constituents may expect him, and, perhaps, demand of him to do so. I do not know that the candidate would be going much beyond the proper line, if he were to say that if occasion offered he would exercise his influence in favor of his constituents, whether in the bestowal of offices or in other matters in which they were interested. If in his speeches he were to limit his favors to those only who would support him, it might then be said he left the proper path and held out direct inducements to each to vote for him, and in that way was endeavoring to corrupt the constituency; and yet, promising to do what he could for his constituents in general terms, would, to most minds, imply quite as much as the more direct offer to give offices to those who helped him.\nOne difficulty in the case of speeches is, that you have not the exact words uttered by the candidate and each listener puts his own peculiar construction on the language used, and, when the lines of permissible speech and self-laudation and of corrupting appeals approach each other so nearly, it is not always safe to rely on the impressions parties have as to the effect of a speech.\nI take it for granted, Mr. Laflamme might have said, without incurring legal censure. you ought to support me; I am a member of the Government a Minister of the Crown\u2014and have more influence than my opponent. I can do more good for the county\u2014more good for you \u2014than the gentleman opposed to me. As your member, it is peculiarly my duty to look after your interests, and I will do so.\" Would not this language, in fact, have the same tendency to prevent the freedom of choice by the electors between the two candidates, as the more pointed and objectionable language referred to? I understand the matter is put in this way on behalf of Mr. Laflamme. He was charged with being a man without influence that he had failed as a member to take the position he ought to have taken, that he had done no good for the county, that all he had done was to get his friends a few offices. In reply to this attack, he said his opponents had charged him with doing no good to the county, with being without influence, and yet he had influence to procure more appointments for the electors of the county than any member who had preceded him, and if he had been able to do this for his constituents as a private member, as a minister of the crown he would be able to do more. Several of the witnesses on his behalf stated he in no way promised to give offices, that he was merely repelling the attack made on him, and shewing the people that as a minister he would possess more power to serve them than his opponent and more than he had as a private member. This is the view, as I understand, that the learned Judge takes of the effect of the evidence, and I cannot say he is not justified in doing so. If I entertained a stronger opinion than I do of the legal view to take of these election speeches, I should hesitate to declare the Respondent guilty of corrupt practices against the views of the Judge who tried the case as to the facts, and against the view the Court of Appeals in Ontario have expressed as to the law. I do not wish it to be understood from what I have said on this subject that candidates may, with impunity, make all kinds of appeals of a corrupting tendency to their constituents, and I think a careful perusal of the evidence will show that Mr, Laflamme, in taking the course he did, was, to use the words of one of his own witnesses, \" traveling on delicate ground.\" As I have had occasion to say in most of the election cases which I have unfortunately been compelled to consider when corrupt practices were charged against a candidate, when there is a reasonable doubt if a party has brought himself within the clear terms of the law, you ought not, when the effect of the finding is so grave and serious, to decide against him.\nI am not prepared to reverse the decision of the learned Judge as to the speeches made by Respondent. As to Speeches by Agents:\u2014\nAfter what I have said about the Respondent's speeches, I have but to say that the only speech by an agent which would call for further remark was that made by Mr. Duhamel at St. Anne to the effect that if they elected Mr. Laflamme he would have at his disposal as many places as they would want. They would be greatly in the wrong to prefer any other for he had already obtained places for some, and would be able to obtain some more. He also referred to the canal passing m front of the village, and said, if he was elected, he might fell them as a sure fact he would cause a few millions to be spent in deepening and widening it.\nThe speech of Mr. Duhamel was made in the presence of other gentlemen who had spoken, or who were about to make speeches the latter could, of course, reply to any statement he made, and if he said anything questionable or improper, could have replied to it. Putting improper motives before the people to influence them would naturally draw down censure and remark, and ought rather to injure than benefit the party on whose behalf they were put forward. Mr. Duhamel did not, as appears by the evidence, promise these places to any particular class of the inhabitants\u2014say those who supported Mr. Laflamme. What he said was to the effect that if elected he (Mr. Laflamme) would be able to obtain more places for them, that is, for the people. As to the reference to the expenditure of money to improve and widen the canal, that was a matter which, of course could be responded to, as the improvements had been provided for before Mr. Laflanime's time__as one of the gentlemen who was present when this speech was made mentions in his evidence.\nThough by no means free from doubt, I do not feel warranted in setting aside the election in consequence of the speeches made, either by Respondent or his agents.\nThe question how far a candidate and his friends may go in this kind of speaking is a very perplexing one and if it is found that great evils result from such speeches the legislature may interpose. Judges may also feel warranted, if it is found that these addresses of candidates and their agents go further in the objectionable direction, in declaring the same a violation of the law relating to the freedom of elections, though up to the present time they have not been able, satisfactorily, to come to such a conclusion.\nThere was little or no direct evidence that these speeches had a corrupt influence. One man speaks of being inclined to act from the corrupt motives placed before him, but, on further reflection, concluded not to do so Several of the witnesses mentioned that it was spoken of amongst the people that Respondent and his friends had promised offices; but it seemed as if this was done more to express disapproval of such conduct than to show they were influenced by it.\nThe enquiry before the learned Judge did not take the direction of showing the corrupt effect on individuals, but rather left it to be inferred that such must have been the case.\nI do not feel that we would be warranted in finding such general corruption resulting from the speeches complained of as to set aside the election on that ground. The learned Judge in the Court below, when discussing the question as to speeches by Respondent, refers to the S Montmagny case, and shows, I think, satisfactorily, how that case differs from this as to the matter under discussion and concludes:\nHere we have a serious conflict of testimony as to the effect of the expressions of which the Respondent made use, and we have his declaration upon oath, in which he says he only spoke about places in reply to the attacks made upon him by his adversaries, and in no way with a view to exercise any influence over the electors,\nClement and Deschamps cases.\nThe witness O'Neill collector of canal tolls, said :\nMy sympathies were with Mr. Laflamme, on account of being under a personal obligation to him for a year and a half before the election, of which fact Mr. Girouard was well aware for a year previous to the election. The only work I did on behalf of Mr. Laflamme, after the writ of election was issued, was to send a message to Deschamps that I wished to see him to ascertain if it was true that he had gone out to St. Laurent to propose a candidate to oppose Mr. Laflamme, after he had promised Mr. Laflamme that he would not work in the election.\nI myself, after Mr. Geoffrion resigned, was satisfied Mr. Laflamme would succeed him, and I wrote a note to a friend in Lachine to ask Clement Deschamp s and Israel Clement to see me at my office in town when they came in. I had conversations with them a year and a half previous to the election with reference to Mr. Laflamme. My friends thought Mr. Laflamme was an enemy of mine, I was satisfied he was not, and I considered it my duty to tell my Lachine friends, of whom I have many, that Mr. Laflamme was not my enemy.\nWhen Clement and Deschamps came into town (after the issuing of the writ of election) I asked them if they had made up their minds not to interfere against Mr. Laflamme, which I was satisfied they would not, from conversation I had with them previously, one of them a year before that, before Mr. Geoffrion got sick at all. They told me they would not interfere against Mr. Laflamme. I asked them to come and tell Mr. Laflamme so in his office. They came up and told Mr. Laflamme in my presence that they would not interfere against him. My object was that I knew they were politically opposed to him, and if they thought he was an enemy of mine, they would still be. I am satisfied my having told Clement and Deschamps that Mr. Laflamme was not an enemy of mineral tended to induce them not to oppose him. During the local election in 1875 I met Des champs, who said there was a vacancy in the canal office, at Lachine, in consequence of the death of a sub-collector; that he had applied for the position on behalf of his son. Mr. Laflamme had refused it to him, he said, for the reason that he had not been a political supporter of his. 1 did not promise then to get a situation for his son. I did get a situation for him eight years ago. Deschamps appeared to feel bad against Mr. Laflamme. I told him 1 would ask Mr. Laflamme why he did not give his son the position, and if he would call in a few days I would give the answer. He called afterwards. I told him Mr. Laflamme's reply was he could not give situations to opponents whilst his friends wanted them. I was anxious to know if they would carry out their promise not to oppose Mr. Laflamme, as they were influential men. I thought it would tend to let him in without opposition. At the same time Mr. Laflamme never asked me to support him in any manner or form. I did this voluntarily, in consequence of a favor he did me in 1875. In the conversation with Mr. Deschamps. when he told me he would not interfere in the election against Mr. Laflamme, I took the precaution to tell him I did not. wish him to have any misunderstanding relative to any conversation we might have had regarding his son Clement. He said it is not on account of any promise that we came here, \" for you have not made any. I came here of my own accord; and if they ask me the reason I did not interfere in it, I will show an insulting letter, in my pocket, I received from one of the Local Ministers.\"\nIt strikes me that in May, 1875, or sometime in 1875, I told him there might be changes in the Department which would create a vacancy. I may have used language, when speaking to him in a friendly way, which would lead him to believe I would interest myself on behalf of his son, but not in the sense the question suggests\u2014 of making a direct promise to his son with reference to the situation. When at Mr. Laflamme office, I said, \"this is Mr. Deschamps of Lachine.\" He said he knew Mr. D. very well. I said, \" Mr. D. has come up with me, as I told him there was a possible election contest shortly in the county, and he did not intend to interfere in the election. Mr. Laflamme said he was thankful to him, and they got into a general conversation about a previous contested election.\nI asked Mr. D. if his son Jean Baptiste intended to interfere in the election. He said Jean Baptiste could do as he pleased: he would. not interfere.\nWhen I saw Israel Clement. I asked if he would come up and tell Mr. Laflamme he would not interfere against him. I asked him in presence of Mr. Laflamme if he would be for him, and he said he would not be against him. He told me afterwards he would be for him: this was between the time of Mr. Geoffrion's resignation and the issue of the writ for the new election. About a year before the election I sent word to Israel Clement to come in and I would try L and get a situation for his son Louis. I saw him some weeks after. He said he did not want Louis to get a situation, as he wanted him to help him at Lachine. He said he had a very bad memory, but he kept the books very correctly.\nI would have done the same thing in relation to Clement, if there was no election for two years. I took Clement to Mr. Laflamme's office, introduced him to Mr. L. Something occurred pretty much the same as in Deschamps' case. He said he would not interfere against him, only Deschamps was more positive he would not interfere in the election. I have never since the election told Mr. Laflamme that Clement or Deschamps wanted situations for their sons. I told Mr. Laflamme, when I brought them, that I was satisfied these two gentleman would not oppose him, and I asked them to come up and tell him so. It was me that brought them up. Mr. L. never mentioned anybody's name to me. My object in having the personal interview was so that they would not interfere against him (Mr. L.) Question: To choke him? Answer: Unquestionably. These were the only two men whom I had canvassed for a year and a half. I spoke to my friends in Lachine as occasion presented itself, telling them that Mr. Laftamme was not an enemy of mine. What I did I did of my own free will, and not prompted by Mr. Laflamme, to let him know that I could treat him honorably as he had treated me.\nClement Deschamps said:\nHe voted at the last election but did not work. During the last local election was the official agent of Mr. Le Cavalier. Before the last election can't say how long there was no mention of election at the time. Mr. O'Neill sent me a message to call at his office in Montreal. The first time I went to the city. I did so. I think he said to me he had heard that I did not intend to work in the coming election Cannot swear positively I told him I would not work for one party or the other. He asked me to call at Mr. Laflamme's office. I said I had no business with him. He asked if I had any objection to go. I said not, and we went. He asked if my son was yet in the fur trade at Labrador. I think he asked me if I had applied for an appointment for my son. I answered him I had not. He asked if my son had applied himself I answered yes but he had not received an answer. I asked him if there were to be any changes in the government. He answered there was none, but if the Ministers thought proper to make changes in the spring, they might do so. Mr. O'Neill told me, in case there would be a situation for my son he would do his best as he had done in the past. This was said in the street in my carriage. We arrived at Mr. Laflammes's office. We waited there some time. Mr. Laflamme spoke for a time with Mr. O'Neill in my presence. He introduced me to Mr. Laflamme; said he had come to the office with me, knowing well I was not going to work during the contest. Mr. Laflamme asked me if it was certain I would not work neither for one side nor for the other. I answered him that I would not work. He asked me if I would vote. I said yes. I think Mr. O'Neill asked me if I would vote for the same party I always voted for, and I said yes. I don't remember that any mention was made at Mr. Laflamme's office of a situation for my son.\nWhen it was decided that an election would take place, a meeting was called at St. Laurent. I went to that meeting of the Conservative party. A few days after that O'Neill sent me a telegram asking me to call at his office the next time I went to the city. I called at his office. He said he heard I was working that I had been at the St. Laurent meeting. I said I was not going to deprive myself from going to any meeting, nor any where I pleased, and that I was only not to work at the election. (Don't think Mr. O'Neill or anyone else would take the liberty of influencing me.) My son's name was not mentioned in the second conversation. Mr. O'Neill only wanted to find out if I was going to work in the contest.\nI don't think this evidence sufficiently makes out a case of a corrupt offence, or intimidation or of agency on behalf of O'Neill.\nThe impropriety of O'Neill, holding an important situation in connection with the canals busying himself so far about election matters as to take electors to Mr. Laflamme's office has, in effect, been referred to when discussing the case of Foley. The fact that an active partizan at the recent local election had ceased to work, as the phrase is, was significant, and likely to cause grave suspicion; and, however imprudent it was on Mr. Laflamme's part to allow persons in the situation of O'Neill and Conway to bring parties to his office to be interrogated about election matters, I do not think what occurred sufficient to sustain a charge of an illegal practice, nor that there is sufficient evidence of agency if such charge had been sustained. Hutubise's case\u2014As to getting appointed keeper of a light house. SO\nI have gone over the evidence in this matter and see no reason to disturb the finding of the learned judge as to it. The evidence is conflicting and Belanger' s agency not sufficiently shown.\nBoudrias' case:\nThe alleged offer of money by Latour at the lock in St. Anne is not stated by Boudrias himself to be corrupt, or for the purpose of corrupting him. He said:\nI did not understand that it was with the intention of buying me over, I had no thoughts of it. It is very probable that he would give it to me in this manner. If I did not return it to him he would have charged it on account of what he owed me. I think that he offered it to me with that intention\nThe offer was to give him money to pay his passage to Lachine. Latour who is said to have made the offer contradicted him.\nAs to the threat by Lebau about the shop, I do not think the evidence as to the threat satisfactory and I infer that the learned judge who saw the witnesses did not credit the statements of Boudfias or Dunberry about the matter.\nCooke's case:\nRichard P. Cooke contractor on the Carillon Canal in his evidence said:\nMr. Regis Cardinal brought me a letter from Mr. Laflamme three or four days before the polling day. It was handed me on board the Prince of Wales, I was going down at the time. Cardinal was pay-master was on his official duty at the time. The letter was introducing Mr. Cardinal as his friend, asking me to assist him at the election Mr. Cardinal said it would be better to give the letter back to him, and I destroyed part of it. I met him first at Carillon. I said I was going to Montreal but I did not know what I could do in any case, as the men I had employed in the county were all French, and I could not speak that language. He said he would call at the hotel with Mr. Laflamme and see me next day. Mr. Cardinal asked me to do what I could to help him. He said if I did Mr. Laflamme would be able and willing to help me in my contract if I wanted assistance. He said he would call at the hotel next day with Mr. Laflamme and see me. I don't think there was any further conversation. I don't think I said I would take any part in the election. I said I would not do it. I had men in my employ at Isle Lizard quarrying and cutting stone. The foremen was Mr. McAdam. I told him I wished to keep out of the thing altogether: those were my instructions to him, at the same time he need not show that I did not want him to have anything to do with it. I had this conversation with McAdam the day before the election I think. We had about fifty men at the quarry where the conversation took place. I was aware McAdam was on Mr. Laflamme\u2019s side of politics, but I was not aware he was working. I don't think the men were paid for their work on the polling day. I was told in Montreal that Cardinal had been looking for me, but I did not see him there. Mr. Perry told me in Montreal he would meet me at Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve. I saw him there\nI preserved a portion of the letter, because I thought it suspicious looking that he wanted to get it back again. It was simply a letter of introduction introducing Cardinal as a friend. My contract is a large one. It is of course, a matter of some moment to me as to the terms on which I am with the government of the day. An offer like Cardinal's would be of considerable moment if carried out.\nThe only thing I said to McAdam was that I did not wish to be mixed up in it as a contractor, and my own natural feelings were the other way and I did not know either of the candidates. I said, of course you will be civil to them. I introduced him to Mr. Stewart as my foreman As far as I was concerned the men were at liberty to do as they pleased. I brought no undue influence to bear on them. The letter was a letter of introduction, asking what assistance I could give in the contest. I suppose the usual kind of letters sent out during elections, introducing this gentleman as his friend, and stating that any help I could give him in the contest he would be thankful for. It was the third day before the election. He paid me on the day he gave me the letter for some coals the engineer had got. The meaning of Cardina s words was that one good turn would deserve another, and that if I would help him then he would help me in my contract. The meaning was that he would be ready and willing to help me in my contract if I wanted help. I am not prepared to say whether it was might help at some future time.\nRegis Cardinal, Paymaster of the St. Lawrence canals, said:\nI did all I could at the last election. It is probable Mr. Laflamme must have known it. I think it probable Mr. Leopold Laflamme knew it, and it was publicly known at Lachine, and in the county that I was working for him. Mr. Laftamme gave me a letter to Mr. Cooke because I asked it from him. I was going up to pay the men on the Grenville canal at Carrillon. and I asked Mr. Laftamme for a letter of introduction to Mr. Cooke My object in asking for that letter was to request Mr. Cooke to come down and help us if he was one of Mr. Laflamme's partizans. It was unsealed\u2014a letter of introduction, in which he said to Mr. Cooke that I was one of his political friends. He did not ask Mr. Cooke in that letter to help me My object in going to Mr. Cooke was to ask him what party he belonged to, and if he had been of our party to ask him to come down in the county and help us, seeing that he had a quarry at Isle Bizard. When I gave him the letter he shook hands with me and after reading the letter said: \" I will do all in my power to help him; 1 have a contract from the Government. Mr. Laftamme is a Minister, and I do not see why I should work against the Government. I have not much influence. I do not know whether the men working in my quarry are voters or not: I will get a list to see those who have a right to vote, and those who have not. I will do all in my power for Mr. Laftamme.\" Seeing he was so much in favor of Mr. Laflamme. I did not make any proposition to him. Mr. Cooke said he would like to be introduced to Mr. Laftamme. I said I would take him to Mr. L's office and introduce him, or I would arrange to have Mr. L, call on him and introduce him at the St. Lawrence Hall. The hour was fixed between 12 and 1 o'clock. I called on Mr. Laftamme, reported the interview with Mr. Cooke, and told him Mr. C. wished to be introduced to him. Mr. L. said \"we will go and see him.\" I told Mr. L, that Mr. Cooke seemed to be in his favor and that he had said to me he would be happy and pleased to make his acquaintance. It is likely I told him Mr. Cooke would do all he could for him. The day Mr. L. was to call on Mr. Cooke was the day fixed for a meeting at Lachine. A great many people came to Mr. Laflamme's office and detained him until he was obliged to start for Lachine and could not keep the appointment to meet Mr. Cooke, I had before that been to the St. Lawrence Hall to report to Mr. Cooke that Mr. Laflamme was leaving by the 12 o'clock train. I did not say to Mr. Cooke that Mr. Laftamme might be of some use to him in his contract with the Government. I never alluded to his contract with the Government.\nCross-examined d I asked the letter of introduction to Mr. Cooke from Mr. Laflamme. It was unsealed. I asked Mr Cooke to tear it up for this reason, that a letter of introduction in election times\u2014supposing Mr. C. would have shown it to his friends\u2014might have given them cause to suppose I had gone up to Mr. Cooke's with the view to bribe him asked him that in my own interest in order that no remarks should 3, be made about my visit to Mr. Cooke\u00bb Mr. C. did not destroy the letter in my presence: he put it in his pocket. When I saw that, I did not insist upon his destroying it. I knew Mr. Cooke well enough not to mention to him what he said here I swear positively that I made no promise whatever to Mr. Cooke; it was himself who said that he would be pleased to see Mr. Laflamme; that he had a contract from the Government and that he did not see why he should not work for him, considering that Mr. Laflamme would be a Minister.\nPerry's evidence:\nHe (Cooke) said he did not speak French, and did not think it was his proper place to interfere in the election All I asked him to do was to allow the men to vote, and when I got that promise it was all I wanted.\nIf the learned Judge sifter hearing the evidence and his attention being drawn to the surrounding circumstances had decided that he believed the statement of Mr. Cooke that Cardinal had asked him to do what he could to support Mr. Laflamme, and if he did, Mr. Laflamme would be able and willing to help him in his contract if he wanted assistance; and the learned Judge had rejected Cardinals statement as not truthful, I should not, I think, have felt warranted in disturbing that finding\u2014because it was shown that Cardinal had denied that such a conversation had taken place\u2014on the ground it was simply oath against oath. It might be that the manner in which the witnesses gave their evidence and a consideration of the other circumstances induced the learned Judge to decide in that way I think so much is due to the opinion of the learned Judge that before it can be set aside we must be satisfied that he is wrong. In a matter of this kind when the two witnesses appear to be equally respectable, and they positively contradict each other and the surrounding circumstances do not lead the Judges in the Appellate Court clearly to the conclusion that the decision in the Court of First Instance is wrong the Appellate Court ought not to interfere, though they might have decided differently if they had seen the witnesses.\nIf he had a reasonable doubt about the matter\u2014believed both men to be honest but one or the other mistaken (and he could not say which); in that state of mind as it was thrown on the Petitioners to prove the case to the satisfaction of the Judge and as it was not proven to his satisfaction, the Judge was bound to find as to it for the Respondent; or, in other words, if the evidence was equally balanced he ought to find for the Respondent, as the presumption of indecency would naturally arise.\nIt is true in one sense cardinal may be considered as the party accused and Cooks as the witness sustaining the accusation; that the party accused would wish to purge himself and therefore his evidence must be viewed with suspicion. The same may be said of a person charged with perjury, as the late learned Chief Justice of the Court of .Appeals in Ontario gives the illustration in one of the cases referred to then it is oath against oath, and it requires further evidence to sustain the charge. The circumstances referred to by the Petitioners' counsel and in the factum go more to Cooke's general truthfulness than to his statement in the particular matter which requires confirmation, namely, the promise that Mr. Laflamme would aid him (Cooke). It is not at all improbable that Mr. Cooke felt that as he had no personal knowledge of either candidate, though probably he might have a preference, yet the contest was not likely to cause him to feel so much interest as to take an active part; and being ignorant of the French language, he could personally accomplish very little. He said he would not take part in the contest, and he did not, in fact interfere; his conduct does not appear to have been influenced by anything Cardinal said.\n\"When there is no result from an improper attempt at influencing, say a promise to give or do something, and nothing was in reality given, and no corrupt influence exercised, the evidence of the corrupt act, it is said, should be satisfactory beyond a reasonable doubt. I do not feel that on this charge after the opinion expressed by the learned judge as to the uncertainly which prevailed in his mind, that we can properly say that he should have given faith to Cooke's statement and disbelieved Cardinal and if not then I do not think we should reverse his decision in this matter.\nIt seems to me to have been in the most favourable view in which it can be put, a very imprudent act for a Minister of the Crown to write a letter to a contractor soliciting his aid in a pending election contest, and still more imprudent to select as the bearer of that letter a subordinate officer in the employ of the Crown, a paymaster connected with the canals whose active employment as a political partizan would naturally excite attention and create feelings of annoyance on the part of those against whom he was acting. I may be permitted to hazard the opinion that the sooner the subordinate officers of the government act on the principle that they are not to be active politicians for either party, the better it will be for all parties.\nCousineau's case\u2014as to treating and getting him a place:\nI do not think on the evidence that the charge is sustained. The judge, no doubt, believed (and was quite justified in doing so) the evidence offered on behalf of the Respondent, and I don't think we ought to interfere\nGravels case:\nGravel says one Gohier gave him 25 cents. He said to him, if you hinder your father-in-law from voting, here is some money for that purpose,\" and on the evening before the election he bought some liquor and got his father-in-law drunk. Laframboise, another witness, said he was present when Gohier paid Gravel his wages for his week's work and gave him 25 cents extra. When he received the money Gravel said he would use it in making his father-in-law drunk because his right to vote had been taken from him. Gohier said he could do as he pleased about that. I am not prepared to say that the view taken of this case by the learned judge is wrong. I see no reason for interfering with the decision\nBrunet's case:\nMessrs. Penance and Eustache Lemay are charged with having taken electors from Montreal to Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve in their vehicle, with having treated and paid money to induce them to vote for Respondent. There were several persons in Mr. Lemay's wagon. One of the number, the witness said a stranger in the county but whom Petitioner alleged was Toussaint Meloche, treated before setting out and afterwards produced a bottle of liquor and treated on the way. It is said he was the driver. On their return after the voters had Voted, they stopped at St. Laurent, but did not get off. Meloche asked if they had any money, the answer was they had none; then he put a half dollar in the witness's hand and said, \" here is a half dollar, you can take a mouthful as soon as you will be out of the county, do not stop in the county to take anything.\" They stopped at Cote des Neiges, at a tavern outside of the county and took a drink. It was very cold. Meloche is now in California. Lemay was not in the wagon on the return when the driver gave Brunet the half-dollar. He was present at the treating on the road. Another witness stated it was not Meloche who paid for the drink before they started. It was a man whom he had never seen or known who drove in the wagon with them and the treat out of the bottle was handed them by the same man who had paid for the treat at the hotel. It was not Meloche.\nI do not see any evidence to connect Mr. Laflamme with this matter. If it be contended that Meloche (the driver) was in Mr. Lemay's employ, and being under his control, if he treated electors, then, as Mr. Lemay was an active friend and supporter of Mr. Laflamme, and might be considered his agent as he did not prevent the driver from treating he in effect, treated himself, and therefore Mr. Laflamme is liable to the extent of having the election set aside. It is by no means certain that Meloche was the person who treated. The witness who says it was not Meloche, speaks more decidedly than the one who says he thought it was Meloche. The learned Judge evidently believes it was the stranger (the unknown man), and not Meloche; and I am not inclined to differ from him. When the money (the half-dollar) was given for the treat on the way home, Lemay was not present and therefore could not be held to be in any way connected with that matter.\nIt is doubtful if the treating would be considered as contrary to the intention of the Statute already referred to and discussed.\nSte. Genevi\u00e8ve Quarry case:\nAs a matter of fact it is not shown that any man who worked in the quarries was influenced by the alleged threats that they would be dismissed if they voted against Mr. Laflamme. Most of the voters to whom the language is said to have been addressed actually did vote and those who did not state that they were not in any way influenced by what St. Denis is alleged to have said. Then there is the direct denial of St. Denis as to having used the language which some of the witnesses say he used; and several of the parties who worked in the quarry, who were addressed at the same S time by St. Denis as those who gave this evidence, confirm the statement of St. Denis that he wanted to ascertain for whom they were there; that is, for whom they intended to vote, not for the purpose of influencing them (as they were told they could vote for whom they pleased), but with a view of ascertaining who were voters and for whom they intended to vote. Mr. Lanthier, who does not appear to have been a partizan, as well as several of the quarrymen, confirm St. Denis' statement as to what occurred in his and their presence.\nAll the witnesses seem to have known that St. Denis had no control of the men in the quarry; and all the workmen as 1 understand, concur in the statement made by St. Jean, who was the man in charge, and who, it is contended, was also an agent of Respondent, that he told the workmen to vote as they pleased. \"Go and vote for whom you like\u2014you are not hindered.\" \"Vote for him you think best.\" To one elector who said he intended voting for Mr. Girouard, he said, v vote for whom you like; but you must vote.\" It is suggested that St. Jean in this matter was not acting in good faith; that though he used the language indicating that any man should vote as he thought right; yet he really meant them to understand if they voted against Mr. Laflamme, they would be dismissed from the quarry. I cannot say that I am free from doubt, as to the fact that St. Denis, at some time after the election was spoken of, may have said or done something to intimate to the parties working at the quarry, that if they voted against Mr. Laflamme they would be dismissed. But whatever he may have said or done i do not think that any threat made by him operated on the minds of any voter, so as to influence him to vote or not to vote at the time of the election. The evidence of what took place at the house of Legault, when St. Denis was addressing Rodin, puts a different phase on the transaction from what St. Denis himself states it to be but this conversation occurred sometime before the polling, when an excited discussion vas going on between them. It does not appear to have had any effect on Rodin for he continued to work at the quarry and left when the cold weather set in, probably after the election, and he voted at the election. I am not disposed to set aside an election on a threat made under such circumstances, which alarmed no one or produced no effect.\nIn setting aside an election, it is always more satisfactory to place the ground of your decision, if possible, on a basis more free from doubt than I think it would be on this latter charge as to the conversation with Rodin.\nBut considering the whole evidence as to these threats, alleged to have been made as to dismissing the men from the quarry, and suppose it be admitted that St. Denis did threaten that the men should be dismissed unless they supported Respondent he not at the time having power to dismiss and his threat, in fact, known to be powerless and really causing no apprehension, and then Mr. St. Jean, who really possessed the power, and who, it is contended, was an agent of Respondent equally with St. Denis, assured the workers in the quarry that every man was at liberty to vote as he thought proper, and every man did so vote, would it not seem to be a straining of the law beyond all reasonable limits to set aside an election on that state of facts. I think I should hesitate in doing so; but when, in addition to that it is by no means clearly shown from the evidence that either St. Denis or St. Jean was an agent of the Defendant of the kind necessary to justify us in holding the election void for St. Denis' improper act, I should further hesitate as to setting aside the election.\nI have gone over the evidence very minutely, and after giving it my best consideration, I can only say that I do not feel that I can properly set aside the election on this charge.\nPointe Claire case\u2014As to the attempt to induce men to go to Pointe Claire to work, so that they might not be present to vote at Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve:\nAs a matter of fact no voters were sent to work there and if they had gone there to work, it appears from the evidence, that it was so near the polling place, that if they had desired very much to work and to vote also, they could have gone and cast their votes and returned to their work within the hour allowed them at noon. As indicating the improper attempt to influence these men, it was suggested that there was no such necessity of proceeding in haste as pretended, that the work at Pointe Claire was not commenced until long after; but the evidence shows that that work was begun on the 6th December and the election was on the 28th November\u2014not very long before. It is not improbable that there was some intention of trying to do what was suggested, but there was nothing done; and if the men had actually been sent there the reasonable inference is, that if they had really desired it they could have voted without losing any time. One of the men was not a voter; he declined going to Pointe Claire, because he wanted to be at the polling he liked to be there I am not prepared to avoid the election on what is said to have occurred about sending the voters to Pointe Claire, through the instrumentality of St. Jean and St, Denis.\nOuellette's case:\u2014\nFrom the evidence relating to this case I understand that some time in April 1876 Mr. Caisse the postmaster at Lachine resigned his office, and? Mr. Robert was offered the situation. He was inclined to refuse it, but his father-in-law, Mr. Par\u00e9, wished him to accept it for the the purpose of giving employment to Ouellette, another son-in-law, who was in comparatively indigent circumstances. Robert agreed to do this; but for some cause Caisse withdrew his resignation and Mr. Laflamme asked Mr. Robert to withdraw his acceptance, which he did, and it was said amongst his (Ouellette's) friends that a better place would be procured for him. After this, probably in the month of May Robert asked Mr. Laflamme to do something for his brother-in-law Ouellette\u2014to procure a place for him. Mr. Laflamme on that occasion, I presume, as well as all other occasions when he spoke on the subject, said, as Robert puss it:\nHe would think of me, and if a vacancy occurred, he would do his best for me.\nAt this time nothing was said of the Pare family. There is no doubt, that Mr. Robert was a warm political, if not personal friend of Mr. Laflamme, as well as his client and that it is more than probable he would feel inclined to carry out the wishes of Mr. Robert in a matter of this kind. There could be no objection to it on political grounds, for I infer that Ouellette was politically in accord with Mr. Laflamme's party, and there is no reason to suppose that in acceding to Mr. Robert's request there would be a corrupt motive. It has never yet been seriously contended, that a member of Parliament, who wishes to aid a warm political and personal friend in the \"procurement of an office for himself or a friend, must, in doing so, necessarily be considered as guilty of a corrupt act. In fact, if he refused to aid a political friend, when the request that was made to him to do so was reasonable, his refusal would suggest the idea that he was becoming false to his friends and. his party, and it might be charged. against him that he was then acting from corrupt motives. Up to this time, I apprehend, what was said by Mr. Laflamme would not be considered improper. Afterwards, Robert says, that in again speaking to Mr. Laflamme he suggested that if he got the appointment for Ouellette it would greatly please the Pare family; that it might be useful to him later on; it might, perhaps, prevent their voting at the coming election. Laflamme's answer, as stated by Robert, was:\nHe would think of me; and if a vacancy occurred, he would do his best for me.\nIt is not clear the exact time this particular conversation took place. At first, in reply to a question, Robert said it was during the election at all events it was at the time the election was spoken of. Then immediately following, he says\nMr. Laflamme did not tell me that it was probable there would be an election, \u00abnor did I say so myself.\nFurther on, when asked, \"when you told Mr. that the Pare family might be useful to him, did you say so at the time of the last election?\" he answered, \"yes.\" The next question was:\nWhen you had that conversation with Mr. Laflamme, did you understand he was a Minister, or was to become one: and that there was to be a new election?\nThe answer was:\nYes; but there was then no question of the Pare family.\nThen followed the question as to the date he spoke to him about the Pare family. The answer was:\nI cannot say positively but it was four or five weeks before there was question of the election. It was a matter discussed in the County and out of the County.\n\"It\" I suppose, means question of election.\nHe said:\nDuring the election and during the public discussions had no conversation with Mr. Laflamme concerning the same subject. There seems some ambiguity about this. Now, turning to Mr. Laflamme's account of the matter, he says:\nMr. Placide Robert is one of the most honorable men in the County He had asked me, not during the election, but many months before \u2014I believe, so far as my memory goes, a year before there was any talk of election to try and secure some office, or position, or occupation, with a light remuneration, for his brother-in-law .(Ouellette). I told him I would consider his claims; that he was one of my best supporters; and if I found any occasion when it could be possible for me to support his claim, I would do so. The thing remained in that way; and previous to the election, particularly, there was never one word said or breathed on that subject between Mr. Robert and myself. I never asked him to use this promise; and never intended to do so. It was merely because he was a personal friend of mine, and a man of respectability and importance in the County, that I promised to consider his claim, as I was justified, as the representative of the County, in doing. He was one of my best supporters; and, I think, I was in duty bound, when occasion offered itself, to give him a situation such as he desired for one of his relatives. During the contest, I carefully avoided even allowing myself to speak about any situation or office.\nI suppose, by the expression \"previous to the election,\" is meant immediately preceding the election which took place in November. An election might have been talked about as no doubt it was, before that but Mr. Laflamme, from what he says, does not seem to have anticipated until October, that an election would take place from his acceptance of office.\nThe evidence does not show nor is it contended before us that the influence it would exercise on the Pav\u00e9 family to give Ouellette an office, was referred to in any way by Mr. Laflamme. It was a suggestion made by Robert, and may have been made to induce Mr. Laflamme to give the office. It was the procuring of the place that was to influence the Pare family\u2014not the promise to do his best to procure it. Mr. Laflamme does not in any way, appear to have desired Robert to tell the Pare family of his assurances as to what he would do. As he had given the same assurance before the Pare family were mentioned, he might have supposed Robert had spoken of it, and that they had knowledge of it; S and it might not, therefore, have occurred to him to -, have said to Robert that the pleasing of the Pare family was not the motive which induced him to promise to use his efforts to get a place for Ouellette.\nI can well imagine a public man, having promised a political friend and supporter to endeavor to procure an office for another friend, meeting with him, and the matter being referred to and spoken of between them, the latter saying, in the course of conversation:\" It will be a good thing if the applicant gets the office; he is a popular man, well liked, and his selection will please his friends and strengthen your influence.\" The fact that it is called to his attention that the result of that which he has promised to try and do for the purpose of gratifying his political friend may bring him more influence, ought not to prevent him from doing that which he has promised to do and which he promised to do from quite another motive. His carrying out his original promise could not fairly be charged against him as a corrupt act. The promise Mr. Laflamme made\u2014at the time it was made\u2014was unobjectionable. Can what occurred afterwards, on his saying in effect that he would do what he had promised to do before, (and which we have no reason to suppose he would not have done, if it had not been suggested it might please the Pare family) be a corrupt act, unless he intended it to corrupt them, and intended that they should be informed of his promise for that purpose. I think, to hold this against a man who, under oath, denies such intent, would be dealing harshly with him, and not according to the spirit in which the Statute has been interpreted.\nMr. Laflamme's statement, under oath, is that he never asked him to use the promise never intended him to do so; and if Robert used it, as he appears to have done, for corrupt purposes, Mr. Laflamme ought not to be found guilty of the corrupt act, if he did not intend that use to be made of it.\nThe matter then assumes this form: When Mr. La-flamme first made the promise it was unobjectionable, as a promise made to a political friend to oblige him, and was harmless and not improper. When referring to the matter again, a reason was suggested, for doing the act he promised to endeavor to have done, which might make the act a corrupt act, if done for the corrupt reason. Mr. Laflamme, in effect, swears it was not for the corrupt reason, but to gratify a political friend and supporter who had claims to his consideration\nMust we then necessarily assume the reason for making the promise was a corrupt one?\nIn an election case tried before me in Ontario, it appeared that meetings were frequently held in public houses with the knowledge of the Respondent and it was contended that the holding of such meetings so often and in so many public houses \"was calculated and intended to make the proprietors of these houses give their support and influence to the Respondent; that these were corrupt acts to Respondent's knowledge, and that he should be declared guilty of them. The Respondent, in giving reasons for holding these meetings at public houses, and so frequently, said, amongst other things:\nThe calling of meetings at public houses was to have people to talk to. Innkeepers are, of course, a power in these localities, and that may have been a reason amongst others for holding meetings there, and another to prevent the other side from getting them.\nHe was not aware of any meetings of his friends at any inn where the party was not a supporter of his. He said,\nOf course when you get a supporter, you want to keep him. In another part of his testimony he added:\nI did not consider holding meetings in the taverns and paying for the use of the rooms would be a violation of the law.\nIn disposing of the question being a corrupt act, I came to the conclusion that there was a legitimate motive for hiring the rooms, though there might have been other motives not so legitimate influencing Respondent and his friends, if they had stood alone.\nBaron Bramwell, in his judgment in the Windsor election case ([90]), to which I referred in the case before me, laid down the doctrine: that there is no harm in it if a man has a legitimate motive for doing a thing, although in addition to that he has a motive which if it stood alone, would be an illegitimate one. I am not aware that the view that I took in the case to which I have referred has been disapproved of in any way, or that the doctrine laid down in the Windsor case has been questioned in any subsequent case either in England or this country. It is mentioned and not disapproved of in one of the latest works on the subject of elections.\nNow, here I think the Respondent had a perfectly legitimate motive in promising Robert to try and get an office for his brother-in-law,\u2014his desire to please a political friend and supporter. He does not, as the Respondent in the case tried before me, suggest another motive which might be questionable, but, on the contrary, as I understand his evidence, he repels any such imputation.\nI see no reason to change my opinion as to the doctrine I acted on in the case I have referred to and I therefore think the charge that the corrupt act of Robert, in relation to the votes of the Pare family, was not a corrupt act committed with the knowledge and consent of the Respondent, The next question is, was it a corrupt act on the part of Robert? He says:\nI reported to the Pare family simply what I had said to Mr. Laflamme, and what he had replied to me.\nKeeping in mind that what he had said to Mr. Laflamme was \"It would greatly please the Pare family if he could procure a place for Ouellette; that, possibly, it might be useful to him later on; it might, perhaps, prevent them voting at the coming election; and Mr. Laflamme's reply\u2014\" he would do his best for him\";\u2014afterwards, and during the election\u2014 during the time of the meetings of the candidates at the church doors\u2014Robert asked the Messrs. Pare their opinion. They said they would vote for Mr. Girouard, but that they would not make use of their influence. Robert says:\nI told them it would be better not to vote as they wanted a place for Honor\u00e9 Ouellette.\nQ. Did Mr. Robert tell you anything relating to your vote? A. He told me it was best not to vote, in order to get a place for Honer\u00e9 Ouellette\u00bb\nFurther on, he said, in answer to a question of how many days before the polling Robert told him it was best not to vote, to get a place for Ouellette, he answered:\nI do not know that he spoke of that tome. I told my sons it was better not to vote, as we wanted to get a place from Mr. Laflamme. One of the three of us voted. '\nHe is again pressed as to Robert's having told him it was better for him not to vote. His answer is '.\nI have no knowledge of that; it is myself who said so to my sons.\nThis does not seem to be the same matter or time referred to by Robert who says he made the statement in reply to a suggestion made, that they would vote for Mr. Girouard, but not work against Mr. Laflamme. The fact that he (the elder Par\u00e9) also made the suggestion, can make no difference, if it arose from the act of Robert putting it as an inducement to vote, or not to vote, that the place for Ouellette would be in jeopardy.\nAlphonse Pare states he did not vote at the last election; and explains the reason why. After referring to Mr. Robert's conversation with Mr. Laflamme about the place for Ouellette, and his writing to Mr. Laflamme about it also, and stating they would not use their influence against him if he would give Ouellette a place, he adds: \"But we did not say we would not vote.\" He then says:\nAt the time of the election Mr. Robert told us it would be better not to vote. We told him that we would vote. He told us: \" Do as you please: they will use your votes as an objection to give Mr. Ouellette a place.\" That is the reason why we did not vote at the last election.\nHe then says they were known at Lachine as Conservatives and had great influence there. Further on in his examination, in reply to a question, if Mr. Robert at the time of the election spoke to him about his vote the answer is: \"He spoke of it to my brother, and my brother told me.'' He further says:\nSome two or three weeks before the polling day\u2014after what my brother had told me\u2014I said to Robert I wanted to know if our abstention from voting was required. He told me to do as I thought fit but that it was better for us not to vote. By those answers, I imagined that the fact of our voting would be an objection to Mr. Ouellette getting the place. The question came also before the family circle of which Mr. Robert was a member; and he told us about the same thing. It was referred to in the family circle a second time, a few days before the election.\nThere is no doubt two of the Pares in consequence of what Mr. Robert said to them abstained from voting, and the motive restraining them was the expected place for Ouellette.\nThe fact seems to have been presented to the minds of the Pare family from the beginning, from what Robert said to them that their conduct in relation to the elections would have an effect in getting the place for Ouellette. Can there be any reasonable doubt that he intended it should have that effect? He was a strong friend and partizan of Mr. Laflamme's anxious for his election, and he himself first suggested that their conduct as to election matters might be influenced by Ouellette? getting the office; and he seems not to have omitted presenting the fact to them whenever a convenient opportunity occurred of doing so. The significant question put him, if their abstention from voting was required, shewed the impression that the language and conduct of Robert had produced on their minds and it had the effect of preventing their voting. I do not doubt, therefore the act was corrupt and within the meaning of the Statute.\nOuellette himself had the idea that his father might be influenced in his conduct by the expectation of his son getting a situation, and the son warned him against working for Mr. Girouard, as it might injure his prospects. Two of Mr. Laflamme's prominent supporters also stated they had heard the elder Ouellette was not to work very hard during the contest, shewing, for some cause, not unlikely the expectation of the office for Ouellette's s son, they thought the elder Ouellette was not intending to exert himself against Mr. Laflamme.\nI think Robert s assurance that Mr. Laflamme had promised would have probably satisfied the Pares without informing them that he had told Mr. Laflamme he thought it would have an effect on their voting. I think it not an unfair inference from the evidence that from the first his object in referring to their voting was to induce them not to vote. In any view in which the subject was presented to the Pares, it was with a corrupt intent. There was no other reasonable ground suggested to them to abstain from voting, but the influence it would have on Ouellette's getting the situation it was many times pressed upon them with that object. If some other motive had been presented to them which was legitimate and proper, and in addition it had been said their doing so might also have a good effect as to Ouellette getting the office, then it might be urged that there was a legitimate motive presented to them. But that is not so now, but the corrupt motive was presented and it had the effect intended.\nFrom beginning to end, as far as the Pares were concerned, the motive as presented by Robert was illegitimate and corrupting in its tendency, and I think he should be bound by it and Mr. Laflamme also if he was his agent.\nMr. Laflamme had directed Robert to say to the Pare family: \"if you will abstain from voting at the coming election, I will endeavour to procure a place for Ouellette \" there can be no doubt but that would have been a corrupt act which would have set aside the election and disqualified Mr. Laflamme. \"Was what was done by Mr. Robert not, in effect, the same thing, though not authorized to say what he did by Mr. Laflamme.\nAs to Mr. Robert's agency\u2014Mr. Laflamme in his evidence says:\nThe moment I was called upon to come before my constituency, the different friends who offered their services were informed by me, in the most imperative manner; to avoid anything in the style of treating, or promises, because I was surrounded in every direction by people who wanted to secure the election by this means or that means. First, I selected an agent from outside of the County, Mr. Adam, knowing that he would be well surrounded by witnesses in my office and I disclaimed to have any connection with any other party than him. Some friends, without my knowledge and concurrence. organized a committee of volunteers to assist me in the election. They formed themselves into a committee at the National office. I never set my foot inside of that committee room, only after the voting had taken place, after I had returned from St. Laurent, on the polling day and when I waited the returns of the different polls. Whoever was employed in that election besides Mr. Adam was employed without my knowledge. The only person I asked to ' come with me into the County was Mr. Eustache Lemay because I determined to have a witness with me wherever I went in order to avoid any false testimony being brought against me on any subsequent period. Mr. Lemay was the only man, except on one or two occasions, when I had to take some other gentlemen.\nIn another part of his evidence he speaks of leaving Belaire with Mr. Doyon. I do not know if the learned judge before whom this petition was tried entertained the opinion that Mr. Laflamme had no agents in this election, whose conduct, if corrupt, without his knowledge, would justify setting aside the election. From a careful perusal of his judgment I do not infer that he entertained that opinion. He speaks of Cousineau as a spy who went to Migneron' s to endeavor to compromise Mr. Laflamme's agents, who were there. These persons referred to as agents were Messrs. Madon and Forget. Forget says he was sent to St. Laurent to prepare the lists and helped to organize the two committees, and young Madon helped him. Forget speaks of his instructions as to compromising themselves as well as Mr. Laflamme, and appears to have represented Mr. Laflamme on the day of polling. The learned judge also speaks in respect to corrupt acts alleged to have been committed by agents; not that the parties could not be agents, because Mr. Laflamme, under the circumstances, could not have any agents but those named by himself; but the fact of a person being an agent is not clearly established. He refers in a part of his judgment to the full opportunity given to the petitioners to enquire into all the details of the election, and says: \"They have entered the private apartments of the Respondent, into his committees. They have visited the offices of the telegraph company and brought hither its employees.\" It seems to me the learned judge must have had the impression that Mr. Laflamme must have had some committees, the members of which aided him in his election and if so, I think the doctrine is pretty firmly established \u2014 if he takes the assistance of the members of a committee he must be responsible for their acts to the extent of having the election set aside if those acts are corrupt within the meaning of the law applicable to elections.\nI think we may assume, as a fact, that a contested election in this county, extending, as I understand, from Lachine to St. Annes, containing some populous villages, could not be conducted by a candidate with any hope of success unless there was some kind of organization amongst his frends to ascertain who were the voters\u2014the probability of the contest being a close one\u2014to ascertain if their friends were likely to turn out on the day of election; to make efforts to give energy to the indifferent; to watch their opponents; to see that no improper efforts were used to induce their friends to absent themselves from the polls or to vote against them and to see that all reasonable and proper efforts were used to secure the attendance of their friends at the polls on the day of voting. Mr. Laflamme, personally, made no attempts at an organization of this kind. It does not appear that he had any committees in the different parishes to canvass votes or in whose hands he placed lists; or, where the ordinary precautions were taken to detect bad votes to ascertain who had votes, and to prevent fraudulent voting unless the committees that were organized, as far as we can see, by persons sent from the Central Committee, were his committees for the purposes I have mentioned.\nI do not understand Mr. Laflamme\u2014when he uses the language: \"Some friends, without my knowledge and concurrence, organized a committee of volunteers to assist me in the election; they formed themselves into a committee at the National office \"\u2014to mean that he did not know, before the polling, that such and organization existed; but rather, that they formed the organization \" without his knowledge or concurrence,\" and that afterwards he did not visit it during the election and had not knowledge of those who were employed in the election.\nMr. Doyon, who was sent by the Central Committee in Montreal to Ste. GGenevi\u00e8ve and Isle Bizard to organize the contest, communicated with Mr. Laflamme before going, and his expenses were paid by Mr. Laflamme's election agent. He also met Mr. Doyon there. It seems to me he must have known that Mr. Doyon was acting on his behalf there He was not an inhabitant of the parish and had been sent from Montreal. I think therefore that it is the proper inference to draw, that Mr. Laflamme must have known that there was some organization for the contest, and that it must have been made through his Central Committee.\nIf he did not intend to rely on the efforts of this committee to aid him in his election why did he not have an organization of his own different from that? If he did not intend to avail himself of the assistance of these volunteers, as he calls them, why did he not provide other and more legitimate assistants to do the work? If he had, then he might possibly have held these volunteers at arms-length (as the phrase is sometimes used), and so not have been answerable for their acts. It seems to me if we hold that a candidate may in this way do nothing to secure his own election when he knows that his friends are organizing for the purpose of doing that which he has a direct interest in seeing properly done with a view of his being elected that he must be held as placing himself in their hands to the same extent as if he had himself been present at and aided in the organization.\nIf we hold that a candidate, elected through the efforts of a committee thus formed and acting can retain his seat, when the persons selected by them to organize the contest and conduct it to a close have been guilty S of corrupt acts, I think the rule considered so essentially necessary to the purity of elections, that a candidate shall not avail himself of the services of those persons (call them agents, or what you please) unless he is responsible for their corrupt acts, will be of little or no use in preserving the purity of elections.\nIn that state of the law all that would be necessary for a candidate to do would be simply to appoint one agent to pay his bills, and let his friends do the rest organize committees name canvassers and others to assist in managing the election and bringing it to a close; and then if corrupt acts are done by these active and necessary conductors of the canvass for his benefit he is not in any way to be put to inconvenience; and unless a sufficient number of corrupted votes can be discovered and struck off from his side he will retain his seat. I think this would be a very undesirable state of thing's to exist.\nBesides this I do not consider the candidate the only party who is interested in the result of the election independent of the broad ground that the public have an interest that no candidate should be returned by undue means. His friends, or his political party, are also interested; their zeal ought not to be encouraged to run into corrupt channels; and considerations of public policy will be served in shewing the friends of a candidate, or a party, that they cannot insure success by improper means used by agents for their candidate, though such agents have been selected by them for him instead of being selected by himself\nCan Mr. Placide Robert, then, be considered a person for whose acts, if corrupt, Mr. Laflamme can properly be considered responsible, so far as to warrant the election being set aside? Let us first see what Mr. Robert says himself. As to agency, Robert says:\nQ. Did you take much interest in the last election? A Pretty much, spoke to voters about their votes in many instances. I made reports to Mr. Gariepy, to Mr. Cardinal, and, I believe to Mr. Prevost also. 1 attended election committees. Not all, but some only. My name was put on one of the committees as one of the members and I attended now and then I attended three or four sittings of the committee. I met Wilfred Prevost and Mr. Gariepy also. Mr. Cardinal once. It was a private committee. but was attended by Conservatives as well as Liberals, the door was opened to all. We used to check the list of electors, which I helped to do. I was at the organization of that committee; was a member of it from the time of its organization, but only attended three or four times as I remember. To the best of his knowledge they had neither President or Secretary. We prepared lists; cannot say they were intended for canvassers but they were for men who called on the electors and solicited for their vote We had printed lists of electors at one time and we checked the same at the committee. We got the list at the committee room the list of the voters for the town and parish of Lachine.\nCross-examined: Q. Were you requested to act as you did, or did you act from your own accord? A. I have acted from my own free will. Q. Were you considered an election agent? A. 1 think not. Q. You acted without being requested by anyone? A. I was never asked by any agent to use my influence. Q. Amongst the persons who were there, did you see any political opponent? A. All those who were present were above suspicion. From what I saw, Dr. Lefebre worked a good deal during election. I think he belonged to the committee. I cannot say if he canvassed votes. I have myself driven a vehicle on the day of polling, and I brought in some voters for the party.\nDr. Lefebre stated he was Secretary-Treasurer of Mr. Laflamme's committee at Lachine. He speaks of receiving $30 or $40 as coming from the Central Committee at Montreal, through Mr. Leopold Laflamme.\nMr. Gariepy solicited votes for Mr. Laflamme, who must have been aware he was working for him. Mr. Gariepy said: \" I must tell you it was an understood affair between us.\"\nMr. Jett\u00e9 was president of Mr. Laflamme's General Committee at Montreal. Amongst other subscribers to the fund to pay expenses of the election, Mr. Wilfred Prevost has subscribed $100. These subscriptions were made without the knowledge of the candidate. Of these monies received by him, he gave Mr. Adam $340 and paid $50 to deposit with the Returning Officer, $200 more were paid Adam of the funds subscribed as above, but not directly by Mr. Jett\u00e9. Mr. Jett\u00e9 thinks from $500 to $600 were subscribed and paid through the committee to aid Mr. Laflamme. The committee corresponded in Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve with Mr. Doyon. Rodrique was considered a messenger not an agent at Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve.\nI have already referred to Doyon having been sent to Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve and Isle Bizard by the Central Committee to organize the contest; and also to Forget and Madon helping to organize two committees in St. Laurent; and Forget was also paid his travelling expenses for representing Mr. Laflamme on the day of polling.\nMr. Wilfred Prevost took a very active part in the election; was not entrusted with the general organization of the election; had not special charge of the several parish lists; had special charge of the town and parish of Lachine. He said he did not recollect of seeing Jashman Belanger at the committee rooms, his absence was felt there. Mr. Prevost, it will not be forgotten, was a subscriber of $100 to the fund raised by the Central Committee, and, no doubt, was a member of it.\nMr. Bienvenu was Secretary of the Central Committee at Montreal. There were other parties who, it was probable were sent by this committee to aid in some way in the election, and they were afterwards paid their expenses through the election agent.\nI think we, from this evidence, must assume that Mr. Laflamme had a committee at Lachine, and it was organized through the means of the Central Committee, probably by Mr. Prevost; that Mr. Robert was one of the members of that committee from its organization attended its meetings, assisted as much as he could as a committee man list of voters were there made out for canvassers, or, as he says, for men who called on the electors and solicited for their vote. Mr. Robert was not a mere clerk there, he was a member of the committee. Mr. Laflamme speaks of him as being one of his best supporters. He (Robert) speaks of making reports to Gariepy, who was especially a friend of Mr, Laflamme, and who it was understood (between him and Mr. Laflamme) was to work for him; to Mr. Cardinal, no doubt equally in his interest with his knowledge, as Mr. Laflamme had given him a letter to Mr. Cooke; and Mr. Wilfred Prevost, who, I assume, was the organizer of the committee; and that Robert met him at the committee. It seems to me, that Mr. Robert was an active, energetic and trusted supporter of Mr. Laflamme; and if the Central Committee could give him authority to act, as I think they could, he must surely have had authority.\nMr. Leopold Laflamme says Robert took a part in the contest in the interest of Respondent who could not well help knowing it; that he was certain he was a devoted partizan of his brother.\nI shall refer to a few of the election cases decided in England, as shewing the general grounds on which the question of agency is discussed, and the conclusion which is arrived at that no certain rule can be laid down as to what constitutes agency, and that the uncertainty arises from the different conclusions that may be drawn from the evidence when it is presented to different minds. The common sense of the Judge, so frequently referred to by Lord Blackburn, not being regulated by a fixed standard, does not conduce to uniformity of decision. The views of the Judges, in some of the decided cases, as to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish agency, would justify a difference of opinion S on the question whether the Petitioners have proved enough to establish Robert's agency in this case. To some minds, the facts necessary for that purpose may appear not to have been sufficiently brought out on the trial. I think differently, and that the weight of authority and of reason sustains my view.\nAs a Judge 1 have no doubt if the matter were triable before a jury that there is evidence as to Robert's agency, which it would be necessary to submit to the jury. Then, sitting in place of a jury, I must say the evidence to which I have referred satisfies me beyond a reasonable doubt that Robert was Mr. Laflamme's agent; and that the latter knew\u2014or must, under the circumstances of this case, be presumed to have known\u2014that he was acting in that capacity for him and on his behalf.\nIn referring to election matters, I think it may be stated as an axiom, that the law of bribery, and in relation to corrupt practices, is not framed so much with the object of punishing the briber as to secure purity of election.\nThe question as to agency in election matters was a good deal discussed in the case of Duffy v. Ryan, in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick ([91]); and my brother Ritchie, in giving the judgment of the Court in that case, refers to many of the cases where the question of agency arose.\nIn the following extracts, which I have made from the decided cases, I have had more thought of the general principles laid down than of particular circumstances of each case, as it is so manifest that as to this matter of agency each case must, as already intimated, be decided on its own peculiar circumstances.\nIn the Norwich case ([92]), heard before Martin, Baron, this doctrine was laid down, which I think is now firmly established, that the law of agency which would vitiate an election, is utterly diff\u00e9rent from that which would subject a candidate to a penalty or indictment; and the question of his right to sit in Parliament has to be settled upon an entirely different principle. The relation is more on the principle of master and servant than of principal and agent.\nIn the Hereford case ([93]) Lord Blackburn uses this language:\nIt would not be possible to unseat a person for corrupt practices. if he were permitted, by the means of persons who acted for him, or who brought him forward, either one or the other, to obtain the benefit of their aid, if he were not to be also responsible to the extent of losing his seat for the. corrupt practices that were done by them for his benefit. That is one of the great reasons for which, as a matter of public policy, it was thought necessary in order to correct corrupt practices to establish that principle. I apprehend that, in a case where corrupt practices are shewn which the candidates themselves are not cognizant of, you must bear these two principal reasons in mind; and then, exercising what may be called common sense, you must see doss the particular corrupt act come within the rule as an act done by an agent. If it does not, then though the person may have been canvassing the town or speaking on one side or the other; still we could not say the candidate should be unseated on that account. Every bit of canvassing and acting for a candidate is evidence to show agency, but the result cannot depend upon any present rule that I could define. It comes to be a question of degree, of more or less, and of common sense. It happens that from the nature of things, when you come to a question of degree, of more or less and of common sense, and leave it in that way to a jury, if there were a jury, the jury would determine it sometimes in one way and sometimes in another. Unfortunately, when judges are obliged to be judges of that question of degree and common sense, there is this unavoidable uncertainty, because it is quite clear that the common sense of one judge will differ from the common sense of another. To use the old simile that was used by Mr. Selden many years ago, and which is none the worse for being old, the standard of common sense would be as uncertain as a measure of length, the unit of which should be the judge's foot: because one judge's foot would be longer and another shorter. We cannot help that. I wish with all my heart that the Legislature would find out some test to relieve us from that uncertainty.\nLichfield case ([94])\u2014Mr. Justice Willes said:\u2014\nI think it may be taken that those who have hitherto had the decisions of election cases have held that an agent to canvass would be an agent within the statute.\nIt having been stated on behalf of the Respondent that he employed no committee, but there were persons who acted in drawing up cards &c. Mr. Justice Willes said:\nThat is the modern fashion apparently: but persons who do what committeemen formerly did, and are seen taking an active part, are just as much committeemen as if they were called so.\nWindsor case ([95]) Mr. Justice Willes said he did not think a mere card messenger could be said to have been an agent.\nI have stated that authority to canvass and I purposely used the word a \"authority\" and not \"employment\" because I meant the observation to apply to persons authorized to canvass, whether paid or not for their services would, in my opinion, constitute an agent; and that authority for the general management of an election would involve authority to canvass. I do not say that there may not be instances of agency on behalf of a candidate besides those of authority to canvass, and authority for the general management of an election.\nHe thought an agent for election expenses might be but a mere messenger could not be, regarded as an agent.\nIn the Taunton case, 1869 ([96]) the question as to the effect the illegal act of a volunteer association may have on the status of a candidate is a good deal discussed. One of the head notes of the case is :\nThe managers of the Conservative Association, having circulated addresses and papers issued by the candidate, will be presumed to have done so with his knowledge, or with that of his agents, so as to constitute the association an agent for such candidate, and to make him responsible for any illegal acts of its managers.\nThat case was also tried before Lord Blackburn, and he referred to the question of agency very much as he did in the Hereford case ([97]). He uses this language:\nIf there is evidence to show that the party is acting for the member who is returned, I think one should consider him to be an agent. If, taking the spirit and object of the rule, you think, bringing your common sense to bear upon it, that he was substantially an agent, I think it is all I could say to a jury: and then, as the Legislature have thought fit to make me both judge and jury, I must apply that guide as best I can myself. I at once see the great inconvenience of such a rule being laid down in this: if that be the proper guide to be taken the law must be very uncertain.\nIn the concluding part of his judgment, he uses these words:\nThe candidate may show that the body acting in that way was acting officiously for him, as I may call it; that it was not with his consent, and was against his will \u00ab but the presumption does arise, I think that it was done in his favor done for him\u2014unless there be something to show to the contrary. Then taking it, as I said before, as a matter of common sense, looking to the substantial degree to which they went, I think the degree goes very far I think in this case such a degree of benefit would be derived from their assistance, that their assistance was so important to the candidate, that it fairly establishes this, that if he took their assistance, did not hold them off, or repudiate them, he must abide the consequences and be responsible for their malpractices.\nThe same learned judge tried the Staley bridge case ([98]). In one part of his judgment he said:\nEach case must be considered with reference to the whole facts taken together and be delivered by the solution of the question, whether the relation between the person guilty of the corrupt practice and the member was such as to make the latter fairly responsible for it.\nIt was then held as laid down in the head note of the case : If the services of a volunteer are accepted, the candidate will not invariably be responsible for his acts. Where the heads of a committee were bon\u00e2 fide voters, not chosen by the Respondent, but by bon\u00e2, fide voters amongst themselves in a business-like way, it was held, that a messenger sent by one of those heads was not so connected with the sitting member, as to make him responsible for his acts.\nThe corrupt act was in the person sent to buy up votes offering to pay them their day's wages if they would come and vote for Respondent. There the Respondent had a committee of his own. But the evidence showed that the sitting member's people did request the volunteer committees there to bring up votes, when they could. He thought many of the volunteer agents who were heads of committees might, or might not be so far connected with the Respondent that he would be responsible for them. In this case he was convinced they were real bon\u00aa fide volunteers, voters acting for themselves, not selected by the member, or chosen by him at all, but really bonfire, in a business like manner, the voters of the district choosing Jobin, and respectable men in whom they had confidence, to be the head of their own department, and acting together. A messenger who is sent by one of them is not so directly connected with the candidate, or any of his recognized agents, as to make him responsible for his misconduct in offering a bribe.\nThe same learned judge said in the Bewdley case ([99]):\nNo one can lay down a precise rule as to what would constitute evidence of being an agent. Every instance in which it is shown, that either with the knowledge of the member himself, or to the knowledge of his agents, who had employment from him, a person acts at all in furthering the election for him, in trying to get votes for him, is evidence tending to show that the person so acting was authorized to act as his agent. It is by no means essential that it should be shown that a person so employed, in order to be an agent for that purpose, is paid in the slightest degree, or is in the nature of being a paid person. In the Boston case ([100]) Mr. Justice Grove says on the subject of agency:\nBut with regard to the election law, the matter goes a great deal further, because a number of persons are employed for the purpose of promoting an election, who are not only not authorized to do corrupt acts, but who are expressly enjoined to abstain from doing them; nevertheless, the law says, that if a man chooses to allow a number of people to go about canvassing for him, generally to support his candidature; to issue placards; to form a committee for his election, and to do things of that sort, he must, to use a colloquial expression, take the bad with the good. He cannot avail himself of these people s acts for the purpose of promoting his election, and then turn his back, or sit quietly by and let them corrupt the constituency 5 therefore, the law Carries the responsibility of a member of Parliament for the acts of the agents, who are instrumental\u2014with his assent\u2014in promoting his election, a good deal further than the mere common law of agency.\nIn the Wakefield case ([101]), decided in 1874, the same learned Judge refers to certain facts which prima facie would bring the case within the law of agency, and would be sufficient to satisfy a tribunal that the Respondent had put himself, or allowed himself to be, in the hands of certain persons, or had made common cause with them, so as to make himself liable, if they, for the purpose of promoting his election, committed acts of bribery. Further on, he says:\nA candidate is responsible generally, you may say, for the deeds of those who, to his knowledge, for the purpose of promoting his election, canvass or do such other acts as may tend to promote his election, provided that the candidate, or his authorized agents, have reasonable knowledge that those persons are so acting with that object.* * *\nHe alludes to the impossibility of laying down such exact definitions and limits as should meet every case, and says:\nIt is well it should be understood, that it rests with the Judge, not misapplying or straining the law, but applying the principles of the law to the changed states of facts, to form his opinion as to whether there has, or has not, been what constitutes agency in these election matters.\nActing on the rule thus laid down by Mr. Justice Grove I have arrived at the conclusion that Robert was Mr. Laflamme's agent, and that for the corrupt act done through him the election should be set aside I think Mr. Laflamme received most important and effective aid by and through the central committee. I think it is probable he would not have been elected if he had not had that aid. I think Mr. Robert was a member of the Lachine committee, which was organized through and acted in concert with the Central Committee from whom they received material aid. That Mr. Robert was an active and effective member of that committee and that Mr. Laflamme must have known, or must be presumed to have known that Mr. Robert was actively engaged in furthering his election. I think he cannot be allowed to avail himself of all these important aids to his success, and then repudiate them, so far as to say he is not responsible for the illegal acts of those who have thus aided him.\nSTRONG, J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nL'expos\u00e9 clair et pr\u00e9cis que le Juge en chef de cette cour vient de faire de tons les faits de la cause et des pr\u00e9tentions des parties, me dispense compl\u00e8tement d'y r\u00e9f\u00e9rer\nNous nous accordons tous \u00e0 dire que de tons les reproches faits \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 sur sa conduite et celle de ses agents avant et pendant l'\u00e9lection dont ii s'agit en cette cause il n'y en a qu'un seul qui puisse en ce moment attirer notre attention, c'est celui indiqu\u00e9 par le Juge en chef; et il s'agit en cons\u00e9quence de savoir Si le nomm\u00e9 Placide Robert, dont ii est question comme agent de M. Laflamme, \u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement tel agent ou non et s'il a commis un acte de corruption tel que pr\u00e9vu par l'acte des \u00e9lections de la Puissance du Canada,\nQu'a fait cet homme, Placide Robert Le voici en quelques mots. Voulant obtenir de M. Laflamme in emploi ou place pour son beau-fr\u00e8re Edouard Honor\u00e9 Ouellette, il demande \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9, environ un an avant qu'il f\u00fbt question de l'\u00e9lection dont il s'agit en cette cause, de t\u00e2cher de procurer un emploi \u00e0 son beau-fr\u00e8re Ouellette, en lui disant qu'il pensait que cela ferait plaisir \u00e0 la famille de Pierre Pare dont Ouellette \u00e9tait le gendre. M. Laflamme li dit qu'il y penserait et qu'il se rappellerait cet homme et t\u00e2cherait de le placer s'il Se pr\u00e9sentait une vacance. M. Laflamme r\u00e9p\u00e8te cela plusieurs fois et m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 une \u00e9poque de deux \u00e0 trois semaines avant l'\u00e9lection. Comme les jug\u00e9s en premi\u00e8re instance, nous ne trouvons aucun reproche s\u00e9rieux \u00e0 faire \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 d'avoir tenu ce langage, bien naturel envers un de ses constituants, car il est indubitable qu'un repr\u00e9sentant peut et doit voir au bien-\u00eatre des habitants de son comt\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et je dis que refuser \u00e0 un repr\u00e9sentant le patronage de sa position serait une absurdit\u00e9. Notons que cette promesse est faite sans condition, sans promesse de son accomplissement. Nous sommes donc tous d'opinion que l'Intim\u00e9 n'a encouru aucune responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard; mais plus tard, ce monsieur Placide Robert agissant de son seul chef, a dit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 ses beaux-fr\u00e8res de la famille Fare \u00e0 l'approche de l'\u00e9lection qu'ils feraient mieux de ne pas voter, et qu'en votant on pourrait sen pr\u00e9valoir pour refuser de placer Ouellette.\nVoil\u00e0 donc le reproche fait \u00e0 M. Laflamme sous le pr\u00e9texte que Placide Robert 1. avait engage quelques membres de sa famille \u00e0 s'abstenir de voter ou de cabaler en faveur du candidat oppose. 2. Que Placide Robert \u00e9tait l'agent de M. Laflamme et pouvait le compromettre. Je suss d'opinion que Placide Robert n'a pas fait un acte de corruption en disant confidentiellement dans le cercle de sa famille \" qqu\u2019il serait mieux pour eux de ne pas voter.\" Ii n'exprimait qu'une id\u00e9e, qu'une opinion plus ou moins rationnelle; ii ne faisait aucune menace d\u00e9 la part de M. Laflamme, il ne faisait que ce que tout homme sens\u00e9 ferait dans l'intimit\u00e9 de sa famille au bien-\u00eatre de laquelle ii voudrait contribuer comme bon fils et comme bon fr\u00e8re.\nJe consid\u00e8re que pour sauvegarder la puret\u00e9 des \u00e9lections ii ne faut pas p\u00e9n\u00e9trer dans le sein des families et t\u00e2cher de trouver un crime dans expression bien naturelle du d\u00e9sir chez un homme de voir son fr\u00e8re recevoir un l\u00e9ger emploi. S'il fallait interpr\u00e9ter de telles observations, de tels conseils comme synonymes de corruption je demanderai combien de nos \u00e9lections seraient \u00e0 l'abri de tels reproches.\nDans mon opinion, il manque \u00e0 ces conseils de Placide Robert pour en constituer un acte de corruption bien des \u00e9l\u00e9ments, savoir, les menaces, les reproches grossiers, l'expression exag\u00e9r\u00e9e des consequences de la conduite de sa famille et surtout l'information donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette famille que M. Laflamme n'avait fait la promesse que sons la condition qu'elle s'abstiendrait de voter Je ne vois rien de semblable dans le t\u00e9moignage, je n'y vois que des conseils entre parents d\u00e9sireux de se prot\u00e9ger. Je remarque au dossier la preuve que ce M. Edouard Honor\u00e9 Cueillette n'a jamais re\u00e7u de place. En cons\u00e9quence je suis d'opinion que Placide Robert n'a pas commis un acte de corruption dans ses conversations ci-dessus rapport\u00e9es et qu'il n'a fait encourir aucune responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 en supposant m\u00eame qu'il put \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme agent.\nEtant d'opinion que Placide Robert n'a pas commis d'actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles au point de vue l\u00e9gal, il est inutile pour moi de discuter la question d'agence, et en cons\u00e9quence, je suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel avec d\u00e9pens contre les appelants.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nLa cour \u00e9tant unanime \u00e0 confirmer le jugement prononc\u00e9 par l'honorable juge qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cette cause en premi\u00e8re instance, \u00e0 l'exception seulement de la partie renvoyant l'accusation de corruption personnelle contre le membre si\u00e9geant au sujet de la promesse faite \u00e0 Robert de faire obtenir une situation \u00e0 son beau-fr\u00e8re Ouellette c'est \u00e0 ce chef d'accusation que je limiterai mes observations sur cette cause ainsi qu'aux t\u00e9moignages sur lesquels les appelants s'appuient pour en faire la preuve.\nLe t\u00e9moignage de Robert \u00e9tant le plus important de tous, je crois devoir en donner une analyse afin de mieux faire comprendre le v\u00e9ritable caract\u00e8re des faits reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9.\nCe t\u00e9moignage peut se r\u00e9sumer comme suit:\u2014\nRobert est un client et un ami politique du membre si\u00e9geant. Dans bien des circonstances, il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 des \u00e9lecteurs de leur vote mais il n'est pas all\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs r\u00e9sidences pour conna\u00eetre leur opinion. Plus d'un an avant l'\u00e9lection se trouvant au bureau de ce dernier il lui demanda une place pour son beau-fr\u00e8re. Le membre si\u00e9geant lui r\u00e9pondit que s'il se pr\u00e9sentait une vacance il ferait son possible pour lui Robert. Dans une autre entrevue (ni\u00e9e par l'Intim\u00e9), ayant renouvel\u00e9 sa demande pour son beau-fr\u00e8re ii aurait ajout\u00e9: \" \u00e7a ferait bien plaisir \u00e0 la famille Pare si vous pouviez procurer une place pour mon beau-fr\u00e8re,\u2014peut-\u00eatre cela pourrait vous \u00eatre utile plus tard; cela pourrait peut-\u00eatre les emp\u00eacher de voter \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection prochaine.\" Il ne fut pas parl\u00e9 d'\u00e9lection entre eux, mais il en \u00e9tait question. La famille Pare avait vot\u00e9 contre le ministre de la Justice en 1872, et appartenait au parti Conservateur. Sans pouvoir en pr\u00e9ciser l'\u00e9poque, c'est trois ou quatre semaines avant qu'il fut question d'\u00e9lection qu'il a parl\u00e9 S, au membre si\u00e9geant de la famille Par\u00e9 Celui-ci a r\u00e9pondu qu'il penserait \u00e0 lui, (Robert), et que s'il se pr\u00e9sentait quelque vacance, il ferait tout son possible pour lui; il dit avoir compris par cette r\u00e9ponse, que c'\u00e9tait pour son beau-fr\u00e8re. Il n'a pas du tout parl\u00e9 de ce sujet au membre si\u00e9geant durant l'\u00e9lection.\nAyant demand\u00e9 aux Pare leurs opinions, ils lui dirent qu'ils voteraient pour Girouard, mais qu'ils n'emploieraient pas leur influence,\u2014ce \u00e0 quoi ii r\u00e9pondit que ce serait mieux de ne pas voter puisqu'il \u00e9tait question d'une place pour Honor\u00e9 Ouellette.\nIl n'a pas dit an membre si\u00e9geant ni \u00e0 aucun de ses agents ou amis qu'il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la famille Pare pendant l'\u00e9lection. A communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Ouellette ses entrevues avec le M. S. mais ne se rappelle pas lui en avoir parl\u00e9 pendant l'\u00e9lection. A vu le M. S. \u00e0 la Pointe Claire le jour de la nomination, l'a salu\u00e9 et lui a donn\u00e9 la main; ne lui a pas parl\u00e9 pendant l'\u00e9lection, ne lui a jamais fait de rapport de ses chances \u00e0 Lachine. A fait des rapports \u00e0 MM. Gari\u00e9py, Cardinal, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame \u00e0 M. Pr\u00e9vost Son nom ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 mis sur la liste d'un comit\u00e9, \u00e0 Lachine, comme membre, il a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 trois on quatre s\u00e9ances; y a rencontr\u00e9 MM. Pr\u00e9vost, Gari\u00e9py et Cardinal, une fois. C'\u00e9tait un comit\u00e9 priv\u00e9, mais ii y assistait des lib\u00e9raux comme des conservateurs; la porte \u00e9tait ouverte pour tout le monde. On v\u00e9riflait les listes; a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 ce travail. Il n'y avait ni pr\u00e9sident, ni s\u00e9cr\u00e9tine suivant lui. Des listes \u00e9taient pr\u00e9par\u00e9es pour des gens qui allaient voir les \u00e9lecteurs pour les solliciter \u00e0 venir voter. Il a eu une liste d'\u00e9lecteurs qu'il a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9e au comit\u00e9 Deux mois environ apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9lection ii a fait an M. S. la m\u00eame demande \u00e0 propos de Ouellette et en a re\u00e7u la m\u00eame r\u00e9ponse.\nVoici tout ce qu'il y a d'important dans ce t\u00e9moignage concernant la promesse d'une place all\u00e9gu\u00e9e comme acte de corruption personnelle de la part du membre si\u00e9geant.\nSi respectable que soit ce t\u00e9moin, il ne serait cependant pas juste d'accepter comme exacts tous les faits dont ii a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, sans les accompagner des correctifs que l'on trouve dans sa d\u00e9position et sans non plus les comparer avec le t\u00e9moignage de l'Intim\u00e9 et ceux particuli\u00e8rement des deux Par\u00e9, au moyen desquels les appelants pr\u00e9tendent compl\u00e9ter la preuve de l'accusation en question. Entre ces divers t\u00e9moignages et celui de Robert, ii se trouve des divergences sur plusieurs points importants qui m\u00e9ritent d'\u00eatre signal\u00e9es.\nD'apr\u00e8s sa propre version, Robert aurait en avant l'\u00e9lection plusieurs conversations avec l'Intim\u00e9 au sujet d'une place pour Ouellette; la premi\u00e8re, plus d'un an avant l'\u00e9lection, les autres, dans i\u2019 automne de 1876 lorsqu'il s'agissait d'\u00e9lection.\nSur ce point ii est d'abord contredit par lui-m\u00eame, et ensuite par l'Intim\u00e9. La question suivante lui ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite: Q.\u2014\" Pendant l'\u00e9lection, pendant les discussions, aviez-vous en une conversation avec M. Laflamme \u00e0 propos du m\u00eame sujet (une place pour \" Ouellette). R. Pas du tout.\" Il a en avant cela, le soin de dire que par \u00e9lection il entend la discussion publique qui se fait ace sujet.\nS'il est correcte dans cette partie de son t\u00e9moignage, il ne peut pas l'\u00eatre dans celle o\u00f9 ii a dit qu'il a en de ces conversations pendant l'\u00e9lection Ce qui rend encore plus certain le fait qu'il est tomb\u00e9 en erreur \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, c'est que dans une autre partie de son t\u00e9moignage o\u00f9 on lui demande \" s'il a vu le membre si\u00e9geant pour lui parler il r\u00e9pond seulement qu'il l'a vu \u00e0 la Pointe Claire, le jour de la nomination, la salu\u00e9 et lui a donn\u00e9 la main. Ailleurs il dit i\u2019 avoir vu \u00e0 bord de I' America mais ne lui a pas parl\u00e9 non plus. A part de son propre t\u00e9moignage pour le contredire sur ce point, ii y a encore celui de l'Intim\u00e9 qui dit \u00e0 ce sujet dans sa d\u00e9claration apr\u00e8s avoir rapport\u00e9 leur entrevue, concernant Ouellette:\nThe thing remained in that way, and previous to the election particularly there never was one word said or breathed on that subject between Robert and myself.\nCette assertion qui s'accorde avec les deux derni\u00e8res de Robert, suffit pour d\u00e9montrer qu'il a commis une erreur lorsqu'il a dit qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question de ce sujet entre eux pendant l'\u00e9lection. La chose est impossible puisqu'il ne se sont pas parl\u00e9s du tout, et qu'ils n'ont fait qu'\u00e9changer une poign\u00e9e de main, le jour de la nomination.\nQuant aux diff\u00e9rences importantes entre ce t\u00e9moignage et ceux de Par\u00e9, ii y sera fait allusion plus tard.\nLe r\u00e9sultat de cette confrontation de Robert avec lui-m\u00eame et avec l'Intim\u00e9 prouve d'une mani\u00e8re satisfaisante qu'il n'y a eu entre lui et l'Intim\u00e9, avant l'\u00e9lection, qu'une seule entrevue dans laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de cette promesse. Si les paroles de Robert au sujet de la famille Pare sont correctes elles doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 dites dans la seule entrevue dont parle l'Intim\u00e9 laquelle a eu lieu plus d'un an avant l'\u00e9lection, et dans un temps n'en \u00e9tait nullement question,\nEn admettant m\u00eame pour l'argument qu'il y ait eu deux entrevues, la premi\u00e8re, dans laquelle il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 question que de Ouellette, la deuxi\u00e8me, trois on quatre semaines avant l'\u00e9lection, dans laquelle ii aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 question de la famille Par\u00e9, il est clair que dans la premi\u00e8re, il ne s'est rien pass\u00e9 qui f\u00fbt de nature \u00e0 compromettre l'intim\u00e9, La promesse alors faite ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme entach\u00e9e de corruption puisqu'elle n'a pu \u00eatre faite en vue de l'\u00e9lection dont il n'\u00e9tait alors nullement question. On ne peut certainement pas pr\u00e9tende qu'un d\u00e9put\u00e9 n\u00e8pes faire honn\u00eatement et l\u00e9galement \u00e0 un de ses constituants une promesse de ce genre. Une telle promesse ne peut devenir ill\u00e9gale que si elle est faite pour des motifs et sous des circonstances prohib\u00e9es par la loi. Il ne se rencontrait aucune de ces circonstances lorsque celle dont ii s'agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 un ami politique et personnel qui avait droit \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration et \u00e0 la protection de son repr\u00e9sentant dans une demande parfaitement honn\u00eate et l\u00e9gitime.\nEn supposant que dans la deuxi\u00e8me entrevue, Robert ait dit \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 ce qui est rapport\u00e9 ci-dessus concernant la famille Par\u00e9, l'Intim\u00e9 a-t-il dit ou fait quelque chose dans cette circonstance qui puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un acte de corruption.\nQu'a-t-il r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la consid\u00e9ration que Robert faisait valoir en faveur de Ouellette, savoir: \" que \u00e7a pourrait \" peut-\u00eatre lui \u00eatre utile plus tard\u2014que \u00e7a pourrait \" peut-\u00eatre emp\u00eacher les Pare de voter; \" a-t-il dit quelque chose qui puisse faire voir qu'il acceptait le raisonnement de Robert et que la promesse d\u00e9j\u00e0 faite, longtemps auparavant, a \u00e9t\u00e9 alors renouvel\u00e9e pour le motif sugg\u00e9r\u00e9? Non, l'Intim\u00e9 r\u00e9pond exactement dans cette circonstance comme ii l'avait fait auparavant, \"qu'il fera son possible pour lui (Robert) lorsqu'il se pr\u00e9sentera une vacance.\" Il ne s'engage \u00e0 rien ni envers Ouellette, ni envers les Par\u00e9. Il ne pouvait renier la promesse ant\u00e9rieurement faite; il ne pouvait faire quelle exist\u00e2t point, ii se borne \u00e0 la r\u00e9p\u00e9ter dans les m\u00eames termes et sans aucun \u00e9gard au nouveau motif qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9. Rien, absolument rien, ne fait voir non plus que l'Intim\u00e9 en r\u00e9pondant ainsi, le faisait dans l'intention de gagner un avantage quelconque en vue d'une prochaine \u00e9lection, puisque Robert admet que cette deuxi\u00e8me entrevue a eu lieu trois ou quatre semaines avant qu'il f\u00fbt question d'\u00e9lection.\nSi la promesse faite dans la premi\u00e8re entrevue (ce qui est admis de toutes parts) n'\u00e9tait pas ill\u00e9gale A son origine, peut-elle l'\u00eatre devenue sans que l'Intim\u00e9 y ait lui-m\u00eame apport\u00e9 quelque modification? Peut-on, en don- nant un effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 des faits auxquels ii est tout-\u00e0-fait \u00e9tranger, changer la nature de cette promesse, d'abord tout-\u00e0-fait innocente, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 en faire une offense de la plus haute gravit\u00e9 \u00e9 C'est ce que les appelants pr\u00e9tendent pouvoir faire en prouvant que Robert \u00e9tait devenu pendant l'\u00e9lection un des agents de l'Intim\u00e9, et, qu'en cette qualit\u00e9, ii aurait fait allusion \u00e0 la promesse en question de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 influencer la famille Par\u00e9 dans le but de l'emp\u00eacher de voter.\nJe ne puis, avant d'aller plus loin m'emp\u00eacher de faire observer \u00e0 propos de cette accusation, ainsi que l'a fait l'honorable juge qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance, que li Intim\u00e9 n'est pas accus\u00e9 d'avoir fait cette promesse avec l'intention d'influencer qui que ce soit dans le but de les emp\u00eacher de voter. Malgr\u00e9 un examen minutieux des \" particularit\u00e9s,\" je n'ai Pu y trouver d'all\u00e9gation \u00e0 cet effet. Sans doute une telle omission ne pouvait emp\u00eacher l'investigation d'avoir lieu, mais elle n'aurait di \u00eatre faite qu'apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu du juge une permission, qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e, d'amender les particularit\u00e9s afin d'offrir la preuve de ce fait.\nMr. Justice Blackburn said that all through these cases had gone upon this principle, namely, that he should not allow any inquiry to be stifled, as not being in the particulars; but at the same time he could not allow any respondent to be taken by surprise without having fair warning. If therefore the petitioners relied upon this evidence, and had not given notice, they must apply ([102])\nBien que l'on ait irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement laiss\u00e9 faire cette preuve je ne crois pas toutefois que cette irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 soit suffisante pour nous emp\u00eacher den prendre connaissance et de prononcer notre opinion sur sa valeur.\nL'appr\u00e9ciation que je fais des rapports de Robert avec la famille Par\u00e9, me portant \u00e0 conclure qu'il ne s'est rendu coupable d'aucune offense contre les lois \u00e9lectorales, il serait inutile \u00e0 mon point de vue de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour \u00e9tablir sa qualit\u00e9 d'agent de l'Intim\u00e9. Je passerai donn\u00e9 de suite \u00e0 l'examen de ces rapports.\nOn a vu par son t\u00e9moignage que Ouellette est, comme lui, gendre de M. F. Par\u00e9, et que malgr\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence d'opinions qui existent entre eux, les membres de cette famille paraissent vivre en tr\u00e8s bonne intelligence.\nIl n'est pas douteux que Robert avait communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la famille Pare ses d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de l'Intim\u00e9 dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de Ouellette. Quoique l'\u00e9poque de la premi\u00e8re communication ne soit pas bien \u00e9tablie il est certain qu'elle a eu lieu an moins six mois avant l'\u00e9lection, puisque \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, Alphonse Far\u00e9 \u00e9crivait lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9, sur le m\u00eame sujet. Mais ii est bien plus probable que cette communication a eu lieu imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re entrevue de Robert avec l'Intim\u00e9. Mais il para\u00eet certain qu'il en aurait aussi parl\u00e9 pendant l'\u00e9lection. Voici ce que lui-m\u00eame rapporte a ce sujet:\nIl croit avoir parl\u00e9 pendant l'\u00e9lection m\u00eame, aux messieurs Port\u00e9 du vote qu'ils devaient donner, leur a demand\u00e9 leur opinion, et ils Jul ont dit qu'ils voteraient pour M. Girouard, mais qu'ils n'emploieraient pas leur influence A. cela il a r\u00e9pondu que ce serait mieux de ne pas voter puisqu'il \u00e9tait question d'avoir une place pour Honor\u00e9 Ouellette.\nSun ce fait important Robert n'est pas d'accord avec Fran\u00e7ois Par\u00e9, pr\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin. Il est vrai qu'il dit d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qu'il croit en avoir parl\u00e9 aux messieurs Par\u00e9. A part des deux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examines ii y en a un troisi\u00e8me, Fran\u00e7ois Par\u00e9, fils, auquel ii en aurait aussi parl\u00e9, mais celui-l\u00e0 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin. Nous n'avons donn\u00e9 de cette conversation que les versions de Francois Par\u00e9, pr\u00e9, et d'Alphonse Par\u00e9. Voici ce que dit \u00e0 ce sujet le p\u00e8re: Q. How long before the voting day did Mr. Placide Robert tell you not to vote in order to get a place?\nA. I cannot tell. I think it was a long time before the election. I know that the affair about the Post Office took place in the month of April of last year.\nC'est en avril ou en mai qu'avait en l'affaire du bureau de poste \u00e0 laquelle ii est fait allusion, plus de six mois avant l'\u00e9lection\nQ. How many days before the polling day did Mr. Placide Robert make the remark that it was best for you not to vote in order to get a place for Honor\u00e9 Ouellette?\nA. I do not know that he spoke of that to me. I told my sons that it was better not to vote, as we wanted to get a place from Mr. Laflamme. One of the three of us voted.\nQ. While the Election was spoken of, did Mr. Placide Robert say that it was better for you not to vote?\nA. I have no knowledge of that; it is myself who said so to my Sons, and one of them voted\nQ. It was yon who said it was better to abstain from voting? A\u00bb Yes,\nIl semble clair d'apr\u00e8s ce t\u00e9moignage que Robert n'a exerc\u00e9 aucune influence sur Frs. Par\u00e9. pr\u00e9, et que c'est plut\u00f4t ce dernier qui aurait recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 ses fils de ne pas voter.\nAlphonse Far\u00e9 dit sur le m\u00eame sujet:\nAt the time of the Election Mr. Robert told us that it would be better not to vote we then told him that we would vote. He told us: \"do as you please, they will use your votes as an objection to give Mr. Ouellette a place.\" That is the reason why he did not vote. * * *\nQ. At the time of the Election did Mr. Robert speak to you about your vote? A. He spoke of it to my brother, my brother told me.\nSi cette r\u00e9ponde signifie quelque chose, elle vent dire que Robert ne lui a pas parl\u00e9 \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, mais \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re qui le lui a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9.\nEvidemment ce qu'il a dit auparavant n'est fond\u00e9 que sur le rapport que lui a fait son fr\u00e8re Fran\u00e7ois de sa conversation qu'il avait eue avec Robert. Ce rapport est-il correct? Fran\u00e7ois Par\u00e9, fils, qui seul aurait Pu le prouver, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin. Mais chose assez singuli\u00e8re apr\u00e8s cette r\u00e9ponde qui ferait croire que c'est \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re seulement que Robert a parl\u00e9 il fait mention presque imm\u00e9diatement d'une conversation dans laquelle ii \u00e9tait le principal interlocuteur.\nSome time before the polling day two or three weeks before the election after what my brother had told me, I told Robert that I wanted to know if our abstention from voting was required\nIl parait clair par cette question que Robert n'avait fait aucune tentative pour l'emp\u00eacher de voter et ii est \u00e9galement clair par sa r\u00e9ponde qu'il n'entendait rien faire pour les y engager, puisqu'il leur d\u00eet de faire comme bon leur semblera.\nHe told me to do as I thought fit, but that it was better for us not\u00bb to vote. By that answer I imagined that the fact of our voting would be an objection to M. Ouellette getting a place.\nDe ce t\u00e9moignage ii ressort deux faits principaux, le premier, que Robert aurait dit au temps de l'\u00e9lection que c'\u00e9tait mieux de ne pas voter. Le deuxi\u00e8me qu'en r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 la question au sujet de l'abstention, ii aurait dit de faire comme on le jugerait \u00e0 propos.\nC'est \u00e0 cela que se r\u00e9duit toute l'intervention de Robert aupr\u00e8s de la famille Par\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 une simple expression d'une opinion sun une affaire \u00e0 laquelle la famille s'int\u00e9resse depuis longtemps. Robert me para\u00eet en cela avoir jou\u00e9 un role plut\u00f4t passif qu'actif La premi\u00e8re fois ii se contente de faire l'observation qu'il serait mieux de ne pas voter; la deuxi\u00e8me, il r\u00e9pond \u00e0 son interrogateur de faire comme bon lui semblera. Sa conduite en ces deux circonstances ne constitue pas m\u00eame le canvassing, t\u00e9l que d\u00e9fini dans la cause de Westbury ([103]).\nCanvassing may be either by asking a man to vote for the candidate for whom you are canvassing, or by begging him not to go to the poll, but to remain neutral and not to vote for the adversary. Il ne demande pas le vote des Pare il ne les sollicite pas non plus de s'abstenir de voter. Il ne fait aucune promesse de situation et ne s'engage pas non plus \u00e0 en procurer. Ce qu'il dit alors para\u00eet bien moins inspire par l'id\u00e9e du succ\u00e8s de l'\u00e9lection que par celle de servir les int\u00e9r\u00eats de Ouellette, qui n'est pas m\u00eame voteur et dont ii s'occupe depuis plus d'un an avant l'\u00e9lection. Il est certain qu'en faisant cette observation il n'avait aucune intention de corrompre les Pare. C'est evident, du moins quant au pr\u00e9, puisque celui-ci declare for mellement que ce n'est pas Robert, mais lui-m\u00eame qui a dit \u00e0 ses fils de ne pas voter. Il est vrai que Alphonse Pare ajoute que d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e9ponses de Robert\nI imagined that the fact of our voting would be an objection to Mr. Ouellette getting a place.\nRobert lui-m\u00eame n'a jamais fait cette observation qui, certainement, si elle e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par lui serait grave et pourrait donner un tout autre caract\u00e8re \u00e0 sa conduite. Il faut remarquer de plus que Alphonse Par\u00e9ne dit pas avoir exprim\u00e9 cette pens\u00e9e \u00e0 Robert, il dit seulement qu'il a fait en lui-m\u00eame cette r\u00e9flexion,\u2014\" I imagined, &c.\"\nD'apr\u00e8s la loi ce n'est pas ce qui peut s'\u00eatre pass\u00e9 dans l'esprit des Pare qui pouvait constituer l'offense dont il s'agit, mais bien l'intention qu'avait Robert en leur parlant ainsi.\nBaron Martin said in the Westminster case:\u2014\nThe question is not what is the motive that operated upon the mind of the voter. The mind of the voter has nothing to do with it; the question is. the intention of the person who furnished the board. Probably there is no man who ever was bribed but would swear that the bribe had not influenced his vote. ([104])\nQuoique dans cette citation il s'agisse d'aliments fournis aux voteurs, le principe est le m\u00eame et cette autorit\u00e9 est applicable au cas actuel.\nQue la connaissance des d\u00e9marches faites par Robert, que celles faites directement par Alphonse Par\u00e9, lui m\u00eame, six mois avant l'\u00e9lection, en \u00e9crivant \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 pour obtenir une place pour Ouellette, aient eu l'effet d'engager les Pare \u00e0 s'abstenir, c'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s certain; mais ce que la preuve n'\u00e9tablit pas, sans quoi ii ne saurait v avoir d'offense, c'est que cette abstention est due \u00e0 des d\u00e9marches faites par Robert dans le but d'obtenir ce r\u00e9sultat. L'allusion que Robert a faite a. cette promesse ne parait pas plus que la promesse elle-m\u00eame entach\u00e9e de corruption. Un fait bien remarquable et qui fait voir que les conversations de Robert avec lea Par\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas en vue de l'\u00e9lection, c'est qu'il n'en a jamais fait mention \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 ni \u00e0 aucun de ses agents. Je ne puis donc voir dans ce fait un motif suffisant pour annuler une \u00e9lection qui, sons tons lea autres rapports, me parait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite avec un d\u00e9sir \u00e9vident de se conformer \u00e0 la loi.\nHENRY, J.:\nI agree with the conclusions arrived at by the learned Chief Justice in regard to all the objections urged against the return of the Respondent and argued before us, except as to that of Placide Robert in regard to the alleged bribery by him of the two Pares, by means of which they were induced to refrain from voting for the Appellant. Although I may not coincide with the learned Chief Justice as to all he has thought proper to give as his reasons for arriving at the results he has intimated I have after the most anxious and laborious consideration, and the most exhaustive researches, arrived at the same conclusions he has in regard to all the cases, except the one referred to; but, after the same consideration and researches, in respect to the excepted case, I feel myself obliged to differ from him; and I shall, as briefly as I can, explain why I cannot coincide in his views. There is no evidence to charge the Respondent individually with the alleged bribery of the Pares for none was given that he either directed or counselled Robert to communicate what passed between them to the Pares or even knew at the time of the election that he did so or intended doing so We are, therefore, to see if Robert was guilty of bribery or undue influence by what he said to the Par\u00e9s in respect to their votes, and if so, was he the agent of the Respondent at the election, so that the Respondent should be held answerable for his corrupt acts if committed. I have no doubt but the two Par\u00e9s were restrained from votings by what Robert said to them but, looking at all the facts and circumstances, the conclusion that he was guilty of corrupt bribery or undue influence, is not so easily arrived at.\nAbout a year before the election Robert, who was not only a political supporter, but a client and personal friend of the Respondent made use of those relations with him to try to obtain an appointment of some kind for his brother-in-law (Edouard Honor\u00e9 Ouellette). He (Robert) says: \"I asked him if he could do something for my brother-in-law? He, in reply, simply told me that he would think of me and that if a vacancy occurred he would do his best for me.\" The substance of this conversation he says was repeated once or oftener; but not, as he says, within four or five weeks before the time when the election was first spoken of. During the election and during the public discussions, he says he had no conversation with Respondent on the subject. He say she communicated the conversation with the Respondent about Ouellette to the Pare family; but he does not say when; and, as there is no proof that he did so during the election the reasonable conclusion is that he did so shortly after the first conversation as one of the Par\u00e9s wrote the Respondent on the subject about six months before the election. It will thus be seen that long before the election was thought of, Robert, by his repeated intercessions with the Respondent exhibited a strong desire to benefit his brother-in-law; that this motive continued operative at the time of the election may be fairly assumed; but, it is alleged he had also the corrupt one to influence the votes of the Pares. Upon these propositions we have no direct evidence but we may assume the correctness of both. What then is the law in regard to them?\nIn the Windsor case ([105]) cited by the learned Chief Justice approvingly in the Kingston case ([106]), and in his judgment to-day, it was proved that the Respondent some long time before the election had distributed among his tenants (voters and others) \u00a3100; and, on being questioned\nWhether when he made these gifts, he had in view the election for the borough, admitted that, to a certain extent, he had. It was argued that this was a corrupt act, on account of which the Respondent should be unseated.\nBaron Bramwell, in his judgment, said as to this:\nIt is certain that the coming election must have been present to his mind when he gave away these things: but there is no harm in it. If a man has a legitimate motive for doing a thing, although in addition to that he has a motive which if it stood alone would be an illegitimate one, he is not to refrain from doing that which he might legitimately have done, on account of the existence of this motive, which, by itself, would have been an illegitimate motive. If the Respondent had not been an intending candidate for the borough, and yet had done as he has done in respect to these gifts, there would have been nothing illegal in what he did; and the fact that he did intend to represent Windsor', and thought good would be done to him, and that he would gain popularity by this, does not make that corrupt which otherwise would not be corrupt at all.\nApply, then, that doctrine, laid down as lately as 1874, to Robert and he cannot be convicted of bribery or undue influence. In the case just cited the Respondent admitted that he made the expenditure to a c certain extent in view of the election.\" In the present we only have that position by presumption, from the fact of his being an ardent supporter of the Respondent. Of the two, the former is the stronger case, because there can be no doubt of the feeling of the Respondent, who himself admits it. If, indeed, the Respondent in the case cited had but the one motive, and that the corrupt one mentioned, he would have been unseated and so if Robert had but the motive of aiding the Respondent the latter should be unseated, if Robert were his agent. It is the mind of the alleged briber that is to control. See Westminster case ([107]) where Baron Martin says:\nThe question is not what is the motive that operated upon the mind of the voter. The mind of the voter has nothing to do with it: the question is, the intention of the person who furnished the board.\nAnd why, then, if Robert did what would be harmless, but for the assumption that he was also actuated by the motive to assist the Respondent in his election, should he not have the benefit of the same principle as the learned Baron, in the Windsor case ([108]), so unequivocally and unreservedly laid down. Everyone must admit that if Robert, when suggesting the propriety of the Par\u00e9s abstaining from voting, was actuated solely by the motive to benefit his brother-in-law, or, if he were wholly indifferent about the result of the election, there would be no harm in his making that suggestion. The case of Robert is, therefore, exactly that of the Respondent in the Windsor case. I have sought in vain for a dividing principle between them; and I do not feel justified in setting up a decision of mine against that of the learned Baron which I have cited.\nIn the Warrington case ([109]), Baron Martin is reported as saying:\nI adhere to what Mr. Justice Trilles said at Lichfield, that a Judge. to upset the election, ought to be satisfied beyond all doubt that the election was void, and that the return of a member is a serious matter, and not lightly to be set aside.\nMr. Justice O'Brien in the Londonderry case ([110]), after quoting, approvingly, the above words of Baron Martin, says:\nMere suspicion, therefore, will not be sufficient to establish charge of bribery; and a Judge, in discharging the duty imposed upon him by the Statute, acting in the double capacity of judge and juror, should not hold that charge established upon evidence, which, in his opinion, would not be sufficient to warrant a jury in finding the charge proved.\nAdopting this decision, I think the evidence here would not warrant a jury in finding that Robert had not the motive of befriending his brother-in-law when telling the Pares \"they might do as they liked, but he thought it better they should not vote.\" Independently of the principle mentioned, the case, to satisfy the requirements of law and evidence, is not by any means a strong one. It is not suggested that Robert made an attempt to exercise corrupt influence with any other party; and stronger evidence of a corrupt intention is therefore necessary.\nI will now proceed to give briefly my views on the question of the agency of Robert.\nMr. Justice Blackburn, in the Bridge water case ([111]), says:\nIt has never yet been distinctly and precisely defined what degree of evidence is required to establish such a relation between the sitting member and the person guilty of corruption, as should constitute agency. I do not pretend to be able to define it certainly. No one has yet been able to go further than to say, as to some cases, enough has been established; as to others, enough has not been established to vacate the seat. This case on the right side of the line, that is on the wrong, but the line itself has never been definitely drawn, and I profess myself unable accurately to draw it.\"\nGrove J. in the Taunton case ([112]), said: All agr\u00e9e, that the relation is not the common law one of principal and agent. * * * I am of opinion that to establish agency for which the candidate would be responsible he must be proved by himself or by his authorized agent to have employed the persons whose conduct is impugned, to act on his behalf; or to have, to some extent, put himself in their hands, or to have made common cause with them for the purpose of promoting his election. To what extent such relation may be sufficient to fix the candidate must, it seems to me, be a question of degree and of evidence to be adjudged of by the Election Petition tribunal. Mere non-interference with persons, who, feeling interested in the success of a candidate, may act in support of his canvass, is not sufficient, in my judgment, to saddle the candidate with any unlawful acts of theirs of which the tribunal is satisfied he or his authorized agent is ignorant\nIn the Windsor case ([113]) it was proved that one Pantling wrote a letter to a voter named Juniper, who, at the time of the election, was away from the borough offering to pay his travelling expenses, if he would come and vote and it was admitted that this offer if made by the Respondent, or an agent of his, would have unseated him. The only evidence of Pantling being an agent was that he was a member of a committee which had been formed for the purpose of promoting the Respondent's election. It was not proved who put him on the committee, or how he got there; what his duties were or what he did but his own statement as to this was that he \" understood that his duties were to do the best he could for the Respondent.\" Mr. Baron Bramwell, in his judgment said as to this:\nI am invited to believe that, in some way or other, a man who has given no description of himself except that he was on a commette, was an agent, so that his act, in writing this letter, should unseat the Respondent. It appears to me really impossible to hold that he was an agent. I think that according to the authorities (citing Staleybridge, vol. I, 67; Westminster, ib. 92: Blackburn, ib. 200; Dublin, ib. 272; Taunton, ib. 183; Wigan, ib. 189; Galway, vol. II. 53. See also Newly, P. &. K. 151; Bristol, P. & K. 574), and according to the good sense of the matter, he was not an agent. He has given no account of how he came to write this letter to Juniper, he having told him where he had gone to, and having told him to write linon the occasion of an election. I cannot help agreeing with Mr. Giffard that if we were to hold this man to be an agent it would make the law of agency, as applicable to candidates, positively hateful and ludicrous.\nIn the Bolton case ([114]), Mr. Justice Mellor said:\nOf course the production of the canvass-books proves nothing except that certain ticks appear on it. If you want to go further call the canvasser; because the mere fact of a man having a canvass-book and canvassing, cannot affect the principal unless I know by whom the man was employed. There is nothing more difficult or more delicate than the question of agency; but if there be evidence which might satisfy a Judge, and if he be conscientiously satisfied that the man was employed to canvass, then it must be held that his acts bind his principal. Again, I should not, as at present advised, hold that the acts of a man who was known to be a volunteer canvasser without any authority from the candidate or any of his agents, bound the principal. You must show me various things. You must show me that he was in company with one of the principal agents, who saw him canvassing or was present when he was canvassing; or that, in the committee room, he was in the presence of some body or other acting as a man would act who was authorized to act. If putting all these things together, you satisfied me that the man was a canvasser with the authority of the candidate's agents, then I do not look with nicety at the precise steps, but there must be something of that character.\nWhere a sitting member is not acquainted with the illegality of the act for which he subsequently repays the person who originally made the payment, that is not sufficient to make such a person an agent by adoption. Bewdly ([115]).\nIf therefore the Respondent subsequently was informed of Robert having canvassed a voter and thanked him for obtaining a voter, he would not in regard thereof be answerable for Robert's illegal act, unless made acquainted therewith but there is no evidence even of any such adoption There is no evidence whatever that the Respondent knew he was canvassing or had canvassed. A member of a self constituted committee is not an agent ([116]).\nRogers on Elections ([117]) says:\nThe rules which apply to a committee being agents obviously apply with less force to clubs or associations which not unfrequented constitute themselves committees for the purpose of promoting an election, but the members of which are not thereby constituted agents, though the sitting member may contribute to their funds unless they are in fact his committee, and have undertaken the practical conduct of the election. For similar reasons a mere volunteer is not an agent.\nIn the Windsor case ([118]), Mr. Justice Willes says:\nI have stated that authority to canvass, and I purposely used the word authority and not employment, because I meant the observation to apply to persons authorized to canvass, whether paid or not for their services, would in my opinion constitute an agent.\nAfter quoting this Mr. Justice O'Brien in the Londonderry case ([119]), adds:\nI cannot concur in the opinion that any supporter of a candidate who chooses to ask others for their votes and to make speeches in his favor can force himself upon the candidate as an agent, or that a candidate should be held responsible for the acts of one from whom he actually endeavors to dissociate himself.\nIn the Hastings case ([120]) Mr. Justice Blackburn says:\nBut I cannot but feel where the case is a small isolated, solitary case it requires much more evidence to satisfy one of the agency than would otherwise be necessary. If a small thing is done by a person who is the head agent * * I think that would have upset the election. And if small things were done to a great extent by a subordinate person comparatively slight evidence of agency would probably have induced one to find that he was an agent. But when you come to a single case of one man telling another, whom he was inducing to go to the polls, that he would be paid afterwards for what he might spend in drink, to make that single case upset the election would require considerable evidence of agency.\nI take, then, this single case of Robert's and applying the principles of evidence just quoted, let us see what there is to make the Respondent answerable for his acts.\nThe Respondent says in his sworn declaration, received in evidence (and in regard to the reception of which I agree with the learned Chief Justice), that he only appointed one agent, Mr. Adam; that the committee in Montreal was formed without his knowledge, and therefore, necessarily, without his concurrence. That during the election he never was present at any committee meeting or entered the committee room and that whoever was employed besides Mr. Adam and Mr. Lemay was employed without his knowledge. It may, however, be alleged, that although the Respondent did not attend a meeting of the committee or visit the committee room, he was aware nevertheless of all they did and may have accepted their services. Such, indeed may have been the case, but the Petitioners cannot ask us so to conclude without any proof whatever. The onus was on them. They might, if such were the case, have proved it by the Respondent himself, or by some of the committee. Mere non-interference is not sufficient, and so held. I am not aware of any law requiring a candidate to have a committee or committees; and a party, if he so please, can be quite clear of the assistance of and responsibilities for such; and no number of friends forming themselves into a committee without his knowledge, can bind him in any way. If, however, a candidate is shown to be aware that any member of a committee so formed is, as such, performing acts of canvassing or otherwise, in such a way as an agent duly authorized would be alone supposed to do, and he, with full knowledge, ratifies such acts, it might possibly be sufficient to bind him not only as to that one member, but as to the rest of the committee so far as he was aware that such persons composed it. There is some evidence that the Respondent received funds through the treasurer of the committee for the election expenses S but I can find no evidence that he \"was aware for \"what particular purpose, if any, the committee was formed, or the extent of aid they intended giving. There is no satisfactory evidence of any authority from the Respondent to any committee to canvass for him, or act for him in the election. He certainly may have known that gentlemen were acting in concert in his favor, but in what way is not stated; but I have already shown that mere negative authority is not binding. There is no evidence to contradict the Respondent's statements on that point, and I don't feel at liberty to question them. Were there good reason for the conclusion that any organized system existed to commit corrupt acts, successful or otherwise, through the means of partizans of the Respondent, banded together as a committee, and that it was understood the Respondent was to be kept in ignorance, so that he would be safe from the consequences of illegal acts; or there appeared to have existed a general intention to secure the return of the Respondent by illegal means, and it was satisfactorily shown that he knew of the existence of the committee and had good reasons to believe in the existence of the combination for illegal purposes, it might, in such a case, require grave consideration before concluding that the ignorance in which the Respondent was ostensibly kept was not solely to avoid the consequences of the illegal acts of his friends. There is, however, nothing to shew anything of the kind on the part of any committee referred to in the evidence and I cannot therefore, draw any such conclusion. It is not improbable that the candidate was pleased to have the benefit arising from a combination of his friends but unless there be proof of authority beforehand to act for him or ratification, with full knowledge afterwards I can discover no law to bind, the candidate. There is no clear evidence as to how, or by whose means, the committee spoken of were appointed or formed. So far as the evidence goes, they were volunteers, and I can find no trace of any legal connexion between them and the Respondent. We are not told what their functions were, or to what extent, or in what particular way they were to aid the Respondent; and we cannot, therefore, ascertain how any apparent ratification of the acts of one or more of those composing a committee would be sufficient. The functions of the committee might have been limited, so as not to include or justify something done by one of its members. There is no allegation or suggestion of illegal conduct on the part of the Montreal committee themselves and I can find no evidence to make them the agents of the Respondent and none to connect them or any of them, directly or indirectly, with the acts of Robert. It is true we might imagine or surmise a great many things; we might draw conclusions, but we might be far from the facts if we did so. I submit, we are not called upon to do so unless the result of evidence; we are to look for reasonable proof of all facts necessary to the chain of evidence to establish the necessary allegations and connections. In the late Charlevoix case I had little, if any, doubt of the complication of the Respondent in the illegal acts upon proof of which he was deprived of his seat but in the absence of proof of the tact, I could not certify that they were known to or sanctioned by him. I feel bound to apply the same rule in this case.\nI have summarized the evidence bearing, as I think upon the question of the agency of Robert, and I start with the assertion that in the whole of it there is not a scintilla to establish the position that the Respondent, at the time of the election knew that Robert had canvassed or was about to canvass or do any other particular service towards his election. If he (the Respondent) did not ask him to act and knew not of his acting in any particular way, the mere general impression that he would aid him in some undefined way is surely not sufficient. If a candidate is to be held answerable and not only him but the majority who returned him, because he simply knew, in a general and undefined way, that hundreds were active partizans of his and who without his authority or knowledge committed illegal acts, merely because he did not, as soon as he knew they were such active partizans, forbid their interference in any way I cannot see how an election could be safely run. To decide so would be unprecedented so far as I have been able to discover.\nLeopold Laflamme says, in substance: \" I am a brother of the Respondent in this case. Mr. Placide Robert comes often to our office He took part in the last contest in the interest of my brother. My brother could not help knowing it. I am certain he was a devoted partizan of my brother.\" I would ask what is meant by \" he took part in the contest.\" It would be straining evidence to say that it was such a part as must necessarily make him an agent; and it would be still more absurd to call Robert an agent, merely because, in the opinion of Respondent's brother, he was not an active but a devoted partizan of the Respondent. I may be a most devoted partizan, but it does not necessarily follow that I am an active one or did anything. This evidence, I take it, by itself, proves nothing; and it will be seen that if considered, even with all the other evidence, it is unassisting.\nPlacide Robert says, substantially:\nI was one of Mr. Laflamme's supporters. I took pretty much interest in the last election. I spoke in many instances to voters about their votes. I did not go to the voters' houses to know their opinion. I saw Mr. Laflamme during the election and I spoke and shook hands with him. There might have been a few words said about the election at Chvrlebois' tavern when Mr. Laflamme was there but I don't recollect what was said. I never reported to Mr. Laflamme during the election as to his chances at Lachine. I made a report to Mr. Gariepy, to Mr. Cardinal, and I believe, to Mr. Prevost. I attended three or four meetings of the election committee. My name was put on the committee as one of the members and I attended now and then. It was a private committee but it was attended by conservatives as well as liberals, the door was open to all. At this committee we used to check the lists of voters; I helped to do so. I was at the organization of it and was a member from that time. There was, I think, no President or Secretary. I cannot say the lists we prepared were intended for canvassers, but they were for men who called on the electors and solicited their votes. The committee met at the house of Mr. Jean Baptiste Poirier, and I can't say whether or not anything was paid for the room. I had at my service a printed list of the electors and I checked the same at the committee room. The list was for the town and parish of Lachine.\nOn his cross-examination he says: (in answer to the question \" were you requested to act as you did or did you act from your own accord?\")\nI have acted from my own free will. I think I was not considered as an election agent. I was never asked by any election agent to use any influence. I saw no political opponent at the committee room. Those I saw there were persons who could be trusted. I drove a vehicle on the polling day and brought in some voters for the party.\nThere may be some other portions of the evidence that have some reference to this question of agency; but it is too remote to have the slightest legal affect in regard to it.\nThe meeting of a number of respondent's friends to check the lists (and that is all it is shown was done) at what the witness (Robert) calls the committee meetings, and the having in his possession one of those lists, surely would not make him an agent. The authorities I have quoted show this. There is no evidence how this committee was appointed, who were present, or what its functions were. The Respondent was not shown to have authorized or ratified its appointment, and even had such, proof been given, it is not shown how far they were authorized to go, and no evidence was given to show a connection in action with the committee in Montreal. He {Robert) says he spoke in many instances to voters about their votes. Asking voters about their votes is not evidence of canvassing for either party; and if he really did canvass, in the legal sense of the term he should not have been allowed to escape saying so. I certainly cannot say that s speaking to voters ABOUT THEIR VOTES \" necessarily means canvassing. It is not shown that the Respondent knew he (Robert) was even speaking to voters about their votes, and I have yet to learn that the knowledge, by the Respondent, that he was merely speaking to voters ABOUT THEIR VOTES, would in the slightest degree have affected the question. Robert says he made reports to Gariepy and to Cardinal, and he believed to Prevost. I see no proof to establish the agency of any of the three, and I have yet to learn that a person who is not shown to have been appointed by anyone, can make himself an agent of the candidate by merely reporting the prospects at a particular locality. Robert says substantially that he acted without authority from any one; for, when the question is put to him in the alternative he replies: \"I have acted from my own free will. I think I was not considered as an election agent \"\u2014(and if he had no more authority than we have seen he had good reason to think so) \u2014\" and I was never asked by any agent to use my influence.\"\nThe presumptions of law are always in favor of innocence; and he who asserts the contrary necessarily assumes the onus of proving his allegations. It may be done by direct or circumstantial evidence; but, if by the latter, it should be so full and complete as to exclude any reasonable theory of innocence. Such \"evidence should leave no gaps to be filled either by doubtful deductions from other portions of the evidence or the still more dangerous expedient of drawing wholly upon imagination or speculation, which would require a judge or jury to violate the invariable rule of evidence I have mentioned. I can find no precedent for declining to apply this principle of evidence to election cases; and if the petitioner fail to give sufficient evidence, I am not justified in saying he has done so. We might, possibly, be correct in assuming the circumstances to be as the petitioner alleges, but I can find no justification for doing so. If his evidence is insufficient our obvious duty is simply to say so. He has given us no evidence of facts incompatible with the absence of the slightest legal connection of the Respondent with Robert.\nWith therefore as I think such insufficient evidence to raise necessarily even a presumption of the agency of Robert and in the face of the positive statements last quoted from his evidence, coupled with the uncontradicted statement of the Respondent that all who acted in his behalf in the election, with the exceptions named by him, had no authority from him, I feel bound, after the best application of my mind to the subject, and to the prevailing rules of law, to say that the allegation of the agency of Robert has not been established, and that upon the whole case the appeal should be dismissed, and the Respondent declared duly elected.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for Appellants : \u2014D.

The latter pleaded by preliminary objections that this election petition, notice of its presentation and copy of the receipt of the deposit had never been served upon him. Judgment was given maintaining the preliminary objections and dismissing the petition with costs. The petitioners, thereupon, appealed to the Supreme Court under 38 Vic., cap. 11, sec. 48.\nHeld,\u2014That the said judgment was not appealable and that under that section an appeal will lie only from the decision of a Judge who has tried the merits of an election petition [Taschereau and Fournier, J. J. dissenting.]\nPer Strong, J., (Richards, C. J., concurring,) That the hearing of the preliminary objections and the trial of the merits of the election petition are distinct acts of procedure (1).\n(1) By The Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1879, sec. 10 it is provided that An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court \u201cfrom the judgment, rule, order or decision of any Court or Judge on any preliminary objection to an Election Petition, the allowed have been final and been final and conclusive, and which shall have put an end to the petition, or which would, if allowance of which shall have conclusive, and have put an end THE question to be decided in this appeal was whether a judgment maintaining preliminary objections and dismissing an election petition was appealable under the 48th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act.\nThe facts appear sufficiently in the head note and the judgments.\nMr. A. F. McIntyre, for Appellant: \u2014\nThe petition has been virtually tried, for the judgment of the Court amounts to a final judgment against the petitioners. We must read section 25 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act in connection with section 48. If this Court has not jurisdiction in such a case as this, then it is in the power of any Judge to oust the appellate jurisdiction of this Court in every controverted election case. The policy of the law has not been to diminish the right of appeal but to extend it. The judgment in this case is final and therefore appealable. See Freeman on judgments ([1]); Powell on the law of appellate proceedings ([2]).\nMr. H. C. Pelletier for Respondent :\u2014\nThe judgment is final and without appeal.\nThe 8th section of the Statute 38 Vic, chap. 11, (the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act) says positively: Any party to an election petition under the said Act, who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge who has tried such petition, &c., may appeal from said judgment. In the present case, we have not to consider\nto the petition: Provided always, that an appeal in the last- mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings or to delay the trial of the petition, unless the Court or a Judge of the Court appealed from, shall so order: and provided also that no appeals shall be allowed under this section in cases in litigation and now pending. Except cases when the appeal has been allowed and duly filed. a decision given at the time of the trial of an election petition, but a judgment given on preliminary objections\nIf an appeal is allowed from every decision of a judge, it would be impossible to proceed with a petition. \u201cTrial\u201d means the examination of witnesses &c. See Hardcastle, Laws and Practice of Election Petitions ([3]) and Wolferstan Law of Election Petitions ([4]).\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThis was an appeal from a judgment rendered by His Honor Mr. Justice Routhier, of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec for the District of Saguenay, in the matter of a petition filed by the Appellants, under the Controverted Elections Act 18*74: against the return of the Respondent as member of the House of Commons for the Electoral District of Charlevoix, The return of the writ of election to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery in which the Respondent was declared to be duly elected a member of the House of Commons was published in the Canada Gazette on the 7th April; 1877. The Appellants .filed their petition against the return on the 21st April, 1877. A copy of the petition is alleged to have been served on the Respondent on the 27th April. On the 28th April, 1877, an application was made on behalf of the Respondent to Mr. Justice Routhier to extend the time for filing preliminary objections to the petition until the 22nd May following, which application was allowed. On the 22nd May the Respondent filed his preliminary objections against the further maintenance of the Appellant's petition. The objections material to be noticed here (being those which the learned judge sustained) are the first and fourth.\nThe first objection is \u201cThat no certified copy of the \"said petition has been served on the Respondent;\u201d and the fourth, \u201cThat no notice of the presentation of the\u201d petition and of the security was served on the Respondent.\"\nThe Appellants inscribed these objections for proof and hearing for the 12th July last when counsel for both parties appeared before Mr. Justice Routhier and no evidence being entered into by either side, the objections were argued and taken en delib\u00e9re.\nOn the 24th of July the learned Judge gave judgment, holding the first and fourth objections to be well founded, and dismissing the Appellant's petition with costs. The appeal to this Court is from that judgment. The grounds of the appeal are, that the judgment is wrong and cannot be maintained. First, Because there was no proof of any kind establishing the objections. Secondly, Because the burthen of proving the objections was upon the Respondent.\nThe first objection in answer to this appeal, set up by the Respondent in his factum and in argument at the Bar, was, that the decision of the Court below was final, as having been pronounced by a Court of last resort, and that this Court has no jurisdiction.\nThe procedure for the trial of Controverted Elections under the Act of 1874 (37 Vic, Cap. 16) may, so far as it is material here, be succinctly stated as follows :\u2014\nThe petition must, subject to some exceptions not applicable here, be presented not later than thirty days after the day of publication in the Gazette of the receipt of the return to the Writ of Election by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.\nThe presentation is to be made by delivery to the Clerk of the Court. At the time of the presentation a deposit of $1,000 is to be made for which the Clerk is to give a receipt, which shall be evidence of the deposit. Within five days after presenting the petition and making the deposit, or within such other time as the Court or a Judge may allow, a notice of the presentation of the petition and of the security, together with a copy of the petition, is to be served on the Respondent. Within a like delay, after service of the petition, the Respondent is to present any preliminary objections which he may have against the petition, or the petitioner, or against any further proceedings. The Court or any Judge thereof is to hear these objections, and is to decide them in a summary manner. After the expiration of five days from the decision of the preliminary objections, or from the expiration of the time for presenting them, if none be presented, the petition is to be deemed to be at issue and the Court is to fix a time and place of trial. So far, all the proceedings are to take place in or before the Court in which the petition has been presented, or before one of the Judges of that Court. By section 13 the petition is to be tried by one of the Judges of the Court without a jury. The trial is to take place unless otherwise ordered by the Court in the electoral district the election or return for which is in question At the conclusion of the trial the Judge must determine whether the member whose election or return is complained of, or any and what other person, was duly returned or elected or whether the election was void, and other matters arising out of the petition, and requiring his determination; and shall, except only in the case of an appeal, immediately after the expiration of eight days from the day on which he shall have given his decision, certify in writing such determination to the Speaker, appending thereto a copy of the notes of the evidence; and the determination so certified Is to be final to all intents and purposes. If any charge is made in the petition of any corrupt practice having been committed at the election, the Judge is, in addition to such certificate and at the same time to report in writing to the Speaker: (a) Whether any corrupt d practice has or has not been found to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate at the election, stating the name of the candidate and the nature of the corrupt practice. (b) The names of any persons who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any corrupt practice. (c) Whether corrupt practices have, or whether there is reason to believe they have, extensively prevailed at the election. The Judge may, at the same time, make a special report to the Speaker as to any matters arising in the course of the trial, an account of which, in his judgment, ought to be submitted to the House of Commons.\nSection 54 of the Act contains a provision recognizing a distinction very pertinent to the question raised here; it relates to the withdrawal of a petition and enacts \u201dThat a petition shall not be withdrawn without the leave of the Court or Judge according as the petition is then before the Court or before the Judge for trial, upon special application,\u201d to be made as prescribed by general rules.\nThis clause recognizes and carries out very clearly a distinction which runs through the whole Act as to the separation of the powers and jurisdiction of the Court and those of the Judge at the trial.\nAfter the petition is set down for trial the functions of the Court are at an end for no provision similar to that embodied in section 23 of the Controverted Elections Act of 1873, authorizing the Judge who tries a petition to reserve a case for the opinion of the Court is contained in the Act of 1874. There is therefore a well defined line of demarcation between the two jurisdictions, that of the Court and that of the Judge who tries the petition. It appears, then, that a Judge who is called upon to decide a \u201cpreliminary objection\u201d presented under section 10, exercises the jurisdiction of the Court in which the petition is filed.\nThis jurisdiction is not restricted as to locality, but the objections may be heard and determined at any place within the jurisdiction of the Court, whilst the trial of the petition in the absence of an order of the Court, founded on some special circumstances, must be had within the Electoral District. Again, whatever may be the proper construction of the words \u201cpreliminary objections,\u201d whether they are to be taken as applying to every irregularity or failure to comply with the procedure laid down by the Act of Parliament and the rules of Court, as well as to objections which might be taken to the qualification of the petitioner, or to the latter class of objections only, it is plain, that their determination does not comprise any such decision as the Judge at the trial is bound to come to. In deciding preliminary objections, the Judge cannot determine whether the member whose election or return is complained of, or any other person, was duly returned or elected, or whether the election was void. He can have no evidence before him to enable him to enter into the merits of the petition, and, consequently, he cannot make the report to the Speaker required by the 30th section of the Act of 1874.\nIn determining preliminary objections, although the Judge may have to hear evidence he is in no sense\u201d trying the petition.\u201dThe 10th section, and the whole context of the Act, indicates that the two proceedings of hearing preliminary objections and the trial of the petition are separate and distinct, to be taken before different tribunals, at different times, and possibly at different places. The determination of the preliminary objections has for its object adjudication upon such exceptions as the Respondent to a petition may take to the status of the Petitioner and to his compliance with the statutory prerequisites to being permitted to proceed to trial.\nIf the decision of the Judge on the objections is against the Respondent, his functions are terminated; he cannot proceed to enquire into or try the merits of the petition. On the other hand, the decision which section 29 of the Act of 1874, makes it incumbent on the Judge at the trial to pronounce is one, on the grounds of law and fact, upon which the validity of the election is impugned, and upon those grounds also on which by way of recrimination the Respondent may seek to in validate any claim to the seat made by the Petitioner on his own behalf, or on that of some other person. Manifestly, this is a very different process from that to be gone through with by the Court or a Judge dealing with preliminary objections only. In short, the word \u201dpreliminary\u201d imports that these objections are to be precedent to some proceeding in which the merits of the election and of the petition are to be enquired into, and the Statute authorizes no other proceeding for that purpose than the trial of the petition. The words \u201cpreliminary objections\u201d are, therefore, to be construed as an elliptical expression for objections preliminary to the trial.\nThe convenience of such a division of the enquiry under the petition is very obvious. It is calculated to save large expenditure in summoning and paying witnesses, generally very numerous, to testify for and against the merits of the petition which would be useless and wasteful, if the preliminary objections were reserved until the trial and should then appear to be well founded. It relieves the Judge from the inconvenience and loss of time which might be occasioned in going to the Electoral District to hear mere technical points of law argued, and it tends to disembarrass the trial on the merits, when it comes on, from collateral issues, and to save time which, might otherwise be consumed in long arguments as to the qualification of the Petitioner or the regularity of his proceedings, whilst the witnesses on the merits were uselessly kept in attendance.\nThis practice of disjoining the hearing of preliminary objections from the trial, which does not correspond with any similar proceeding provided for by the English Act, was probably suggested by the course of proceeding formerly adopted by the Election Committees, who, though bound by no prescribed rules, but being free to regulate their procedure in each case according to convenience were accustomed to hear and determine in limine, objections taken to the qualification of the Petitioner, and others of the same class, before proceeding to investigate the merits of the petition. These considerations appear sufficient to demonstrate that the Controverted Elections Act of 1874 deals with the hearing on preliminary objections and the trial of the petition as two distinct acts of procedure, having for their objects different results, and which it was the policy of the Act to keep separate. Parliament has, indeed, in so many words recognized the separation between the jurisdiction of the Court before trial and that of the Judge after the petition is set down for trial, when, in the 54th section it requires the withdrawal of the petition to be with the leave of the Court or Judge,\nAccording as the petition is then before the Court or before the Judge for trial\nThen, the Respondent's proposition is, that the appeal to this Court is limited to one from the decision of the Judge who tries the petition, and does not include an appeal from the determination of the Court or Judge on the hearing of preliminary objections.\nSection 48 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act is the enactment which confers the jurisdiction on this Court, and it repeals sections 33, 34 and 35 of the Act of 1874, which had provided for appeals in the Province of Quebec to the Superior Court sitting in Review, and in the other Provinces to the Court in which the petition was presented sitting in banc. These repealed clauses in themselves shew that they were meant to confer the right of appeal from the Judge at the trial only. Section 33, which has reference to appeals in Quebec cases, requires the Court of Review to determine and certify its determination and decision to the Speaker upon the several points and matters, as well of fact as of law, upon which the Judge might otherwise have determined or certified his decision, in the same manner as the Judge would otherwise have done at the trial and declares that the determination of the Court thus certified shall be final to all intent and purposes\nSection 35 which relates to appeals from the Provinces other than Quebec, is to the same effect, and contains even stronger indications that the appeal was intended to apply only to the substance and merits of the petition.\nThese sections, however, are repealed by section 48 of the Supreme Court Act, which contains express words not found in the repealed clauses of 37 Victoria, Cap.10, limiting the appeal to one from the Judge at the trial. After enacting a repeal of the sections just mentioned, to take effect so soon as the Supreme Court should be organized, and in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, it proceeds as follows :\u2014\nAnd thereafter any party to an election petition under the said Act, who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge who has tried such petition on any question of law or fact, and desires to appeal against the same,\nmay do so by adopting the mode of procedure which had been provided for by the repealed section 35 of the Act of 1874, and it requires the Registrar to certify the decision of this Court to the Speaker in the same manner as the Judge at the trial is required to do by the pro visions of the former Act already referred to, and it lastly declares that the judgment and decision of the Supreme Court shall be final to all intents and purposes.\nApplying this section to the case in hand, it cannot possibly be said, having regard to what appears to be the proper construction of the Act of 1874, as already stated that Mr. Justice Routhier, when he heard these preliminary objections, \u201dtried the petition,\u201d nor would it be possible for the Court if it came to the conclusion that the preliminary objections ought to have been over ruled instead of allowed, to pronounce a decision which would have been final on the merits of the petition, nor could this Court in any aspect pronounce a judgment upon this appeal which would warrant such a certificate as in every case of appeal this Court is imperatively bound to send to the Speaker of the House of Commons. Therefore the inevitable result of the construction I have placed upon the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, in treating the hearing of the preliminary objections and the trial as distinct acts of procedure, requires me to hold that the decision complained of is not a proper subject of appeal.\nThe language of the 48th section of the Supreme Court Act, already quoted, seems so explicit that it scarcely requires the aid of any extrinsic argument to support the construction I uphold, but it may well be thought that an enactment which would have made every decision upon preliminary objections or upon interlocuoory or incidental motions or applications in litigated election proceedings appealable, would have been most undesirable, since it might have been used vexatiously and oppressively, both as regards delay and expense. If from every incidental decision in the, proceedings in a controverted election, the parties were to be at liberty to resort to this Court by way of appeal to be remitted back upon the determination of the appeal against the objection to the primary Court, there to resume the contestation of the merits, the litigation would be prolonged to the prejudice not merely of the parties to the petition but to the detriment also of the constituency whose representation was in dispute. It cannot be presumed, that the Legislature intended to authorize such appeals, for it may be truly said that there is no class of litigation in which judicial dispatch is more desirable than that arising out of controverted elections. The interests of all concerned, those of the parties, the Courts and the public alike, require reasonable promptitude of decision in such cases. There may, no doubt, be exceptional cases in which the rights of parties to petitions may be seriously affected by erroneous decisions on preliminary points and motions, but the balance of convenience greatly preponderates in favor of confining appeals to the merits. Were this Court to concede the right to take an appeal in the present case, an equal process of reasoning in construing the Act would require it to admit an appeal from the most insignificant motion which could be made. There is, therefore, every argument to be drawn from convenience in favor of restricting the appeal, as the Legislature has done to one upon the merits of the petition, the decision of which must be conclusive.\nBut supposing I am wrong in this opinion as to the policy of the law, and even though in particular instances the interpretation of the Statute restricting appeals to the merits of the petition might seem to leave parties without relief against erroneous decisions, such consequences would afford no ground for wresting the plain words of the 48th section of the Supreme Court Act from their obvious primary meaning and extending them so as to include such cases as the present. Where the language of a Statute is doubtful, arguments drawn from unjust and inconvenient results may be of force but where there is no ambiguity of language they cannot affect judicial construction, whatever weight they may have as reasons for Legislative amendment.\nA majority of the Court agreeing on the question of jurisdiction, there is no necessity for discussing the second point argued on this appeal; that involving the correctness of the judgment which is called in question.\nIn my opinion, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, which should, therefore, pursuant to section 37 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, be quashed, with costs to be paid to the Respondent.\nThe Chief Justice concurred with Strong, J.\nTASCHEREAU, J :\u2014\nJe dois donner un court aper\u00e7u des faits de la cause en ce qui concerne le pr\u00e9sent appel.\n1o. Le 21 avril 1877.

Le 9 mai 1877. Les p\u00e9titionnaires, pr\u00e9sents appe lants, produisent an greffe du bureau du protonotaire du district de Saguenay in avis informant l'Intim\u00e9 que le douze de ce m\u00e9me mois de mai 18777 ils demanderont i an Juge du district de fixer un jour pour 1 instruction de la petition.\n3o. Le 12 mai 1877. L'Intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente une requ\u00e9te pour extension de d\u00e9lai pour produire ses objections pr\u00e9liminaires, et ce d\u00e9lai lui est accord\u00e9 jusqu'au 22 mai, et le 21 mai 1'Intime produit ses objections pr\u00e9liminaires, et le 12 juillet la cause est inscrite au r6le pour preuve et audition sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires. La cause est mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 devant M. le juge Routhier qui, le 21 juillet, renvoie la petition sur le principe qu'aucune copie certifi\u00e9e de la petition, non plus qu'aucun avis de la presentation de cette petition et du cautionnement n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 signifies au d\u00e9fendeur.\nMaintenant la premiere question qui est soulev\u00e9e en cette cause par 1'Intim\u00e9, l'honorable M. Langevin, est celle de savoir si la decision du Juge sous les circons tances que je viens d'exposer, est on n'est pas susceptible d'appel, en un mot, si une decision sur les objec tions pr\u00e9liminaires est susceptible d'appel. L'Intim\u00e9 le pretend, et il a en sa faveur 1'opinion de mes deux honorables confreres qui viennent d'exposer leur vues \u00e0 ce sujet. L'Intim\u00e9 se fonee sur la section 48 de la 88e Vic., ch. 11, (Acte constitutif de la Cour Supreme) pour y trouver une distinction entre le droit d'appel d'une decision sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires et le droit d'appel de la decision du m\u00e9rite de la petition m\u0152me. Je ne trouve rien dans cette section pour justifier cette distinction. La section est en ces termes :\nSec. 48. When the Supreme Court is organized, and in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the thirty-third, thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth sections of the Act passed in the thirty-seventh year of Her Majesty's reign, and intituled An Act to make better provision for the trial of controverted elections of members of the House of Commons, and respecting matters connected therewith,\u201d shall be repealed, except as hereinafter provided with respect to proceedings then pending, and thereafter any party to an election petition under the said .Act, who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge who has tried such petition, on any question of law or fact, and desires to appeal against the same, may within eight days from the day on which the Judge has given his decision, deposit with the clerk, or other proper officer of the Court (of which the Judge is a member) for receiving moneys paid into such Court at the place where the petition was tried, if in the Province of Quebec, and at the chief office of the Court in any other Province the sum of one hundred dollars as security for costs and a further sum of ten dollars as a fee for making up and transmitting the record: and thereupon the clerk or other proper officer of the Court shall make up and transmit the record in the case to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, who shall set down the matter of the said petition for hearing by the said Court, &c., &c., &c.\nJe ne trouve rien en cette section pour justifier la pr\u00e9tention de 1'Intim\u00e9. Au contraire j'y vois qu'il y a appel de toute question de droit o\u00f9 de fait. Or, en la pr\u00e9sente cause le Juge qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 charge, a adjug\u00e9 sur les questions de droit et de fait, lo. de droit, en d\u00e9ci dant que les appelants devaient commencer l'enqu\u00eate et faire Ia preuve, 2o. de fait, en d\u00e9cidant qu'ils avaient failli de prouver leurs objections pr\u00e9liminaires.\nUne contestation d'1\u00e9lection est soumise au m\u00eame Juge qui peut ab initio la conduire jusqu'\u00e0 jugement final; il est oblige de decider \u00e9galement les objectionspr\u00e9liminarres aussi bien que le m\u00e9rite m\u00eame, et il y a dans l'un et l'autre de ces cas une importance et une responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9gales, et de la decision de ces objections pr\u00e9liminaires, comme de celle du m\u00e9rite de la petition, depend le sort de cette petition; les int\u00e9r\u00e9ts d'une division \u00e9lectorale peuvent en \u00eatre \u00e9galement et fatalement affect\u00e9s.\nJe ne vois aucun motif legal ni rationel pour justifier une telle distinction du droit d'appel sur des quesions \u00e9galement import antes quant au r\u00e9sultat. Au contraire, je trouve un argument s\u00e9rieux dans le danger de laisser \u00e0 un seul homme le pouvoir d'adiuger en dernier ressort sur des objections pr\u00e9liminaires. Je ne puis me reconcilier \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e que la legislature au moyen de cette section 48, et de l'emmploi des mots: J Judge who tried the petition,\u201dait voulu dire que le Juge charg\u00e9 d'adjuger sur une contestation d'\u00e9lection et qui la renvoie in foto sur des objectionspr\u00e9liminarres n'y a pas compl\u00e9tement mis fin et n'a pas jug\u00e9 la petition d'une mani\u00e9re substantielle,\u201ddid not try the election\u201dil l'a tellement jug\u00e9e cette contestation d'\u00e9lection qu'il l'a renvoy\u00e9e a toutes fins que de droit, et sans laisser aux p\u00e9titionnaires l'espoir de renouveler cette contestation.\nSous un autre aspect, on peut dire que la prise en consid\u00e9ration d'une contestation d'6lection par un juge commence avec la lecture et l'\u00e9tude de la petition des moyens de d\u00e9fense, et se termine avec la preuve si on n'y met fin auparavant par le renvoi sur objections pr\u00e9iminaires. Tout cela forme le trial savoir: la preuve et l'adjudication sur tous les points en litige, et c'est la Ia seule interpretation plausible \u00e0 donner \u00e0 cette section 48.\nQuant a cette premiere question relative au droit d'appel, je consid\u00e9re que les pr\u00e9tentions de l'Intim\u00e9 sont non fond\u00e9es.\nMais il y a dans les autres objections que l'lntim\u00e9 \u00e9nonce en son factum, quelque chose que je consid\u00e9re comme tr\u00e9s s\u00e9rieux.\nLes appelants pr\u00e9tendent que l'lntim\u00e9 comme excipant, devait commencer sa preuve sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires, et l'Intim\u00e9 soutient le contraire et je considere que l'Intim\u00e9 a raison sur ce point. Il est le defendeur, il se tient donc sur la defensive ; li dit a ses adversaires, vous m'accusez, montrez a la Cour que vous m'avez assign\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux requisitions du statut, et que vous m'avez signifi\u00e9 un certificat legal du cautionnement et un avis du jour de la presentation de la petition. Les appelants o\u00f9 n'ont pu o\u00f9 n'ont pas voulu faire cette preuve et Son Honneur le juge Routhier, devant qui elle devait se faire, a renvoy\u00e9 la petition, faute par les Appelants d'avoir \u00e9tabli ce qui \u00e9tait la base la fondation de la petition, savoir, que les p\u00e9titionnarres avaient signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 I'lntim\u00e9 une copie certifi\u00e9e de la petition, un avis de sa presentation, et du cautionnement fourni tel que Ia loi l'exifire.\nMais comme je l'ai dit, les Appelants pr\u00e9tendent que c'\u00e9tait a l'lntim\u00e9 a prouver ces negatives, v\u00e6 qu'il \u00e9tait l'excipant. Je concois qu'il peut y avoir des cas o\u00f9 l\u2019excipant puisse \u00e9tre tenu de prouver un plaidoyer affirmatif qui attaquerait une pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale. Dans le cas present la loi ne presume pas que les Appelants se soient conform\u00e9s aux requisitions du statut en ce qui concerne la signification des documents exig\u00e9s comme assignation de l'lntim\u00e9. O'\u00e9tait donc aux Appelants a commencer cette preuve et non a Tintime qui n'avait qu'\u00e0 attendee les bras crois\u00e9s la preuve de ces significations, II lui faudrait prouver une n\u00e9gative, ce qui dans la plupart des cas est impossible, cette preuve incombait aux Appelants comme ayant on devant avoir en mains les documents n\u00e9cessaires pour l'\u00e9tablir, d'apr\u00e9s la section 40 du statut des elections de l'ann\u00e9e 1874 qui \u00e9nonce que le service de la petition et des avis de sa presentation, et d'une copie du recu du d\u00e9p\u00f4t on du cautionnement doivent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s autant que possible en la m\u0152me mani\u00e9re qu'un bref de sommation en mati\u00e9re civile on en toute autre mani\u00e9re qu'il pourrait \u00e9tre prescrit. Or, a d\u00e9faut de toute autre injonction a cet \u00e9gard, le Code de Procedure Civile de la province de Quebec doit r\u00e9gler, et de fait r\u00e9gle ce mode de signification par les articles 56, 57, 77, 78, 80. Ces articles exigent que les significations de sommations soient efiectu\u00e9s par un huissier on par une personne quelconque qui en donnera un certificat sous forme d'affidavit. Les Appelants pr\u00e9tendent que l'Intim\u00e9 a admis avoir recu une. copie de la petition, mais iln'admet pas qu'il ait recu avis de sa presentation, ni d'une copie du cautionnement on du recu du d\u00e9pot pour en tenir lieu. Si cet aveu de l'Intim\u00e9 quant a la reception d'une copie de la petition pent \u00e9tre interpret\u00e9 contre lui (ce que je ne crois pas), toujours estil vraique son objection quant \u00e0 l'absence d'un certificat de signification de l'avis de sa presentation et de la copie du cautionnement subsiste en son entier et doit \u00eatre fatale aux Appelants. Le dossier en cette cause ne d\u00e9montre nullement l'ac complissement d'aucune de ces formalit\u00e9s essentielles exig\u00e9es par le statut et sans lesquelles la petition ne peut exister. Je le demande, comment \u00e9taitil possible au Juge qui a prononc\u00e9 le jugement de passer pardessus de telles irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s. Je crois de plus que M. le Juge Routhier ne pouvait exercer aucune discretion a cet \u00e9gard, et de son propre mouvement, sans y \u00eatre requis par les Appelants, accorder un d1ai ult\u00e9rieur aux Appelants pour rectifier leurs erreurs on omissions Les Appelants ne paraissent pas avoir aucunement essay\u00e9 ce moyen d'y rem\u00e9dier, et s 'en sont tenus a leurs pr\u00e9tentions que j'ai signal\u00e9es. Ilis ont eu grand tort; pour ces raisons, je suis d'opinion,\n1o. Qu'il y avait en faveur des Appelants un droit d'appel du jugement renvoyant les objections pr\u00e9liminaires.\n2o. Qu'au m\u00e9rite de l'appel, le jugement doit \u00e9tre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens contre les Appelants.\nFOURNIER, J.: \u2014\nLe present appel est de la decision rendue en cette cause, le 24 juillet dernier, maintenant des objections pr61iminarres produites par l'Intim\u00e9, et renvoyant la p\u00e9ti tion produtte par 1'Appelant contre son election.\nL'Intim\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 devant cette cour une question au sujet de la comp\u00e9tenee de celleci a entendre le present appel. C'est de cette question qu'il faut d'abord s'oc- J cuper, car de sa decision dans la negative depend le L sort de la cause.\nL'Acte des Elections Contest\u00e9es de 1878 sec. 14 admettait dans les m\u00e9mes termes que celui de 1874, sec. 10, les objectionspr\u00e9liminarres \u00e0 la petition. Ces objec tions sont d\u00e9finies d'une mani\u00e9re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans l'un et l'autre acte, comme \u00e9tant toutes les objections o\u00f9 raisons d'insuffisance que le d\u00e9fendeur pourra faire valoir contre le p\u00e9titionnaire, o\u00f9 la petition, o\u00f9 contre toute procedure ult\u00e9rieuee sur la petition, et la Cour o\u00f9 le Juge doit en d\u00e9cider sommairement. Mais la constitution de la Cour n'est pas la m\u0152me dans les deux actes.\nLe statut de 1873 \u00e9tablissatt une Cour d'\u00e91ection com pos\u00e9e de trois juges, dont chacun, individuellement, ainsi que tous les autres juges qui pouvaient y si\u00e9ger, exer^aient au sujet des petitions d'elections des pouvoirs diff\u00e9rents de ceux de la Cour.\nAinsi, un seul juge pouvait decider de la validit\u00e9 des objections faites au cautionnement et de tout ce qui s'y rapportait, et exercer les pouvoirs de la Cour d'\u00e9lection, excep\u00e9 lorsqu'il \u00e9tait declare que la Cour seule pouvait decider, on quant aux points de droit soulev\u00e9s par la petition, on dans un cas special (special case) o\u00f9 dans les questions r\u00e9serv\u00e9es par le Juge pour la decision de la Cour. Le Juge avait le pouvoir de r\u00e9server sans distinction tous les points de droit soulev\u00e9s dans les pro c\u00e9dures faites en vertu de l'acte.\nQuant aux objectionspr\u00e9liminarres qui devaient \u00e9tre d\u00e9cid\u00e9es sommairement, ii y avait juridiction concurrente entre le Juge et la Cour.\nL'Acte de 1874 a fait dispara\u00eetre ces differences de pouvoir entre un seul Juge et la Cour telle que compos\u00e9e auparavant. Aujourd'hui, la Cour ne consiste plus que d'un seul juge qui decide sur toutes les procedures qui peuvent avoir lieu au sujet d'une petition d'\u00e9lec tion, ainsi que sur toutes les questions defaits et de droit qui peuvent v \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es Il doit decider finalement, sans pouvorr les r\u00e9f\u00e9rer a la Cour; car la Cour c'est luiseu,l Ia distinction entre les pouvoirs de la Cour et du juge n'existant pIus.\nAu lieu du pouvoir qu'avait le Juge en vertu de l'acte de 1873, simplement de r\u00e9server la decision des ques tions de droit pour la Cour, compos\u00e9e de trois juges, la loi de 1874 avait substitu\u00e9 l'appel, pour la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 la Cour de R\u00e9vision. Toute partie a la petition pouvait dans les huit jours de la decision faire transmettre le dossier \u00e0 cette Cour. Les procedures devaient \u00eatre conduites comme dans une cause en revision et la Cour devait prononcer sa decision sur les mati\u00eares de fait et de droit sur lesquelles le juge aurait pu liii m\u0152me prononcer, et de la m\u0152me mani\u00eare qu'il aurait Pu le faire\nLes pouvoirs exerc\u00e9s a cette \u00e9poque par la Cour de Revision ont \u00e9te, en vertu de la 38me Vict., ch. 11, sec. 48, transf\u00e9r\u00e9s a, cette Cour qui dolt prononcer, tant sur les questions de droit que sur les questions defaits, le jugement qui aurait d\u00fb \u00e9tre rendu par le juge de lad\u00e9cision duquel appel est interjet\u00e9.\nLa principale objection que l'on fait au droit d'appel en cette cause provient de ce que dans cette sec. 48 l'on emploie, pour designer le jugement dont il y aura appel, les expressions suivantes:\u201dthe decision of the Judge who has tried such petition;\u201det aussi de ce que plus bas dans la m\u0152me section, le r\u00e9gistraire est requis\u201dto set down the matter of the said petiiion for hearing.\u201dOn pre tend que ces expressions ne peuvent s'entendre que du m\u00e9rite de la petition, et non pas d'une decision sur des objections preliminaires; que partant cette Cour n'a pas droit de prendee connaissance du present appel, bien que le iuffement dont on se plaint mette fin a la petition. C'est en donnant au mot trial une signification restreinte qu'il ne me semble pas avoir dans cet acte, qu'on arrive a cette consequence. Ce terme (trial) ne doit pas s'appliquer seulement a l'examen des faits concernant le m\u00e9rite de la petition, puisque d'apr\u00e9s la loi ii peut y avoir plusieurs trials dans la m\u0152me contestation, savoir: trial sur les objectionspr\u00e9liminarres, et trial stir le m\u00e9rite de la petition L'examen de la mati\u00e9re de fait en issue \u00e9tant un trial d'apr\u00e9s la definition technique ce terme devait donc s'appliquer a liinstrnction de la contestation soueov\u00e9e par les objections pr\u00e9liminaires aussi bien qu'\u00e0 l'examen du m\u00e9rite de la petition; laloi en se servant de cette expression indique l'un aussi bien ane l'autre, puisque, dans les deux cas, il y a lieu a I'examen (trial) des questions de faits.\nMais on dira, peut\u00eatre, que dans le cas actuel les objections pr\u00ealiminaires, n'\u00eatant fond\u00eaes que sur des moyens de forme attaquant la r\u00e9gularitC de la signification de la petition et des avis requis par la loi, elles ne font pas r\u00e9guli\u00e8rment la mati\u00e8re d'une telle procedure. Cependant d'apres la section 10, toute raison suffisante pour emp\u00eacher touts proc\u00e9duee ult\u00e9rieure sur la petition est indiqu\u00e9e comme pouvant faire le sujet d'objections pr\u00e9liminaires sur lesquelles il peut \u00eatre prononc\u00e9 un jugement qui met fin a la contestation. Or, il n'existe pas, je crois, d'autre mani\u00e9re de prendre avantage de ces irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s que par objections preliminaires.\nDe tout temps cette maniere de proc\u00e9der a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise, et de tout temps aussi, on a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les expressions try the merits of the petition, try the matter of the petition s'appiiquaient au jugement rendu sur ces objections comme au jugement d\u00e9cidant le m\u00e9rite de la petition.\nC'est par des objections pr\u00e9liminaires que dans la cause de Honiton, ([5]) le membre sl\u00e9geant prenait avantage, lo.: du fait que la petition produite n'\u00e9tait pas de bonne foi une petition renouvel\u00e9e, ainsi que la loi l'exi-d geait a cette \u00e9poque, Iorsque la proc\u00e9dure n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9e dans la session mais un duplicata de celle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sentee dans une session pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente; 2o: que les p\u00e9titionnarres s'\u00e9taient rendus coupables de corruption.\nLe Conseil du membre si\u00e9geant argumentait ainsi;\nBoth these points are preliminary conclusive objections to the trial of the cause; contending, that if established by evidenee, the Court ought not in justice to proceed upon it. That though the duty of the members, enjoined by oath, required a trial of the matter of the petition referred to them, yet this rule was necessarily subject to the fundamental rules of practice, by which the Court proceeded: because all trials were necessarily guided by such rules. For, if it could be supposed that the names to a petition were forged, or that the parties had no interest or right to petition, it would be proper to receive the evidence of the facts and if found true, to reject such petition. For in such cases there are no merits to try and the ends of justice would be obtained in this manner, although the terms of the oath would not be literally obeyed.\nLe comit\u00e9 adopta cette mani\u00e9re de voir et d\u00e9clara que le membre si\u00e9geant pouvait faire la preuve de la nullit\u00e9 de la petition, et prouver aussi l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans la signature et la pr\u00e9sentation de la seconde petition Le r\u00e9sultat final fut le renvoi de la petition pour les motifs invoqu\u00e9s dans les objections preliminaries. La cause de Bedford en 1728 \u00e9tait m\u00eame genre.\nCes decisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues en vertu de l'acte 10 Geo 3 ch. 16 commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 le GrTSfiville act lequel contient au sujet de la reference d'une petition d'election a un comit\u00e9, les m\u00e9mes expressions que celeas employees dans la 38 Vict. ch. 11. sec. 48. La section 72 de cet acte d\u00e9cr\u00e9tait que le comite general auquel \u00e9tait r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e la formation des comites sp\u00e9ciaux pour la decision des petitions d'\u00e9lection ferait rapport a la Chambre des noms des membres\u201dof such select committee appointed to try the merits\" Par la section 73 ii \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 des membres ainsi nomm\u00e9s quills pr\u00e9tassent le serment de\nwell and truly to try the matter of the petitions referred to them, and a true judgment to give according to the evidence, and shall be taken to be as a select committee lesallv appointed to try and deter\u201dmine the merits of this return of election so referred to them by the House.\nSection 78. Such select committee shall meet at the time and place appointed for that purpose, and shall proceed to try the merits of the election petition so referred to them.\nCependant, en d\u00e9pit des expressions si souvent r\u00e9p\u00e9 t\u00e9es\u201dto try the merits to try the matter of the petition, to determine the merits of the return of election,\u201don a de tout temps divis\u00e9 la contestation d'une \u00e9lection et admis des moyens de forme plaid\u00e9s par objectionspr\u00e9liminarres, dont la decision avait l'effet de terminer la contestation. J'oserais dire sans craindre de commettre une grave erreur, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 autant de petitions d'\u00e9lections sur des objections pr\u00e9liminaires, que sur le m\u00e9rite m\u0152me de ces petitions. Cependant lee references, faites aux comit\u00e9s charges de les decider, \u00e9taient\u201dto try the merits\u201dmalgr\u00e9 cela on n'a jamais eu l'id\u00e9e que c'\u00e9tait forfaire au serment\u201dto try the merits\u201dque de decider finalement du sort d'une p\u00e9tition sur des moyens de forme. Telle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 la jurisprudence tant en Anglelerre qu'ici depuis que la decision des elections contest\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 transferee de la Chambre des Communes a des comit\u00e9s sp\u00e9ciaux asserment\u00e9s pour cet objet, c'est a dire pendant un si\u00e9cle,\nOn ne doit done pas h\u00e9siter a conclure que ces expres sions\u201dtry the merits\u201dsigniaiaient dane l'acte imperial des elections contest\u00e9es de 1770, et dans notre statut provincial de 1851, le proc\u00e9s (trial) sur les objections pr\u00e9liminaires aussi bien que le proc\u00e9s (trial) sur le m\u00e9rite de la petition.\nEn r\u00e9p\u00e9tant les memes expressions dane l'acte des elections contest\u00e9es de 1873 et 1874 ainsi que dans la 38e Vic, ch. 11, sect. 48, lal\u00e9gislature est cens\u00e9e d'apr\u00e9s les r\u00e9gles ordinaires d'interpr\u00e9tation des statuts, avoir adopt\u00e9 et conserve l'interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e ant\u00e9rieurement a ces expressions. Dans la section 48 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la jurisprudence \u00e0tablie, les expressions\u201dtry the petition\u201do\u00f9\u201dtry the matter of the petition\u201ddoivent avoir la m\u0152me signification qu'auparavant,\nCons\u00e9quemment l'appel donn\u00e9 dans ces termes doit' aussi comprendre l'appel d'un jugement qui, quoique rendu sur des objections pr\u00e9liminaires decide en m\u0152me temps le m\u00e9rite de la petition et an\u00e9antit la contestation\nD'ailleurs les termes de la section 48 donnant le droit d'appel me semble ne laisser aucun douee sur ce sujet;\u201dany party to an election petition under the said Act who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the judge who has tried such petition, on any question of law or of fact and desires to appeal against the same etc.\u201dC'est de la decision que l'appel a lieu, non pas du proc\u00e9s (trial) et cette decision peut \u00e9tre rendue\u201don the trial of a question of law or of fact.\u201dDans le cas actuel il y avait l'un et l'autre; et c'est de la decision sur les questions de fait et de droit que l'appel est donn\u00e9, sans distinction d'appel sur le m\u00e9rite o\u00f9 sur les objectionspr\u00e9liminarres. La loi ne fait a cet \u00e9gard ni restriction ni distinctions, et la o\u00f9 elle n'en fait pas, ii n'est pas permis au juge d'en faire.\nPour ces raisons, je suss d'avis que l'appel devrait \u00eatre recu.\nQuant aux questions soulev\u00e9es sur le m\u00e9rite il serait inutile d'entrer dans leur consid\u00e9ration, puisque la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour est d'opinion qu'il n'y a pas d'appel du jugement dont on se plaint en cette cause.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe points in this case I have found notto be so easily resolved as at the hearing, I was inclined to think They were raised by two issues, numbers one and four, in the shape of preliminary objections, by the Respondent as follows ;\u2014\nThe Respondent asked to have the petition dismissed because, as he alleges,\n1st. No certified copy of the petition was served upon him, and\n2nd. No notice of the presentation of the petition and o the bail (cautionement) was served upon him.\nThe learned Judge before whom the matter came decided in favor of the Respondent on both points; and dismissed the petition with costs. From that judgment the Petitioners appealed to this Court; and, in addition to the claim of the correctness of that decision the Respondent takes the ground that, inasmuch as the merits of the petition were not heard and adjudicated upon by the learned Judge, no appeal will lie.\nI will deal with the latter objection first, as it touches the jurisdiction of this Court to try the merits of the judgment given on the other points at issue.\nThe appeal directly to this Court in controverted election cases is given bv section 48 of the Dominion Act of 1875 entitled '.\u201dAn Act to establish a Supreme Court and a Court of Exchequer for the Dominion of Canada\"\nIt provides for the repeal of sections 33, 34 and 35 of the Controverted Elections Act of 1874 and enacts that:\nAny party to an election petition under the said Act, who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge who has tried such petition on any question of law or of fact, and desires to appeal against the same may appeal to this Court. And the appeal shall thereupon be heard and determined by the Supreme Court, which shall pronounce such judgment upon questions of law or of fact, or both, as in the opinion of the said Court ought to have been given by the Judge whose decision is appealed from.\nIt also empowers this Court to make orders as to the money deposited; as to the costs of the appeal; and also for the taking of further evidence when improperly rejected, and it further provides :\nThat the Registrar shall certify to the Speaker of the House of Commons the judgment and. decision of the Court upon the several questions, as well of fact as of law, upon which the Judge appealed from might otherwise have determined and certified his decision in pursuance of the said Act, in the same manner as the said Judge should otherwise have done, and with the same effect, &c.\nThe thirty-third section of the Act of 1874, so repealed, provided for appeal from the Judge to the Court of Review in Quebec or Montreal, as the case might be, as follows ;\nProvided also that in the Province of Quebec any party to the petition may, after depositing the necessary sum of money as security,. &c., file in the same office an inscription for review, notice of which must be given to each of the opposite parties, &c., * * * and all other proceedings, shall be had as in a case of review. And the Court shall determine and certify its determination and decision to the Speaker upon the several points and matters, as well of fact as of law, &c.\nas in section 48 of the other Act hereinbefore first quoted.\nSection 34 provides for the appeals to be made to the Court of Review at Quebec or Montreal, as the case might be.\nSection 35\nProvided, also, that in any other of the Provinces any party to the petition who may be dissatisfied with the decision of the Judge on any question of law or of fact, and desiresto appeal against the samer may, within eight days from the day on which the Judge has given his decision, deposit in the Court of which the said Judge is a member, with the proper officer of the Court, &c., the sum of one hundred dollars, &c., by way of security for costs, &c.\nThe matter of the petition is then to be set down\u201dfor hearing before the full Court.\u201dAnd the said appeal shall thereupon be heard and determined by the said full Court, and the judgment shall be pronounced both upon questions of law and of fact, as should, in the opinion of the said Court, have been delivered, by the said Judge, with, the same conclusion as to the power to dispose of the deposit and the costs of the appeal, the certificate to the Speaker, and the finality of the judgment in substance as in the section which gives the appeal to this Court.\nUnder the circumstances in this case then could a party, dissatisfied with the decision of a Judge of the Superior Court of Quebec as to the preliminary objections, appeal to the whole Court ? By the Act the preliminary questions may be tried by the Court or a Judge, and sections 3 and 7 declare what \u201dthe Court\u201d and \u201dthe Judge,\u201d when used in the Act, shall mean. Section 3 provides :\u2014\nIn this Act and. for the purposes thereof, the expression, \u201dthe Court,\u201d as respects elections ii the several Provinces hereinafter mentioned respectively, shall mean the Courts hereinafter mentioned, or any Judges thereof, &c.\nAnd section 7 provides:\u2014\nThe expression, \u201cthe Judge,\u201d shall mean the Judge trying the election petition, or performing any duty to which the enactment in which the expression occurs has reference, &c.\nSection 10 provides for the filing of preliminary\nObjections or grounds of insufficiency which he may have to urge against the petition or the Petitioner, or against any further proceedings thereon; and the Court, or any Judge thereof, shall hear the parties upon such objections or grounds, and shall decide the same in a summary manner.\nI have no doubt that the objections taken were legiti mate ones in this case, which, if proved, would be sufficient to cause the dismissal of the petition but the consideration of which I consider unnecessary.\nBy the Act of 1874 no part of the proceedings in regard to preliminary objections need necessarily come before \u201dthe Court\"; for section 3 makes a Judge \u201dthe Court,\u201d with plenary powers. The Judge who tries the preliminary objections is, for the time being, \u201dthe Court,\u201dand, if so, no appeal to the whole Court would lie, unless expressly provided by the statute. I think, therefore, no appeal would lie to the whole Court. Section 7 says that \u201dthe Judge\u201d shall mean not only the Judge trying the petition, but a Judge performing any duty to which the enactment in which the expression occurs has reference.\nSection 33 provides for an appeal to the whole Court within \u201deight days from the day on which the Judge has given his decision,\u201d and for the hearing of the appeal, and enacts, that all other proceedings shall be had as in a case of Review.\nIt has been contended that an appeal will only lie from the decision of the Judge who tried the merits of the petition, and not from the Judge who tried the preliminary objections. Section 33, however, gives an appeal from the decision of \u201dthe Judge,\u201d without any distinction, as between the Judge trying the preliminary objections and the Judge trying the merits of the petition. The words \u201dperforming any duty,\u201d would, no doubt, in some respects, and for some purposes, apply to and include the Judge trying the preliminary objections. The section in question says, in substance, that \u201dthe Judge\u201d shall mean and include a Judge other than the Judge trying the petition, but it may not still be applicable to \u201cthe Judge\u201d trying the preliminary objections and still have abundant application otherwise.\nIf it be considered wise or necessary that the party against whom a decision is given on a trial of the merits should be entitled to an appeal, why should there not be an appeal when an erroneous judgment on the preliminary objections deprives the petitioner of a trial on the merits, and leaves the Respondent illegally in his seat. I cannot conclude the Legislature intended to leave parties interested and the status of the Legislature itself dependent to such an extent on the decision of any one Judge with out appeal. The question here is however not so much, what the intention was, but whether an appeal in such a case is, by legislation, provided. That it is not by express provision is clear and must confess I find no little difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that it is necessarily to be implied. The words of the clause giving the appeal to this Court provide for such appeal only from \u201cthe decision of the Judge who has tried such petition;\u201d and the five latter words, being clearly words of limitation, we cannot extend the provision beyond them, unless by other parts of the Act it is patent they were not intended to be so construed. I have sought in vain for anything in any of the enactments to justify the conclusion that the restrictive words in question were not intended to have their full effect. If the Legislature intended an appeal should be had from the judgment on the preliminary objections, the restrictive words were unfortunately used; but 1 feel myself bound to interpret the several Statutes as I find the wording of them requires irrespective of results.\nWhat is meant by the words \u201dtried the petition\"? They are, to my mind, intended to distinguish between the Judge who has tried the merits of the petition from a Judge who may have tried the preliminary objections'\nSection 13 of the Act of 1874, provides that every election petition shall be tried by one of the Judges, &c without a jury; and settles where the trial shall take place.\n\"The Judge who has tried the petition,\u201d is here pretty plainly indicated, and certainly does not, in my opinion, include the Judge who tries the preliminary objections. It is not necessarily the same Judge who tries both; and although it may be asserted that the Judge who tries the preliminary objections does indirectly as in this case determine the election and in that way try the petition is such a trial what the Statute refers to ? I have had no small difficulty on that point; but I cannot see my way clear, after a studious consideration of all the legislation 'upon the subject, to the conclusion that such should be the proper legal interpretation of the words by which an appeal is provided. The clause giving the appeal to this Court, as also those giving the appeal to the other courts under the Act of 1874, clearly point to a final judgment and report to the speaker; and if it was intended that the judgment on preliminary objections should be the subject of an appeal, no final judgment could in many cases be given, and the matter would, in case of reversal, have to go back to a Judge to try the merits of the petition. For such there is no statutory provision; and when considering the words of limitation I have mentioned in connection with that fact and the provision for the peculiar and final judgment to be given on appeal, and report of the same to the Speaker, I feel myself bound to conclude, either that no appeal in such cases was intended, or, that if it was, the legislation for it is defective. Section 29 of the Act of 1814 provides that the Judge shall, after eight days from the time of his decision, unless in case of an appeal, certify his determination to the Speaker and it shall be final l and the same provision for eight days' time for an appeal is given in section 32, where provision is made for a decision upon a \u201dspecial case\u201d agreed upon. Section 10 which provides for the trial of preliminary objections, has no such time given, but says that\nThe parties shall be heard upon the objections and grounds, and that the Court or a Judge shall decide the same in a summary manner.\nThe distinction that thus appears as to the judgment in the latter case from those under sections 29 and 32 would lead to the conclusion that on the trial under section 10, no appeal was contemplated. There are, however, several reasons in opposition to those I have mentioned, but I cannot help feeling that they are not sufficient to control those I have given for the conclusions I have arrived at. Taking this view it is un necessary for me to refer to the remaining points.\nAppal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellants: Laugelier & Langelier.\nSolicitor for Respondent: H.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN\u2019S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA\u2014(APPEAL SIDE).\nLarceny\u2014Unstamped Promissory Note\u2014Valuable Security\u201432 & 33 Vic., ch. 21 D.\nS. was indicted, tried and convicted for stealing a note for the payment and value of $258.33, the property of A. McC. and another. The evidence showed that the promissory note in question was drawn by A. McC. and C. R., and made payable to S\u2019s order. The said note was given by mistake to S., it being supposed that the sum of $258.33 was due him by the drawers, instead of a less sum of $175.00. The mistake being immediately discovered, S. gave back the note to the drawers, unstamped and unindorsed, in exchange for another note of $175.00. An opportunity occurring, S. afterwards, on the same day, stole the note; he caused it to be stamped, indorsed it, and tried to collect it. Held,\u2014On appeal reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side), that S. was not guilty of larceny of \u201ca note\u201d or of \u201ca valuable security\u201d within the meaning of the Statute, and that the offence of which he was guilty was not correctly described in the indictment.\nThe prisoner, James Scott, was tried and convicted on a charge of stealing \u201c a note for the payment of and of the value of $258.33, the property of Archibald McCallum and Charles Read,\u201d at the March Term, 1877, of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Crown Side) sitting at Montreal.\nMr. Justice Ramsay, holding that Court, reserved the following case for the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench sitting in Appeal and Error.\n\u201cProvince of Quebec, \u201cDistrict of Montreal.\nIn the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.

The evidence \u201cshowed that the promissory note in question was \u201cdrawn by Archibald McCallum and Charles Read, and \u201cmade payable to the prisoner\u2019s order. The said note \u201cwas given by mistake to prisoner, it being supposed \u201cthat the sum of ($258.33) two hundred and fifty-eight \u201cdollars and thirty-three cents was due him by the drawers, instead of a less sum of ($175.00) one hundred \u201cand seventy-five dollars. The mistake being immeditely discovered, prisoner gave back the note to the \u201cdrawers, unstamped and unindorsed, in exchange for \u201canother note of ($175.00) one hundred and seventy \u2013 \u201cfive dollars. An opportunity occurring, prisoner afterwards, on the same day, stole the note; he caused \u201cit to be stamped, indorsed it, and tried to collect it. He \u201cwas convicted, and I reserved the following questions \u201cfor the consideration of the Court :\u2014\n\u201cFirst: Whether an unstamped promise to pay is a \u201cpromissory note or a valuable security?\n\u201cSecond: Whether in the hands of the drawers it was \u201csuch property as to be the subject of larceny?\n\u201cAnd I postponed the judgment until such questions \u201care decided, and recommitted the prisoner to prison.\n\u201c(Signed) T. K. Ramsay, J.\n\u201cMontreal, 11th June, 1877.\u201d\nThe reserved case was heard in the full Court and the conviction sustained, Chief Justice Dorion and the late Mr. Justice Sanborn dissenting.\nDue notice to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was given to the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec, within fifteen days from the rendering of the above judgment, as required by sec. 49 of the Act.\nThe prisoner, being poor, was unable to make any deposit to appeal, but fyled in the office of the Clerk of the Court of Appeals a petition in forma pauperis to be allowed to obtain the papers from that office.\nMr. Frank Keller, for Appellant:\u2014\nThe indictment contains but one count: that of \u201cfeloniously stealing one note for the payment of and of the value of $258.33, the property of A. McC. and another.\u201d This note, payable to appellant\u2019s order, was unstamped and unindorsed when stolen. In order to obtain a conviction under 32 and 33 Vic., c. 21, it was the duty of the Crown prosecutor to have evidence that the Appellant had stolen \u201cmoney or a valuable secureity.\u201d Now, all the English authorities go to prove that an ordinary unstamped note cannot be \u201ca valuable security in the hands of the owner.\u201d The Canadian Statute which allows a bon\u00e2 fide holder of a promissory note to cure the defect by affixing double stamps, does not alter the case. A note, considered as a valuable security, is only deemed equal in value to the unsatisfied amount of money, for the securing or for the payment of which it is applicable. There was no amount due upon this note and it cannot have been of any value to the owner, as it was stolen before it was negotiated. See Rex v. Phipoe (1); R. v. Mead (2); R. v. Bingley (3); R. v. Perry (4); Russell on Crimes (5); Caverly v. Caverly (6); Rex v. Walsh (7); Reg. v. Yates (8); The case of R. v. West (9); was relied upon by the Court below, but it does not apply.\nThe case of West was an indictment against Frederick West for stealing \u00a395 in money, and against Elizabeth West, his wife, for receiving \u00a35 in money, part of said \u00a395, knowing them to have been stolen. The money stolen consisted in bank notes, and the only question raised, was whether banknotes not in actual circulation could be the subject of larceny as money, under section 18 of 14 and 15 Vict., ch. 100, similar to section 25 of 32 and 33, ch. 29, of the Dominion Acts, which declare it sufficient to describe bank notes in an indictment as money.\nIt cannot be seriously argued that there is any similarity between taking a bank note and a promissory note made by the drawer, especially when the Statute declares that stealing bank notes is equivalent to stealing money. The honorable Judges who delivered the judgment of the full Court acknowledged the decision was contrary to English precedents. This judgment, if sustained by the Supreme Court of the Dominion of Canada, would over-rule the former decisions existing on this point.\nOur criminal law being based on the English criminal law should follow the English precedents. The reasoning of the honorable the Chief Justice, and the grounds urged by the different authorities cited, prisoner\u2019s counsel respectfully submits are clear and ought to be sustained.\nMr. C. P. Davidson, Q. C., for the Crown :\nThe prisoner was convicted for stealing a note. In Art. 2344 C. C. L. C., we have the definition of a promissory note. Under this section the moment the note got into the possession of the Appellant it was a legal instrument. The English cases cited by Appellant\u2019s Counsel do not apply, for the law was not the same when these decisions were rendered as ours is now. In the Canadian Statute the following words have been added \u201cevidencing title to any chattel or money.\u201d The importance of these words has not been taken into consideration by the learned Judges who differed in the Court below. It is argued that the note was unstamped and unindorsed, but the endorsation by Scott is not of the essence of the note, neither is the stamp, for the note can be legalized here by affixing double stamps.\nThe case of R. v. Walsh (1), relied on by the Appellant, has been twice overruled: 1st. by R. v. Metcalfe (2); and 2nd. By R. v. Heath (3). The case of Reg. v. West (4), where it was held that bank notes in the hands of a bank, and not in circulation, could be the subject of larceny, is a case in point. Mr. F. Keller, in reply :\u2014\nThere is no difference between a promissory note here and a promissory note in England. In the case of R. v. Heath () there, the cheque was taken, not from the hands of the drawer, but from the servant. It became a valuable security because it was taken from a third party. In no case whatever is the case of R. v. Heath referred to as overruling R. v. Walsh (2).\nRitchie, J.:\u2014\nA note was made payable by the prosecutors to the prisoner\u2019s order and given to him. It having been discovered that a mistake had been made in the amount for which the note was drawn, the prisoner returned it to the drawers, unstamped and unindorsed. On the same day prisoner stole the note, caused it to be stamped, indorsed, and tried to collect it. He was indicted \u201cfor stealing a note for the payment and value of $258.33, the property of Archibald McCallum and another, the drawers.\u201d He was convicted, and the learned Judge reserved for the consideration of the Court the following questions:\u2014\nFirst. Whether an unstamped promise to pay is a promissory note or a valuable security?\nSecond. Whether, in the hands of the drawers, it was such property as to be the subject of larceny?\nThe conviction was sustained by a majority of the full Court, the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Sanborn dissenting. .\nThe Statute under which the prisoner was indicted and convicted is the 32 and 33 Vic., ch. 21, and the sections bearing on this case are sections 1 and 15. Section 1 provides :\u2014 . That in the interpretation of this Act the term \u201cvaluable security\u201d shall include, inter alia, any debenture, deed, bond, bill, note, warrant, order, or other security whatsoever, for money or for payment of money, whether of Canada or of any Province therein, or of the United Kingdom, or of any British Colony, or possession, or of any foreign State, or any document of title to lands or goods as hereinbefore defined, and any stamp or writing which secures or evidences title to, or interest in, any chattel, personal, or any release, receipt, discharged or other instrument evidencing payment of money or the delivery of any chattel personal; and every such valuable security shall, where value is material be deemed to be of value equal to that of such unsatisfied money, chattel personal, share, interest or deposit for the securing or payment of which, or delivery, or transfer, or sale of which, or for the entitling or evidencing title to which such valuable security is applicable or to that of such money or chattel personal, the payment or delivery of which is evidenced by such valuable security.\nAnd section 15 declares that:\u2014\nWhosoever steals or for any fraudulent purpose destroys, cancels, obliterates or conceals the whole or any part of any valuable security other than a document of title to lands is guilty of felony of the same nature and in the same degree,' and punishable in the same manner as if he had stolen any chattel of like value with the share, interest or deposit, to which the security so stolen relates, or with the money due on the security so stolen or secured thereby and remaining unsatisfied, or with the value of the goods or other valuable thing represented, mentioned or referred to in or by the security.\nI think it capable of easy demonstration that at the time this document was stolen it was neither a \u201cnote,\u201d nor a valuable security within the meaning of the Statute. If it was of any appreciable value to the owner as a mere piece of paper, the prisoner was not indicted for stealing it as such, and therefore on this indictment for stealing a note could not be convicted.\nThe document was not at the time it was stolen, as against the makers, valid and obligatory, so that in whosesoever hands it might come for valuable consideration it would be productive and available against the makers.\nThe note was not stamped when stolen. The 11th section of the Stamp Act then in force declared that if any person in Canada makes, &c., \u201cany promissory note\u201d chargeable with duty under 31 Vic., ch. 9, before the duty or double duty has been paid, such person shall thereby incur a penalty of $100, and save only in case of payment of double duty as in 12th section provided, such instrument shall be invalid and of no effect in law or equity. The 12th section provides:\u2014\nNo party to or holder of any promissory note, draft or bill of exchange, shall incur any penalty by reason of the duty thereon not having been paid at the proper time and by the other party or parties, provided that at the time it came into his hands it had affixed to it stamps to the amount of the duty apparently payable upon it, that he had no knowledge that they were not affixed at the proper time and by the proper party or parties, and that he pays the double duty or additional duty as soon as he acquires such knowledge,\u2014and any holder of such instrument may pay the duty thereon and give it validity, under section eleven of this Act, without becoming a party thereto. In this section the word \u201cduty\u201d includes any double or additional duty payable under the said section eleven.\nIt is therefore clear, that the alleged note, not having been stamped by the makers, and, indeed, never properly stamped, was, under the Stamp Acts, of no effect in law or equity.\nAt the time this paper was taken it was not then a valid or binding undertaking to pay or secure any sum of money, nor yet intended so to be, and if the maker did not stamp it, and never intended it should be stamped, surely the law never contemplated that in the event of such a paper being stolen, it could be legally stamped by the thief, and so, by the act of the thief, vitality and effect should be given to that which otherwise would be wholly void and of no effect, either at law or in equity. I can find no provision in the law for making the stamping by such a party effective.\nBut, independent of this, the Statute only declares that the party stealing a valuable security shall be guilty of felony of the same nature and in the same degree, and punishable in the same manner, as if he had stolen any chattel of the like value with the same, &c., \u201cor with the money due on the security so stolen or secured thereby and remaining unsatisfied\u201d; so if there is no money due on the security so stolen nor secured thereby and remaining unsatisfied, what is the nature of the felony and degree and punishment to which he is liable? And thus we find in Archibold (1) the form of the indictment for stealing a bill or note contains the averment, that the sum \u201c payable and secured by and upon the said Bill, being then due and unsatisfied,\u201d and in the text it is stated; \u201cso that to show that the stealing of a bill, or note, or cheque is punishable within the 7 & 8 Geo. 4 C. 29, s. 5 (which is couched in the same language as section 15 of the Dominion Act), it is necessary to show that some amount of money is due upon it or secured by it and remaining unsatisfied, and that is not done by merely stating it to be a bond, bill of exchange, promissory note or order for money or payment of money, for it may have been paid and in the case of the Queen v. Lowrie (2), in which the indictment was in a similar form, and where it was determined, that an indictment, under the 24 and 25 Vic., cap. 96 Sec. 27,(which uses similar language to our own Statute,) for stealing a valuable security must particularize the kind of valuable security stolen. Bovill, C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court, speaking of the document proved, says: \u201cIt was not by itself a document entitling Cairns (the Prosecutor) to receive the money from Stafford. Moreover, the money was not dm and unsatisfied at the time the prisoner took the agreement.\u201d\nHow can it be said there was any money due on this paper or secured thereby? It could not have been used by the drawer, the owner, for any available purpose whatever, either as a promissory note or a valuable? security; nor, as regards others, could what prisoner stole, have been sued on, or made available by any one at the time he took it, in the unindorsed and unstamped state in which it then was, and certainly not by the prisoner himself, because, if he sued on it, it would be quite open to the maker to show that nothing was due or owing on it, and that the claimant had stolen the paper, which it is obvious would be a clear answer to his action, and so conclusively establish that the instrument, in lieu of being a valuable security, was simply a piece of paper, on, or by which, there was no money due or secured, and no unsatisfied money for securing or payment of which the paper was applicable. If then it was valueless as a security to the maker and payee, and, at the time it was taken, to all others, it not being then indorsed or stamped, had the prisoner been apprehended and indicted and tried while the paper continued in that condition, is it not self-evident that he could not have been convicted of stealing a promissory note or a valuable security, the paper then being in fact and in law neither the one nor the other. If this be so, on what principle can it be successfully contended, that the act of the prisoner in either stamping or indorsing, or both, subsequent to the taking, and wholly unconnected with the act of taking, and while still retaining the paper in his own possession, or under his own control, could make that taking larceny, which was not larceny when the act of taking was committed; for when he took the note from the prosecutor, he certainly neither stole a stamped nor an indorsed note. If such was the effect of his dealing with the paper, it would necessarily follow, that it was not the taking which constituted the larceny, but the subsequent stamping and indorsing, and we were not to look at the condition of the paper when the larceny was actually committed. But it is clear that neither the stamping nor the indorsing would give the paper any value in the possession of the prisoner; because the mere fact of his stamping and indorsing the paper and retaining it in his own hands could in no way make the paper a good note, or a valuable security, nor in my opinion in any way change the relative position of the parties in respect to the paper, or their relative rights or obligations.\nIt is not necessary to discuss or express any opinion as to what might have been the possible effect of prisoner\u2019s acts had he stamped and indorsed the paper and transferred it to a bon\u00e2fide innocent indorsee for value, whereby it might, or might not, have become available as against the drawer as a promissory note, the payment of which he could or in view of the stamp Acts or otherwise he could not resist.\nIt is sufficient for us to say that on the present indictment, we think the prisoner should not have been convicted of stealing a note for the payment and value of $258.33; but there need have been no failure of justice in this case, for had the Prisoner been indicted for the common law offence of simply stealing a piece of paper, and had there been a second count in the indictment of that character, he might have been tried for that crime and convicted as in Reg. v. Perry (1); Reg. v. Walls (2); Reg. v. Yates (3); Reg. v. Clark ([1]); Reg. v. Frampton ([2]); Reg. v. Rodway ([3]); Reg. v. Vyse ([4]); and other cases.\nStrong, J., I am of the same opinion.\nHenry, J. :\u2014\nThe prisoner was indicted for stealing \u201ca valuable security,\u201d in the shape of a promissory note, for the payment and of the value of $258.33, the property of Archibald McCallum and another. The note was made by Archibald McCallum and Charles Read, payable to prisoner\u2019s order. The note was delivered unstamped to the prisoner, but it was immediately given back by him in the same state and unindorsed, as it was discovered that the amount was too large, and he received a note in lieu thereof for the correct amount ($175). The prisoner afterwards, on the same day, stole the note first mentioned. He was convicted, and the learned Judge on the trial reserved two points :\n\u201cFirst Whether an unstamped promise to pay is a promissory note or a valuable security?\n\u201cSecond. Whether, in the hands of the drawers, it was such property as to be the subject of larceny?\u201d\nThe reserved case was heard in the full Court, and the conviction sustained by three out of the five Judges who heard it, and it has come to this Court by appeal from that decision.\nI am of opinion the conviction was wrong on many grounds.\nIn the first place the indictment charges the larceny of \u201ca note,\u201d being the note in question. I am of opinion it was not a note at all. It was drawn by mistake, and, although delivered, it was unstamped, and, therefore, then imperfect as a note; and the re-delivery when the mistake was discovered made it precisely as if never made or delivered. It is then an incomplete instrument in the hands of the drawers, with no intention or idea of ever completing the execution or delivery of it, or of making any use whatever of it as a note. It has been argued that the payee, after a larceny of it, might double stamp it, and indorse it for a valuable consideration to a third party without notice of the larceny, and that the indorsee would thereby acquire a right of action to recover the amount from the parties whose names appeared as the makers. I can find no law to sustain this proposition. If, indeed, a note be fully executed, and passes by delivery out of the hands of the drawer, is endorsed and subsequently stolen, and gets into the hands of an innocent holder for a valuable consideration, he can recover it from the drawer, but it must first have the character of a note. If I draw a note to the order of a party, and lock it up in my desk to be stamped and delivered when I receive a consideration for it, and my desk is opened and the note stolen, I know of no law to oblige me to pay it. When I execute and deliver a note, I am presumed to have received a consideration for it, and am therefore bound to pay the legal holder or indorsee, but it would be contrary to every equitable, and I may say legal, principle to make me pay in the other case, where I received no value or did no act from which such might be presumed. There is no doubt of the law in the first case, but I can find none to sustain the other proposition. Many decisions, however, run in the opposite direction.\nThe authorities as to the necessity of a delivery before liability attaches are abundant.\nIt must be by the drawer or by some one authorized by him. An executor cannot complete his testator\u2019s indorsement by delivering the instrument which has been already signed by the testator. Bromage v. Lloyd ([5]). Neither indorsement nor acceptance are complete before delivery of the bill. Cox v. Tray ([6]); Chapman v. Cottrell ([7]). Where A. specially indorsed certain bills to B., sealed them in a p arcel and left it with his servant to be given to the postman, it was held that the special indorsement did not transfer the property in the bill still delivery, and that delivery to the servant was not sufficient, although it would have been otherwise if delivery had been made to the postman. Reg. v. Lampton ([8]); see also Adams v. Jones ([9]); Brind v. Hampshire ([10]); C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Deveze ([11]).\nThe liability of the acceptor, though irrevocable when complete, Thornton v. Dick ([12]); Trimmer v. Oddie ([13]), does not attach by merely writing his name, but upon the subsequent delivery of the bill\u2014or upon communication to some person in the bill, that it has been so accepted. Hence it follows that if the drawee has written his name on the bill, with the intention to accept, he is at liberty to cancel his acceptance at any time before the bill is delivered, or, at least, before the fact of the acceptance is communicated to the holder, Cox v. Tray ([14]); and the other cases cited in Byles on bills ([15]);\nA distinction, and a wide one, exists on this point between a note or bill payable to order and those payable to bearer. In the case of the latter an unauthorized delivery may, and often does, give to a bon\u00e2 fide holder a claim on the other parties, but the rule is not so in respect to those payable to order.\nThere is no doubt that, in general, the circumstance of a bill or note having been obtained without adequate consideration, or by duress or fraud, or feloniously, or having been put into circulation contrary to agreement, affords no defence when the instrument has come into the possession of a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value ([16]); but that doctrine does not apply to what was never a bill or note. If a note be fully executed, as I have before said, the maker is answerable if the instrument be stolen from a holder and gets afterwards into the hands of another bon\u00e2 fide holder for value. The cases cited by Chitty in support of the doctrine quoted as to stolen notes refer to bank notes or cheques, or crossed cheques, all of which pass by delivery after issue, but do not, in the slightest degree, refer to promissory notes never delivered.\nHaving shewn that on principle it would be inequitable to enforce payment of an inchoate instrument stolen from the party to it, and for which he never received any value, and in the absence of any legal authority, I feel bound to declare that no action on the note in question would lie, even at the instance of a bon\u00e2fide holder for value, and must conclude that it was not a note at all and therefore as such not the subject of larceny.\nThe provision for double stamping, if carried out in regard to this note, does not, I take it, help the case, for if it wanted other essentials the mere stamping could not change the character of the instrument.\nI am also of opinion, from a careful study of all the authorities, that in no case could a mere promissory note, payable by a party to some other, and not fully executed and delivered, be in any circumstances \u201ca valuable security.\u201d It could not be one to the intended payee for he had never acquired any right to it, and a man\u2019s own note could not be a security to him. It is laid down in Archibold's Criminal pleading ([17]), that it must be of value to the prosecutor, and be proved that something remains due and unsatisfied to him. How could it be said that a man\u2019s own note was due and unsatisfied to himself? Common sense forbids it.\nI also am of opinion, that it must be a valuable security to some one at the time of the larceny, and that no subsequent act of double stamping which might make the note otherwise a good one would be sufficient to sustain a charge of larceny. On the points stated by my learned brother Ritchie, I fully agree and am therefore of opinion that the indictment has not been sustained by proof.\nThe Chief Justice, Taschereau and Fournier, J.

In November, 1873, the firm of D., H. & S. became insolvent. On the 14th February, 1874, the said firm, under the Bankruptcy Act of the United States (s. 5,103, Rev. Stat. U.S.,) executed a deed purporting to \u201cconvey, transfer and deliver all their and each of their estate and effects\u201d to one C., as trustee for the creditors. On the 26th Sept., 1874, a writ of execution against D\u2019s lands in Canada was placed in the hands of the proper Sheriff by the Respondents, who had in the mean time recovered judgment against him. Subsequently D., by way of further assurance, and in pursuance of the deed of the 14th Feb\u2019y, 1874, granted to C., the trustee, his lands in Canada, specifying the different parcels.\nM., the Appellant, was afterwards substituted to C. as trustee, and, as such, filed a Bill in the Court of Chancery to obtain a declaration that the lands specified in the bill were not liable to the operation of the writ of execution of the Respondents.\nHeld,\u2014That a bankrupt assignment, made under the provisions of an Act of the Congress of the United States of America, will not transfer immoveable property in Canada.\nAlso,\u2014That the deed of the 14th February, 1874, was not effectual, either as a deed of bargain and sale, or a deed of grant to pass any legal title or interest in the lands of D. in Canada.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario by the Plaintiff in a cause in the Court of Chancery, in which the present Appellant was Plaintiff and the Georgian Bay Lumber Company were Defendants.\nThe Plaintiff\u2019s bill was filed in the Court of Chancery on the 18th day of May, 1876, in order to obtain a declaration that the Writ of Execution against the lands of Anson G.P. Dodge, placed by the Defendants in the hands of the Sheriff of the County of York, did not operate to bind certain lands in that County described in the bill. The answer of the Defendants was filed on the 23rd day of September, 1876.\nIssue having been joined, the case came on to be heard at the sittings of the Court of Chancery at Toronto, on the 8th day of November, 1876, before The Honorable Vice\u2011Chancellor Proudfoot.\nJudgment was delivered by the Vice-Chancellor on the 10th of January, 1877, in favor of the Plaintiff, and a decree was thereupon drawn up and entered in accordance with the prayer of the bill.\nThe Defendants subsequently appealed from this decree to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and that Court, on the 18th day of June, 1877, gave judgment in favor of the Defendants, reversing the decree of the Court of Chancery with costs and ordering that the bill be dismissed with costs.\nThe present appeal to this Court was brought in order to reverse the order of the Court of Appeal and restore the decree of the Court of Chancery. The facts material to a decision may be stated as follows:\u2014\nOn the 1st of November, 1873, a petition was filed in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, under the provisions of an Act of the Congress of the United States of America, entitled: \u201cAn Act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States.\u201d approved March 2nd, 1867, against Anson G.P. Dodge, W.J. Hunt and Samuel Scholefield, praying that they might be adjudicated bankrupt; and on the 15th November,1873, they were duly adjudicated bankrupt.\nOn the 14th February, 1874, an order of the same Court was made in the matter of the Bankruptcy whereby it was ordered that the said A.G.P. Dodge, W.J. Hunt and S. Scholefield should forthwith convey, transfer and deliver all their and each of their property or estate to John L. Cadwalader, as trustee, by deed in a form which was set out in extenso in the body of the order, and which was afterwards followed in the deed of the same day, the purport and terms of which are next stated.\nOn the same day John L. Cadwalader was duly appointed trustee of the estates of the bankrupts, and on that day the bankrupts executed and delivered to the trustee a deed purporting to \u201cconvey, transfer and deliver all their and each of their estate and effects to\u201d the trustee, \u201cto have and to hold the same in the same manner, and with the same rights in all respects as\u201d the bankrupts, \u201cor either of them would have had or held the same if no proceedings in bankruptcy had been taken against them or either of them, the same to be ap- plied for the benefit of the creditors of the\u201d bankrupts in like manner as if they had been at that date duly adjudged bankrupts, and the said trustee had been appointed assignee under the Act of Congress.\nOn the 24th September, 1874, the bankrupt Dodge, being seized in fee of a large quantity of lands in Canada, granted and conveyed by way of further assurance, and in pursuance of the said Act and of the said deed of the 14th February, 1874, to the said Cadwalader, in trust for the said creditors, the said lands, specifying the different parcels.\nCadwalader resigned his office of trustee, with the sanction of the Court, and on the 7th December, 1874, the Plaintiff was duly appointed by the Court trustee of the said estates in the stead of the said Cadwalader, and by indenture, dated the 25th January, 1875, Cadwalader conveyed the lands in Canada to the Plaintiff, as such trustee for the said creditors, and the Plaintiff immediately went into possession of them.\nThe Defendants, on the 26th September, 1873, sued out a writ of summons in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Ontario against Dodge, who was a naturalized British subject, then residing out of the jurisdiction; and such proceedings were thereon had that judgment was signed on the 30th June, 1874, for $13,254.18 debt and costs; and on the 26th August, 1874, a writ of execution against the lands of Dodge was placed in the hands of the proper Sheriff, which was renewed on 23rd August, 1875.\nThe Plaintiff, in his bill, charged that this writ is void and of no effect against the lands, but is retained by the Defendants in the Sheriff\u2019s hands, and forms a cloud upon the title of the Plaintiff, who had applied to the Defendants to have the same removed, but which they had refused to do Mr. Cattanach for Appellant:\u2014\nThe conveyance of the 14th of February, 1874, was prior to the writ of execution; and the law here as well as in England is that the execution only affects such an interest as the debtor has at the time the writ is placed in the Sheriff\u2019s hands. Parke v. Rielly[1]; Wickham v. The New Brunswick and Canada Railway[2]; Beaven v. Lord Oxford[3]. The registry laws do not effect the question. McMaster v. Phipps[4]. The real question, then, involved in this appeal is, whether after the conveyance referred to, there was any estate or interest left in the debtor which could be affected by a writ of execution.\nThe Appellant admits that the bankruptcy proceedings in New York, could not affect lands in this country without a conveyance sufficient to pass real estate according to our laws\u2014the lex loci rei sit\u0153 applying[5]; but he contends that the deed of 14th February is sufficient to pass the bankrupt\u2019s estate, or at any rate amounts to an equitable contract or assignment which would be equally efficacious having been followed by the deed of September which conforms to our laws, and by possession.\nForeign bankruptcy proceedings are recognized in England by comity; and the Courts will aid in giving effect to them. In re General Company for Promotion of Credit[6]; affirmed on Appeal under the title of Princess of Reuss v. Bos[7]. Our Courts have adopted the same rule, Howell v. Dominion Oils Company[8]; Barned\u2019s Banking Company v. Reynolds[9]. English Courts have even gone to the length of appointing Receivers, who have no estate at all in lands, for real property in foreign countries, Hinton v. Galli[10]; and the Court of Chancery of Ontario has recognized and given effect to such appointments, Louth v. Western of Canada Oil Company (not reported.) If, therefore, the deed of 14th February, did not effectually accomplish the intention of the parties, our Courts would, if necessary, give effect to the intent in the same way as if the transaction were entirely within the jurisdiction.\nIn the absence of any thing else to shew what was intended a certain form of words is necessary in a deed, I admit. But when it appears on the face of the deed and from the surrounding circumstances that the grantor is parting with his entire interest, I submit that by estoppel, if not otherwise, the deed would operate. Now here, the deed shews on its face that the grantors were conveying all their estate for sale and distribution among their creditors. It would be a fraud on their part to attempt to limit the effect of the deed to a life estate, and much more so to say they had not conveyed anything. And then the deed says that the grantees are to have and hold \u201cin the same manner and with the same rights in all respects\u201d as the grantors would have done if they had not become bankrupts. What does this mean, unless it means an estate in fee or as large an estate as the grantors had to give?\nJustice Patterson in the Court below held the deed to be sufficient in form, and the only difficult there was as to whether it could be intended that these lands were to pass.\nIt is altogether a question of intention to be gathered from the deed and the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary to describe lands specifically in a deed, and parol evidence is often admissible; and the surrounding circumstances always explain what is meant if there is any ambiguity. Here the circumstances necessarily shew that the bankrupts were giving up all they had. Dodge had been, up to this time, a resident of Canada. His head office was there; he did a large business there; and it was notorious that he owned and lived on the very property in question; and, in fact, for aught that appears in the record, he owned no property in the U.S. Is it possible then that the parties could have had in contemplation only property in N.Y., when they knew, as we must assume them to have known, that we would recognize and aid their bankruptcy proceedings.\nAnd in Wheaton, on International Law[11], it is stated that by comity real estate in a foreign country can be reached. The Court, it is true, cannot directly enforce its decrees, but it may do so in personam and by the aid of foreign Courts. Bump, p. 297, and cases before cited.\nThe true interpretation to be given to the Judge\u2019s order is, that the bankrupts must, so far as they are concerned, divest themselves of everything they possess in the world, and that the Court will, so far as it can, administer the estate, wherever it is. Suppose the Canadian lands had been specifically mentioned in the deed, and that the deed was unquestionably in proper form could it be contended that the lands did not pass because the Judge who made the order had no power to deal with these lands? So the case comes down to the deed itself and the surrounding circumstances, irrespective altogether of the order, which is a mere matter of procedure.\nMr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C., for Respondent:\u2014 The deed of the 24th February, 1874, is a statutory deed, deriving its force and validity from s. 5,103 of the Revised Statutes of the United States of America, and cannot have effect as a deed passing by its own force the real estate in Ontario now in dispute in this suit. The proceedings in this case clearly shew that it was not the intention of the petitioners or of the debtors, when possession of the joint and separate estates of the estates was given to the trustee, that they contemplated a conveyance of any property that was not subject to the restraining order of the United States Court, there being no power in the Courts of a foreign State to enforce their decree or order in bankruptcy here; and no legislative body will be presumed to exceed its legitimate jurisdiction. Moreover, the operative words used, \u201cconvey, transfer and deliver,\u201d have no operation in passing real estate here, either at common law or by statute.\nWith this view of the case all the decided American cases agree, shewing that this is a deed, not a contract, and one which passes to the trustee just so much as, and no more than, would have passed to the assignee in insolvency by order of the Court, and without any deed under the hand and seal of the bankrupt. Re Williams[12]; Bump\u2019s Law of Bankruptcy[13]; Osborn v. Adams[14]; Holmes v. Remsen[15]; Lee on Bankruptcy[16]; Ford v. Beech[17].\nThe assignee derives his title from a conveyance executed by the Judge or Registrar, which takes effect by operation of law, sec. 14; and if the assignment had been made by him, it is conceded it would not affect the property, but, because it was made by the insolvent, it is contended that if the words are wide enough, the Courts in Canada will give effect to the deed. But the deed cannot be said to be a deed poll or an indenture. A clear statement of what is intended to pass is as necessary in an agreement as in conveyance. Here there is no word shewing that an inch of land in Ontario was ever intended to be conveyed. The language of the instrument itself, and the proceedings in bankruptcy, shew that the intention of the parties was most certainly confined to the dealing with such property as would have passed to the assignee had not the creditors superseded the bankruptcy by appointing a trustee.\nMr. Cattanach replied:\u2014\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nDefendants issued an execution against the lands of one Anson G.P. Dodge, and placed the same in the hands of the Sheriff of York. Plaintiffs by their bill seek to obtain a declaration that such execution did not operate to bind certain lands in that county, but that a certain deed, dated 14th February, 1874, executed by said Dodge, passed the title to Dodge\u2019s said lands, so as to prevent the Defendants execution, subsequently issued, from being levied thereupon.\nThe Vice-Chancellor decided in favor of Plaintiff, which decree on appeal was reversed and judgment was given by the Appellate Court in favor of Defendants.\nThe present appeal is taken with a view to reverse the latter decision.\nThe Plaintiff is trustee of the bankrupt estate of said Dodge, Hunt and Scholefield, all of and in the United States of America.\nOn the 1st November, 1873, a petition was filed in the District Court of the State of New York, U.S., in accordance with the Act of Congress, entitled: \u201c An Act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States, against Dodge, Hunt and Scholefield, praying they might be adjudicated bankrupts, and on the 15th November, 1873, they were duly adjudicated bankrupts.\nOn the 14th February, 1874, Cadwalader was duly appointed trustee of the estates of the bankrupts and they made and delivered to Cadwalader, as such trustee, the deed of the 14th February, 1874, entitled: \u201cIn the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York\u2014in Bankruptcy. In the matter of Anson G.P. Dodge, William Jay Hunt and Samuel Scholefield, bankrupts, Southern District of New York, [S.S.],\u201d and whereby they did convey, transfer and deliver all their and each of their estate and effects to John L. Cadwalader, as trustee absolutely, to have and to hold the same in the same manner and with the same rights in all respects as the said bankrupts, or either of them, would have had or held the same, if no proceedings in Bankruptcy had been taken against them or either of them; the same to be applied and administered for the benefit of the creditors of said bankrupts in like manner as if said Dodge, Hunt and Scholefield, had been at the date thereof duly adjudged bankrupts, and Cadwalader, trustee, had been appointed Assignee in Bankruptcy, under the Act of Congress; which deed was in the exact form prescribed in an order of Court, on proof that three-fourths in value of the creditors of the bankrupts had resolved to supersede Bankruptcy proceedings by arrangement under section 43; which order, after stating that the certificate of the Registrar in Bankruptcy had been read and filed, and resolutions therein referred confirmed, ordered that the said bankrupts should forthwith convey, transfer and deliver all their and each of their property or estate to Cadwalader, as trustee, by deed on the following form, to wit, &c.: (the form which was adopted.)\nCadwalader subsequently the 20th June, 1874, with the sanction of the District Court of the U.S., for the Southern District of New York, resigned his office of trustee, and on the 7th December, 1874, Plaintiff was duly appointed by said Court trustee instead of said Cadwalader. On the 24th September, 1874, A.G.P. Dodge and wife executed a deed, reciting the petition in bankruptcy under the Act, entitled: \u201cAn Act to establish, &c.,\u201d the adjudication thereon, the appointment of Cadwalader as trustee, the execution of the deed of the 14th February, 1874, setting it out verbatim, and that the estate and effects comprised lands in the Province of Ontario, Dominion of Canada, being individual property of Dodge, and thereafter particularly described, and that said lands are vested in said trustee by force of said Act and deed of 14th February, 1874, and that it had become necessary that the then present deed should be executed by way of further assurance, in order that, under the Registry Laws of Ontario, the title of said trustee in said lands might be registered. The deed witnessed that, in consideration of the premises, and by way of farther assurance, and in consideration of $5, Dodge granted, &c., to Cadwalader, as such trustee, his heirs, &c., the lands, &c., set out in the plaintiff\u2019s bill, in trust for the creditors of the said bankrupts.\nCadwalader, by deed, dated 7th December, 1874, after reciting his appointment as trustee, and the deed of the 14th February, 1874, and his resignation as trustee, and its acceptance, and the order directing the execution and delivery of the deed, conveyed, &c., to John Macdonald, the Plaintiff, \u201call and each of the estates, real and personal, and all the property and effects, both joint and separate, of said Dodge, Hunt & Scholefield, wheresoever situate, both in the United States and in Canada,\u201d which were conveyed by said recited deed to hold the same, as trustee, in the same manner, and with the same powers; and duties relative thereto, as he, Cadwalader, now has, or held the same and as bankrupts, or either of them, would have held them, if no proceedings in bankruptcy had been taken against them, and to be applied for the benefit of their creditors in like manner as if they, at the date thereof, had been duly adjudged bankrupts, and said trustee had been appointed assignee, &c.\nAnd on 25th January, 1875, Cadwalader, by deed of that date, between himself, as trustee of said bankrupts, and Plaintiff, as trustee, after reciting, as the first two recitals of the deed of 24th September, 1874, and that the estate and effects included certain lands in Ontario, being the individual property of Dodge, which were vested in Cadwalader, as trustee, by force of the said Act of Congress and deed of 14th February, 1874, which deed was registered in the registry office N.R. County of York, at 10.50 a.m., 13th October, 1874; and that Cadwalader had resigned his office of trustee, and his resignation had been accepted, and that by order of the District Court of New York, on 7th December, 1874, Plaintiff had been appointed trustee in place of Cadwalader, with same rights, &c., and that said lands were then vested in Plaintiff, as trustee, by force of said Act of Congress and orders and decrees of said District Court, and that it had been deemed necessary that the then presents should be executed by way of further assurance, and in order that under the Registry Laws of Ontario the title of Plaintiff, trustee to said lands, might be registered, conveyed as Dodge had conveyed to Cadwalader.\nOn 25th August, 1874, Defendants caused a writ of execution to be issued against the lands and tenements of Dodge, and on the 26th of the same month, it was placed in the hands of the Sheriff of York, for $13,201.61 debt and $52.57 costs, which writ was renewed on 25th August, 1875, and which, at the time of filing of Plaintiff\u2019s bill, remained in the Sheriff\u2019s hands unsatisfied, and in full force and effect.\nThis writ Plaintiff claims is void, and of no effect against said lands, but operates as a cloud on his title; that he has had an opportunity of selling the lands, but is prevented by reason of the retention by Defendants of said writ in Sheriff\u2019s hands.\nThe deed under which it is claimed the property passed, or by which it is alleged an equitable interest in the real estate of Anson G.P. Dodge in the Dominion of Canada was created, was not a voluntary conveyance, but a statutable assignment, the grantor having been adjudicated a bankrupt. He was adjudged by a Court of competent jurisdiction in the United States to make a statutable conveyance of his property in a certain prescribed form. This was, in my opinion, an involuntary legal conveyance, intended to convey only the property over which the Legislature had assumed the disposition, in invitum, and consequently with which alone the Court had power to deal, and was intended to have, and had, no other or greater effect than if the Legislature had declared that the property of the bankrupt should pass to the assignee or trustee without conveyance by operation of law. In either of which cases the only property that would be affected by the deed or declaration would be the property, or the subject matters of the bankrupt, within the control of the Legislature, or upon, or over which, it could operate, and which clearly would not include lands in a foreign country; for the principle is too well established to be now questioned, that real estate is exclusively subject to the laws of the government within whose territory it is situate. Mr. Story says, so firmly is this principle established, that in cases of bankruptcy, the real estate of a bankrupt, situate in a foreign country, is universally admitted not to pass under the assignment.\nThat real estate is exclusively subject to the law of the Government within whose territory it is situate, see Sills v. Worswick[18]; Phillipps v. Hunter[19]; Hunter v. Potts[20]; Selkrig v. Davies[21]; Brodie v. Barry[22]; Birthwhistle v. Vardill[23]; and American cases cited in Story\u2019s Conflict of Laws, sec. 428.\nIn sec. 425, after stating the principle as laid down by foreign Jurists, Story says:\u2014\nThe universal consent of the tribunals, acting under the common law, both in England and in America, is, in a practical sense, absolutely uniform on the same subject. All the authorities in both countries, so far as they go, recognize the principle in its fullest import, that real estate or immoveable property is exclusively subject to the laws of the Government within whose territory it is situate.\nI think, therefore, the Court of the State of New York must be presumed to have intended to do only what it had the right to do, and intended the deed it directed the bankrupt to execute to pass only the property with which the Court had a right to deal, and there is nothing whatever on the face of the deed to indicate a contrary intention, and we have no right to assume the Court of New York did or attempted to do any more than it had the legal power to accomplish.\nIn Elliot v. North Eastern Railway Company[24] it was held, that a deed of conveyance made under the authority of an Act of Parliament must be read as if the sections of the Act were incorporated in it. At p. 335 Lord Chelmsford says:\u2014\nThe conveyance to the Company was made in the form prescribed by the Act and must be read as if the sections applicable to the subject matter of the grants and its incidents were inserted in it.\nSo in this case must the deed be read by the light of the Bankrupt Act of the United States and the proceedings had thereunder.\nHad the Court in the State of New York ordered the bankrupt to convey the lands in Canada, I do not think it would have been of any avail, for I think it is well established that foreign lands cannot be affected by the administrative Act of any Court, nor can the person be obliged to supply the defects of such administrative Act. See Selkrig v. Davies[25]. The House of Lords held that only a moral obligation to convey to assignees was imposed, which might be justly enforced by withholding the bankrupt certificate till he complied. But in a later case, Cockerell v. Dickens[26], Lord Wensleydale denied that even the certificate can be properly withheld on this ground. I am therefore of opinion that the deed of the 14th February, 1874, was not effectual to pass any title or interest in the lands of A.G.P. Dodge in Canada, and therefore, I think the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be confirmed.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe first point argued before this Court was one which seems to have been held to be untenable by all the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal, as well as by the Vice-Chancellor. This was the contention, that the jurisdiction of the foreign Bankruptcy Court extended to lands in this country, or that it, at least, imposed upon the bankrupts a personal obligation so to deal with lands here as to bring them under the control of the foreign bankruptcy, an obligation which, upon princi- ples of international comity, it was said, our domestic tribunals would enforce.\nAn almost universal consent of authorities, that of Courts and Judges, as well as of text writers, is against both these propositions. For the proposition that bankruptcy proceedings have any extra-territorial operation as regards immoveables, there is no English or American authority, judicial or otherwise, which can be quoted, though some of the continental jurists\u2014Savigny, in particular, as appears from passages in the 8th volume of his work on Roman Law, translated by Mr. Guthrie\u2014appear to favor such a doctrine, not so much, however, as a principle of international law actually recognized, but rather as one, the adoption of which is commended by a liberal spirit of comity, or which ought to be made the subject of treaty stipulations. The Courts and jurists of no nation appear to have gone so far in excluding the extra-territorial operation of bankruptcy proceedings as those of the United States. They have applied the rule, not merely to immoveables, but also to moveable property having its situs in their territory[27]. In England[28], on the other hand, the more liberal rule has been adopted, of treating moveables as subject to a bankruptcy in the foreign domicile of the owner. The latest American writer on Private International Law[29] states both the rule and the reason for it, thus, distinctly:\nIn the United States the law is, that a foreign bankrupt assignment will not be permitted to transfer property, whether moveable or immoveable, as against domestic attaching creditors. This result is sometimes based on the position that compulsory conveyances in bankruptcy are the creatures of local law, and should not be extra-territorially extended, and sometimes on the priority which every State, in case of collision, should give to its own subjects. But the true ground is, that property, personal as well as real, is subject to the local laws of its site; and if the owner locally incurs obligations on the faith of such property, it is but fair that it should primarily bear the burden of such debt. The forced application of the law of the lex domicilii to such case would operate to extend oppression and fraud.\nThis rule is recognized in the English cases of Selkrig v. Davies[30], and Cockerell v. Dickens[31], cited in the judgment of the learned Vice-Chancellor, and is beyond dispute[32].\nThe other ground adverted to is equally without foundation, for the House of Lords determined in Selkrig v. Davies, already quoted, that English Courts will not interpose to compel a bankrupt to convey his foreign lands to the assignees, although there might be a moral obligation requiring him to do so[33]; and in Cockerell v. Dickens[34] it was held to be improper to compel such a conveyance even by the indirect pressure of withholding the certificate. Mr. Westlake[35] points out that the true ground for non-interference in such cases is, that if the Courts were, by acting on the bankrupt in personam, to compel a conveyance of the foreign immoveables, they would be indirectly doing that which they had no jurisdiction to do directly; and he shews the distinction between interference in such cases and the jurisdiction exercised by Courts of Equity to compel specific performance of contracts relating to foreign lands. I have stated the law on these points more fully than I should otherwise have done, from consideration for the earnest and able arguments of Mr. Cattanach on this part of the case, on which, however, I have to express my entire concurrence with the opinions of all the learned Judges in the Courts below.\nThe learned Vice-Chancellor based his decree upon the effect of the deed of the 14th February, 1874, regarded as a conveyance sufficient to pass these lands, independently of the bankruptcy proceedings. I cannot gather very satisfactorily from the language of the judgment whether the learned Judge considered the deed a good conveyance at law, sufficient to pass the legal estate, or whether he relied on it as operating only in equity, or as a defective conveyance, which a Court of Equity would aid. The only forms of original conveyance appropriate for transferring a legal estate in possession in freehold lands between strangers are, of course, those of feoffment, lease and release, bargain and sale, and a statutory deed of grant.\nThe deed of the 14th February, 1874, cannot operate as a deed of bargain and sale, as no consideration is mentioned in the deed sufficient to raise a use. It cannot take effect as a deed of grant, for the use of the word \u201cgrant\u201d is indispensable to the operation of such a deed; and feoffment and lease and release are both out of the question. It is plain, therefore, that no legal estate passed by the instrument under consideration.\nThe remaining question relates to the Appellant\u2019s rights to invoke the aid of a Court of Equity to perfect the deed, or to have it carried into execution by a legal conveyance. Without stopping to enquire whether the words of description contained in this deed, \u201call their estate and effects,\u201d would, if used in an ordinary purchase deed, be sufficient to pass all the grantor\u2019s lands\u2014a point on which I express no opinion\u2014it appears to me that there are decisive objections to supporting this deed as an efficient instrument in equity. The execution of this indenture was compelled by the order of the District Court, which I have before stated, made on the same day, and which ordered the bankrupts to execute the deed, being the ordinary statutory form of assignment prescribed by the Act of Congress. It is therefore a part of the proceedings in the bankruptcy. Now, in view of the prevalent doctrine of American Courts and jurists already alluded to, that it is a rule of private international jurisprudence, founded on reasonable and sound principles, not to give extra-territorial effect to bankruptcy jurisdiction, it must be assumed that Congress, in passing the Act, did not intend to attach any wider meaning to the general words used, \u201cestate and effects,\u201d than, according to the recognized doctrine of the United States Courts, it had power effectually to do; and that, therefore, immoveables in foreign countries were not intended to be comprised. The order of the Bankrupt Court could only directly affect lands in the United States, and it is not to be presumed that either the legislation of Congress, or the act of the Court, was intended to bring that indirectly within the jurisdiction of the Court which could not be reached by its direct process. There can be no objection here to our putting a construction on this deed by means of which it is sought to affect lands within our jurisdiction. It is no infringment of the rule which requires foreign law to be established as matter of fact by skilled witnesses; for instruments affecting lands must be construed and governed by the law of the situation of such property, and moreover questions of construction, dependent on presumption, are questions of fact rather than questions of law.\nBut granting that it was intended to compel the bankrupts to execute an assignment including lands in Canada, and assuming that the deed of the 14th February, 1874, comprises these lands as effectually as if they had been specifically mentioned in it, I am still of opinion that the assistance of a Court of Equity could not be claimed by the assignee. When the jurisdiction of equity is exercised to enforce specific performance, or to aid or perfect a defective assurance between parties who are strangers in blood, a valuable consideration is an indispensable element in the transaction which is sought to be executed or aided. In the present case there is not only a total absence of valuable consideration, but the deed does not even possess the character of a free disposition, having been executed, as it was, under the compulsion of the process or order of the District Court. Further, if the deed is to be construed, on the hypothesis last assumed, as comprising these lands, a Court of Equity, in giving effect to it, would be doing nothing short of enforcing a foreign bankruptcy; it would be recognizing extra-territorial legislation, and aiding the jurisdiction of a foreign Court against lands in this Province; for, in signing and sealing the indenture, the bankrupts did but submit themselves to the power of the law, and were mere instruments of the Court. To deny to foreign Courts of Bankruptcy direct jurisdiction over property situated here, and at the same time to assist them when they attempt to evade this same rule of law (which they apply to the protection of their own citizens) by compelling the execution of an assignment, is too great an inconsistency to be legally possible. The objection to the direct exercise of such a jurisdiction is equally applicable to its indirect exercise. Mr. Westlake recognizes this position, for he says:\u2014\nBut that a Sovereign should claim to affect foreign land generally through the compulsory intervention of the owner, merely on the ground of such owner\u2019s status, as fixed by his ordinary authority over him, does not differ perceptibly from a claim to affect it directly[36].\nThe refusal to give equitable relief cannot be condemned as harsh or wanting in comity, since reciprocity is the foundation of all comity, and the American Courts themselves would, in a like case, act upon a similar rule. The justice of the rule itself which withholds lands from the operation of foreign bankruptcy in favor of the local creditors, is well stated and defended in the passage already quoted from Dr. Wharton\u2019s work on the conflict of laws.\nThe result is that the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J., concurred.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nDodge et Cie. furent d\u00e9clar\u00e9s en faillite, le 15 novembre 1873, par la cour de district du \u201cSouthern District of New-York,\u201d en vertu de la loi de banque-route des Etats-Unis, qui autorise un tel proc\u00e9d\u00e9. Le 10 novembre suivant, les cr\u00e9anciers d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent d\u2019op\u00e9rer par arrangement la liquidation des affaires des faillis, au lieu de la continuer par le mode compulsoire qu\u2019ils avaient d\u2019abord adopt\u00e9. Ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9[37] consiste \u00e0 substituer au syndic un fid\u00e9icommissaire choisi par les cr\u00e9anciers, et \u00e0 remplacer le contr\u00f4le de la Cour sur les actions du syndic par la surveillance d\u2019un comit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9anciers aussi nomm\u00e9 par eux pour surveiller et diriger les affaires en liquidation. Le fid\u00e9icommissaire et le syndic ont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s les m\u00eames attributions.\nC\u2019est en vertu de cette sec. (5103) que les cr\u00e9anciers firent choix de John L. Cadwalader, comme fid\u00e9icommissaire, et de cinq autres personnes pour composer le comit\u00e9 de surveillance. Un ordre du juge en date du 14 f\u00e9vrier 1874, confirmant leur r\u00e9solution \u00e0 cet effet, enjoignit en m\u00eame temps aux faillis de c\u00e9der et transporter au dit fid\u00e9icommissaire tous leurs biens par un acte dont la formule ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans le jugement est la m\u00eame que celle donn\u00e9e par le Statut. Cette cession fut ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par I\u2019ordre du juge et dans les termes voulus par la loi, par indenture en date du m\u00eame jour, 14 f\u00e9vrier 1874, entre Dodge et ses associ\u00e9s, d\u2019une part,\u2014et le fid\u00e9icommissaire Cadwalader, de l\u2019autre. Cette cession est ainsi con\u00e7ue: \u201cWitnesseth, that the said Anson G.P. Dodge, W.F. Hunt and Samuel Scholefield aforesaid, hereby convey, transfer and deliver all their and each their estate and effects to John L. Cadwalader, as trustee absolutely, to have and to hold the same in the same manner and with the same rights in all respects as the said Anson G.P. Dodge, William Foy Hunt and Samuel Scholefield, or either of them, would have had or held the same if no proceedings in bankruptcy had been taken against them or either of them, &c., &c.\u201d\nPlus tard, le 30 juin 1874, Cadwalader demanda \u00e0 \u00eatre relev\u00e9 de sa charge de fid\u00e9icommissaire et obtint, le 7 d\u00e9cembre 1874, apr\u00e8s avoir accept\u00e9 la cession ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9e, en date du 24 septembre 1874, un ordre \u00e0 cet effet, nommant en m\u00eame temps John J. Macdonald, I\u2019appelant, comme son successeur, lequel re\u00e7ut, le m\u00eame jour de Cadwalader une cession et transport des biens des faillis, au m\u00eame effet que celle faite \u00e0 Cadwalader.\nLe 13 juin 1874, les Intim\u00e9s avaient obtenu jugement dans la Cour du Banc de la Reine, province d\u2019Ontario contre A.P.G. Dodge, l\u2019un des faillis, pour $13,201.61 et $52.57 pour frais; en vertu de ce jugement ils firent \u00e9maner un bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution qui fut remis au sh\u00e9rif de York, le 25 ao\u00fbt de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que le sh\u00e9rif f\u00fbt devenu porteur de ce bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution que Dodge et sa femme firent, le 24 septembre 1874, une autre cession \u00e0 Cadwalader des immeubles situ\u00e9s dans la province d\u2019Ontario, appartenant personnellement au dit Dodge, en les d\u00e9signant d\u2019une mani\u00e8re sp\u00e9ciale et en d\u00e9clarant que bien que le dit fid\u00e9icommissaire en f\u00fbt d\u00e9j\u00e0 saisi en vertu de la cession du 14 novembre 1874, il \u00e9tait cependant devenu n\u00e9cessaire, pour plus grande s\u00fbret\u00e9 (by way of further assurance) et pour se conformer aux lois d\u2019enregistrement de la province d\u2019Ontario, d\u2019en faire cession de nouveau. Cette fois la cession en est faite dans les termes qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les lois d\u2019Ontario, sont n\u00e9cessaires pour transporter la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolue des immeubles, savoir: \u201chath granted, bargained, sold, aliened, demised, released conveyed, assured and confirmed.\u201d\nL\u2019Appelant, comme fid\u00e9icommissaire rempla\u00e7ant Cadwalader, se pr\u00e9tend en cette qualit\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire des biens des faillis en vertu des actes ci-dessus cit\u00e9s, et les r\u00e9clame \u00e0 I\u2019encontre de l\u2019Intim\u00e9 dont il veut faire annuler l\u2019ex\u00e9cution contre les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des faillis situ\u00e9s dans Ontario.\nCes faits soul\u00e8vent la question de savoir si une cession compulsoire en vertu de la loi de faillite des Etats-Unis peut affecter les biens d\u2019un failli situ\u00e9s dans la la province d\u2019Ontario.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s le principe que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e par la loi du lieu o\u00f9 elle est situ\u00e9e, la cession faite en vertu des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s en faillite ne peut avoir d\u2019effet au-del\u00e0 du territoire dans lequel elle est faite. \u201cReal estate is governed by the lex loci rei sit\u0153, and if a bankrupt is entitled to real estate situate abroad, it will not pass to the trustee unless he acquires a title to it by the law of the country where it is situate.\u201d\nSur ce point, il ne peut y avoir de difficult\u00e9; les deux parties sont d\u2019accord sur ce principe. Mais l\u2019Appelant pr\u00e9tend que les termes de l\u2019acte du 14 f\u00e9vrier 1874 sont suffisants pour transf\u00e9rer le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des immeubles de Dodge, sans distinction, et que par cons\u00e9quent ceux situ\u00e9s dans Ontario sont compris dans la cession faite \u00e0 Cadwalader. Comme il est dit plus haut, cet acte du 14 novembre a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par ordre du juge, en vertu de la loi de faillite et ne peut par cons\u00e9quent comprendre que les biens qui peuvent \u00eatre affect\u00e9s par la loi de faillite des Etats-Unis. Les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s situ\u00e9es dans Ontario ne pouvant pas l\u2019\u00eatre n\u2019ont donc pu \u00eatre ainsi transport\u00e9es; elles ne peuvent \u00eatre cens\u00e9es avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9es au moyen d\u2019un acte qui avait pour but restraint et limit\u00e9 de saisir le fid\u00e9icommissaire des biens du failli soumis \u00e0 l\u2019effet de la loi de banqueroute des Etats-Unis. Rien ne fait voir dans cet acte qu\u2019il y e\u00fbt de la part du failli une intention de faire un transport plus ample que celui que le juge pouvait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, lui ordonner de faire.\nLes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Dodge, situ\u00e9es dans Ontario, formant une partie importante de ses biens, si c\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 son intention d\u2019en faire cession, il les aurait sans doute sp\u00e9cialement mentionn\u00e9es. Loin de l\u00e0, quoiqu\u2019il d\u00fbt faire le transport sous serment de n\u2019en rien omettre, on voit qu\u2019il s\u2019est soustrait \u00e0 cette formalit\u00e9 voulue par la loi et ordonn\u00e9e par le juge. Si son but en agissant ainsi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e9gitime, il montre du moins qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de faire plus que la loi ne pouvait lui ordonner, et repousse n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019une intention de comprendre dans sa cession les biens situ\u00e9s en Canada.\nD\u2019ailleurs, cette cession est insuffisante d\u2019apr\u00e8s les lois du Canada pour op\u00e9rer le transport du t\u00eetre de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9elle, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas faite dans les termes particuliers dont l\u2019usage est n\u00e9cessaire pour transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re d\u2019apr\u00e8s les lois de la province d\u2019Ontario \u201cgrant, bargain, sell, &c.\u201d Il est de principe que le transport de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re situ\u00e9e en pays \u00e9tranger doit, pour y avoir effet, \u00eatre fait dans la forme voulue par les lois de ce pays[38].\nNo. 555.\u2014The grounds upon which the exclusive jurisdiction is maintained over immoveable property are the same, upon which the sole right to establish, regulate and control, the transfer, descent and testamentary disposition of it has been admitted by all nations.\nThe inconveniences of an opposite course would be innumerable, and would subject immoveable property to the most destressing conflicts arising from opposite titles, and compel every nation to administer almost all other laws except their own, in the ordinary administration of justice.\nNo. 556.\u2014It is universally admitted and established that the forms of remedies, and the modes of proceeding and the execution of judgments, are to be regulated solely and exclusively by the laws of the place when the action is instituted or as the civilians uniformly express it, according to the lex loci.\nSi l\u2019acte du 14 f\u00e9vrier est valable d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi des Etats-Unis, il ne I\u2019est pas d\u2019apr\u00e8s celle de la Province d\u2019Ontario, comme il doit \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ici, on ne peut invoquer l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de nos tribunaux pour faire mettre \u00e0 effet un transport de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, nul d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi d\u2019Ontario.\nCette difficult\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien sentie par les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es qui ont essay\u00e9 d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier par l\u2019acte du 24 septembre 1874, cit\u00e9 plus haut, dans lequel ils ont fait usage des termes sacramentels qui doivent \u00eatre employ\u00e9s d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi d\u2019Ontario pour transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re.

Parce qu\u2019\u00e9tant fait pour parvenir \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de celui du 14 f\u00e9vrier 1874, il n\u2019est aussi qu\u2019un transport de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re fait en vertu de la loi de faillite, comme le premier auquel il a pour but de rem\u00e9dier; 2o. Parce qu\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait apr\u00e8s la remise entre les mains du sh\u00e9rif de York d\u2019un bref d\u2019ex\u00e9cution dirig\u00e9 contre ces m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, l\u2019Intim\u00e9 avait acquis un privil\u00e8ge qu\u2019un acte post\u00e9rieur de son d\u00e9biteur ne pouvait lui faire perdre.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d\u2019opinion que le jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel d\u2019Ontario renvoyant le bill en chancellerie doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis action was commenced by a bill of complaint in the Equity Court in Ontario, filed on the 18th of May, 1876, in order to obtain a declaration that a writ of execution against the lands of Anson G.P. Dodge, at the suit of the present Respondents, and placed by them in the hands of the Sheriff of the County of York, did not operate to bind lands in that county of the execution debtor. After hearing, a decree was made by Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, in favor of the Appellant, but that decree was reversed by the Court of Appeal, and from the latter judgment it comes by a second appeal to this Court.\nDodge was a member of the firm of Dodge, Hunt and Scholefield, residents respectively of New York, Jersey City and Philadelphia, in the United States of America, and which firm, as shewn by the evidence in this suit, carried on business in several places in that country. The firm became insolvent in 1873, and in the Southern district of New York made an assignment, under \u201cAn Act to establish a uniform system of Bankruptcy throughout the United States,\u201d to one John L. Cadwalader as a trustee for their creditors under that Act. That assignment is dated the 24th February, 1874, and forms part of the evidence herein. Subsequent thereto, on the 26th of August, 1874, the Respondents placed the execution for $13,201.60 debt and $52.57costs, in the Sheriff\u2019s hands, and the same was renewed on the 23rd of August, 1875, and remained in full force in the Sheriff\u2019s hands unsatisfied up to the bringing of this suit.\nDodge, being the owner in fee simple of lands in Ontario bound by the execution and liable to be seized and sold to satisfy it, after the delivery of it to the Sheriff, that is to say, on the 24th September, 1874, made a conveyance by deed to the said John L. Cadwalader, in confirmation, as is alleged, of the previous assignment to him.\nCadwalader resigned his trusteeship on the 30th of June, 1874, and by course of law, which we may assume to be valid under the evidence, the Appellant was, on the 7th December, 1874, appointed trustee in place of Cadwalader\u2014and the latter, by indenture bearing date the 25th of January, 1875, conveyed the said lands to the Appellant, as such trustee, in trust for the creditors of the said bankrupt firm. This deed was registered on the 27th April, 1875. On the part of the Appellant it is contended that the general assignment to Cadwalader covered and conveyed the lands of Dodge in question, but if not, that the subsequent deed to him from Dodge will operate as a confirmation of the assignment and relate back to the date of the latter, so as to have precedence of the execution at the suit of the Respondent company.\nI have considered all the binding authorities as to both propositions, and can find none to sustain them. A general assignment, under the bankruptcy laws of the United States, cannot affect or cover lands in this country, although, as to moveable property, the law may be different. An assignment in bankruptcy in another country will not affect lands in the United States\u2014neither will it in England. No reason has been given why we should hold differently here. The rule seems firmly established that in a contract concerning real or immovable property the law rei sit\u0153, and not that of the place of contract, should prevail. By the law here the assignment can have no operation merely as one made in bankruptcy in the United States. A general assignment under our own bankrupt laws would be good, but it is so only by Statute which does not apply to the former. Independently therefore of that question, is the first assignment valid between the parties to it so as to cover the lands? or, if it should be so declared, how, under the registry law, could it affect the execution in the Sheriff\u2019s hands. By the law of Ontario the placing of the execution in the Sheriff\u2019s hands with directions to levy bound the lands of Dodge in the County of York. At that time there was no registry of any incumbrance thereon, the first conveyance to Cadwalader not having been registered, but that unrecorded assignment might, if a good conveyance, affect the rights of the Respondents under the execution. Suppose Dodge had given a deed bon\u00e2 fide, with every requisite necessary to a perfect conveyance, but it was never registered, as at present advised, I should say the execution claim would be affected by that deed, under the provision of sec. 7 of the Statutes of Canada of 1861, chap. 41, which provides that when no memorial of a deed is registered it should be deemed effectual according to the priority of time of execution. The execution only authorizes the sale of the interest of Dodge at the time it was placed in the Sheriff\u2019s hands. The previous assignment therefore, if valid, would leave no interest in Dodge to be sold under the execution. In this way, then, I think that, under the law of Ontario and the registry Acts, the assignment, if a valid one, would intervene to render the levy under the execution void. The decision of the case depends, in my judgment, altogether on the validity of the assignment.\nRegistry is not necessary to the validity of a conveyance of land in Ontario. Neither can a judgment creditor since 1861, secure a lien upon lands by registry; he can only make his judgment available by a levy upon, and sale of, the debtors lands. By the late registry Act of 1868, I think a judgment might be registered, but that Act (sec. 64) makes a previous unregistered instrument void only as against a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for valuable consideration and therefore it would be of little benefit to register a judgment. As respects the first conveyance to Cadwalader, the registry Acts were not utilized; and the execution in the Sheriff\u2019s hands bound the property as against the debtor, but the previous unregistered conveyance, if valid in other respects, would prevail against it by the terms of section seven, before mentioned. Be that, however, as it may, the main question is, as I before stated, as to the validity of the conveyance of the lands, by the assignment as between the parties irrespective of the question of bankruptcy although unregistered. I am inclined to agree with the learned Vice-Chancellor that the trust expressed in the assignment was a sufficient consideration; and the question as to the extent of the trust beyond the right of the trustee to hold the lands to be subsequently \u201capplied and administered for the benefit of the creditors,\u201d does not here arise.\nThe assignment does not mention lands\u2014the words are \u201chereby convey, transfer and deliver all and each of their estate and effects.\u201d \u201cEstate\u201d in law, in regard to its use in conveyances, is properly defined to mean a property which one possesses, especially property in land. It is also understood as defining the nature and quantity of interests in lands, &c. In the conveyance under consideration, I think it may be fairly construed to mean and include, not only personal property, but lands; if, in other respects, the instrument is valid. \u201cEffects\u201d could not properly include lands; it means \u201cresults,\u201d \u201cconsequences\u201d; but is often applied to \u201cgoods,\u201d \u201cmovables,\u201d \u201cpersonal estate.\u201d There is no localization, however, in reference to the lands; no description, in a word, of the \u201cestate\u201d in the document in question. There is no pointing to anything by which the lands could in any way be ascertained\u2014nothing to shew the intention of the grantor as to the lands to be conveyed\u2014nothing to which the maxim quoted by the learned Vice-Chancellor, id certum est quod certum reddi potest, can be applied. In all his citations from 4 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 269, pl. 55, there are reference to localities and other means of ascertaining the lands intended to be conveyed as to \u201call that the estate in the tenure of J.S.,\u201d or \u201call that estate which descended to the grantor from J.S.,\u201d or \u201call the grantors lands in the Co. of B.\u201d In each of the three cases, there is given a reference limiting the inquiry and pointing to the mode of making it. In the present case there is no reference (and the deed itself must contain it) to anything to which the maxim could be applied. A deed may refer to other documents, or to matters in pais, to define the land intended to be conveyed, but it must either describe the lands so as by itself to indicate them, or contain references to something else by which the description, not being sufficient in itself, may be made so. I consider, therefore, the absence of any reference of the kind mentioned is fatal to the validity of the assignment as a conveyance of Dodge\u2019s interest in the lands in question. The title to the lands being in Dodge when the execution was delivered to the Sheriff, I consider they became thereby bound, and the subsequent deed to Cadwalader conveyed only subject to the lien of the execution. It is argued that, as the latter is but such a confirmation as a Court of Equity would enjoin Dodge to give of his previous assignment, the lien by the execution was subject to the equitable right of the Appellant. I know of no legal or equitable doctrine to sustain that proposition. Independently of the doubt that I entertain that the equity courts of this Dominion would necessarily be required to enjoin Dodge to make such a confirmation under the circumstances and nature of the assignment in bankruptcy in a foreign country, no Court of Equity could, or would, enjoin him to make such a confirmation when the lien under the execution intervened. Each of the two conveyances must in this suit stand upon its own legal merits. The first, I consider defective for the reasons given, and the second is, I think, inoperative against the previous lien by the execution.\nI think, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs and judgment entered in favor of the Respondents.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellant: Crooks, Kingsmill & Cattanach.\nSollicitors for Respondents: McCarthy, Boys & Pepler.\n[1] 3 Grant\u2019s E. & A. 215.\n[2] L.R. 1 P.C. 64.\n[3] 6 DeG.

Appellants\u2019 Agent solicited and prevailed on T.S. to insure his premises with the Appellants. Previously he had examined the premises to be insured, and on the 22nd of April, 1874, T.S. signed the application which C.M. had caused to be filled up, and upon the back of which was a diagram purporting to represent the exact situation of the building in relation to adjoining buildings. T.S. stated at the time of signing the application, that the distances put down in the diagram were not accurate. C.M. promised he would go to the property and make an accurate measurement of the distances. By one of the conditions of the policy it was provided that if an agent should fill up the application, he should be deemed to be the agent for that purpose of the insured and not of the company, but the company will be responsible for all surveys made by their agents personally.\nHeld,\u2014Affirming the judgment of the Court of Error and Appeal, that with respect to the survey, description and diagram the assured was dealing with C.M., not as his agent, but as the agent of the company, and that therefore any inaccuracy, omissions or errors therein were those of the agent of the company, acting within the scope of his deputed authority, and not of the insured.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Error and Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas[2].\nThis was an action on a policy tried before Patterson, J., and a jury, at Barrie, at the Spring Assizes of 1876.\nOn the 22nd of April, 1874, the Respondent signed an application upon one of the Appellants\u2019 blanks for an insurance on fixed and moveable machinery contained in a grist mill, $2,000, annexed to which, or endorsed thereon, was a diagram purporting to represent the exact situation of the said mill in relation to adjoining buildings. The application and diagram represented that the saw mill was distant from the grist mill 140 feet, whereas it was only 110, and also other buildings as 100 feet, whereas they were not over 60 feet. The Respondent paid to Charles Morris, the company\u2019s agent, $45 for the premium of insurance of the property mentioned in the application and received an interim receipt.\nBy one of the conditions of the policy it was provided that if an agent should fill up the application he should be deemed to be the agent for that purpose of the insured, and not of the company; \u201cbut the company will be responsible for all surveys made by their agents personally.\u201d In this case Morris, who had, a few days prior to the 22nd of April, 1874, examined the premises with a view of effecting an insurance, filled in the application. The Respondent, thinking that the distances stated in the said diagram were not, or might not be strictly accurate, and that the same might possibly in other respects be imperfect, drew the attention of the said Morris thereto, before and at the time of his (the Respondent\u2019s) signing the said application. Morris alleged that it was sufficiently accurate; that any inaccuracies, if there were any, were of no consequence, and that, at all events, he would go to the property and make an accurate admeasurement of the distances, and, if necessary, correct any errors in the said application or diagram before sending it forward to the Board of Directors of the Appellants.\nThe agent, in forwarding the application to the head office, wrote them in reference to the risk, but such letter was not produced at the trial. Upon the back of the application, underneath the diagram, is the following:\u2014\nThe agent is particularly requested to answer the following questions (inter alia).\nQ. Have you personally examined the premises? A. Yes.\nShortly thereafter the Respondent received a policy from the Appellants, but which was re\u2011delivered to the agent, who got it as he said, for the purpose of making some change therein. The premises were subsequently destroyed by fire, on the evening of the twenty-first and the morning of the twenty-second day of July, 1874, of which the Respondent gave notice to the Appellants on the 26th of the said month of July, in the same manner that he had given notice of the insurance in the Citizens\u2019 Insurance Company, with whom he was also insured.\nTo the notification of the Respondent\u2019s loss, the Appellants replied, on the 29th of the same month, inform- ing him that they had arranged with the Inspector of the Gore District Mutual Insurance Company, who had a concurrent risk on the grist mill, to adjust his loss.\nMorris afterwards, and as promised by the said Inspector, handed to the Respondent\u2019s Solicitor the forms of application to be used by him in making the usual proof of claim, and the same were used accordingly, and, having been duly sworn and certified to, were, on the sixth day of August following, forwarded by post, in the same manner that all the notices and papers had been forwarded and given to the Appellants, and they were, in fact, duly received.\nNo objection was ever made to the form of the claim papers, nor was it contended that they did not contain all that the Respondent was bound to put therein, but on the 11th day of November, more than three months after the claim papers had been received, the Appellants, in answer to a demand for payment of the loss, answered, without objecting in any way to the form of the claim papers, that they had placed the matter in the hands of the Gore Mutual Insurance Company for adjustment, and they would, in all probability, concur in any settlement that company might make.\nNo further communication having been made, the Respondent commenced his action on the seventeenth day of February following the happening of his loss.\nThe declaration contained one count on the policy, to which the Defendants pleaded several grounds of objection.\nThe special replications and rejoinders raised the question on which this appeal was decided, viz.:\u2014\nWhether the company had not assumed a direct responsibility for the acts of their agent, Morris, in reference to surveys, and, if so, whether a notice to and knowledge by him as to the position of the adjoining buildings were binding on the company. Mr. George D. Dickson, for Appellants:\u2014\nThe question is one of contract. The Appellants contend that they are free to make such contracts for insurance as may be agreed upon, subject to such conditions, restrictions and stipulations as their governing body may impose, and the insured agree to, and that when a contract has been reduced into writing, verbal evidence is not allowed to be given of what passed between the parties, so as to add or subtract from, or in any manner vary or qualify, the written contract, Goss v. Lord Nugent[3]; Woolam v. Hearn[4]; Forsyth v. Boyle[5]; Mason v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.[6]; Mason v. Scott[7]; Jones v. Victoria Graving Dock Company[8]; Direct U. S. Cable Company v. Anglo American Telegraph Co.[9]; Shannon v. The Gore Ins. Co.[10]\nIn the construction of a contract, the general intent to be gathered from the writing is to prevail, regard being had to the clear intent of the parties rather than to any particular words used Pollock on Contracts[11]; Southwell v Bowditch[12]; Smith v. Hughes[13]. In the application it is specially provided that \u201ca special survey must be filled by the applicant on all mill and factory risks,\u201d and one of the conditions of the policy is:\u2014\nThat if an agent of this company fill up an application for insurance therein, such agent shall be considered as acting for the Applicant, and not for this company, and no verbal or written statements of the said agent to the contrary shall be received in evidence, but the company will be responsible for all surveys made by their agents personally.\nI take it, then, looking at the whole contract, that the intention of the parties was that the insured should be responsible for any errors in the description in the annexed diagrams, and that he is estopped from saying it is not his. Pickard v. Sears[14]; Cornish v. Abington[15]; Hammersley v. DeBiel[16]; Beattie v. Lord Ebury[17]; Thomas v. Brown[18].\nThen, did the agent make the survey within the meaning of the words of the policy? It is evident, by the terms of the application, that the survey for which the company, by the policy, agrees to be responsible is not applicable to mill risks; and, moreover, what constitutes a survey, according to all authorities, is something more and quite different from looking all round the place, making no measurements, and this several days before the application was made, and before the applicant had made up his mind to insure with Appellants. See Rowe v. The London and Lancashire Ins. Co.[19]; Denny v. Conway[20]; Bunyon on Fire Insurance[21], and authorities cited in the judgment of Harrison, C.J., in court below.\nIn this case, the Respondent knew the application and diagram, misrepresented the facts and risk, and trusted to his friend to correct the same. This was not done, and the company cannot be held to have accepted the risk otherwise than as disclosed by the application.\nThe policy, also, was voided by reason of the further insurance, notice thereof not having been received by the company. McCann v. The Waterloo County Fire Ins. Co.[22]\nAnother point on which Appellants rely is, that the non-compliance with the requirements of the contract as to the certificate being given by the most contiguous Magistrate or Notary Public, accompanied by an affi- davit as required, voids the policy. Lampkin v. The Western Assurance Co.[23]; Davis v. The Canada Farmers\u2019 Mutual Fire. Ins. Co.[24]\nUnder 36 Vic, c. 44, sec. 36 O. the company had no power to contract except under seal, signed by the President and Vice-President, and countersigned by the Secretary. The written contract could only be altered in writing by the company, under seal, and no agent could vary a written contract by parol evidence.\nMr. Dalton McCarthy, Q.C, and Mr. H.H. Strathy for Respondent:\u2014\nAs to the condition requiring the Respondent to furnish a certificate \u201cunder the hand of the Magistrate or Notary Public most contiguous to the place of fire,\u201d it is an unjust and unreasonable condition, and was properly so found by the Judge at Nisi Prius, and his ruling is right, and ought to be sustained. See 36. Vic., c. 44, s. 33, O.; Imperial Act, 17 & 18 Vic., c. 31, s. 7; Rooth v. The North-Eastern Railway[25].\nThe objections as to the form of the claim papers, and as to the preliminary proofs, were not taken at the trial, but, even if they were, the Appellants, having supplied the forms for the Respondent through their agent, cannot be heard to contend that they are not in the proper form; the Appellants are, in fact, estopped. These conditions are voidable, and the case of Armstrong v. Turquand[26] shews that they can waive their right by mere acquiescence, and we have more than that here. See also, Webb v. The Commissioners of Herne Bay[27]; Best\u2019s Evidence[28].\nThe questions arising under the 7th and 8th pleas are, in effect, whether the finding of the jury upon the alleged misrepresentations in the application should be disturbed or not.\nThe alleged misrepresentations, as to the nature and situation of the risk, and as to the value of the insured premises, are said to have been contained in the written application for insurance. But the said application for insurance was not produced, but is alleged to have been lost, and the Appellants, being allowed to give secondary evidence thereof, endeavored to establish that a certain paper, which they put in, was a true copy thereof; the jury, however, in answer to the first, second, fifth and sixth questions put to them by the learned Judge before whom the case was tried, in effect, found that the said paper was not a true copy of the application. Such finding is supported by the evidence, and, if correct, disposes of all the grounds of alleged misrepresentation.\nThe alleged misrepresentations or errors are not in the application, but in the diagram thereon endorsed, and there is no clause in the policy avoiding it for errors or mistakes in the diagrams. \u201cIt is for erroneous representation,\u201d or for omitting \u201cto make known any fact material to the risk\u201d in the \u201capplication,\u201d that the policy is declared to be void.\nAs to the alleged misrepresentations of the nature and situation of the risk, the Appellants\u2019 agent, having himself made an examination and survey of the premises before the insurance was effected, knew, or must be taken to have known, whether the nature and position of the risk, proposed for insurance in the Appellants\u2019 Company, was correctly described, and the Appellants, possessing such knowledge, (for they must be taken to have known all their agent knew\u2014all, at any rate, acquired in the discharge of his duty as their agent) cannot rely, as a ground of defence to the Respondent\u2019s claim, on any inaccuracies or misstatements in the application or diagram as misrepresentations. The agent of the Appellants, having made a survey and examination of the insured premises prior to the acceptance by him of the risk, and having caused the Respondent\u2019s application for insurance to be filled up in the form in which it was, and having promised to correct any errors that may have been therein, the Appellants cannot set up the mistakes (if any) therein as misrepresentations to avoid the contract of insurance.\nBut, even under the terms of the policy, it is declared that \u201cthe company (the Appellants) will be responsible for all surveys made by their agents personally.\u201d And the said Morris did personally make a survey of the insured premises and agreed to correct the diagram that was made, if it required correction, by making another and more accurate survey, all of which was within the scope of his authority.\nOwing to the non-production of the letter that the said Morris, as agent of the Appellants, sent to his principals, and on which, as well as on the application, the insurance policy seems to have been made out, it cannot be safely assumed, much less established, that the said Morris did not do as he agreed.\nThe application, survey and diagram are not so described or made part of the policy as to constitute their contents warranties; a mere reference to them is not sufficient for the purpose. If there is a doubt about the words, the Court will interpret them not as a warranty but as a mere representation. All that is declared in the application is that \u201cthe descriptions in the annexed diagram are true and complete in all particulars,\u201d which certainly does not necessarily or reasonably imply or import that the diagram showed, accurately or particularly, more than a description of the proposed risk, possibly the dimensions, etc., of the building in which the property to be insured was situate. See Lothian v. Henderson[29]; Parsons v. Watson[30]; Stokes v. Cox[31]; Budd v. Fairmaner[32]; Scanlon v. Scales[33]; Turley v. North American Ins. Co.[34]; Bunyon on Fire Insurance[35]; Hide v. Bruce[36]; Davis v. Scottish Provincial Ins. Co.[37]; Hopkins v. Provincial Ins. Co.[38]; In re. Universal Non\u2011tariff Fire Ins. Co.[39]\nThe proof of there being a double insurance was on the Appellants, and it was not established, nor was it admitted or conceded at the trial. The Secretary of the company was a witness in the case and was not questioned. On application for a new trial, there was no affidavit that the notice had not been received. The presumption of fact is in favor of the Respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by RITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nCharles Morris was Defendant\u2019s local agent, and, as such, solicited risks, received applications, transmitted them, received premiums, granted interim receipts, and appears to have been and acted as Defendant\u2019s agent in all particulars connected with insurance, save only in the matter of filling up applications, when, and when only, it would seem he was to be considered as acting for the assured.\nGalt, J., in his judgment says:\u2014\nThe seventh ground, on which, in fact, the defence really rested, remains to be considered. That objection is, that the situation of the insured premises, as respects adjoining buildings, was not properly described in the application. It is beyond question that the diagram on the back of the copy of the application produced at the trial does not show correctly the position of the premises, but the Plaintiff, by his replication to the seventh and eighth pleas, says \u201cthat the insurance was effected by the Plaintiff with the local agent of the Defendants, having authority to solicit risks and to inspect premises offered or proposed or about to be insured by the Defendants, and to make out applications, receive premiums, and effect interim insurances;\u201d and the Plaintiff says that the said agent personally inspected the property insured, and was fully aware of the position of the building containing the same, and its contiguity to other buildings; and the said agent afterwards made out the said application, or caused the same to be made out; and the Plaintiff says that the same was signed by him at the instance and procurement of the said agent, and upon the undertaking of the said agent that he would amend the same by inserting in the said application the distance of any building within one hundred feet from the building containing the property insured, before forwarding the said application to the head office of the Defendants, and the Plaintiff, relying on the said application, completed the effecting of the said insurance, by paying the premium to the said agent, and took from him an interim receipt effecting the said insurance of the said property against loss until the policy should be issued by the Defendants; but the said agent neglected to amend the said application by inserting therein the fact that there was a building within the distance of one hundred feet from the building containing the property insured, of which the Plaintiff had no notice or knowledge until after the happening of the loss in the declaration mentioned, and the Defendants did not make or raise any objection to the contiguity of any other building, or to the same not being mentioned or referred to in the said application; and the Plaintiff further says that there was no fraud or fraudulent misrepresentations on his part in reference to the matters herein pleaded to.\nThe clause in the policy is this:\u2014\nThat if an agent of this company fill up an application for insurance therein, such agent shall be considered as acting for the applicant and not for the company, and no verbal or written statement of the said agent to the contrary shall be received in evidence, but the company will be responsible for all surveys made by their agents personally.\nUpon the back of the application, underneath the diagram, is the following:\u2014\nThe agent is particularly requested to answer the following questions (inter alia):-\nHave you personally examined the premises?\u2014Yes. Are there any other circumstances connected with danger of fire to the property proposed for insurance?\u2014No.\nIt is, therefore, true that, so far as the application is concerned, the Plaintiff was contracting, through his agent, with the Defendants, through their agent, though one and the same person. But, with respect to the survey, description and diagram, the assured was dealing with Morris, not as his agent, but as the agent of the company. The company are not, I think, to be released or excused from consequences resulting from the carelessness or want of skill of their agent in a matter within the scope of his deputed authority, because he is also employed by the assured in another portion of the same transaction. If the company had not assumed a direct responsibility for the acts of their agent in reference to surveys, the case might possibly be in a different position. It is clear that the error, if any, in the description or diagram did not occur by or through the default, negligence or mistake of the assured, who appears to have acted throughout with the most perfect good faith, and to have furnished to the agent of the company every opportunity of examining and surveying the premises, and of testing and correcting his description and diagram before transmitting it to the company. He never, in fact, assumed the false representation or the responsibility of it, he never put it forward, but, on the contrary, when put forward by the company\u2019s agent, he repudiated it, calling attention to the inaccuracies of the agent\u2019s description and diagram, and pointing out minutely the particulars in which they were incorrect. He never authorized the transmission of anything but a correct description and diagram; he was guilty of no concealment, and he in no way directly or indirectly, by himself or in collusion with the agent of the company, attempted to obtain from the Defendants an insurance upon false represen- tations. If the difficulty in this case has arisen by or through the default, negligence or mistake of the agent of the insurers, I think it cannot be disputed that the policy would be valid. The insurance was pressed on Plaintiff by the agent of the company authorized to obtain insurances for the company, and when so pressed to insure, Morris, the agent, was taken through the grist mill and all round the place, and after that undertook to make out, with the assistance of an amanuensis selected by himself, the application; this he did as Plaintiff\u2019s agent\u2014if adopted by him. But as regards the diagram and description, he must, I think, be considered as the company\u2019s agent, that being within the scope of his deputed authority, and he having inspected and examined the premises, or, in other words, surveyed them\u2014and for which the company must be responsible. The meaning of the word \u201csurvey,\u201d as applicable to this subject matter, as given in the imperial dictionary is \u201cto examine with reference to condition, situation and value, as to survey a building, to determine its value and exposure to loss by fire.\u201d The agent appears to have adhered, notwithstanding the objections of the assured, to the description and diagram; the assured signed the application with the description the agent had put forward in the application and diagram which must be assumed to have been the result of his examination and enquiries, the agent, at the same time, stating that he would go again to the premises and measure and alter the paper to suit the measurements. This account of the transaction the jury have found to be correct. Now, the company having undertaken to be responsible for all surveys made by their agents personally, how then can they escape responsibility for an inaccurate examination or survey by their agent Morris, or an inaccurate description and diagram of that examination or survey prepared by him, this being a matter unquestionably within the scope of his agency. Who but the company is to be responsible for his not making a more accurate examination and survey in the first instance, or for his not making the resurvey and measurements as he promised, or for not correcting the description and diagram before transmission to the company, as the assured desired and he agreed to do, and as it was his duty to the company to do, or for not furnishing the company with the information the assured gave him as to the inaccuracy of his description and diagram, and which, being connected with what was clearly within the scope of his agency, must have the same effect as if communicated directly to the company, the knowledge of the agent in such a case being the knowledge of the company, or, in other words, in such a case notice to the agent being notice to the principal; or for transmitting contrary to the evident wish of the assured an incorrect description and diagram, he being for the purpose of transmission the agent of the company, but who, on the contrary, transmitted the documents with his certificate or written assertion that he had personally examined, that is surveyed the premises, and that there were not any other circumstances connected with danger of fire. Surely under such circumstances the Plaintiff had a right to rely on Defendants\u2019 agent\u2019s assertion that he would transmit a correct description, and I think the survey and diagram must be considered the survey and diagram furnished by the agent of the company, and made part of the application by him, and for which the company, through him, are responsible; and so establishing their agent\u2019s description, diagram and assertion as the basis of the contract, which they cannot now dispute, it operating to estop the Defendants from disputing its correctness; for if the Defendants are responsible for the surveys of their agent, and for the information of the agent in respect thereof as being the information of the company, it would be a gross fraud in Defendants to receive through their agent a premium with the intention of avoiding the insurance in case of loss, and retaining the premiums in case no loss should occur.\nSo long ago as 1815 Lord Eldon, in the House of Lords, recognized that while it is a first principle of the law of insurance that, in the case of a warranty, the thing must be exactly as it is represented to be, it would be an effectual answer, even in the case of a warranty, that the insured were misled by the insurers or their agents; Newcastle Fire Ins. Co. v. Macmoran[40]; and, in Hartford Protection Ins. Co. v. Harmer[41], Ramsay, J., referring to this case, says Stephens, in his Nisi Prius,[42] says:\u2014\nUpon the authority of Newcastle Insurance Company v. Macmoran[43], it seems that, even in case of warranty, it would be a good answer that the mistake or misrepresentation was to be attributed solely to the insurers themselves or their agent; and finally, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in the case of Bruner v. Howard Fire Insurance Company\u2014determined during the present year, and not yet reported\u2014has decided that parol evidence is admissible to show that the description of property insured, annexed to a policy, though signed by the insured, was drawn up by the agents of the insurer; that they knew all about the property from verbal description by the insured and from actual survey, and that, therefore, omissions and errors therein were those of such agents, and not of the insured, notwithstanding a provision in the policy that the description should be taken as part thereof, and as a warranty on the part of the insured. 2 Am. Law Reg. 510.\nIn the case of Peoria Marine and Fire Ins. Co. v. Hall[44], it is stated:\u2014\nBut the counsel for the Plaintiff in error insists that the printed conditions were notice to the assured of the agent\u2019s want of authority to assent to the keeping of gunpowder, &c., and that this assent could be given only by the company itself. This, at first view, would seem plausible, and might be sound but for another principle which lies back of it and defeats its application. The principle to which we allude is, that notice to the agent is notice to his principal. The company must be regarded as knowing what he knew. If he knew that powder was kept at the time of the insurance, or to be kept during its continuance, the company must be regarded as having known it also. They had power to waive the condition; and by taking the premium and issuing the policy with such notice or knowledge, they must be regarded as having waived the condition which prohibited its keeping. It would be a gross fraud in the company to receive the premium for issuing a policy on which they did not intend to be liable, and which they intended to treat as void in case of loss.\nAnd In re Universal Non Tariff Fire Ins. Co.[45] the same principle is put forward; the marginal note is:\u2014\nA fire insurance was effected in respect of certain property through an agent named Donald, who inspected the premises. One condition of the policy was, that any material mis-description of the property would render the policy void. The buildings were described as built of brick and slated, but it turned out that one of the buildings was not roofed with slate, but with tarred felt. The company alleged that Donald was not their agent, but the agent of the insured and that the mis-description rendered the policy void.\nHeld,\u2014That the mis-description was immaterial, and not sufficient to vitiate the policy; but that, if material, it was made by Donald as the agent of the insurance company, and the insured were not responsible for it.\nAs in Wing v. Harvey[46], it was held that the company having held out L. & S. to the world as their agents for the purpose of receiving the premiums, it became the duty of L. & S., and not that of the Plaintiff, to communicate to the head office at Norwich the circumstances under which those premiums had been paid to and received by them, and the representations which were made on the occasions of such payments and receipts. So here, the Plaintiff having held out to the world Morris as their agent to obtain insurances, trans- mit applications, receive premiums, and make personal surveys, it became the duty of Morris, and not of Plaintiff, to communicate to the company all the circumstances connected with the description and diagram and the transmission of the application.\nI by no means wish to be understood as intimating that if this application had been signed by Plaintiff, and placed in the agent\u2019s hands as containing a correct description, simply to be transmitted as Plaintiff\u2019s act, independent of any personal survey or examination made by the agent, or description thereof furnished by him, that, in such a case, knowledge by the agent that it was not correct would be evidence of a waiver by Defendants of the condition that a misrepresentation in the application should avoid the policy, because, in such a case, the agent would be acting simply as the transmitter of that for which the assured alone was responsible, though it is not necessary to discuss or determine this point.\nThere were two or three minor points suggested, but scarcely relied on, viz.: As to the notice of additional assurance; and as to the preliminary proof. We think there is nothing in either of these objections that was not disposed of by the finding of the Jury; and, as to the objection that the certificate of the magistrate most contiguous was not furnished, we agree with the Court below that this was an unreasonable condition.\nSTRONG, TASCHEREAU, FOURNIER and HENRY, J.J., concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellants: George D.

In the Respondent\u2019s application, which had been signed in blank and delivered to the person through whose instrumentality the policy was effected, it was stated that there were no incumbrances on the property, although there were several mortgages. It was also proved that after the issuing of the policy the Respondents effected a further incumbrance on the land, but did not notify Defendants. The policy was made subject to 36 Vic., c. 44, O., The proviso (since repealed by 39 Vic., c. 7,) to sec. 36, declared, \u201cThat the concealment of any incumbrances on the insured property, or on the land on which it may be situate * * shall render the policy void, and no claim for loss shall be recoverable thereunder, unless the Board of Directors shall see fit in their discretion to waive the defect.\u201d\nOne of the conditions of the policy provided that the policy should be made void by the omission to make known any fact material to the risk.\nOn an action upon the policy, the Court of Common Pleas[1] refused to set aside the verdict in favor of the Appellants, but on appeal to the Court of Error and Appeal for Ontario[2], it was held that the policy was divisible and that Respondents were entitled to recover the insurance on the stock. Held\u2014On Appeal, that the contract of insurance on the building and on the stock was entire and indivisible, and that the misrepresentations as to incumbrances, by the conditions of the policy as well as by the 36 sec. of 36 Vic., c. 44, O., rendered the policy wholly void.\nTHIS was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, making absolute a rule nisi to enter a verdict for the Respondents for two thousand dollars, being insurance on goods.\nThe action was commenced on the 3rd day of November, 1875, upon a policy of insurance issued by the Appellants to the Respondents, bearing date the 16th of December, 1874, on their property to the amount of three thousand dollars, as follows, viz.: $1,000 on the building only of their wooden furniture manufactory; $2,000 on their stock of lumber and materials, and furniture manufactured and in process of manufacture contained in said building.\nThe declaration contained four counts on the policy and the common counts. The pleas were:\u2014\n1st. One denying the making of the policy.\n2nd. That the real estate was encumbered, and that in the application it was alleged to be unencumbered.\n3rd. Concealment of the fact of encumbrances.\n4th. As to so much of the counts as relate to the insurance on the building; that after the making of the policy, the Respondents transferred the said building, by mortgage, to Robert Davies, and gave no notice of such transfer to the Appellants.\n5th. Sets up the same defence in a different way; and the\n6th. Never indebted to the common counts.\nThe Respondents replied, taking issue on the first plea, and, to the second plea, 1st. That they did not, in their application, state there were no encumbrances on the property, as in that plea alleged. 2nd. That the policy was not issued on the application in that plea mentioned.\n3rd. That the section of 36 Vic., Chapter 44, of the Statutes of Ontario, referred to in the pleadings, does not affect the policy as to the goods insured and the risk thereon.\n4th. That the application was made through an agent of the Appellants, and that before the application the Respondent informed him of the encumbrances, and that the misrepresentations were by him.\nIssue was taken on the replication, and the Defendants rejoined that provision in the policy that if an agent of the company should fill up an application, he, in doing so, should be considered as acting for the applicant, and not for the Respondents. The cause was tried before Chief Justice Hagarty, in March, 1876, and a verdict given for the Appellants. Leave was, however, given to move for a rule to enter a judgment for the Respondents for $3,000 and interest, and shortly after a rule nisi was granted in pursuance of such leave, on the following grounds:\u2014\n1st. That there was no evidence that the Appellants had ever elected to avoid the policy for any cause.\n2nd. That the evidence established that the only application made by the Respondents was in blank; that there was no concealment therein of encumbrances; that the policy was issued without the Respondents knowing that any one had represented the absence of encumbrances, and that the agency of Rosenblatt had terminated before he signed the application, and that he was then the agent of the Appellant and of Griffith, and not of the Plaintiff.\n3rd. That no representations were made by the Respondents, but by Griffith\u2014not their agent, but the agent of the Appellants. 4th. That Griffith signed the application without any authority from Samo.\n5th. That the replication proved there were no misrepresentations made by Respondents, and that they were not answerable for acts of Griffith.\n6th. That the condition that the agent of the Appellants shall be deemed the agent of the Respondents is unreasonable and unjust.\n7th. That the policy was divisible; and therefore only void as to the insurance on the factory, and not on the goods therein contained.\nThe Court of Common Pleas refused to set the verdict aside. The Plaintiffs then appealed from the decision of the Court of Common Pleas to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, which held that the policy was divisible, and that Plaintiffs were entitled to receive the amount of the risk, taken in and by the policy on the stock of lumber and furniture.\nThe material portions of the evidence are set forth in the judgments. The question to be determined on this appeal was, whether or not the policy in question is a divisible policy; whether it is void in the whole, or only in part, viz.:\u2014Void as to the insurance on the wooden manufactory, and good as to the stock of lumber and materials, and furniture manufactured and in process of manufacture?\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., and Mr. C.A. Durand, for Appellants.\nOne of the covenants of the policy is that, \u201cif the title of the property be transferred or changed without written permission, the policy shall thenceforth be void.\u201d Under Sec. 36 of the Statute, 36 Vic., c. 44, O., it is the policy, that is, the whole policy, which is made void in the event of there being any false statement in the application respecting the title or ownership, or his circumstances, or the concealment of any encumbrances on the insured property or the land on which it may be situate. It is admitted that there was a misrepresentation as to encumbrances on the land, the application stating that there were none, the land at the time being mortgaged to over $4,000. The insurance in this case was an entire insurance for $3,000, for which one rate was fixed and paid. The conditions of the policy apply equally to real and personal property: it cannot be argued that such a policy is divisible.\nBy the terms of the contract, \u201cthe policy,\u201d that is, the whole policy (not a part of it, as held by the majority of the Judges in the Court of Appeal) became void if the assured made any erroneous representations in the application, or if the assured was not the sole and unconditional owner of the property, unless the true title were therein expressed:\u2014Gottsman v. Pennsylvania Ins. Co.[3]; Barnes v. The Union Mutual[4]; Gould v. The York County Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[5]; Lovejoy v. The Augusta Mutual Ins. Co.[6]; Wilson v. The Herkimer County Ins. Co.[7]; Bowman v. The Franklin Ass. Co.[8]; Hinman v. The Hartford Fire Ins. Co.[9]; Lee v. The Howard Ins. Co.[10]; Friesmuth v. Agawam M.F. Ins. Co.[11]\nThe only American case opposed to this view is that of Ph\u0153nix Ins Co. v. Lawrence et al.[12]\nThe case of Date v. The Gore District Mutual Ins. Co.[13] was under a different section of the Act. It is opposed to Ramsay Cloth Co. v. Mutual Ins. Co. of Johnstown[14]; and to Russ v. The Clinton Mutual Ins. Co.[15]; Kerby v. Niagara[16]; and to Bleakely v. The Niagara District[17]. Moreover it is proved that subsequent to the policy being effected, the insured effected a further encumbrance on the property, and never notified the company. The learned counsel referred also to Cashman v. London & Liverpool Ins. Co.[18]; Flanders on the law of fire insurance[19]; Bunyon, law of life insurance[20]; Angell, law of fire and life insurance[21]; and Phillipp\u2019s law of insurance[22].\nMr. Read, Q.C., for Respondents.\nThe application was for two insurances in one policy: 1st, for the building for which a special rate of 5 p. cent. was fixed; and 2nd, for the stock for which a special rate of 5 p. cent. was also fixed. It makes no difference that the rate should be the same. This rate was subsequently changed to 6\u00bd p. c., and it applies equally to the personal and real property.\nThe Appellants by their replications have made this case dependant upon the construction of 36 Vic., c. 44, O.\nThe true construction of the 36. Sec. of 36 Vic., Cap. 44, O., which enacts that in case a fraudulent representation, or any false statement respecting the title or ownership of the applicant or his circumstances, or the concealment of any incumbrances on the insured property, or on the land on which it may be situate, or the failure to notify the company of any change in the title or ownership of the insured property, and to obtain the written assent of the company thereto, shall render the policy void, is that where a policy, as in this case, is for a cash premium, and in the application, a distinct premium is charged for the risk on the building and on the goods, that the policy is void as to the buildings only, where any of the defects referred to exist as to the buildings, and not as to the goods or personal property; and void only as to the goods and personal property insured where the defects exist only in reference thereto, and not to the buildings insured.\nThe 36th Sec. of 36 Vic., Cap. 44, says that the policy shall be void, in case any of the defects therein referred to exist as to the \u201cinsured property,\u201d and not as to the \u201cinsured property or any part thereof,\u201d to make the policy void the defects, or some of them, must exist as to all the insured property mentioned in the policy, and not to a part thereof only.\nThe policy in question, however, was a divisible policy, and only void as to the factory, and not as to the furniture, goods, or other personal property: Ph\u00e6nix Insurance Co. v. Lawrence et al[23]; Clark v. New England M.F. Insurance Co.[24]; French v. Chemango Co. Mutual Insurance Co.[25]; Barnes v. Union Mutual Fire Insurance Co.[26]; Gould v. York County Mutual Fire Insurance Co.[27]; Burrill v. Chemango Mutual Insurance Co.[28]; Kuntz v. Niagara District Insurance Co.[29]; Date v. Gore District M.F. Insurance Co.[30]\nMost of the American cases holding a policy is indivisible are cases in which there has been a premium note for which the company had a lien on the property, and do not apply.\nThe policy in this case, and the construction thereof, is not to be governed by the law as applied to whole or entire and divisible contracts without reference to legislative enactments, but must be governed by the legislative enactments referred to therein, and the ap- plication therefor, and the construction to be placed thereon.\nEven under the Law of Contracts, there is nothing to prevent this contract being a divisible contract, but on the contrary, the application for the contract and the contract itself show that it was intended to be divisible, and the words thereof do not necessarily make it indivisible. Doran v. Reed[31]: Held, that notwithstanding the Consolidated Statutes of U.C. Cap. 85, Sec. 7, of which provides:\u2014\u201cIf any such deed (one-third of married woman) be not executed, acknowledged, and certified as aforesaid, the same shall not be valid or have any effect,\u201d the deed is good as to husband\u2019s interest\u2014in other words, partly good and partly bad. Rose v. Scott[32]; chattel mortgage, held good in part and bad in part.\nAs to the defence set up by the Appellants in their second plea, viz.:\u2014That the existence of the undisclosed mortgages was a circumstance material to the risk, and to be known to the Appellants, and setting up the failure to disclose them, as a breach of the agreement in the application for insurance, the Respondents submit, that the existence of an encumbrance on the building was not a material fact or circumstance, in regard to the condition, situation, value or risk of the property, nor was there any evidence at the trial that the failure to disclose such encumbrances was material to the risk, Lindenan v. Desborough[33]; Jones v. Provincial Ins. Co.[34]\nMr. Bethune, Q.C, in reply:\u2014\nThe Appellants did not only plead the Statute. By the evidence it will be seen that the answers given by the applicant relate to the risk, and not to two risks, and moreover, when the rate was increased, it was agreed to lump the risk at 6\u00bd cent.\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nDefendants insured Plaintiffs \u201cin consideration of the receipt of $195, to the amount of $3,000 for the term of one year, ending at noon on 18th Nov., 1875, as follows, viz: $1,000 on the building only of their wooden furniture manufactory, situate on Yonge Street, in Yorkville, $2,000 on their stock of lumber and materials and furniture manufactured and in process of manufacture contained in said building.\u201d It is admitted there was a misrepresentation as to encumbrances which would invalidate the policy as to the building, but it is contended on Plaintiff\u2019s behalf that the contract of insurance is not entire, but divisible, the insurance on the building being, it is alleged, separate and distinct from that on the furniture contained in the building, and that consequently any encumbrance on the building could affect and render void only that portion of the contract applicable to the building, and had no reference to the insurance on the furniture, which, notwithstanding the encumbrance on the building, was valid. But, I am not able so to construe this instrument. The words of the Statute of 36 sec. 36 Vic., Cap. 44, endorsed on the policy, enact that any false statement respecting the title or ownership of the applicant or his circumstances, or the concealment of any encumbrance on the insured property, or on the land on which it may be situate, or the failure to notify the company of any change in the title or ownership of the insured property, and to obtain the written consent of the company, shall render the policy void, and that the concealment of any circumstances on the insured property or the land on which it may be situate, renders the policy void. But entirely independent of the Statute, the application set forth:\u2014\nApplication of J.H. Samo & Co., of Toronto, County of York, for insurance against loss or damage by fire, by the Gore District Mutual Fire Insurance Company, in the sum of $3,000 for the term of one year, commencing the eighteenth day of November, 1874, at noon, on the property, as follows:\u2014On a furniture manufactory two stories high, 50 x 25, built of wood, covered with shingles; present cash value, exclusive of land, amount to be insured \u2154 value, $1,000. Rate, 5 per cent.\nOn stock of lumber and materials, and furniture manufactured and in process of manufacture, contained in above building, covered with shingles, marked No. on diagram, said building owned by assured, present cash value, exclusive of land, $8,000; amount to be insured, $2,000. Rate, 5 per cent.\nThe said applicant makes the following statement and gives the following answers to interrogations here put, relating to the risk:\u2014\n1. Where is the property to be insured situate? On Yonge street, Village of Yorkville.\n2. Name of owner of property to be insured? J.H. Samo and company.\n3. By whom and for what purpose is the building occupied? By us as a furniture manufactory.\n29. What other insurance is there at present on the property? $2,000.\n30. In what companies? Guardian.\n31. What is your interest in the property to be insured? Owners.\n33. Is property encumbered, and, if so, to what amount? None.\n* * *\nAnd the said applicant hereby covenants and agrees to and with the said company that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation, value and risks of the property to be insured, so far as the same are known to the applicant, and are material to the risk, and material to be known by the company, and agrees and consents that the same be held to form the basis of the liability of the said company, and shall form a part and be a condition of this insurance contract.\nSignature of applicant,\nJ.H. SAMO & Co.,\nper T.B.G.\nDated 18th November, 1874.\nBy the policy, it was covenanted:\u2014 It is covenanted and agreed that the interest of the assured herein is not assignable without the consent of said company in writing; and if the title of the property be transferred or changed other than by succession, by reason of death, or the policy be assigned without written permission hereon, this policy shall thenceforth be void; and that the application of the assured upon which this insurance is granted, the survey and diagram of the premises and all things therein contained shall be taken and considered a part and portion of this policy; and that no insurance shall be binding until payment of the premium by cash or note. * * * * That if the assured in the application referred to herein make any erroneous representation or omit to make known any fact material to the risk, or if the assured shall have effected or shall hereafter effect any other insurance on the property hereby insured, or if the risk be increased by any means within the knowledge of the assured without the consent of this company endorsed thereon, or if the assured is not the sole and unconditional owner of the property insured unless the true title be expressed herein, * * * * then, and in every such case this policy shall be void. * * * * That if any agent of this company fill up an application for insurance therein, such agent shall be considered as acting for the applicant and not for this company, and no verbal or written statement of the said agent to the contrary shall be received in evidence, but this company will be responsible for all surveys made by their agents personally.\nHaving a due regard to the terms of this policy and the subject matter of the contract, I think it was an entire agreement to insure the house and its contents in consideration of the gross sum of $195, made up, no doubt, as proposed in the application for the insurance. The consideration is stated in the policy as entire on the one side for all Defendants undertook to do, on the other, the distribution of the risk being simply to limit the extent of the risk assumed by Defendants on each kind of property; in all other respects the contract was entire.\nA remark of Bramwell, B., in Harris v. Venables[35]; where one question was whether the consideration applied to both promises, and it was held it did, seems very apposite to this case. He says:\u2014 All that is to be done on one side is the consideration, for all that is to be done on the other; all the promises are referred to all the considerations.\nSo here, in consideration of an entire sum on one side, the Defendants assumed all the risks on the other.\nThe character and situation of the building is a prominent consideration in every contract of insurance, and is equally important, whether the policy covers personal property in the building or the building itself. No distinction is indicated in this policy in respect to the character and situation of the building between insurance on personal and on real property, or to indicate in any way that the condition relied on by Defendants refers exclusively to applications for insurance upon buildings. It is equally sensible and intelligible when applied to personal property as to real property, and when applied to personal property in the building as in reference to the building itself; for no one can doubt that if the building takes fire the property in the building is jeopardized. It has been argued that it would necessarily follow that the same rule would be applicable to two descriptions of insurance having no connection whatever with each other, as for instance, on personal property in one city and on a house in another, included in one policy; but this by no means follows. It cannot be doubted, there may be separate insurances in the same policy as there may be separate causes of action, totally distinct from each other, arising upon the same instrument for which an action might be brought on each of them. When questions, such as have been suggested arise, they will have to be decided on the language of the policy, having due regard to the subject matter. In Hopkins v. Prescott[36]; at p. 591, Wilde, C.J., says:\u2014\nNo doubt, you may put two distinct and independent contracts upon one piece of paper, but here the consideration alleged is an entire one.\nAnd in delivering judgment, he says:\u2014\nThe declaration sets out an agreement; and one question is, whether it sets out an agreement, which is single and entire, made on one entire consideration, or whether is it severable in its nature, and deals with matters that are unconnected with and independent of each other. It seems to me that the matter alleged in the declaration amounts to one entire agreement, which may very well be, although the contract be to perform several distinct things.\nThe authorities in Ontario are, so far as I can judge, in entire accord with the view here put forward, as are those in the United States. All the cases, both in Ontario and the United States, have been so fully put forward and discussed in the Courts below that it is unnecessary to occupy the time of this Court in going through them again. The Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick, in Cashman v. L. & L. Fire Ins. Co.[37], acted on the same principle. There the Plaintiffs insured two buildings and the merchandize in one of them against loss by fire; one of the conditions of the policy declared that if there should be any fraud or false swearing, the claimant should forfeit all claim under the policy. One ground of defence to an action brought on the policy was that the Plaintiff made a false declaration as to the value of the goods lost by the fire. Held, that the contract was entire, and if the Plaintiff was guilty of fraud or false statement in reference to the goods he could not recover any part of the insurance.\nTherefore, on principle and authority, to use the words of Wilde, C.J., in the case before cited, \u201cLooking at this agreement, it appears to me, that it is one entire and indivisible contract, founded upon one entire consideration,\u201d and relates to matters that are connected with and dependant on each other. STRONG, TASCHEREAU and FOURNIER, J.J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nThe rule nisi for leave to enter judgment for Respondents was discharged by the unanimous decision of the Court of Common Pleas, and, on an appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, the decision of the Court of Common Pleas was, by a majority of the Court, reversed; and it is now before us, by a second appeal, and, having been heard, we have now to give judgment. The defence is substantially as to the misrepresentations in the application as to the then existing encumbrances, and the subsequent mortgage to Davies, or, in case they were not the misrepresentations of the Respondents, that their application omitted to make known facts material to the risk. I do not consider it necessary to say much in regard to the question of the agency of Rosenblatt to bind the Respondents as to his acts in regard to the application, as, in the event of a decision that he was not such agent, the Respondents will be found to occupy an equally unfavorable position, for, the section of the Statute incorporated into and forming part of the agreement provides, amongst other things,\nThat the concealment of any encumbrance on the insured property, or on the land on which it may be situated, or the failure to notify the company of any change in the title or ownership of the insured property, and to obtain the written consent of the company thereto, shall render the policy void, and no claim for loss shall be recoverable thereunder unless the Board of Directors, in their discretion, shall see fit to waive the defect.\nMr. Samo, in his evidence, admits the agency of Rosenblatt to procure the insurance. He says:\u2014\nI gave Rosenblatt a blank form, partly filled. The questions in it were not answered or filled up.\nAgain:\u2014\nThe question in the paper as to encumbrances was not answered by me. It was to oblige Rosenblatt that I dealt with him instead of going to the company\u2019s office. I thought Rosenblatt would fill up the blanks. I intended trusting him with signing the application, having done the like before. I did not ask Rosenblatt to show me the application, not thinking it necessary. The mortgage (to Davies) was dated 28th April, 1875, and was for $525. It was on the factory.\nThe policy in this case was made and delivered to the Respondents in December, 1874. The fire did not take place till the following July. It was for over six months in the hands, for inspection, of the Respondents, and, after having signed a blank application, their duty was to read it, and there they would have seen their own covenant and agreement, that if they were not the sole and unconditional owners of the property insured, unless the true title be expressed herein, the policy should be void. Their duty was clearly to have read the policy, and given notice for and send the necessary amendment made or the policy cancelled before loss. If they did not accept the policy as it was, they did not accept it at all, and, therefore, have no action on it. From this evidence, I think the agency of Rosenblatt, to make an application binding on the Respondents, cannot be questioned, and that for his misrepresentations the Respondents are answerable. See Richardson v. Maine Ins. Co.[38], where the assured applied by mail to the agent for insurance. The agent filled up and signed an application, which contained a statement that there were no encumbrances. A policy was issued referring to the application, and accepted, with the application attached to the policy. Held\u20141st. That by accepting the policy the assured covenanted for the truth of the application, and ratified it. 2nd. That the representation as to the property was material; and lastly, that the contract was entire, and a misrepresentation as to one of the subjects insured avoided the policy. If, by the acts of an agent, one or other of two innocent parties must suffer, the law says it must be the one whose agent he was, provided the acts complained come within the scope of his agency, or was in reference to a matter the agent had authority to deal with. I think that in this case the Respondents are responsible for the acts of Rosenblatt, including that of getting Griffith to put their names to the application. In addition to the defence raised on the \u201cconcealment\u201d referred to it in the Statute, which is virtually a re-enactment of the common law on the point, I think we must hold the Respondents answerable for the misrepresentations in the application.\nThat they are false is admitted; and, therefore, in respect of the building, there can be no doubt they are fatal to the success of the Respondents.\nThe same may be said of the consequences of the subsequent assigment to Davies. There can be no question, that, under the terms of the policy and section 36 of the Act before mentioned, \u201cthe failure to notify the company\u201d of the transfer to Davies being a \u201cchange in the title or ownership of the insured property, and to obtain the written consent of the company thereto,\u201d rendered \u201cthe policy void.\u201d That provision of the statute is incorporated into and became a part of the agreement for the insurers, the Respondents independently of the other legal principles involved, having adopted it as a condition precedent to their right to recover on the policy, are estopped from denying its application, and cannot ask the Court to pronounce, what they would, for other reasons, be disinclined to do; and which, by the terms of the section in question, which itself makes the provision for the notice \u201cand written consent of the company,\u201d it would be prevented from doing, that the requirement, either of the notice or of the written consent is unreasonable or unjust.\nIt is contended, however, that these objections cannot be raised against the claim for loss on the goods, although a good one, as to the claim for the loss on the building, and that, therefore, the Respondents are entitled to recover for the loss on the goods.\nTo determine that question, we must first examine the policy and see the nature of the agreement entered into. By it the Appellants \u201cin consideration of the receipt of one hundred and ninety-five dollars, do insure J.H. Samo & Co., of the City of Toronto, * * * to the amount of three thousand dollars for the term of one year * * * as follows, viz: $1,000 on the building only, of their wooden furniture manufactory, and * * * $2,000 on their stock of lumber and materials and furniture manufactured, and in process of manufacture, contained in same building.\u201d The goods, therefore, and the building are insured for one lump consideration. It is one agreement; and the Respondents covenant in respect to the insurance generally, that if the title of the property be transferred or changed, other than by succession by reason of death, without written permission thereon, or that if the application referred to therein make any erroneous representation or omit to make known any fact material to the risk, or if the assured is not the sole and unconditional owner of the property insured, unless the true title be expressed therein, that the policy should be void. The consequence therefore, the policy being legally construed, of the misrepresentation &c., was settled by it, and, being the agreement of the parties themselves, is binding on them; and by it the whole policy is void. Both parties agree by the incorporation of the statute that in any of the cases mentioned the policy, not the insurance on the building, shall be void. There are few, if any, cases that suggest an opposite construction; but not only in Upper Canada, but in the United States the ruling authorities are the other way, and properly so, as I think. The contract contained no provision that the risk should continue on that part in reference to which no misrepresentation was made, but it was entire, and the risk to cease and the policy to be avoided altogether. It is matter of no small moment that the insurers, in the case of the application for insurance on goods, should be correctly informed in regard to the building containing them. If a party says, \u201cI want to insure on goods in my store, which is a valuable one, totally unencumbered, and there is no \u201cconcealment by me of any encumbrance\u201d on the property sought to be insured, \u201cor on the lands on which it is situated\u201d; and, upon this application, the risk is taken, we have to say, whether or not under the provision of the thirty-sixth section and the written misrepresentations, the policy would be avoided; if, at the time, the building containing the goods, and the land on which they both were at the time of the application, either did not belong at all to the applicant or were heavily encumbered by mortgages. In the statute and in the policy adopting them, the words are \u201cthe insured property or on the land on which it may be situate.\u201d The word \u201cproperty\u201d in the first part of the quotation, includes goods as well as buildings. The words are general and include goods, unless there is something elsewhere to induce a different construction. And, I think, we may construe the Statute and policy, as saying in substance, that if there be any concealment of encumbrances on the land of any building in which goods are insured, it will be sufficient to avoid the policy on the latter. There are good reasons why the insured should be truthfully informed as to the state of the ownership of a building. If unencumbered, more care is reasonably expected on the part of the owner. If it be a rented building, or one in which the applicant has little or no interest, and his stock be fairly covered, the personal inducements to care and caution are absent. In such a case, truly represented, the insured would have the option of declining the risk or demanding a higher premium. By a false representation of a different state of things the insured would be entrapped and a policy obtained that he would not otherwise have granted at all, or granted only upon different terms. In representations for insurance, where the knowledge of certain things resides wholly or principally with the applicant, the law requires the truest and fullest statements; and when they are not so in respect of important matters, the policy is always avoided. There is not the slightest suspicion of fraud on the part of the Respondents in this case; but were we to decide this matter in their favor, the door would be opened to fraud which might be difficult of proof, and, as I think, legal principles, founded in justice and equity, violated.\nThere is no more reasonable or necessary requirement than that where one party is induced to enter into a contract with another, the latter is required to give bon\u00e2 fide and intelligible information in regard to material matters of which the other is ignorant, and in no case is the rule more necessary than in applications for insurance. If in the administration of justice that rule be neglected or slighted, insurance companies could not safely do business; and those who would be careful and truthful applicants, would be made to suffer for the careless and untruthful. It is necessary, therefore, that rules so salutary should be maintained, not only in the interest of insurance companies, but in that of the public. Carelessness and recklessness often mark the conduct of applicants for insurance, and the aid of Courts are constantly invoked to release them from the necessary results; and sometimes with undeserved success. In no class of cases have the legal principles in regard to contracts been more strained than in respect of careless applicants for insurance. Experience has shown insurance companies, that certain precautions and guards are necessary for the prevention of fraud and consequent loss. They guard against such by the terms provided in the application and policy. The law gives them the right to dictate the terms and conditions upon which they will issue a policy, and the right to say afterwards, that by the terms of the mutual agreement their liability was at an end and the policy avoided. The Respondents here, by representing that the building in question was theirs and unencumbered may have, by that means, induced the company to accept the risk on the goods contained in it, when they otherwise would not have done so. And by making an application for the joint insurance, and warranting that the representations are all true, the insurers may well say, \u201cwe took and accepted the two risks together at a rate less than we would have taken either separately, or we would otherwise have declined the risk altogether. The whole position on that point affected, in our view, the safety of the goods and by your misrepresentations in regard to the building, we insured the goods which we otherwise would not have done; and you, having in that respect deceived us, either innocently or otherwise, we disclaim the contract as a whole.\u201d\nWe have been asked to say, that the words in question may be read so as to avoid the insurance on the building only, but, my reply is, that the parties themselves have agreed that the \u201cpolicy,\u201d not the insurance or any part of it, should be avoided; and all the governing principles and authorities sustaining this view, I am unable to substitute a new or different agreement from that entered into by the parties themselves.\nThe authorities cited by my learned brother Ritchie, I need not repeat. I think, therefore, the appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Appeal Court of Ontario reversed, and the rule nisi for a judgment for the Respondents discharged with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellants: C.A.

He resided on the West half of said lot with his sons, and occasionally assisted in working the whole lot, until his death, which occurred in 1857. In 1847-8, while his son Adam was working the East half, and in possession, James Gray devised it to him by will, and the land was known as \u201cOur Adam\u2019s.\u201d In 1857, James Gray made a second will, in which he said: \u201cI give and devise to my son John Gray, his heirs and assigns, &c., to have and to hold the premises above described to the said John Gray, his heirs and assigns forever. But if my said son John should die without leaving any issue of his body lawfully begotten, or the children of such issue surviving him, then in such case I will and devise the said, &c., to my son Thomas Gray, his heirs and assigns, to have and to hold the same at the death of the said John Gray.\u201d\nAfter the father\u2019s death Adam remained in possession, and in 1862 he accepted a conveyance with full covenants for title from John. On 15th September, 1868, Adam conveyed to A. McC., one of the Respondents, and R., the other Respondent, claimed title under A. McC. as landlord. In 1874, John died without leaving any lawful issue, and on 5th May, 1875, Thomas (Appellant) brought ejectment against Respondents, but neither at the trial nor in term was any question raised as to the effect of John\u2019s deed.\nHeld,\u2014That James Gray, the father, at the time of his death had acquired a title to the lot by length of possession. That, under the will, John Gray took an estate in fee, with an executory devise over to Thomas Gray, in the event that happened of John Gray dying without leaving lawful issue.\n2. That Adam, having recognized, in 1862, John\u2019s interest in the land by purchasing from him, by deed of bargain and sale, a limited and contingent estate, its effect was to stop the running of the Statute, and the Respondents cannot set up Adam\u2019s possession under John to defeat the contingent estate.\n3. That the Court of Appeal could not refuse to entertain the question as to the effect of John\u2019s deed, although not raised at the trial nor in term.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], declaring that the rule nisi for a new trial in the Court of Common Pleas be made absolute. This was an action of ejectment to recover possession of E. \u00bd of lot No. 13, and broken part thereof in 1st Concession of the Township of East Hawesbury.\nThe action was commenced on the 5th January, 1875, and was tried before Galt, J., without a jury.\nThe Plaintiff, Thomas Gray, claimed title as devisee under the last will of James Gray, dated 30th January, 1857. The Defendant, William Richford, besides denying the Plaintiffs title, asserted title in Andrew McCon- nell, under whom he claimed as tenant by virtue of a demise for terms of years, dated 24th March, 1870.\nAndrew McConnell, having appeared as landlord, besides denying Plaintiff\u2019s title, asserted title in himself as having been possessed thereof by himself and those through whom he claims for a period of twenty years before action commenced, and also claimed title by deeds of conveyance from John Gray to Adam Gray, dated 31st March, 1862, and from Adam Gray, dated 20th June, 1862, 26th April, 1858, and 15th September, 1868.\nAt the trial the Plaintiff claimed and sought to establish by evidence that James Gray entered into possession of the land in question in November, 1830, and continued in possession until his death, in August, 1857.\nAbout 1847-8 Adam Gray entered into possession of the east half, with the permission of his father. On the 10th October, 1848, James Gray, by will, devised the said east half to Adam, his son, with the words: \u201cThis considered to become in force after the decease of my wife and myself.\u201d\nOn the 30th of January, 1857, James Gray, by another will, devised in fee the said east half to John Gray, his eldest son, subject to an executory devise over to Thomas Gray, in fee, on the death of John, without leaving issue, which event happened in September, 1874, the words used being:\u2014\u201c1st. I give and devise to my son John Gray, his heirs and assigns, that tract or parcel of land and premises situate in the Township of East Hawkesbury, in the said County of Prescott, being composed of the east half of Lot number thirteen, in the First Concession of the said Township, including the broken front thereof, together with all the hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging, or in anywise appertaining, to have and to hold the premises above described to the said John Gray, his heirs and assigns forever. But, if my said son John should die without leaving any issue of his body lawfully begotten, or the children of such issue surviving him, then and in such case I will and devise the said above mentioned premises, with the appurtenances, to my son Thomas Gray, his heirs and assigns, to have and to hold the same, at the death of the said John Gray, to my said son Thomas, his heirs and assigns, forever; subject, however, to this condition, that in case my wife Janette should survive me, then whoever of my said son John, his issue, the children of his issue, or of my said son Thomas, or his heirs, shall then be the owner of the said above mentioned premises, by virtue of this my last will and testament, shall support, clothe and maintain my said wife Janette in a comfortable and respectable manner, suitable to her age and condition in life; and should they neglect or refuse to do so, then I will and devise the above mentioned premises, with the appurtenances, unto my said wife Janette, her heirs and assigns, to have and to hold the same from the time of neglecting or refusing to support, clothe and maintain my said wife, as aforesaid, unto my said wife, her heirs and assigns, forever.\u201d Both wills were registered; the first on the 22nd Oct., 1857, and the second on the 20th August, 1858.\nThe other documents relied on by the parties were the following:\u2014\nDeed of bargain and sale and quit claim, Adam Gray to Andrew McConnell, dated 26th April, 1858, 50 acres clear, E. \u00bd lot 13.\nBond, Adam Gray and William McAllister to Andrew McConnell, \u00a3140, for payment whereof Adam Gray mortgages middle lot, after reduction of the superficial extent of 66 acres sold this day to Andrew McConnell, according to form of law of Lower Canada, providing \u201cif title held good from Adam Gray and wife,\u201d said bond to be void, signed at St. Andrews, in the Seigniory of Argenteuil, on 17th October, 1859.\nDeed, of bargain and sale, John Gray to Adam Gray, dated 31st March, 1862.\nDeed, by way of mortgage, Adam Gray to A. McConnell, dated 20th June, 1862, E. \u00bd lot 13.\nDeed of bargain and sale, Adam Gray to Andrew McConnell, dated 15th September, 1868, E. \u00bd lot 13, and broken front.\nEvidence was also given as to Adam Gray\u2019s and James Gray\u2019s possession, and the value of the improvements, extracts of which evidence are given at length in the judgments of their lordships.\nNo question was raised at the trial nor in term as to the effect of John\u2019s deed.\nThe learned Judge at the trial found that the testator had acquired title to the lot by length of possession, and on that ground rendered a verdict for the Plaintiff.\nThe Defendants in the following Term moved to set aside the verdict on the ground that the Plaintiff had not shown a paper title to the land, but had sought to establish a title by statute of limitations in testator James Gray, which title was not made out. The Plaintiff showed cause to this rule, claiming that he had shown the testator to have acquired title by 20 years\u2019 possession. No other point or question was raised on the argument of the rule.\nThe Court of Common Pleas gave judgment[2] in favor of the Defendants\u2014they made the rule absolute to set aside the verdict and enter it for the Defendants.\nThe Plaintiff then appealed to the Court of Appeal, for Ontario. That Court acquiesced in the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Common Pleas on the question of possession, but were equally divided in opinion upon the effect of John\u2019s deed, raised in that Court for the first time. The appeal was thereupon dismissed, and the Plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court.\nMr. James Bethune, Q.C., for Appellant:\u2014\nThe Appellant claimed title under the will of James Gray. The evidence establishes the fact that James Gray, the father of the Appellant, and of Adam Gray, under whom the Respondents claim, was the owner of the land in question, and went into possession of it in November, 1830, and that it was used by the whole family in common for some years. In 1848, Adam took possession of the lot under James Gray, and until his father\u2019s death in 1857, was a tenant at will and could not dispute his title Doe Johnson v. Baytup[3]. In 1857, James Gray devised by will the property to John Gray, his eldest son, and the Appellant submits that this case depends very much on the construction of this will. It is contended on the part of the Appellant that the title which John Gray got under the will was a fee, with an executory devise over in favor of Thomas Gray. Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[4] is express on the point.\nIn 1862, Adam Gray accepted a conveyance from John Gray, and signed the deed of the 31st March, 1862. His possession thenceforward was under the title which John Gray acquired under his father\u2019s will, and he could not afterwards set up title against the Appellant any more than could John.\nThe Plaintiff\u2019s title was saved by the statute, as he could bring no action until the death of John. See James v. Salter[5]; Day v. Day[6]; Brown on the Statute of Limitations as to real property[7]; Coke on Littellon[8]. Other cases, Persse v. Persse[9]; Kernag- han v. McNally[10]; and more particularly Board v. Board[11], show beyond doubt, when a person has entered under a will, it does not belong to him to set up an adverse title.\nMr. Stephen Richards, Q.C., for Respondents:\nThe only question raised on the trial was, whether the Appellant had made out title in James Gray (the testator) by 20 years possession. If, as is contended by Respondents, they have failed to do this, the Appellant cannot be allowed to raise in appeal that he showed a possession of the land by the testator previous to Adam Gray\u2019s possession, and that such possesion is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of ownership, entitling him to recover.\nIf intended to be relied on, the Plaintiff should have raised the point at the trial: had he done so, the Defendant might have shown as the fact was, that the testator had not the legal title. Stephens v. Allen[12]; Jones v. Duff[13]; Armstrong v. Bowes[14]; Donnelly v. Rawden[15]; Doe v. Needs[16].\nPrevious possession is not itself a title, but at most merely raises a presumption of title; if the other facts of the case rebut the presumption it will not prevail. Doe Carter v. Bernard[17]; Henderson v. Munson[18]; Wallbridge v. Gilmour[19].\nMoreover, the Defendants are not estopped from showing that testator had not the legal title. It was intended the land should be Adam\u2019s. The testator abandoned all possession of it to him, and treated it as his. Adam took possession of it, cleared, built and made the improvements on it, and in equity and good conscience it was his. The Plaintiff disclosed at the trial what he claimed was testator\u2019s title (namely, a title by statute of limitations) and that having proved defective, it is not to be presumed, in face of what he alleged and set up, that there was any other title. Doe Woodhouse v. Powell[20].\nThere is not sufficient evidence of possession by testator to warrant presumption of title in him as against Adam\u2019s possession, which was actual and real. Shaver v. Jamieson[21]; Wallbridge v. Gilmour[22].\nPrevious possession is said to be evidence of title as against a wrong-doer: Taylor on evidence[23]; but neither Adam Gray nor Defendants can be considered as wrong-doers.\nAs to the Appellant\u2019s contention, that Adam had not possession for 20 years when the deed of 31st March, 1862, was made by John Gray to him, and that the statute ceased to run from that date, and did not commence again until John\u2019s death, on 14th September, 1874, I submit that the Plaintiff cannot be allowed now to raise this question, not having raised it at the trial. Had it been raised there the Defendant\u2019s might have shown in answer to it that John had not, and did not claim to have, title under the will, but under a deed which he had acquired from William Forsyth for the whole of Lot No. 13, dated 9th April, 1860, or might have met it by other evidence showing under what circumstances the deed from John was made and accepted\u2014or might have shown more clearly that Adam\u2019s possession extended back to more than 20 years before the deed from John was given. But Adam Gray did not enter under the deed of 31st March, 1862, from John Gray, nor was his possession held under that deed, nor did that deed prevent the operation of the statute during any part of the time he or Defendant McConnell had possession. The mere taking of a deed, as Chief Justice Harrison says, for value from a person out of possession and claiming under a will, by a person who held independently of the will, should not be deemed such a recognition of the title of the testator as to estop the person accepting the deed from afterwards showing that the right of entry now set up accrued more than twenty years before action, and is now extinguished.\nThe Respondent further contends that the right construction of the will of James Gray, gives a fee tail to John Gray, and as tenant in tail he could convey the whole estate. Cons. Stats. U.C., c. 83.\nThe words \u201cwithout issue\u201d are to be read \u201cwithout issue generally.\u201d\nThere is nothing in the will to show that the testator intended to use the words \u201cshould die without leaving any lawful issue,\u201d in a sense different from their ordinary and legal construction of an indefinite failure of issue.\nThe learned Counsel referred to, 2 Jarman on Wills[24]; Doe d. Cadogan v. Ewart[25]; Doe d. Todd v. Duesbury[26]; Bamford v. Lord[27]; Walter v. Drew[28]; Broadhurst v. Morris[29]; and more especially to Peyton v. Lambert[30]; Jones v. Ryan[31].\nMr. Bethune, Q.C., in reply.\nUpon the point of the construction of the will, see Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[32]; and Finch v. Lane[33]. It was testator\u2019s clear intention that Thomas should succeed personally at death, if latter died without children or grand children, for we find the following words \u201cor the children of such issue surviving him.\u201d The charge is to be a burthen upon the estate in whosoever hands it should go.\nThe following authorities were also cited as to the effect of John\u2019s deed and James Gray\u2019s possession:\u2014\nBigelow on Estoppel, 359-381; Glynn v. George[34]; Orr v. Orr[35]; Smith v. Smith[36]; Hyde v. Baldwin[37].\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nThe Plaintiff\u2019s evidence in this case shows that James Gray went into possession of this lot on November 30, at which time Adam, his son, was between 13 and 14 years of age; that James Gray worked on the lot, but never lived on it, and that Adam worked with his father both before and after he was married; that they \u201cwere using it, pretty much all together; that James Gray had the control of it, what he said was to be done had to be done;\u201d that his sons never disputed his authority; that he was working on the lot a few days before he died; that for a number of years the father and the sons all worked together; that after James Gray\u2019s death McConnell got control of it; that Adam, while McCallum was assessor, was assessed for lot, though not living on it, the assessor says: \u201cbecause he asked me to do so.\u201d McCallum was first assessor in 1833, and was so 13 years. That Adam moved on lot, long before his father\u2019s death.\nThat McCallum drew Jas. Gray\u2019s will, dated October, 1848; that Adam was living on W. \u00bd when will was made; that Adam had a house, barn and sheds on the lot, lived on it for a good many years, for 1\u00bd or 2 years, and when he left that Adam, McConnell, or his tenants, have lived on it ever since; that Adam was living on the lot before the last will of Jas. Gray, 30th January, 1857, was made, that Adam had been living on the lot and in the receipt of the rents and profits to his own use before his father\u2019s death; that the last years Adam was carrying on work on the lot, he had a house, barn, sheds, stables, and a stock of cattle on the lot of his own, and the crops were put in his barn.\nThe evidence for the defence of Jas. Scott shows that Adam built his house and barn on the lot in \u201847 or \u201848; that the crops were taken to the west half until he had his own barn built; that he had often heard Jas. Gray say the E. \u00bd was \u201cour Adam\u2019s;\u201d that Adam did statute labor of lot. And by H. Bradford, that he knew lot since \u201846, that Adam Gray was in possession of it, for he got wood off it by his permission. Jas. Gray sent him to Adam and he made the bargain with him in \u201846, but on cross-examination he says the old man was the owner of the land.\nThe evidence of William Gray shows that Adam was in possession of lot from \u201845 to \u201860; that his father, brother, Andrew and himself were all working together on both E. \u00bd and W. \u00bd; but he says: \u201cnotwithstanding we all worked together, each had his own 100 acres. Adam would get the crop off the E. \u00bd. John off the W. \u00bd. Thomas had 100 acres of lot 14, and Andrew also 100 acres of lot 14; my father paid for the land.\u201d And, on cross-examination, that John, Adam, and the old man were working pretty much all together; up to the old man\u2019s death, they had to do as the old man ordered them. \u201cMy father gave me a deed, gave John a deed, he gave Thomas a deed and Andrew a deed. He kept the E. \u00bd half for himself;\u201d and, on re\u2011examination, he says: \u201cI got my deed in \u201845 or \u201846; we got them all at the same time; none was prepared for Adam, my father wanted to keep 100 acres for himself.\u201d\nAndrew McConnell, one of the defendants, says he was often at Adam\u2019s place, he was living on the E. \u00bd separate and apart from the old man. Adam was the reputed owner. On cross-examination, he says: \u201cAdam told me the land came from his father, the same as the rest of the brothers; he said his father gave it to him and afterwards made a will of it to him. At the time I made the first purchase, there was a dispute between John and Adam about the title.\u201d\nJas. Gray, on being re-called, says: \u201cI built the house on E. \u00bd under contract with Adam Gray, it was built 26 years ago; the barn was previously built; Adam was to pay me,\u201d and, on cross\u2011examination, \u201cmy grand father, John and Adam were all working together; part of the lumber in the house came from Cushin\u2019s mill, and part from the old man\u2019s mill. The building was, I think, put where my grand father wished it to be;\u201d on re-examination, says: \u201cJohn and Adam worked together in the mill after the barn was built on the E \u00bd; the crops raised on that half were put into it; if more wheat was grown on one \u00bd lot than on the other, it was divided between them.\u201d\nAnd Andrew McConnell says: \u201cAdam Gray told me before the date of his deed to me that his father had willed the lot to him.\u201d\nThe evidence shows, I think, very clearly this: that the land in dispute was the property of old James Gray, and that he owned and paid for it, and was in possession of it while Adam was yet but a child, and continued his possession and control over it until the time of his death; for, though it is quite true that his son Adam was also in possession, it seems very clear from the evidence that it was conjointly with his father, and with his concurrence and subject to his control. I take it to be a well established principle of law that if two parties are in possession of a lot of land, one having title to it and the other without title, the possession will enure for the benefit of the one having title, and though the land was called \u201cour Adam\u2019s,\u2019\u2019 and the father may have intended to give it to Adam, and Adam may have had reasonable grounds for thinking that he would do so, the evidence very clearly establishes that he never did give it to him in his life time, and that neither the father nor Adam considered that it belonged to the latter, or that he had any title to it while the father lived. One of the witnesses for the Defendant proves that while the father gave the other sons deeds \u201che kept the E. \u00bd of 13 for himself, and no deed was prepared for Adam, because the father wanted to keep 100 acres for himself,\u201d and we find the father devising it to Adam by his will, dated 10th Oct., 1848, in these words:\u2014\nAnd lastly, after all my just debts are paid, I give and bequeath to my son Adam Gray, and his heirs, my lot of land being East half of lot number thirteen, in the first concession of East Hawkesbury, County of Prescott, Ottawa District, and Province of Canada, aforesaid, this considered to become in force after the decease of my wife and myself.\nAnd afterwards, revoking this will by another, and devising it to his son John; and after the death of the father we find Adam, under his hand and seal, propounding the will of his father of the 10th of October, giving him, in the words of the father, \u201cmy lot of land to become in force after the decease of my wife and myself,\u201d and requiring the same to be registered on the 22nd October, 1857, thereby, so far as he could, virtually adopting that will and recognizing the statement of the testator therein contained, that the lot in question was his at the time of the making of the will, and that he, Adam, considered it continued his father\u2019s up to and at the time of his death, and he not only then registered that will, but claimed under it. The evidence of McCallum, who drew the will, shows that this will was in the possession of Adam, and McCallum, to whom Adam sold, he says:\u2014\nAdam told me that the land came from his father, the same as the rest of the brothers; he said his father gave it to him and afterwards made a will of it to him.\nAnd again, he says:\u2014\nAdam Gray told me before the date of his deed to me, that his father had willed the lot to him.\nThis will having been revoked by the subsequent one of the 30th day of January, \u201857, became wholly inoperative, and again we have Adam recognizing this last will as conveying the property to his brother John by taking a deed of it from him of the 31st March, \u201862, and under which deed Defendant now claims title, and for which Adam appears to have paid the consideration of $1,100. It is now claimed that Defendant has a title by possession, that is to say, by virtue of the united possession of Adam and himself, and if not, that he has title under the deed from John to Adam. Now, as to Adam\u2019s possesion, William Gray says Adam was in possession from \u201845 to \u201860; this was before he had built on the lot, for Mr. Scott says, Adam built his house and barn in \u201847 or \u201848.\nJames Gray died in \u201857, and on 31st March, \u201862, John and Adam executed the deed whereby John conveyed his interest in the land to Adam, so that there is no doubt that up to that time Adam had acquired no sufficient possession to give him a title, assuming that he actually went into the exclusive possession of the whole of the E. \u00bd in \u201847. It becomes necessary to ascertain what estate John took under the will of his father, for it is a proposition too plain to require authority to support it, that if John was the lawful owner or had a limited estate, and Adam took a deed from him, he must be considered in possession, as under the title, he so acquired from John, and if the estate of John was a limited and contingent estate, he cannot set up his possession under John to defeat the contingent estate, for the very obvious reason, that while he held John\u2019s title, he was in of right and could be interfered with by nobody.\nThe deed from John Gray to Adam Gray, dated the 31st March, 1862, in consideration of $1,100, purports to convey the land to Adam, his heirs and assigns, with a covenant that the grantor is seized in fee, but, as John\u2019s title thus conveyed to Adam is devised under his father\u2019s will, the extent of that title necessarily depends on the construction of that will. The devise is in these words:\u2014\nI give and devise to my son John Gray, his heirs and assigns, the East half Lot No. 13, &c., to have and to hold, &c., to the said John Gray, his heirs and assigns, forever. But if my said son John should die without leaving any issue of his body lawfully begotten, or the children of such issue surviving him, then, and in such case, I will and devise the said above mentioned premises with the appurtenances to my son Thomas Gray, his heirs and assigns, to have and to hold the same at the death of the said John Gray to my son Thomas, his heirs and assigns, forever.\nSubject to a condition that in case his wife Janette should survive him, then whoever of his said son John, his issue, the children of his issue, or of his son Thomas or his heirs, should then be the owner of said premises, by virtue of the will, should support, &c., his said wife, &c., and should they neglect or refuse to do so, then:\u2014\nI will and devise the above mentioned premises with the appurtenances unto my said wife Janette, her heirs and assigns, &c.\nWhat estate, then, did John take under this will? I am of opinion he took an estate in fee, subject to an executory devise over in the event of there being no issue of his body lawfully begotten, or the children of such issue, surviving him, living at the time of his death. This depends on the question, whether the testator intended the contingency to depend on a definite or indefinite failure of issue, and this intention must be collected from the will itself. The distinction between a definite and an indefinite failure of issue is very clearly stated by a learned Judge in the U.S.A., and adopted by Mr. Justice Blackburn, in his commentaries, thus:\u2014\nA definite failure of issue is when a precise time is fixed by the will for the failure of issue, as in the case of a devise to A., but if he dies without lawful issue living at the time of his death. An indefinite failure of issue is a proposition the very converse of the other, and means the failure of issue whenever it shall happen, sooner or later, without any fixed, certain or definite period, within which it must happen. It means the period when the issue or descendants of the first taker shall become extinct, and when there is no longer any issue of the issue of the grantee, without reference to any particular time or any particular event; or, in the words of the Statute, de donis, referring to the first taker, if his issue shall fail.\nThere are to be found in the books any number of cases on this branch of the law. No doubt the rule is, that where real estate is devised, either directly to or by way of executed trust for, a person and his issue, the word issue will be construed a word of limitation so as to confer an estate tail on the ancestor, unless there are expressions unequivocally indicative of a contrary lawful intent.\nBut, I take it to be equally well established that if the testator meant that the limitation was ever to take effect on failure of issue living at the time of the death of the person named as the first taker, then the contingency determines at his death, and no rule of law, as is said, is broken, and the executory devise is sustained, but the difficulty arises in determining whether the testator, by the expression he uses, meant a dying without issue living at the time of the death of the first taker, or whether he meant a general or indefinite failure of issue. In 2 Sanders[38], it is said:\u2014\nIf, however, the testator makes use of words in his will which indicate an intention to confine the generality of the expression of dying without issue to dying without issue living at the time of the person\u2019s decease, they will be so construed to effectuate the intent.\nIn speaking of the case of Pells v. Brown[39]; which has been called the Magna charta of this branch of the law, a learned judge says:\u2014\nReverting then to Pells v. Brown, that case settled the doctrine which obtains at the present day that any words which certainly indicate an intention in the testator to confine the failure of issue on which the estate is given over to a dying without issue living at the death of the first taker, will be sufficient to rebut the construction of an indefinite failure of issue.\nIn Doe v. Wetton[40]; the devise was to the testator\u2019s daughter in fee, but if she should happen to die leaving no child or children lawful issue of her body, living at the time of her death, then over, and the limitation over was held good as an executory devise, as indeed it seems perfectly clear.\nIn Fetherstone v. Fetherstone[41], Tindal, C.J., delivering opinions of judges, says:\u2014\nWe think the rule of construction laid down by Lord Alvanley in his judgment in the case of Poole v. Poole[42], being at once the result of the former cases, and being consistent with the principles of legal construction and of good sense, is the safe and correct rule to be applied to cases of this description, namely: \u201cthat the first taker shall be held to take an estate tail where the devise to him is followed by a limitation to the heirs of his body, except where the intent of the testator has appeared so plainly to the contrary that no one could misunderstand it.\nAnd Lord Brougham says:\u2014\nAgreeing entirely with the opinion of the judges, &c., * * I take the principle of construction as consonant to reason, and established by authority, to be this, that where by plain words, in themselves liable to no doubt, an estate tail is given, you are not to allow such estate to be altered and cut down to a life estate, unless there are other words which plainly show the testator used the former words of purchase contrary to their natural and ordinary sense, or unless in the rest of the provisions there be some plain indication of a general intent, inconsistent with an estate tail, being given by the words in question, and which general intent can only be fulfilled by sacrificing the particular provisions and regarding the expressions as words of purchase. Thus, (he says): If there is a gift first to A. and the heirs of his body, and then in continuation the testator, referring to what he had said plainly, tells us, he used the words \u201cheirs of the body\u201d to denote a first and other sons, then clearly the first taker would only take a life estate.\nIn Lees v. Mosely[43], Alderson, B. says:\u2014\nThe word issue is used in different senses, either as including all descendants, in which case it is, of course, a word of limitation or as confined to immediate descendants, or some particular class of descendants living at a given time. Probably it will be found most frequently used in the former sense, and it therefore most frequently has the effect of giving an estate tail to the ancestor; it might even perhaps be considered that this is prim\u00e2 facie its meaning. But the authorities clearly show that whatever be the prim\u00e2 facie meaning of the word \u201cissue\u201d it will yield to the intention of the testator to be collected from the will, and that it requires almost less demonstrative context to show such intention than the expression of heirs of the body would do.\nIn Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[44], Lord Chancellor Cairns says:\u2014\nThe words in the Codicil, then, are these: \u201cAnd if it should happen that my son John Coltsmann die without heirs of his body lawfully begotten, or to be begotten, in that case, and in default of such heirs, I do hereby devise and direct that my lands, castles, tenements and premises, at and about Flesh Castle, and mentioned in my said will, together with the plate, furniture and library in said will specified, also, my lands, farms, tenements and premises situate lying and being at Dick\u2019s Grove near Castle Island, all subject to and charged with the payment of the aforesaid annuity to my dear wife of eight hundred pounds a year, and also, with the payment of any reasonable provision made with my consent by my son for his wife, to be paid and payable to her during her natural life, shall, at my son\u2019s death, descend and be transferred to my grandson, Daniel Cronin, his heirs, executors and assigns forever, the heir for the time being to add the name \u201cColtsmann,\u201d to the name \u201cCronin.\u201d Also, if it should happen that my son, John Coltsmann, die without heirs of his body lawfully begotten, or to be begotten, in that case, and in default of such heirs, I do hereby give and assign out of the monies I have at interest, and specified in my said will, the sum of six thousand pounds to my daughter, Mary Godfrey, for her own use and benefit, and so as that the said sum of six thousand pounds shall not nor shall any part of it be subject or liable to the debts, engagements, management or control of her husband, but at the same time, said sum of six thousand pounds shall be subject to and charged with the payment of the said annuity to my dear wife, Christina Coltsmann.\u201d\nThe question as to Flesk Castle is, do these words cut down the estate in fee, or quasi fee previously given to any estate in tail or quasi tail? Or, on the other hand, do they amount to an executory gift over in the event of John Coltsmann dying without heirs of his body living at the time of his death? In support of the argument for cutting down the gift in fee simple to an estate tail, it is said, in the first place, that the words \u201cdying without heirs of the body, and in default of such heirs\u201d point not to the non-existence of one heir, but to the failure of a succession of heirs. In the second place, that we cannot suppose that the testator intended that if his son should leave an infant child, who should die under age, the estate should not go over to Daniel Cronin, as much as if the son died without issue living at his death. And it is argued, thirdly, that if the estate of John Coltsmann remained during all his life subject to an executory devise, he would not be able in his life-time to provide for his issue, as he might do by means of an estate tail.\nAs to the words of these arguments, I cannot admit that the words \u201cdie without heirs of the body\u201d are necessarily inflexible. They are technical words, and they are strong words, but they are notwithstanding words the technical meaning of which may, on construction, be controlled by the context. A gift over \u201cif A shall die without heirs of his body at his death, or living at his death,\u201d would imply a failure of heirs of the body at that punctum temporis only, and the question in this case is, does the context limit the words \u201cheirs of the body in the same way?\u201d The second argument proceeds upon a priori assumption of what the testator would naturally intend, which cannot be allowed to weigh against the proper construction of the words which he has used.\nAnd, as to the third argument, if the testator can be supposed to have contemplated a provision to be made by the son for his issue generally, he must be supposed to have contemplated cutting off of the entail, for in no other way could provision for his issue generally be made, a proceeding which would put an end to the gift over altogether.\nI turn, therefore, my lords, to the considerations which satisfy my mind, that as to Flesk Castle the codicil created an executory devise operating upon the absolute interest given by the will. In the first place, reading the codicil without the parenthetical or superfluous expressions, it runs thus: \u201cIf John Coltsmann die without heirs of his body and in default of such heirs, I direct that Flesk Castle with the plate, furniture and library shall at my son\u2019s death, descend and be transferred to Daniel Cronin, his heirs, executors and assigns forever.\u201d\nThese words appear to me to be clear and distinct, and the expression \u201cat my son\u2019s death\u201d appears to operate on every part of the sentence, and to point to a succession to John Coltsmann, which, if it arises at all, is to open upon John Coltsmann\u2019s death, and at no other time. The exigency of the words was attempted to be surmounted by reading them \u201cat my son\u2019s death as aforesaid,\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cat my son\u2019s death, without leaving heirs of the body.\u201d But this construction, in the first place, interpolates words which are not found in the will, and in the next place, it is open to the even more serious objection, that in an unbroken sentence it attempts to fix the meaning of the first part, and then to square the second part with the meaning so fixed, in place of reading the whole and interpreting the whole together.\nThe words of this will clearly indicate, I think, an intention on the testator\u2019s part to confine the failure of issue on which the estate is given over to a dying without issue living at the death of John Gray, the first taker.\nThe context, I think, shows that the testator did not intend that the words \u201cdie without leaving any issue\u201d should receive the general construction. The words as applied to the issue or the children of such issue, coupled with the words, \u201cthen in such case to Thomas, his heirs and assigns, to have and to hold the same at the death of the said John Gray, to my said son Thomas, his heirs and assigns for ever,\u201d in connection with the condition that, in case his wife Janette should survive him, then whoever of my said son John, his issue, the children of his issue, or of my said son Thomas, or his heirs, shall then be owner, &c., shall support, &c., my said wife in a comfortable &c., and should they neglect or refuse to do so, then I will, &c., unto my said wife, &c.,\u201d all point, I think, with certainty to the death of John Gray, as the time at which the failure of issue contemplated is to be ascertained, and indicate very clearly to my mind that he meant a failure at the time of the death of John Gray. I think it, therefore, clear that the testator meant to devise the land to Thomas if John died without issue, of his body or children of such issue living at the time of his death, and this limitation to Thomas being, in my opinion, good, by way of executory devise, and John dying without issue, I think the title vested in Thomas, and, therefore, the learned Judge was right on the trial in ordering a verdict to be entered in his favour.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe Plaintiff made out a prim\u00e2 facie case by proving: first, the possession of his father, James Gray, then, that Adam Gray, under whom the Defendants claim, was let into possession by James, the father, as a tenant at will in 1847, and lastly, the will of James Gray, under which, according to the construction of the court below, with which I entirely agree, but as regards which I have some further observations to make, John Gray was the devisee in fee of the land in question, subject to an executory devise over to the Plaintiff in fee on the death of John, without leaving issue at his death, which event happened in September, 1874. The first objection urged against this appeal was, that there had been surprise at the trial, the Plaintiff having opened a case of title in James Gray, the father, under the Statute of Limitations, failing to establish which, he afterwards fell back on the bare possession of James Gray as prim\u00e2 facie evidence of a seisin in fee.\nWithout expressing any opinion on the sufficiency of evidence of a possession for less than twenty years as establishing a presumption of a seisin in fee, which Cole, in his Treatise on Ejectment, says, is insufficient, inasmuch as any presumption arising from such possession is destroyed by the conflicting presumption arising from the present possession of the Defendant, a doctrine which at least commends itself as reasonable, I may observe, that in the present case, it was not only shown that James Gray had been in possession, but also that Adam Gray, under whom the Defendants claimed, had been let into possession by his father, James, and so became his tenant at will, which was manifestly to establish a sufficient case. Then, as the Defendants would have been estopped from proving an outstanding title in a stranger, which they might certainly have done, if the evidence had consisted of proof of former possession alone, without the fact of the tenancy at will and consequent estoppel, it does not appear possible that the Defendant could have been prejudiced by the Plaintiff\u2019s abandonment of the case, under the Statute of Limitations. As regards the will of James Gray, I am clearly of opinion, that the proper construction of that instrument was that which the Court below attributed to it, namely, that John Gray took an estate in fee simple, subject to an executory devise over in favor of the Plaintiff, on the death of John, without issue at the time of his death. The case referred to Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[45], is directly in point, and if that case is inconsistent with the previous decision in Jones v. Ryan[46], the answer must be that the last mentioned case is over-ruled by Coltsmann v. Coltsmann; but there is, between the two cases, a distinction, though but of one word, which is pointed out by the text-writers and has been supposed to make a difference. In Jones v. Ryan, the words were \u201cafter the death of the first taker\u201d\u2014in Coltsmann v. Coltsmann the words were \u201cat my son\u2019s death,\u201d as in the present case, they are \u201cat the death of the said John Gray.\u201d Therefore, if Jones v. Ryan is distinguishable from Coltsmann v. Coltsmann, this case is governed not by the former, but the latter authority. Indeed, without any reference to authorities, it is hard to see how a testator, who desires to give an estate over in the event of failure of issue not indefinitely, but at the death of the first taker, can do so more effectually than by using the words in which the testator expressed himself in the present case:\u2014\nTo have and to hold the same at the death of the said John Gray to my said son Thomas.\nThe defence of the Statute of Limitations has, in my judgment, entirely failed. Adam Gray went into possession as a tenant at will to his father in 1847, so that the Statute began to run in 1848, at the expiration of a year from the commencement of that tenancy. James Gray, the testator, died in 1857, having made the will already referred to. The Statute having begun to run in the lifetime of the testator, it is well settled, and beyond the reach of controversy, that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the protection accorded by the Statute to remainder\u2011men, reversioners, and other owners of future estates, as he would have been if the Statute had only commenced to run after the testator\u2019s death. If, therefore, there had been nothing to interrupt the running of the Statute, a title under it would have been acquired by Adam Gray, or the Defendant, McConnell, in 1868. That there was such an interruption, however, seems very clear. In 1862, Adam Gray, being then in possession, took a conveyance from John Gray, the devisee in fee, subject to the gift over to the Plaintiff, under the will of James Gray.\nThe effect of this conveyance does not seem to have been pressed in the Court of Common Pleas, and in the Court of Appeals the learned Judges were equally divided on the question which arose upon it. It appears to me, that from the date of this deed the Statute of Limitations was out of the question. I put the doctrine of estoppel aside, not because I do not entirely agree with Mr. Justice Moss and Mr. Justice Patterson in their well supported judgments on that point, but because I think the same conclusion is arrived at in a more simple way upon the Statute itself.\nMr. Justice Patterson points out that the aphorism that when the Statute once begins to run nothing stops it, has reference only to disabilities, and that it does not mean that if a man has been for nineteen years in tortious possession of an estate, and then gets a conveyance of the fee from the true owner, he can, after the lapse of a year, say, he is in with a good title under the Statute. The Statute of Limitations is, if I may be permitted to borrow from other systems of law terms more expressive than any which our own law is conversant with, a law of extinctive, not one of acqusitive prescription\u2014in other words, the Statute operates to bar the right of the owner out of possession, not to confer title on the trespasser or disseisor in possession. From first to last the Statute of 4 Wm. 4 says not one word as to the acquisition of title by length of possession, though it does say that the title of the owner out of possession shall be extinguished, in which it differs from the Statute of James, which only barred the remedy by action, but its operation is by way of extinguishment of title only.\nMr. Justice Patterson quotes from Baron Parke\u2019s judgment in Smith v. Lloyd[47] this passage:\u2014\nThere must be both absence of possession by the person who has the right and actual possession by another, whether adverse or not, to be protected, to bring the case within the Statute.\nThis authority does not controvert what I have just propounded, for in order that the Statute may operate against the owner out of possession, actual possession in fact in another is essential, in order that the rule of law which attributes a possession actually vacant to the person who has the legal title may be rendered inapplicable.\nThen applying this view of the Statute to the facts before the Court on this Appeal, let me inquire who was the owner out of possession between the 31st of March 1862, the date of the deed from John Gray to Adam Gray, and the 14th September, 1874, the day on which John Gray is proved to have died, to be affected by the Statute? Not John Gray, for he had conveyed to Adam, not the Plaintiff, for his possessory title had not accrued. There was, therefore, no one whom the Statute could affect. It had ceased to operate, for the possession was rightful from that date.\nThe proposition, that time can never be said to run against a remainder-man, so long as a tenant for life under the same will or settlement is in possession, which is, in effect, the present case, seems so plain that scarcely any authority is called for, but in addition to the case of Anstee v. Nelms[48], referred to by the learned Judges of the Court of Appeals, I may make a short quotation from text writers to the same effect.\nDarby and Bosanquet, in their treatise on the Statute of Limitations[49], say:\u2014\nThough the Statute may be running against a settlor at the time the settlement is made, yet the fact of the grantee of a particular estate taking possession under the settlement will re-vest the title of all persons entitled to remainders under the settlement, as well as that of the settlor and his heirs in reversion.\nThis is a succint statement of the law as I interpret the Statute. In short, the Statute has no application, except so long as the title and possession are separate, when the possession is in the rightful owner Statutes of Limitation are not required. The learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench lays it down as the practice of the House of Lords on Appeals, that a point of law could not be argued upon an Appeal which had not been raised in the Court below, and for this proposition the case of Oakes v. Turquand[50] was cited. A reference to that case shows, however, that what was there said had no connection with this point, but was in condemnation of the practice, which prevails more or less in most equity appeals, of raising a discussion as to the minutes at the conclusion of the judgment, and was no authority at all for the rule it was assumed to have established, which is directly contradicted by the treatise writers on the practice of the appellate jurisdiction both of the House of Lords and the Privy Council.\nI am of opinion, that the order of the Court of Appeals should be reversed, and that the rule nisi for a new trial in the Court of Common Pleas should be discharged, with costs to the Appellant in this Court, and in both the Courts below.\nTASCHEREAU and FOURNIER, J.J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis case comes to us by appeal from the Appeal Court of Ontario. It is an action of ejectment brought to recover a lot of land containing about one hundred and thirteen acres of land, being the eastern half part of Lot 13 in the First Concession of lots at Hawkesbury, and the broken front thereof. The suit was brought against Richford, and McConnell was subsequently admitted to come in and defend as his landlord. The Plaintiff, by his notice, claims title under the last will and testament of his late father, James Gray.\nThe Respondent, Richford, by his notice of title, denies the title of the Appellant, and claims as tenant of the other Respondent, McConnell.\nThe Respondent, McConnell, by his notice of title, denies the title of the Appellant, and asserts title in himself, by possession of himself and by those through whom he claims for upwards of twenty years before action commenced. He also claims title by deeds from John Gray to Adam Gray, dated 31st March, 1862, and from Adam Gray to him, dated, respectively, 20th June, 1862, the 26th of April, 1858, and the 15th September, 1862.\nThe Appellant, claiming title as I have before stated, under the will of his late father, James Gray, shows, by evidence uncontradicted, that as far back as 1830, he (James Gray) went into possession of the locus; and, according to some of the evidence, continued in possession till he died, in August, 1857, a period of twenty-seven years. When he went into possession, as proved by his son-in-law, McCallum, he had three sons, John, Andrew and Adam. The latter was then between 13 and 14 years of age. It is in evidence that Adam lived on the locus for some years before the death of his father; but the evidence is not clear that his possession of it was exclusive, for one witness, James H. Gray, asserts that he (the witness) lived with his grand father, whose house was on the west half of Lot 13, for many years, and that the east half was worked also by the testator. He says:\u2014\nWe were using it pretty much together. My grand-father had control of it. I have worked with him on both the east and west half\u2014the last time I saw him working, which was a few days before he died, was on the east half. My grand-father had control of both halves of the lot. What he said was to be done, had to be done\u2014his sons never disputed his authority.\nHe is re-called by the Respondents, and states that:\u2014\nI built the house on east half under a contract with Adam Gray 26 years ago, (that would be in 1850, or about 20 years after James Gray went into possession). The barn was built previously. Adam was to pay me.\nOn cross-examination, he says:\u2014\nMy grand-father, John, and Adam were all working together * * * the building was, I think, put where my grand-father wished it to be. John and Adam worked together in the mill. After the barn was built on the east half the crops raised on that half were put into it; if more wheat was grown on one half the lot than on the other, it was divided between them.\nWilliam Gray, a son of James, and a brother of Adam, says Adam was in possession of the east half from 1845 to 1860. He says his father paid for all the lots his sons had. That, although they all worked together on the east and west halves \u201cAdam would get the crop off the east half\u201d and \u201cJohn would get the crop off the west half.\u201d\nJames Scott proves that Adam built his house and barn on the east half in 1847 or 1848\u2014he was then married. \u201cThe crop was taken to the west half until he had his own barn built\u2014often heard the old man say, the east half was \u201cOur Adam\u2019s\u201d Heard him and his wife say so in 1842 and 1843.\nHenry Bradford says, Adam was in possession since 1846. In that year he got wood off it by his permission\u2014his father referring him to Adam\u2014and he concludes: \u201cMr. Adam Gray appeared to be in possession until Mr. McConnell got it.\u201d \u201cI supposed the old man was the owner of the land.\u201d On his cross-examination, William Gray adds:\u2014\nJohn and Adam and the old man were working pretty much all together up to the old man\u2019s death\u2014they had to do as the old man ordered them. My father gave me a deed\u2014he gave John a deed\u2014he gave Thomas a deed, and Andrew a deed\u2014he kept the East half of 13 for himself.\nOn his re-examination, he says, they all got their deeds in 1845 or 1846\u2014\u201dnone was prepared for Adam. My father wanted to keep 100 acres for himself.\u201d Upon the evidence of the alleged possession of Adam, previous to the death of his father, there is some doubt, whether, under all the circumstances, it was sufficiently exclusive in its nature to amount to a disseisin of the whole lot, or any part of it. The line between the east and west half was run. That might have been done not to mark the boundaries of Adam\u2019s possession, but to divide the lot as between the old man and John, who got a deed of the western half in 1845. There is no evidence that the survey had any reference to Adam\u2019s possession. The lines were not shown to have been run for him. According to the evidence, Adam admitted the title of his father, and if the latter permitted him to use a portion of the lot, which, by the late Statute, would oust him and those claiming under him of the title in 20 years from the end of a year from the beginning of his tenancy at will, that would not, I take it, divest him of the title to that portion which remained in a wilderness state, and never in the manual possession of Adam, but, by contemplation of law, in the possession of his father. Adam admitted the title of his father to the whole lot, and to hold the whole of it he must show a disseisin of the whole. Adam\u2019s possession, under the circumstances, must, I think, be \u201cby the foot,\u201d and therefore would cover only that part in his actual occupation.\nFrom the time that the possession of Adam is alleged to have commenced to the time he received the deed from John, he had not possession long enough to give him a title, and so we may presume he himself then considered. By that deed, dated 31st March, 1862, he is shown to have made a purchase of the land for a valuable consideration, for he appears to have paid for it eleven hundred dollars, which, we may presume, was at that time, about its full value. He and those deriving title through him are therefore estopped, I think, from setting up the previous possession. Taking the deed, under the circumstances, is an admission of holding solely under John. Had he not then purchased, or made some other arrangement with John, the latter might have evicted him, through his title under the will. Besides he, by that deed, has a covenant from John, that at the time of the ensealing thereof, \u201che was solely, rightfully and lawfully seized of a good, sure, perfect, absolute and indefeasible estate of inheritance, in fee simple, of and in the land, tenements and heriditaments, and all and singular other the premises thereinafter described,\u201d and further, \u201cthat the grantor now hath in himself good right, full power, and lawful and absolute authority to grant, sell a lien, convey and confirm\u201d the premises to the grantee, \u201chis heirs and assigns in manner and form aforesaid,\u201d with covenants for quiet enjoyment, and for further conveyances and assurances of the title, as might \u201cbe lawfully and reasonably devised, advised, or required.\u201d\nThe title under which the Respondent claims is by a deed from Adam Gray to him, dated the 20th of June, 1862, less than three months after the deed from John to Adam of one acre of the lot, with covenants the same in substance as in the deed from John to Adam. Also, under a mortgage on the lot from Adam for \u00a3275, with a covenant from the Respondent, McConnell, for quiet possession by Adam, until default in payment of the mortgage. And a deed from Adam, dated 15th September, 1868, \u201cin pursuance of the Act respecting short forms of conveyances\u201d of the east half of the lot for a consideration of $1,660.00, reserving the acre previously conveyed, with covenants for quiet possession, and against encumbrances. A party is not permitted to continue in possession under a deed, and afterwards say that he acquired the property by a possessory title. See Hawksbee v. Hawksbee[51], also Anstee v. Nelms[52], where it is said by Baron Martin and agreed to by Pollock, C.B.,\nThat the Statute of Limitations can never be so construed that a I person claiming a life estate under a will shall enter and then say that such a possession was unlawful, so as to give his heirs a right against a remainder-man.\nSee Persse v. Persse[53]; Kernighan v. McNally[54]; Morton v. Woods[55]; all which sustain the views I have expressed on this point. The cases all propound the principle that if parties have no other title than a will, they are estopped from denying the title under the same will. The principles laid down by Lord Chelmsford in Archibald v. Scully[56] fully accord with the position I have taken, that the possession of Adam, up to the taking of the deed from John, was in law the possession of John claiming under the will. Although by the Statute it is only necessary to show the Plaintiff out of possession twenty years, and there is now no question of adverse possession, is there evidence that, in this case, the parties through whom the Appellant claims were so out of possession? I think not. Adam, in the first place, admits the title of his father by receiving possession from him, as his tenant at will, and John, as his devisee, would be entitled to claim the benefit of that admission, and Adam in purchasing the land from him, by his own act admits John\u2019s title as well as that of his father; and virtually agrees to hold the land as grantee of John. John\u2019s title being then vested in him, and the party (if any) entitled as executory devisee not being able to claim during the life of John, there is no one against whom the Statute will run, for the title and possession are both in the same party. It is a general principle, well settled, that when the Statute begins to run nothing will stop it. The act of the party himself, however, may do it, as I think Adam did, by the purchase and conveyance from John, even if his possession up to that was an adverse one, which it was not. We are not, however, trying the question of adverse possession in Adam; but whether John\u2019s father and he, together, were out of the possession 21 years from the inception of Adam\u2019s exclusive possession, if he ever had such.\nThe possession of Adam and his grantees, after the deed was, so far as relates to the interests of the executory devisee the same, I take it, as if it had been that of any other party to whom John conveyed. The Statute in that case would only run from the death of John. As a question of law, in view of the authorities, Adam, having made the purchase of the land from John, whose title was solely under the devise from his father, is estopped from saying he had no right to make that devise. See Broad v. Broad[57].\nIn that case (in 1873), R.A., being tenant by the curtesy of certain premises, devised them by his will to trustees for his daughter Rebecca for life, with remainder to his grandson William. Upon the death of testator, Rebecca entered into possession of the land purported to be devised, and paid some annuities charged by the will upon the premises, and was suffered by the heir at law to remain in possession, undisturbed, for more than twenty years. William conveyed his remainder to the Plaintiff. Rebecca, after she had been in possession more than twenty years, conveyed the premises to the Defendant, who, upon her death, took possession. The Plaintiff, the assignee of William, the remainder-man, having brought ejectment, it was held that Rebecca, having entered under the will, the Defendant claiming through her was estopped, as against all those in re- mainder, from disputing the validity of the will, and that the Plaintiff was entitled to recover.\nIn delivering judgment, Mr. Justice Blackburn said:\u2014\nRebecca claimed under the will and retained possession under the will, and she, as against everybody interested in the will, is estopped from denying its validity. My brother Martin, in Anstee v. Nelms says: \u201cthat the Statute of Limitations can not be so construed that a person claiming a life estate under a will shall enter, and then say, that such possession was unlawful, so as to give to him or his heir a right against a remainder\u2011man.\u201d That seems directly in point. It is good sense and good law.\nMellor, J., says:\u2014\nIt would be contrary to the wholesome doctrine of estoppel to allow a person who takes a limited interest under a will after she has been in possession for twenty years under it to convert her limited interest into a fee. A person cannot say that a will is valid to enable him to take a benefit under it, but invalid so far as regards the interests of those in remainder, who claim under the same will.\nThe case just cited is like the one before us, with the exception that Adam was in possession at the time he purchased and got the deed. That possession was not then, however, in any respect an adverse one; but, as the tenant at will of John, under his title as devisee, Adam never repudiated the title of the testator, or of John, but held under them, and finally purchased from the latter. The testator was in possession by Adam, as his tenant, and, until by force of the statute, which in the meantime does not alter the character of the holding or the relation of the parties, the possession ripened into a title, the testator was in contemplation of law in possession as fully as the Respondent, McConnell, claims to be by his tenant, the other Respondent; and, as such, up to the time of his death, might, as the landlord of Adam, have come in and defended the title in an action brought against the latter, and he could have made up his title by possession by the addition of his own previous one to that of his said tenant. I think, therefore, the learned Judge who tried the cause was on this point quite right in his finding.\nHow does the possession of Adam, after the deed from John, operate as regards the executory devise over? The defence upon the point is, that at the death of John, the testator and he together had been out of possession 20 years. Suppose John, instead of Adam, had sold and conveyed to another, and the latter had, in 1862, gone into possession under that conveyance, how then could it be asserted that they were so out of possession. I take it that Adam\u2019s possession, after he purchased and got the deed, is an admission that he held thence forth under it, and consequently under the will; and I think such possession must enure to the benefit of the executory devisee under the will, in the same way, and to the same extent, as if the possession had been in another party under a similar conveyance. I cannot, on any principle, ascertain why it should not be so.\nHaving settled the question of possession in favor of the Appellant, the further result will depend upon the construction of the devise in the will. The testator devises the lot of land in question to his son John, his heirs and assigns:\u2014\nTo have and to hold the premises above described to the said John Gray, his heirs and assigns, for ever.\nWere these words contained in a deed of conveyance, they would be uncontrolled by a subsequent clause giving any estate less than a fee simple. In a will it is different. In the next clause of the will there is contained this proviso:\u2014\nBut if my said son, John, should die without leaving any issue of his body lawfully begotten, or the children of such issue surviving him, then and in such case I will and devise the said above mentioned premises, with the appurtenances to my son, Thomas Gray, his heirs and assigns, to have and hold the same at the death of the said John Gray, to my said son Thomas, his heirs and assigns, for ever.\nThese devises are all subject to a condition, that if his wife survived him, whoever of his said son John, his issue, the children of his issue, or of his said son Thomas, or his heirs, should then be the owner of the above mentioned premises by virtue of the will, should support his widow; and on failure to do so, he devised the land, from the time of neglecting or refusing such support, to his wife, her heirs and assigns, for ever.\nThere is no contention that the construction of the will is to be affected by the latter condition, providing for the support of testator\u2019s wife. We have, therefore, to ascertain whether, under the devise to John, he took an estate in fee simple with an executory devise over at his death to the Appellant, in case he died without issue; in which case, John would be held to have but a life estate, and not an estate in fee tail. John died unmarried, and leaving at his death no child or children \u201cof his body lawfully begotten.\u201d If his title was an estate tail, the conveyance to Adam would have given him an estate in fee simple, and barred the title or entry of the remainder-man. If, on the contrary, he took an estate in fee simple contingent on his leaving children or grand-children at his death, with a devise over, on failure at that time, then his estate was one for life, and a title made by a conveyance by him would cease at his death.\nThe cases in the books have been found somewhat conflicting, and the distinctions have been so closely drawn between the two different estates that for many years in England, it will be found, there were, apparently, decisions both ways. For several years past, however, the definitions are more clear, and the decisions uniform, which go to sustain the proposition that John took, under the will, an estate in fee simple with an executory devise over to Thomas, his heirs and assigns, at John\u2019s death, in case he (John) died without leaving any issue of his body lawfully begotten, or the children of such issue surviving him.\nIt is by the express terms of the will a devise of a fee simple to John determinable on a particular event with a devise over in fee simple to Thomas, on the occurring of that event. We have not, therefore, to construe an indefinite devise to John to be considered a fee simple, or fee tail, according to other provisions of the will. By the devise, no person taking under it was to have a less estate than one of fee simple. It is true, by the failure to leave issue, John\u2019s estate was at an end, but while he lived he held a fee simple contingent, and, at and from his death, Thomas was to hold a fee simple. I can discover no principle or decision in pursuance of which John\u2019s estate could, at any time, or under any circumstances, be called an estate in fee tail.The devise of what otherwise would be an estate tail may be raised to one in fee simple, by a condition on the tenant to pay a sum of money in the shape of legacies and otherwise, and an estate apparently created by a devise in fee simple may be reduced to an estate tail, where it is necessary to carry out the intention of the testator clearly shown in subsequent dispositions or limitations inconsistent with an estate in fee simple; but here there is nothing of the kind. There is no legal prohibition to the testator\u2019s executory devise, and the language of it being free from doubt as to his intentions, we have simply to give effect to them by our judgment. To create an estate in fee tail it is necessary to confine the descent to the issue of the donee; but here there was no such limitation, for the estate was, in the first place, given to John, his heirs and assigns in fee. And the subsequent provision is not, and was not intended, to, in any event, reduce his holding to that of an estate less than a fee simple.\nHad, however, the devise to John been limited to him and his heirs only, it would still have given him a title in fee simple, by the effect of the gift over to Thomas at his (John\u2019s) death, in fee simple, it being considered to denote that the prior devisee should have the inheritance in the alternative event of his leaving issue. If John had therefore left the defined issue surviving him, the title of Adam, and those claiming under him, would have also been in fee simple, the condition of the devise being then fulfilled to the exclusion of the executory devise. In Doe v. Webber[58] it was held that by a devise to M.H., her executors, administrators or assigns, forever; \u201cbut in case M.H. shall happen to die and leave no child or children, then to J.B., and her heirs, forever, paying the sum of \u00a31,000 to the executor or executors of M.H., or to such person as M.H., by her will shall appoint,\u201d it was held that the words \u201cchild or children,\u201d were here synonymous with issue, and that this was not the devise of an estate tail to M.H., but of an estate in fee to M.H., with a good executory devise over to J.B., in case M.H., died leaving no issue living at her death.\nPer Lord Ellenborough, in giving the judgment of the Court:\u2014\nAnd if the event on which the two tenements named in the will are given over be, as we think it is, to be confined to a failure of issue at Mary Hile\u2019s death, not only the above case of Roe v. Jeffery[59]; but also the cases of Power v. Bradley[60] and Barnsfield v. Whelton[61] are directly applicable to the present case, to show that the prior estate in fee simple, given to Mary Hiles, is not by the limitation over upon the failure of her issue at the time of her death, narrowed into an estate tail. * * * We think, therefore, that the first devise gave a fee, and that the devise over is an executory devise and not too remote. Consequently, that it is not barred by the recovery, and that judgment must be for the Plaintiff.\nThe case just cited is \u201con all fours\u201d with the one before us. It has never been over-ruled, but, on the contrary, has been cited with approval, and, as far as the reported cases go, is now settled law and doctrine.\nVice Chancellor Wood, in his judgment in Parker v. Birks[62], in 1854, refers to and adopts the ruling of Lord Ellenborough in that case. He says:\u2014\nThe words were leaving \u201cno child or children,\u201d which are as strong as the words in this case, and Lord Ellenborough, C.J., said that the gift must be construed as a devise in fee to M.H., which would enable her to give the estate to her issue, if she had any. * * * This is, therefore, like the case of Roe v. Jeffery, 7 T.R. 589, which was a devise to J.F., and to his heirs, for ever; but in case J.F. should depart this life and leave no issue, then the testator devised over estates for life only. In that case, the first devise was held to be in fee and not in tail, and the limitation over a good executory devise upon the event of a failure of issue at the time of his death.\nThe learned Vice Chancellor, after reviewing and quoting previous decisions and authorities, says:\u2014\nIn no case in which a clear estate in fee simple has been limited by the first words, has that estate been reduced to an estate tail in order to construe the words of the gift over on the death of the devisee without issue, to be a remainder. It is begging the question to say that the gift over is to be taken to be a remainder, because it is necessary, first to make out that the gift in fee is cut down to an estate tail. * * * I think, therefore, that I must decide according to the authorities of Doe v. Frost, 3 B. & Ald. 546, and exparte Davies, 2 Sim. N.S. 114, and having regard to the clear gift in fee simple to William Shaw in this case, that the true construction of this will is, that he took an estate in fee simple, subject to an executory devise over on his death, if he should die without issue.\nIn Doe v. Frost the devise was to W.F., the son of the testator, in fee \u201cand if he should have no children, child or issue, the said estate was, on the decease of W.F., to become the property of the heir at law.\u201d Held, that W.F., took under this will an estate in fee with an executory devise over to the person, who, on the happening of the event contemplated by the will, should become the heir at law of the testator. In Roe v. Jeffery in 1798, cited, as before mentioned, by Lord Ellenborough, in Doe v. Webber, the devise was as already shown, and Lord Kenyon, C.J., in giving the opinion of the Court, says:\u2014\nWe had occasion a few days ago to advert to this doctrine when we said that this is a question of construction depending on the intention of the party, and nothing can be clearer in point of law, than that if an estate be given to A in fee, and by way of executory devise, an estate be given over which may take place within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years, and a fraction of a year afterwards, the latter is good by way of an executory devise. The question, therefore, in this and similar cases is, whether from the whole context of the will we can collect that, when an estate is given to A and his heirs for ever; but if he die without issue then over, the testator meant dying without issue living at the death of the first taker. The rule was settled so long ago as in the reign of James the First, in the case of Pells v. Brown, Cro. Jac., 590., where the devise being to Thomas, the second son of the devisor, and his heirs, forever, and if he died without issue living, then William, his brother, should have those lands to him and his heirs forever, the limitation over was a good executory devise. That case has never been questioned or shaken, but it has been adverted to as an authority in every subsequent case respecting executory devises; it is considered as a cardinal point on his head of the law, and cannot be departed from without doing as much violence to the established law of the land, as (it was supposed by the Defendant\u2019s counsel) we should do, if we decided this case against him.\nIn conclusion, I can most profitably adopt and make use of the words and conclusions of the learned Chief Justice:\u2014\nOn looking through the whole of this will we have no doubt but that the testator meant that the dying without issue was confined to a failure of issue at the death of the first taker, for the persons, (person) to whom it is given over were (was) then in existence * * * and, if so, the rule of law is not to be controverted. It is merely a question of intention, and we are all clearly of opinion that there is no doubt about the testator\u2019s intention.\nThe result of all these authorities is, that John had only a life interest in the property, and that at his death it vested in fee in Thomas, under the executory devise, and, therefore, the appeal should be allowed and judgment on all the points given for the Appellant with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellants: Bethune, Osler & Moss.\nSolicitors for Respondents: Richards & Smith.\n[1] 1 App. R.

J., and Ritchie, Strong, Taschereau, Fournier and Henry, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nJudicial avowal (aveu)\u2014Deed, erroneous statement in\u2014Art. 1,243, C.C.L. C.\nBy notarial deed, dated 3rd May, 1875, F. and P. K. purchased from one F. C. certain printing materials. The agreed price was $5,000, and was paid ; but the deed erroneously stated the price to be $7188.40 which amount was acknowledged in the deed to have been paid and received. C. remained in possession, and, after being in partnership with M. for several months, failed. On 7th March, 1876, F. McN. and P. K. claimed the plant and their petition stated the purchase had been made in good faith, and that they had paid the agreed price, but that the deed erroneously stated the price to have been $7,188.40. The evidence as to the price agreed upon and paid was that of F. McN., and his statement was confirmed by. F. C. The Appellant, as assignee to be insolvent estate of F. C. and M., claimed the payment of $2,188.40, being the balance between the consideration price mentioned in the deed and the $5000 admitted to have been paid\nHeld,\u2014Affirming the judgment of the Court below, that the only evidence in support of Appellant's contention being that of F. McN., the Respondent, the Appellant cannot divide the Res pondent's answers (aveu judiciaire) in order to avail himself of what is favorable and reject what is unfavorable. (Strong, J., dissenting.)\nThat, although there is an error, or even a false statement, in a deed, the obligation to pay the consideration proven to be the true and legitimate one remains.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side).\nIn February, 1876 a writ of attachment under the Insolvent Act of 1875, was issued against Felix Callahan and S. J. Meany, carrying on business as printers and publishers at Montreal, and the Appellant was appointed assignee to the estate of the firm as well as to the individual estates of each co-partner.\nIn March, 1876, the Respondents presented a petition to the Superior Court, praying that the Appellant, as assignee of Callahan and Meany, be ordered to deliver to them certain plant and machinery which Respondents claimed to be their property in virtue of a deed of sale, in their favor, by the insolvent, Callahan passed before Phillips, Notary Public, on the 3rd day of May, 1875. In their petition the Respondents alleged:\u2014\n\" That the said purchase was made by your Petitioners in good faith and that they paid for the said articles above enumerated the sum of $5000 but that the said deed erroneously states the price to have been $7148.40.\"\nThe Appellant, in his answer, admitted the sale, but alleged that the price stated in the deed of sale, and schedule annexed was the real price of the articles sold, and that the Respondents were only entitled to the goods on the paying of $2,188.40, the difference between the amount paid and the price stipulated.\nOn this issue the parties went to proof.\nThe facts of the case are as follows: Felix Callahan a printer being in want of funds to publish an Irish newspaper in Montreal, proposed to sell a part of his plant to the Respondent, McNawee, and a sale of the articles in question in this case was finally agreed upon for the sum of $5000 which was to be advanced as Mr. Callahan should require the money. The Respondent, McNamee, then induced the other Respondent, Kenney, to join him in the purchase, and, on the 3rd May, 1875, a notarial deed of sale was executed before Phillip, N.P.\nA. schedule enumerating the various articles which were sold, was annexed to the deed and formed part of it. When the parties first went to the notary's office, they had no list of the articles sold, and an adjournment took place to enable Mr. Callahan to prepare one. In making the list he added opposite each article the price at which he had bought it. The deed was then drafted, and the price entered was the total of $7188.40 shown at the foot of the list. No money was paid at the time, but afterwards the price of $5,000 was paid in various amounts as required by Mr. Callahan.\nMr. Callahan subsequently formed a partnership with Mr. Meany for the publication of the \"Sun,\" and the Respondents allowed the firm to continue the use of the plant for the publication of the newspaper.\nThe Petitioners were examined for the assignee and Callahan and another witness Carroll, were examined ' for Petitioners in rebuttal\nThe Superior Court gave judgment on the 2nd May, 1876, ordering the Appellant to deliver to the Respondents the articles claimed. This judgment was confirmed in the Court of Queen's Bench for lower Canada (Appeal Side), on the 15th. June, 1877.\nMr. McMaster, for Appellant:\u2014\nThe whole difficulty in this case arises from the following averment in the Respondents' petition: \" That the said purchase was made by your petitioners in good faith, and that they paid for the said articles above enumerated the sum of $5000 ; but that the said deed erroneously states the price to have been $7,188.40.\"\nThe Respondents, I contend, had to prove the error as to the price and what the real price was. The legal instrument showed the price to be $7,188.40, and there is no legal evidence to negative it. The only way of attacking a notarial deed is by a petition in improbation (Inscription de faux), or by evidence of equal value. Here, it is the party to the deed who is attacking it. Our Art. 1210 and 1211, C. C. L. C. apply in this case. This instrument was complete, and if they want to vary it in part, they must do it in accordance with the articles of the Code.\nThe question of dividing an admission does not present itself here. The only admission here made is that the respondents paid $5,000 for the articles claimed.\nThe receipt, erroneously styled a discharge, is admitted by Callahan to be false and cannot be invoked by the respondents, who admit they paid nothing when the deed was executed and only subsequently paid the sum of $5,000.\nThe statements of McNamee 8c Kenney, examined as witnesses, cannot avail themselves. C. C. P. L. C. 251.\nThe evidence shows the property was worth $7,188.40; that the sale was bond fide, and that the respondents paid nothing down; and the assignee, therefore, it is submitted) was entitled to stand by the deed and have it declared by this Court that the respondents are debtors for the difference.\nReference was made to Arts. 1,496,1,533, 1,234 C. C. ' L.C.\nMr. Wurtele, Q.C., for Respondent :\u2014\nThe only question in this case is, what was the price paid for the goods and was it paid.\nThe evidence for the Appellant cannot be divided.\nThe Appellant invokes the respondent\u2019s admission to prove there was falsity of consideration in the deed. But this same admission proves that the price was only $5000 and that this sum has been paid ; and it further explains satisfactorily, how the error happened. The admission must be taken as a whole, and cannot be divided. The Appellant cannot invoke in his favor, against the full discharge given in the deed of sale, the admission of the respondents contained in their petition an4 in their testimony,\u2014that only $5,000 were paid; and reject their declaration,\u2014that this sum was the price really agreed upon, and that the deed erroneously stated the price to be $1,188.40.\nThe learned Counsel referred more specially to 3 Merlin, Questions de droit ([1]); and also, to C. C. L. C. Art. 1,243; Maccad\u00e9 C. N. Art. 1,356 ([2]) ; Demolombe ([3]); Toullier ([4]) ; Duranton ([5]) ; and Masse ([6]).\nSTRONG, J;\n1878: June 3\nThe Chief Justice was absent when judgment was delivered.\nI am of the same opinion as the dissenting judges in the Court of Queen's Bench. There can be no doubt but that the admission of the respondents is not divisible in this sense, that it was not competent to the Appellant to reject the qualification to the state ment that the whole purchase money specified in the deed was not paid; in other words, the qualification is admissible, and is to be taken into account in the Respondents' favour, but it is not, I think, on the authorities, necessarily conclusive. It is competent for the .Appellant to contradict it and the Court is bound to consider what weight should be attributed to it. Art. 231 clause 2, of the Code of P. of L. C. is as follows :\u2014\nThe answer of any party to a question put to him may be divided * * when the part of the answer objected to is improbable, or invalidated by indications of fraud, or of bad faith, or by contrary evidence\nThe passage cited by Mr. McMaster from Marcad\u00e9 ([7]) is an authority directly in point; Laurent ([8]) also states the law in the same way.\nIt was not, therefore, competent for the Appellant to reject that portion of the admission which made against him, altogether; but it was competent to him to contradict it and shew that it was not true or to call upon the Court to discredit it The question thus becomes one of fact\u2014was the lesser sum of $5,000 and not $7,188.00, as stated in the deed, the true price? Not only is the testimony of the parties to the sale that the lesser sum was the real price inconsistent with the deed but in my opinion the evidence is not sufficient to prove the error alleged.\nIt would be against the policy of the law, and productive of very dangerous consequences, if in any case the price stated in a solemn deed of sale could be proved to be erroneous by the evidence of the parties themselves unconfirmed by other testimony when the rights of third parties have intervened and the contract is sought to be enforced on behalf of creditors by the assignee in bankruptcy of the vendor.\nUnder a system of evidence which freely admits the testimony of a party in his own behalf, the purchaser's own unsupported evidence would not, in such a case, be deemed sufficient to establish mistake in the statement of price and to cut down the amount stated in the formal deed. For these reasons, I think the Respondents failed to establish the pretended mistake. To use the expression of the article of the Code of Procedure, already referred to, I think we ought to declare that part of the admission which is objected to improbable.\nI feel, therefore, bound to dissent from the judgment of the Court as delivered by my brother Fournier not on the law, but as regards the sufficiency of the evidence to contradict and vary the deed.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the petition of respondents in the Court below dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER, J.:\u2014\nOn the 3rd of May, 1875, the respondents purchased by deed before a Notary Public from Felix Callahan of the City of Montreal, book and job printer, all the stock of printing materials mentioned and enumerated in a schedule thereof thereunto which formed part of the deed. The consideration expressed in the deed is $7,188.00, which Callahan acknowledged and confessed to have well and truly had and received, previous to the passing of the deed.\nThe vendor Callahan, having remained in possession of the materials, almost immediately formed a partnership with J. Meany, for the publication of a newspaper called The Sun. After a few months, the firm of Callahan 8c Meany went into insolvency, in consequence of a writ of attachment issued in February, 1876. The Appellant was appointed assignee, and with the property of the firm he took possession of these printing materials.\nThe respondents by petition, dated the 27th March following, claimed the plant which they had bought, alleging that the deed of sale of the 3rd of May above cited was their title to the said plant, and that from the date of their purchase it had never ceased to be their property. The consideration alleged to have been paid, is thus worded in their petition :\u2014\nThat the said purchase was made by your petitioners in good faith, and that they paid for the said articles above enumerated the sum of $5,000.00, but that the said deed erroneously states the price to have been $7,188.40.\nThe petition prays that the assignee be ordered to deliver the plant to the petitioners.\nThe Appellant, in his plea, in answer to the petition does not attack the legality of the deed of sale in question but alleges that the consideration price is not $5,000 but $7,188.40, being the amount mentioned in the deed which amount was never paid to Callahan ; and that the same is now due ; and offers and tenders to the petitioners the said articles and effects upon payment of the said consideration price, or of any balance that may remain unpaid of the said purchase price.\nThe issue was joined by a general answer and the parties proceeded to proof.\nThe Petitioners, who had already produced in support of their demand a copy of the deed of sale of the 3rd May, 1875, also filed a copy of the insolvent's answers, under oath, given to the questions put to him before the assignee relative to the sale in question, pending the proceedings under the writ of attachment. The respondents rested their case there, in consequence of a decision of the Honorable Mr. Justice Rainville stating that the burden of proof was on the contesting party.\nThe error in the statement of the price, as it appears by the evidence, happened under the following circumstances:\u2014\nWhen the parties first went to the Notary's office, they had no list of the articles sold, and an adjournment took place to enable Mr. Callahan to prepare one. In making this list he added opposite each article the price at which he had bought it. When the parties returned to the Notary's office, Mr. Philips drafted the deed, and he entered the total of $7,188.40, shown at the foot of the list as the price, instead of the sum of $5,000. The parties, when the draft was read over, immediately detected and mentioned the error and desired the Notary to correct it; but he stated that the amount mentioned in the deed as the price was immaterial, as payment was acknowledged, and the deed was executed as it was. No money was paid at the time; but the price of $5,000 agreed upon was afterwards paid in various amounts, as required by Mr. Callahan.\nAdmitting, even, that the respondents only paid $5,000, whilst the agreed price was really $7188.40 the receipt given must, notwithstanding, be considered to be valid, so long as it is not proved that it was either fraudulently or erroneously given. But there is no such averment. By the evidence it is proved that at the time of the purchase, Callahan was solvent and that there was nothing to prevent him from giving a discharge in full, even if the actual consideration price had been $7,188.40, as was contended by the Appellant.\nBeing unable to contradict respondents judicial ad mission (aveu) as to the price, Appellant now claims the right to say that he will avail himself of that part only of respondents admission which is favorable to his view, such as the admission that he only paid $5,000, and reject that part relating to the error made in mentioning the price, because it is against him. However, it is a general rule that a judicial avowal or admission cannot be divided ([9]). It is only in exceptional circumstances and for special reasons, which are not to be found in this case that Courts will allow the answer of a party to be divided. The rule which should govern in such cases is thus given in a decision of the Cour de Cassation dated the 13th June, 1872 :\u2014\nLes aveux peuvent et doivent \u00eatre divis\u00e9s, soit que sur certains points de details o\u00f9 complexes ils soient reconnus faux, contradictoires et inconciliables avec les principaux faits confesses, soit qu'il en ressorte d'ores et d\u00e9j\u00e0, la preuve d'une situation de fait et de droit entrainant la solution du proces.\nLaurent ([10]) expresses himself on this same subject as follows :\nLa doctrine et la jurisprudence sont d'accord pour admettre que par exceptions la \u00e0 r\u00e9gle de l'indivisibilit\u00e9, il y a des cas o\u00f9 l'aveu peut \u00eatre divis\u00e9.\nBut when, as in the present case, the party invoking the division of the admission (aveu) has no other proof in support of his contention, he cannot have it divided, he must either accept or reject it in its entirety:\nSi l'aveu est indivisible c'est parce que c'est la seule preuve du fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9; la loi veut qu'nn prenne la declaration tellequ'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite ([11]).\nThe Appellant seems to forget that if, on the one part, the deed of the 3rd of May 1875 establishes the price to have been $7188.40 it is on the other hand, also evidence that the price has been paid.\nTherefore nothing is due on the purchase price, and the Appellant has nothing to claim unless he can desroy the effect of the statement made in the deed that the purchase price was paid. He has no other alternative :\nL'aveu judiciaire, dit la cour de cassation, est la declaration quo fait la partie en justice d'un fait dont il n'existe pas d'ailleurs de preuve et qui n'est \u00e9tabli que par cet aveu lui-m\u00e9me. C'est par cette raison et en consideration de cette reconnaisance spontan\u00e9e que la loi a attache a l'aveu le caract\u00e9re diindisibibilit\u00e9 ([12]).\nIn this case there was no obligation on the part of the petitioners to state that the true consideration price was not the one which was mentioned, in the deed He might simply have alleged the discharge or receipt therein mentioned, against which no verbal testimony was admissible. By so doing, he did not in anywise improve his position, and an admission given under such circumstances, must either be accepted or rejected in its entirety. The following passage from Duranton, supports this view:\u2014\nLorsque la partie qui a fait l'aveu n'\u00e9tait nullement oblig\u00e9e par quelque circonstance particuli\u00e9r\u00e9 a le faire, parce qu'il n'existait contre elle aucun acte, aucune lettre, aucune preuve testimoniale admissible, on doit croire, que pouvant nier absolument le fait si elle l'a avou\u00e9, avec quelque circonstance qui en a d\u00e9truit l'effet o\u00f9 qui le modifie, elle a dit la chose telle qu'elle existait. Dans ce cas ii n'est pas douteux que l'aveu ne doive g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00eatre pris o\u00f9 rejet\u00e9 en son entier. Par exemple, vous me demandez la restitution d'un d\u00e9pot que vous pr\u00e9tendez \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par votre auteur, et dont vous n'avez aucune preuve ni commencement de preuve: j'avoue avoir recu le d\u00e9p\u00d4t, mais je declare l'avoir restitu\u00e9 la \u00e0 personne qui me l'avait confi\u00e9, mon aveu doit \u00eatre pris en son entier, sauf \u00e0 vous \u00e0 me d\u00e9f\u00e9rer le serment, si vous pensez que je serai lie par la plus que par l'aveu ([13]).\nL'avuu quand il est la seule preuve pioduite, ne peut \u00eatre divis\u00e9 contre celui qui l'a fait: C. Cass, 18 Nov. 1873.\nArt. 231 of the C. C. P. L.C., concerning interrogatories on faits et articles, cannot be invoked against the principle above stated; because by this article the law has defined the circumstances in which the admission (aveu) or the answers of the party to such interrogatories can be divided; whilst, on the contrary, Art., 1243 C. C. L. C. having declared in an absolute and general manner that the judicial admission cannot be divided, we cannot qualify the provisions of this latter article by applying to it the dispositions of Art. 231 C. C P. Most frequently the object of faits et articles is merely to procure a beginning of proof in writing. In such a case there is no room to raise the question of the indivisibility of the admission, as says Laurent ([14]):\nQuand l'aveu sert settlement pour commencement de preuve, l\u2019indivisibilit\u00e9 est hors de cause: les juges ont alors le droit de prendre l'interogatoire dans son ensemble o\u00f9 dans ses details, pour y chercher le commencement de preuve qui leur permet de recourir a la preuve testimoniale. Ainsi le juge appliquera, dans ce cas, les principes qui r\u00e9gissent le commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, et. non les principes qui r\u00e9gissent l'aveu.\nThe Appellant strongly urges the insufficiency of the allegations of the petitioners in reference to what was the real price agreed upon. He contends that the averment is disingenuous because what they omitted to state led him to believe the contrary of what is ex-pressed in the deed. He also criticises the statements of the learned Chief Justice, who speaking of this admission says:\u2014\u2014\nThe Respondents have admitted they have only paid $5,000, but they, at the same time, state, that this was the only consideration for the deed.\nIt has been stated above in what terms this admission is expressed ; it comes immediately after the paragraph enumerating the complete list of the articles purchased, and to which articles the following words have reference :\u2014\nThe said purchase was made in good faith, and that they (Respondent's) paid for the said articles above enumerated the sum of $5,000.\nIs not this a plain averment that $5,000 was the price of the articles purchased. \"We are unable to take any other view of this admission than that taken by the learned Chief Justice, unless we come to the conclusion that the respondents in thus expressing themselves wished to waive the benefit of the discharge mentioned in the deed, and intended to acknowledge that there was still due a balance of $2188.40. This interpretation is so absurd that it is needless to dwell upon it.\nThe Appellant also claimed that this ingenious admission, on the part of the respondents, put him in a less favorable position than he would have been otherwise. This clearly cannot be, for had the Respondents rested their petition on the deed and simply alleged the discharge it contains, what would have been the result ? The Appellant could have answered only by attacking this discharge as being erroneously given by Callahan, or fraudulently executed by him to the detriment of his creditors. If such had been the case, it would then have been for the Appellant to void this discharge, and this, in the absence of* other proof he could only succeed in doing by interrogating the Respondents ; so that he would still be forced to rely on their admission (aveu). He would thus have been obliged to submit to what has taken place in this suit viz: interrogate McNamee and Meany as being parties to the instrument in order to procure evidence that notwithstanding the receipt there was still due a balance on the purchase price.\nThe authenticity of a document or the laws of evidence are not in anywise infringed, because parties to a deed are questioned as to the truth of the declarations therein contained. On the contrary, it is one of the admitted modes to prove erroneous statements in a deed such as those alleged in this case. The inscription de faux is another of such modes, but not the only one as the Appellant has contended:\nLa preuve do l'acte authentique peut \u00eatre d\u00e9truite par lavuu de la partie, e. g. si Pierre a souscrit une obligation devant no- taires, au profit de Paul, sans en recevoir la valeur, et que ce dernier le poursuive pour le paiement, Pierre peut le faire interroger sur les circonstances du pr\u00e8t, pour tirer de ses r\u00e9ponses un aveu qu'il n'a pas fait ce pr\u00e8t, quoi que l'obligation l'atteste et s'il peut y par venir elle sera an\u00e9antie ([15]).\nThis is exactly what the Appellant did when he examined as witnesses McNcmiee and Meany parties to the deed, to prove that the true price of the purchase was $7,188.00, and not $5,000. The respondents had also that privilege, and they made use of it by producing Callahan's deposition in the proceedings in insolvency, and by examining him as a witness.\nIn his examination before the assignee as well as in his examination as a witness in this cause Callahan admits that the consideration was $5000 and that the amount had been paid. There can be no doubt as to the respondent\u2019s right to avail themselves of his admissions. As to what he admitted before the assignee the following authority suffices to show that such an admission can be adduced as evidence in this cause\nPeu-on opposerl'aveu aux cr\u00e9anciers de celui qui l'a fait ? L'affir mative n'est pas douteuse. Quand les cr\u00e9anciers exercent un droit de leur d\u00e9biteur, ils agissent en son nom, et on peut leur opposer toutes les exceptions qui peuvent \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es au d\u00e9biteur. Sauf aux cr\u00e9 anciers a attaquer l'aveu comme fait en fraude de leur droit. La jurisprudence est en ce sens. Bordeaux. 2 Mai, 1850. DaIIoz, au mot \"obligation\" No. 5,154 ([16]).\nAs to the legal effect of such an admission repeated by Callahan, when examined as a witness in this cause it is quite sufficient to state that his insolvency did not render him an incompetent witness. As it has correctly been stated by Mr. Justice Rainville, \"If the action was between Callahan and the petitioners (Respondents), the latter would undoubtedly succeed.\"\nTheir position cannot be changed because Callahan has become insolvent. The Appellant might have rested his case here,\u2014 having established his payment by the deed and by Callahan's answers to interrogation in insolvency.\nAs to the objection raised by the Appellant founded on Art. 251. C G. P., which declares a party examined in a cause cannot make proof for himself, I do not consider it a serious one. The innovation introduced by that article to the law of evidence was simply for the purpose of allowing parties to a suit to be competent witnesses, when examined by the opposite party, with the above restriction, it is true, that a party cannot make proof for himself, a principle which has always existed in our law of evidence. This article does not destroy the effect of Art 1243 of C. C with reference to the indivisibility of the judicial admission which is still in force not withstanding article 251, of the Code of Procedure. A party, therefore who, having no other proof, examines the opposite party as a witness, cannot now contend, any more than before the introduction of this article that the admission of the party so examined may be divided in order to avail himself of what is favorable and to reject what is unfavorable.\nBut in this case, the admission relied upon by the Respondents is that contained in their petition and not the admission made in their examinations as witnesses in this cause, which the Appellant was at liberty to declare he would not make use of as evidence in the cause. Such was admissible, but can only be invoked by the Appellant if he declares his intention to make use of it and then in such a case the admission must be taken in its entirety and is indivisible. If the Appellant does not wish to make use of these admissions there still remains in the record the Respondents' admissions made in their petition, on which they can legally rely as stated in Laurent ([17]). After referring to the necessity of taking down in writing the verbal declaration made by a party in Court, he adds :\u2014\nQuant aux declarations faites dans les actes de procedures, elles sent par cela m\u00eame authentiquement constat\u00e9es.\nThese authorities, in my opinion, support clearly the conclusion at which I have arrived 1st. There is in this cause a judicial admission contained in the petition (aveu judiciaire) ; 2nd. The circumstances under which was made make it indivisible.\nThere still remains the following question to be answered, viz :\u2014\nThe true consideration of the sale not being the one expressed in the deed of sale, can the validity of the obligation be impeached on account of this erroneous statement?\nIt is true that an obligation to be binding, must have a legitimate consideration, but it does not follow that an error or even a false statement, as to the consideration, would render the obligation void and of no effect. In such a case the obligation still remains provided that instead of the erroneous consideration mentioned a true and legitimate consideration is proven to have been received. All authors agree on this point. To those already cited by the learned Chief Justice, I will add a decision, rendered by the Cour de Cassation on 28th August, 1807 In re heirs of widow Vivien, which is reported in Merlin's R\u00e1pertoire de Jurisprudence ([18]). The plaintiff in that case, being examined, was obliged to acknowledge the false statement of the consideration of the obligation on which his action was based and to declare that the obligation executed by Mrs. Vivien was not for moneys lent but in order to pay the debt of one of her sons-in-law. In the Court of original jurisdiction and in appeal, his action was dismissed, but he succeeded before the Court of Cassation, their judgment being reported as follows ;\nVu l'art. 1356 du Code Civil; Consid\u00e9rant que la Cour d'Appll de Paris n'a pu consid\u00e9rer l'obligation dont il s'agit, comme sans cause, qu'en adoptant lea aveux' de Gorlay, en ce qu'il avait reconnu la fausset\u00e9 de la cause exprim\u00e9e dans la dite obligation, et en rejetant sa declaration qui lui donnait une autre cause ; d'o\u00fa il r\u00e9sulte violation de la loi pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, qui ne permettait pas de diviser l'aveu judiciaire fait par Gorlay, la cour casse et annulle.\nSee also Laurent:\nJe demanee le paiement d'un billet cause valeur recue en marchandises. Le d\u00e9fendeur nie avoir recu des marchandises et me fait interroger sur faits et articles. J'avoue que la cause eat fausse, mais i'all\u00e9srue une autre cause licite. Mon aveu est-il indivisible. Dans notre opinion oui et sans doute aucun. Telle eat ausi lopinion commune, il y a cependant une decision contraire ? ([19])\nThe respondents admission under the circumstances proved in this case, must be tak\u00e9n in its entirety and make proof in their favor ; the evidence on behalf of the .Appellant confirms as \"well the truthfulness of their avowal. Callahan and Carroll, present at the passing of the deed, agree with the respondents in their statement that the agreed price was $5,000. There is nothing in their testimony which might impeach their credibility; Carroll certainly, whom Callahan had turned out of his partnership to take in Meany, cannot be said to have been in a disposition to favor by his evidence either Callahan or the Respondent\nWith regard to the authorities, founded on the English law cited by Counsel in support of Appellant's contentions I fully concur with the following remark made by the Honorable Chief Justice Dorion:\nThis case is not a commercial case, and must, therefore, be decided by the rules of evidence applicable to civil cases.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion, that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench should be confirmed with costs.\nRitchie and TASCHEREAU, J. J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe Appellant claims to be entitled to a judgment for the difference (being over $2,000), between the amount stated in a contract of sale of goods as the consideration money and the amount actually paid.. The instrument in question contains a receipt for the larger sum and an acknowledgment it was paid. Taking the instrument alone it operates to negative the allegation that anything is due for the goods sold.\nParol evidence is however admissible to show that the whole amount of the stated consideration was not paid; but it is also admissible to prove as was done in this case that the amount claimed was never due or payable as a part of the consideration money for the goods in question. We are remitted, therefore, to the oral agreement between the parties; and if by it we find that the full sum agreed upon was paid, we cannot adjudge a further payment contrary to the undoubted agreement of the parties. To so decide, would, in my opinion, be against both law and equity.\nThe Appellant seeks to open up the written agreement that equity may be done. He that seeks equity must do it, and when the written agreement is opened up it is subject to the equities of both parties. No fraud is suggested.\nI therefore fully concur in the judgment given by my learned brother Fournier, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellant: McMaster Hall & Greenshields.\nSolicitors for respondents: Judah, Wurtele & Branchaud.\n[1] Vo. cause des obligations par.\n[2] Vol. 5, p. 213.\n[3] Vol. 20, Nos. 80, 81, Vol. 24,\n[4] Vol. 6, No. 177, Vol. 10, No. 1 No. 3, p., 249. 339.\n[5] Vol. 10, No. 351.\n[6] Droit Commercial, Vol. 5, No. 373.

J.\nThe Chief Justice was absent when judgment was delivered.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nPlea of Insolvency\u2014Discharge not pleaded\u2014Judgment after certificate granted.\nT. J. W. sued F. B., and, on 9th June, 1873, F. B. assigned his property under the Insolvent Act of 1869. On 6th August, F. B., became party to a deed of composition. On the 17th October F. B. pleaded puis darrein continuance, that since action commenced he duly assigned under the Act, and that by deed of composition and discharge executed by his creditors he was discharged of all liability. On the 19th November, 1873, the Insolvent Court confirmed the deed of composition and F. B's discharge, but F. B. neglected to plead this confirmation. Judgment was given in favor of T. J. W. on the 30th January, 1874. On 30th May, 1876, an execution under the judgment was issued, and on the 28th June, 1876, a rule nisi to set aside proceedings was obtained and made absolute.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that F. B., having neglected to plead his discharge before judgment, as he might have done, was estopped from setting it up afterwards to defeat the execution. (Strong, J., dissenting, on the ground that the rule or order of the Court below was not one from which an appeal could be brought under the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act.)\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, delivered on the 26th March, 1877, making absolute an order to set aside an execution issued on a judgment rendered on the 3rd of January, 1874, by a Judge who, on that day, after a trial of the cause, in a summary way, gave a judgment for the Appellant. The facts and pleadings sufficiently appear in the judgment as hereinafter given.\nMr. Wallace, the Appellant in person:\nThe order was taken out by Respondent to set aside the execution on the ground of his having been an insolvent and obtained his certificate of discharge. This certificate was obtained before the trial or judgment, and as he failed or neglected to plead his discharge, as he might have done, he was forever precluded and estopped from doing so, or deriving any benefit from it in this suit, and the Appellant had a right to issue and enforce the said execution. Bump's Bankrupt Law[1]; Bigelow on Estoppel[2]; Rossi v. Bailey[3]; Rev. Stat. N. S., 4th Series, c. 94, sec. 118.\nNo one appeared on behalf of the Respondent.\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nPlaintiff, on 30th January, 1874, recovered judgment in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against Defendant for $59.19 debt or damage, and $7.57 costs of suit; and on 30th May, 1876, caused to be issued on such judgment an execution against the goods, &c., and for want of goods against the body of Defendant.\nOn June 20th, 1876, Defendant applied to the Chief Justice to set aside and to stay all proceedings under said execution and judgment, on the ground that the debt for which judgment was entered was discharged previous to issue of execution, and set forth that on the 6th August, 1873, by a deed of composition and discharge, between Defendant, of the one part; C.A. Bossom, of the second part; B. H. Eaton, of the third part, and the creditors of F. Bossom, of the fourth part, after reciting that Bossom had made an assignment under the Insolvent Act of 1869, and being desirous of procuring a discharge from his creditors, and had agreed to pay a certain composition, the creditors of said Bossom, in consideration of the matters in said deed contained, discharged and released said Bossom from all his liabilities, in accordance with the terms and provisions of said Act, which discharge was duly confirmed in the Court of Probate and Insolvency, and the said Bossom was, by said Court, on the 19th November, 1878, forever freed and discharged of and from all debts and liabilities existing against him at the time of the making of his assignment under said Act, which was 9th June, A.D., 1873.\nIt appears that the Defendant pleaded to Plaintiff's action on the 23rd May, 1873,\n1st. Never indebted.\n2nd. That he did not make the note declared on. 3rd. That the note was not stamped as required by statute.\n4th. No consideration for making note.\nAnd on the 17th October, 1873, for further grounds of defence, that since commencement of suit, Defendant duly assigned under Insolvent Act of 1867 and Acts in amendment thereof, of which Plaintiff had notice, and by deed of composition and discharge duly executed by the creditors of the Defendant, under the provisions of the Act, Defendant had been discharged from all liability in respect of Plaintiff's claim.\nOn argument at Chambers, and afterwards before the full Court, it was ordered that the rule nisi to set aside the said execution be made absolute with costs.\nThe cause appears to have been duly tried and judgment entered on the 30th January, 1874. No defence appears to have been set up before or at the trial under the discharge of the 19th November, 1873; and, in the judgment of the Court, it is stated, \"it does not appear that that Act of the Insolvent Court was brought to the notice of the Court at the trial of the cause which took place under the plea of puis darrein continuance,\" nor does it appear that any available defence was brought to the notice of the Court, but the contrary must have been the case, otherwise judgment could not have been given for the Plaintiff. The judgment affirms that after hearing argument the rule must be made absolute with costs. \"Sections 94, 98 and 100 of Insolvent Act of 1869, read in connection with section 101, necessitates such a judgment.\" But this, in my opinion, is by no means the case, assuming the facts stated to be true, that the deed was entered into and confirmed, as alleged; the Defendant had a good defence to the action when it was tried, had he properly pleaded and proved his discharge; and nothing has occurred since the trial and judgment in any way affecting Plaintiff's claim.\nNow, it is abundantly clear, that a Defendant can avail himself of his discharge as a certificated bankrupt, or as insolvent debtor, only by a special plea, and if he obtains such discharge after plea and before verdict, if he does not plead and prove it and judgment is obtained against him, he loses the benefit of the discharge; he cannot even plead the certificate to an action on such judgment[4]. If the deed discharged Defendant, he had pleaded it, and should have proved it, and there would have been an end of Plaintiff's case; if it did not, but the confirmation of the deed did, he should not have pleaded the deed, but should have waited till the confirmation, and then have pleaded it; and if he felt embarrassed by his plea already pleaded, he should have applied for leave to withdraw it, and for leave to plead the confirmation. Be this as it may, it is clear that before trial and judgment he had a discharge which he could have made available, had he taken the proper steps at the proper time; not having done so, he has allowed the opportunity to pass and a judgment to be entered against him and execution issued thereon, with which the Court had, in my opinion, no right to interfere. Formerly, relief against a judgment could only be had through the instrumentality of the writ of audita querela, but now this writ has fallen into disuse, the Courts under their equitable jurisdiction, give in a summary manner the same relief as under the audita querela. In Comyn's Digest[5] it is said:\u2014\nWhere the party had time to take advantage of the matter which discharges him and neglects it, he cannot afterwards be helped by an audita querela.\nAnd in Bacon's Abridgment[6] it is said:\u2014\nAn audita querela is a writ to be delivered against an unjust judgment or execution by setting them aside for some injustice of the party that obtained them, which could not be pleaded in Bar to the action, for if it could be pleaded it was the party's own fault, and, therefore, he should not be released, that proceedings may not be endless.\nAnd 2 Sand, R. 147, note 1, is to the same effect.\nThe general rule of law, as was laid by Channell, B., in Staffordshire Building Co. v. Emmott[7], and adopted and relied upon by the Court in Rossi v. Bailey[8], is that the party who might have pleaded and prevented a judgment, and did not, is estopped from afterwards raising that defence. But the Court in Nova Scotia says that \"Sections 94, 98 and 100 of the Insolvent Act of 1869, read in connection with section 101, necessitates such a judgment.\" I have read those sections and can come to no such conclusion. No doubt the legislature might have interfered with the general rule of law and the doctrine of estoppel, but there is nothing in the sections referred to, or in any other part of the Act, that I can discover, shewing any such intention on the part of the legislature, and section 104 exhibits a contrary intention, as it provides how the discharge is to be proved when the Defendant seeks its protection; it enacts that:\nUntil the Court or Judge, as the case may be, has confirmed such discharge, the burden of proof of the discharge being completely effected under the provisions of this Act shall be upon the insolvent, but the confirmation thereof, if not reversed in appeal, shall render the discharge thereby confirmed final and conclusive, and an authentic copy of the judgment confirming the same shall be sufficient evidence, as well of such discharge as the confirmation thereof.\nThe plea relied on the discharge without confirmation; the obvious inference from the Court giving judgment on the trial in favor of the Plaintiff must be, that he neither made good the proof, the burden of which the law cast on him, nor did he allege and prove by the means pointed -out in the Act, the confirmation thereof; and there certainly was ample time between the 19th November, 1873, the day on which the Court confirmed the deed and discharge, and the trial, on the 29th January, 1874, to plead the confirmation. The Defendant having then had a full opportunity of pleading and proving his ground of defence, which sets up the deed of composition, and also, of pleading and proving its confirmation, of all which he neglected to avail himself, though present at the trial by his Attorney and defending the action, and so not having relied on and taken advantage of his discharge and its confirmation, as he might, and should have done, and having thus missed the opportunity afforded him, and allowed a judgment to pass against him, and nothing having since occurred to interfere with the judgment, and Plaintiff's rights under it, he is now concluded, and the Plaintiff is entitled to the fruits of the adjudication in his favor, and the judgment of the Court staying or setting aside either the judgment or execution must be reversed with costs.\nSTRONG, J., gave an oral judgment dissenting, on the ground that the order appealed from was not a final judgment within the meaning of the 17th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act.\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nWhat my learned brother has said has not raised any doubt in my mind; it was not raised by the parties in the Court, it was not argued before us, no one appearing on behalf of Respondent. I fully agree with my learned brother, that it is quite proper for a matter affecting jurisdiction to be raised by the Court, but, if so, I should have thought it just and right before determining that this appeal would not lie to allow the Appellant an opportunity to argue the question. This is the first I have heard of it. I do not at all agree as to the construction of the words \"final judgment,\" because, I think, whatever argument might be plausibly drawn from the term \"final judgment,\" is entirely negatived by the statute itself, and by the interpretation clause which has given a statutory definition to the term \"final judgment.\" The clause says:\u2014\nThe word \"judgment,\" when used with reference to the Court appealed from, includes any judgment, rule, order, decision, decree, decretal order, or sentence thereof; and, when used with reference to the Supreme Court, it includes any judgment or order of that Court.\nIt strikes me at the first blush of the case, that it would be a most dreadful conclusion to arrive at, if a Court could give judgment in favor of a party, and could next day wipe it out, and by a final order of that kind deprive him of the fruits of ids judgment and such final order not be open to an appeal. I think the order comes within the express wording of the statute which I have read. If I had any doubt raised in my mind by the very plausible argument of my learned brother, I should have thought it right to this Appellant, at any rate, to have stayed my hand in giving judgment against him, and to have given him an opportunity to have been heard before the Court. As at present advised, I think my original judgment was the correct one.\nTASCHEREAU and FOURNIER, J.J., concurred with RITCHIE, J.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI entirely agree with the judgment given by brother Ritchie. I considered the case very fully, and having seen his judgment some time ago, considered it necessary to do little more than concur in it. As to the question of jurisdiction I am satisfied. It has not come before me for the first time now, because I have had occasion to consider the effect of the statute giving jurisdiction to this Court in some other cases some time ago. Supposing the judgment were for \u00a35,000, and the party came and were told by the Court below that he has a good judgment, but the Court interferes by some assumed power to prevent his having the benefit of that judgment. To all intents and purposes, as far as the party is concerned, it is a final judgment. By such a decision his regular judgment is virtually set aside, and I consider it therefore to be a final judgment. We are not to suppose that the Court below will hereafter alter its dicision. They have virtually decided that the judgment shall not have any effect, and I think it is as much as if the Court had passed an order directly to avoid the judgment altogether, because if the power of the Court is taken away by its own act to award future process to recover the amount of the judgment, it is as waste paper. I think, therefore, an appeal from the decision of a Court which vacates the judgment is virtually an appeal from a final judgment, and, therefore, in respect to the definition clause referred to by my brother Ritchie, and regarding it as a final judgment, I think we must consider it one of the final judgments referred to in the Act. I think we have the jurisdiction; and if I had any doubt about it, and felt that the decision of the Court was likely to go against the Appellant, I should consider it but right, before delivering the judgment of the Court, to hear him upon the point. It was not raised, but, I take it, when a party does not come here to argue his case, or take the exception, he admits the right of the Court. It is true that we cannot usurp jurisdiction, and even in an undefended case, if we felt we had not jurisdiction, it would be our duty to say so. I have no doubt on this point, and, therefore, concur with the judgment, that the judgment of the Court below should be reversed, and the appeal allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: James McDonald.\n[1] P. 641.\n[2] P. 615.\n[3] L.

To Duncan Ferguson, my son, I bequeath my family Bible, and five shillings over and above what I have done for him * * * To Peter Ferguson, my son, I bequeath my implements belonging to my farm, and to occupy the farm and answer State due sand public burdens himself, and the lawful male offspring of his body until the proper heir are come of age to take possession, but Peter himself and all are restricted and prohibited from giving any wood or timber whatsoever kind away off the land, or bringing any other family on to it but his own. But if he leaves a situation so advantageous, and cannot maintain himself upon it * * * I appoint Peter McVicar, my grandson, to take charge of the whole place\u2014farm, and all that pertains to it\u2014and occupy the same for his own benefit and advantage, according to the forementioned restrictions and conditions, until the heir be of lawful age, as aforesaid.\u201d The testator died in 1849, leaving two sons, D. and P., junr., and three daughters and one grandson, P. McV., being a son of a daughter. When the testator died, the property was subject to a lease, which expired in 1857. P.F., junr., after having gone into occupation, in that year conveyed his interest to P. McV. and left the place. Subsequently the Appellant, son of D.F., and heir-at-law of P.F., senr., took a conveyance from P. McV., and thereupon the Respondent, heir-at-law of P.F., junr., brought an action in ejectment, claiming that under the will his father took an estate tail which descended to him.\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench gave judgment[1] in favor of the heir-at-law, which judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2].\nHeld,\u2014On appeal, that the devise by the testator to his first great grandson being void for remoteness, and there being no intention to give to P.F., junr., any estate or interest independent of, or unconnected with, the devise to the great grandson, there was no valid disposition to disinherit the heir-at-law, and therefore the Plaintiff was not entitled to recover. (Strong, J., dissenting).\nPer Ritchie, J.\u2014Where the rule of law, independent of and paramount to the testator\u2019s intentions, defeats the devise the proper course is to let the property go as the law directs in cases of intestacy.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, on appeal to that Court from the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nThis was an action of ejectment, and was commenced by writ issued on the 23rd July, A.D. 1875, to obtain possession of lot 13, in the 10th concession of the township of Drummond, in the County of Lanark.\nThe Plaintiff claimed title to the premises as heir of entail of Peter Ferguson, devisee in tail male under the last will and testament of Peter Ferguson, his father, deceased.\nThe Defendant, besides denying the title of the Plaintiff, claimed the land as heir-at-law of Peter Ferguson, senior, his grandfather. The Defendant further claimed title by length of possession and by conveyance from Peter McVicar, who derived title as devisee under the will of Peter Ferguson, deceased.\nIt was admitted that Peter Ferguson died seized of the land in 1849, and that the Defendant was his heir-at-law.\nThe portion of the will in controversy between the parties reads as follows:\u2014\n\u201cIt pleased the Lord to give me two sons equally dear to my heart; to give them equal justice, I leave all my land to the first great grandson descending from them by lawful ordinary generation in the masculine line, to him I bequeath it, and to him I will that it pass free of any encumbrance, except the burying ground and the quarter of acre for a place of worship. To Duncan Ferguson, my son, I bequeath my family bible, and five shillings over and above what I have done for him * * * To Peter Ferguson, my son, I bequeath my implements belonging to my farm, and to occupy the farm and answer State dues and public burdens himself, and the lawful male offspring of his body until the proper heir are come of age to take possession, but Peter himself and all are restricted and prohibited from giving any wood or timber whatsoever kind away off the land, or bringing any other family on to it but his own. But if he leaves a situation so advantageous, and cannot maintain himself upon it, * * * I appoint Peter McVicar, my grandson, to take charge of the whole place\u2014farm, and all that pertains to it\u2014and occupy the same for his own benefit and advantage, according to the forementioned restrictions and conditions, until the heir be of lawful age, as aforesaid.\u201d\nWhen the testator died in 1849, Duncan was the elderson, Peter was the second son, and Peter McVicar was the son of a sister; the land at the time was subject to a lease, which expired in 1857. At the expiration of the lease, Peter Ferguson, the son of the testator, went into occupation of the land. On the 24th August, 1857, he conveyed to Peter McVicar, the grandson, who is named in the will. The Defendant, son of Duncan Ferguson, besides being the heir-at-law of the testator, proved a deed to himself of the land from Peter McVicar.\nPeter Ferguson, junr., died in 1864, leaving as his only child the Plaintiff.\nAt the trial (Fall Assizes, 1875) before Patterson, J., without a jury, a verdict for the Plaintiff was entered on the ground that the devise to Peter Ferguson, junr., created an estate tail male in him, that the estate tail had not been barred, and that the Defendant had not made out his defence under the Statute of limitations.\nA rule nisi. was obtained to enter a verdict for the Defendant, which was afterwards made absolute by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nThe Plaintiff then appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which reversed the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench.\nMr. MacLennan, Q.C., and Mr. Burdett, for Appellant:\nThere was no great grandson at the death of the testator, so the will is void either as a lapsed devise or for remoteness. The will reads as follows:\u2014\u201cTo Peter Ferguson, my son, I bequeath my implements belonging to my farm, and to occupy the farm, and answer State dues, &c., and the lawful male offspring of his body until the proper heir are come of age, &c.\u201d These are the words relied on by the Respondent as giving to his ancestor the estate tail. The central object of the testator was to give the estate to his great grandchild and the other directions were merely ancillary to, and not in substitution for, the principal devise, the one having failed the other necessarily failed along with it. The effect of this is that the testator died intestate. If the child had been in being when the testator died, he would have taken the estate as a vested estate in fee; not having been born, however, the devise was execu- tory, to take effect when the child was born: Jarman on Wills[3]. It is not limited to take effect during or at the determination of the supposed estate tail. Suppose the alleged estate tail to terminate to-day, the child\u2019s estate would not arise because he is not yet in being, but the estate, if good, must wait till then and be tied, and we have an estate infringing the rule of perpetuities and incapable of being barred. It follows that the estate to the child is void.\nMoreover, the devise to the grandson being a present gift, it follows that there can be no present gift to Peter Ferguson, otherwise there would be two gifts of the same property to the same person to take effect concurrently, which is impossible and repugnant.\nThe provisions with respect to Peter Ferguson and Peter McVicar are made upon the supposition that the gift to the grand child has taken effect, which makes it clear that these persons were to take no estate, but were to be made guardians or caretakers of the property of another during his minority. To hold that the devise to the grandson is executory, is to change and invert the whole frame and structure of the will, to invert and re-arrange its parts to contradict the plainly expressed intention, and to put a fanciful construction upon it.\nThe Appellant contends, therefore, that the result is that testator\u2019s scheme with regard to his property has fallen, and the subsequent provisions in the will, being solely to carry into effect the main object of the will, cannot be given primary importance, so as to make a will the testator never intended. The learned counsel referred to Christie v. Gosling[4]; Countess of Harrington v. Earl of Harrington[5]; Marcon v. Alling[6]; McKidd v. Brown[7]; and Shaver v. Jamieson et al[8]. Mr. Bethune, Q.C., for Respondent:\nA mere presence of a doubt in the minds of the Court will not justify them in holding a will void, they should struggle against an intestacy. It is clear the testator did not intend an intestacy. The paramount idea was to keep the property in his family as long as possible.\nNow, the devise to the great grandson is either void for remoteness, or gives an executory devise to such great grandson, and, for the purpose of determining who should succeed in this action, it matters not which view is adopted. In either view the proper construction is that, an estate tail was given to Peter Ferguson. Tudor\u2019s L.C.R.P.[9]; Jardine v. Wilson[10]; Re Shaver[11]; It must be assumed that the testator intended to devise his whole estate, Con. S.U.C., ch. 82, sec. 12. This construction will best effectuate the intention of the testator, as it may happen that from Peter may issue the first great grandson of his sons. In any case it will more nearly effectuate it than any other construction, and upon the doctrine of cypr\u00e8s, the Court will give effect to it. Stackpoole v. Stackpoole[12]; Tudor\u2019s L.C.R.P.[13]\nThe deed from Peter Ferguson to Peter McVicar was not operative to bar the entail, because it was not registered within six months after the date of execution. Cons. S.U.C., ch. 83, sec. 31 The deed does not profess to operate upon anything more than the estate and interest of Peter Ferguson, the grantor, and so would not operate under the statute to bar the entail.\nThe term \u201coffspring,\u201d used in describing the gift to Peter, is synonymous with heirs of the body. Thompson v. Beasley[14]; Jarman on Wills[15]; Allen v. Markle[16]. There is nothing to show that the whole estate was to be withdrawn from Peter; on the contrary, the terms used, coupled with the absolute bequest of the chattels to Peter, shows an intention to vest some beneficial enjoyment in Peter. Is there an estate tail to Peter? If so, it does not matter what the nature of devise over is.\nMr. MacLennan, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nThe Plaintiff claims title to the premises in controversy in this suit as heir of entail of Peter Ferguson, deceased, who, he alleges, was devisee in tail male under the last will of Peter Ferguson, his father, also deceased, who died seized in 1849.\nDefendant claims the land as heir-at-law of Peter Ferguson, senior, his grandfather.\nThe only question for our consideration, in the view I take of this case, is, did Peter Ferguson take an estate tail under the will of Peter Ferguson, senior, his father? If this is answered in the negative, then the Defendant, being the heir-at-law of Peter Ferguson, senior, cannot be disturbed in his possession of the premises.\nIt is not to be wondered at that the very extraordinary will of this apparently eccentric testator should have given rise to litigation. The clause of the will we have to consider is in these words:\nSecondly, It pleased the Lord to give me two sons equally dear to my heart; to give them equal justice, I leave all my land to the first great grandson descending from them by lawful ordinary generation in the masculine line, to him I bequeath it, and to him I will that it pass free of any encumbrance except the burrying ground and the quarter of acre for a place of worship. To Duncan Ferguson, my son, I bequeath my family bible and five shillings currency, over and above what I have done for him, with my blessing and prayer for him that by grace he will be able to make the best use of his portion, &c. To Peter Ferguson, my son, I bequeath my implements belonging to my farm, and to occupy the farm, and answer state dues and public burdens himself, and the lawful male offspring of his body until the proper heir are come of age to take possession, but Peter himself and all are restricted and prohibited from giving any wood or timber of whatsoever kind off the land or bringing any other family on to it but his own. But if he leaves a situation so advantageous and cannot maintain himself upon it\u2014painful and humbling thought of him failing\u2014but in case this happening, I appoint Peter McVicar, my grandson, to take charge of the whole place\u2014farm, and all that pertains to it\u2014and occupy the same for his own benefit and advantage, according to the forementioned restrictions and conditions until the heir be of lawful age as aforesaid.\nPeculiar as this devise may be, I do not think it is unmeaning or incomprehensible, and I have not much difficulty in arriving at a conclusion as to what the testator desired to accomplish, but the difficulty I find in the way of giving effect to his wishes is, that the law will not allow him to carry his intentions into effect in the manner in which he has sought to do it, or, in other words, to do what he desired to do and thought he was doing, inasmuch as his devise cannot be brought within the rules of law. He violated the rule against perpetuities, and his devise to the first great grandson of his sons is, in my opinion, consequently of no effect, being void for remoteness.\nMr. Justice Cresswell, in Lord Dungannon v. Smith[17], states the rule:\u2014\nIt is a general rule, too firmly established to be controverted, that an executory devise to be valid must be so framed that the estate devised must vest, if at all, within a life or lives in being and 21 years after; it is not sufficient that it may vest within that period, it must be good in its creation; and unless it is created in such terms that it cannot vest after the expiration of a life or lives in being, and 21 years and the period allowed for gestation, it is not valid, and subsequent events cannot make it so.\nConcurred in, as accurately expressed, by the Master of the Rolls in Merlin v. Belgrave[18]. In construing a will, and more particularly one written by an unskilled person (and this will bears conclusive internal evidence that it did not come from the hands of a lawyer, but was the testator\u2019s own production,) reading the will as indicated on the rule laid down by the Lord Chancellor in Young v. Robertson[19] that:\u2014\nThe primary duty of a Court of Construction in the interpretation of wills is to give to each word employed, if it can with propriety receive it, the natural ordinary meaning which it has in the vocabulary of ordinary life, and not to give words employed in the vocabulary of ordinary life an artificial, secondary, and technical meaning,\nthe first inquiry naturally is what was the idea uppermost in the mind of the testator? What was the primary and principal object he was seeking to accomplish as indicated by the language he has used?\nI think it certainly was not in this case to create and vest in Peter an estate tail, and, contingent and dependent thereon, to give to the first great grandson of Duncan and Peter an estate by way of executory devise. If we take his own words in their ordinary signification, his primary object was to give equal justice to the two sons which it had pleased God to give him equally dear to his heart. That equal justice appears to have been to deprive both sons of the property, and to alter the regular course of descent, and select from the descendants of his sons the person who should become his \u201cproper heir\u201d to inherit his estate, and having made such selection, under the impression, doubtless, that he could legally do so, he used plain and unambiguous language, which I cannot doubt he supposed capable of accomplishing his purpose; and having named an heir so remote, his second and subsiduary object seems naturally enough to have been to make provision for the occupancy and care of the estate until the heir so selected should arrive at lawful age to take possession. These, I think, were the primary and secondary considerations operating on the mind of the testator when he drew the will. Had he selected his grandson Peter McVicar (then 14 years old, named in the will) as his proper heir, he would have accomplished his object; the devise to him would have been good; the provisions for occupancy and care of the property would have been reasonable, and could have taken effect without repugnancy and without any necessity for transposing a sentence or for eliminating one word from the will. In such a case, what pretence could there have been for contending that the devise should be transposed, and that Peter, the son, should take an estate tail and Peter, the grandson, only a contingent estate. To have so held would simply have been to put it in Peter\u2019s, the son\u2019s, power to deprive Peter, the grandson, of his inheritance, and so frustrate the testator\u2019s intentions. Does this not show that the language of the will is capable of a consistent construction without any transposition or elimination, and was capable, by giving effect to all the language of the testator as used by him, of carrying into effect his obvious intentions, provided always the law would allow him to do what he desired to effect.\nEvery will must be construed according to the intention of the testator, and I cannot escape the conclusion that the intention of the testator was to base the occupancy by Peter, his son, on the previous devise to the first great grandchild of his sons, that is to say, to make it ancillary thereto, and consequently dependent thereon; and I can discover no intention to give to Peter Ferguson any estate or interest, independent of, or unconnected with, the devise to the great grand child.\nNo doubt, in this case the testator did not intend to die intestate, but it is not enough that the will exhibits an intention to disinherit the heir-at-law, there must be a valid dispostion of the property in favor of some other party. Here the testator has attempted to make such a disposition, but has failed, simply because such a devise as he made could not take effect, the law not sanctioning or sustaining such a disposition. It is clear, then, that the intention of the testator cannot be carried into effect, because the first great grandson descending from his sons cannot be what the testator calls the \u201cproper heir.\u201d As to the final disposition of the property, the testator appears to have had only one intent, and that was that this \u201cfirst great grandson\u201d should be the \u201cproper heir to it,\u201d and he appears to me to have made, as I have said, the other provisions subordinate thereto, viz.: that the property should be taken charge of until such \u201cproper heir\u201d came of age to take possession, and for remunerating the person to whom the charge is so confided, authorizing him to occupy the same for his own benefit and advantage until such heir be of proper age, but restraining and prohibiting whosoever may be so occupying and in charge \u201cfrom giving any wood or timber of whatsoever kind away off the land, or bringing any other family on it but his own;\u201d and, in case of the first person named to whom such charge was confided \u201cleaving a situation so advantageous and unable to maintain himself upon it,\u201d appointing another in his place under the same restrictions and conditions, language indicating, in my opinion, an occupation or employment in connection with the property as caretaker, rather than the idea of ownership of, or title to, or a disposing power over, the property, and therefore these conditions seem to me consistent only with the idea of the testator\u2019s dealing with the estate for the sole purpose of vesting it in, and preserving it for, the first great grandchild as the proper heir.\nBut the devise to the great grandchild being void, as was said by the Master of the Rolls in Ring v. Hardwick[20], in respect to certain clauses in the will he was considering, \u201cthey are accessories to that which is void, and cannot therefore alter the construction.\u201d To hold that the testator intended that Peter Ferguson should take an estate tail, is to my mind a strained construction, supported by artificial reasoning, and would produce results never contemplated by the testator, and instead of making the legal consequences depend on the construction, make the construction depend on the legal consequences. If the law allowed a devise under the circumstances to a first great grandchild to take effect, then testator\u2019s intentions might have been carried out without any repugnancy, or without rejecting any regulations or conditions imposed by the testator. It is attempted to establish the tenancy in tail by transposing the devise to Peter, and reading it as if it preceded the devise to the first great grandchild, and rejecting or eliminating from the devise the restrictions and conditions imposed on the occupancy of Peter Ferguson as being inconsistent and incompatible with an estate tail, the estate it is sought to confer. While no doubt words and limitations may be transposed, if warranted by the immediate context or the general scheme of the will, they may not be merely on a conjectural hypothesis of the testator\u2019s intention, however reasonable, in opposition to the plain and obvious sense of the language of the instrument[21]. On the contrary, the obvious intent of the language must be adhered to, even though it renders the will inoperative, unless, indeed, the transposition brings out the true intent of the testator, and thus renders what was before obscure clear, for if the transposition leaves the same uncertainty, only giving a different import, it is not allowable. Mr. Redfield[22] says:\u2014 If, however, it gives effect to all the provisions of the will, and renders them all harmonious and consistent both with each other and with the general purpose and intent of the will, it affords very satisfactory ground of presumption that it reaches the source of the difficulty and explains the mode in which it arose.\nIn Chambers v. Brandsford[23] the Lord Chancellor says:\u2014\nLord Hardwick[24] lays down the rule for the construction of wills thus, that the words are often transposed to make sense of a will, otherwise insensible, and to make it take some effect rather than be totally void, but in no case where the words are plain and sensible is a transposition made in order to create a different meaning and construction, much less to let in different devisees and legatees.\nHere, it is clear, the transposition proposed and construction contended for, not only fail to give effect to the evident primary object of the testator, but render quite inoperative provisions and restrictions which the testator, no doubt, deemed substantial and necessary to carry out his views in favor of the object of his bounty, the proper heir.\nThe provisions of the will are, it seems to me, entirely inconsistent with this idea of the creation of an estate tail, and first the devise to the first great grandson\u2014\u201cto him I bequeath it, and to him I will that it pass free from any incumbrance, except the burying ground and the quarter of an acre for a place of worship,\u201d is quite inconsistent with a devise of an estate in tail male to Peter, and the bequest to Peter of \u201cthe implements belonging to my farm,\u201d but as to the farm itself, simply \u201cto occupy the farm.\u201d The restricting and prohibiting the supposed tenant in tail from giving any wood or timber of any kind away off the land, or bringing any other family on it but his own, admittedly inconsistent to sustain the construction, must all be eliminated; so the condition, that in case Peter abandons the occupation, or, in the words of the testator, \u201cleaves a situation so advan- tageous and cannot maintain himself upon it,\u201d he is to lose his situation; that is to say, in case he leaves the situation, the appointment of Peter McVicar, his grandson, \u201cto take charge of the whole place and occupy the same for his own benefit and advantage, according to the same restrictions and conditions until \u2018the heir\u2019 be of lawful age,\u201d being also inconsistent, it is said, must likewise be cast aside.\nThe prominent fact that, at all events, there should be a proper heir who should have the estate and the possession of it when he came of age, taken in connection with the fact that Peter, if he was tenant in tail, could dispose of the property absolutely and bar the entail, and so make the disposition equivalent to a devise to himself absolutely, and enable him to prevent the possibility of the property ever reaching the proper heir, supposing he could take by way of executory devise, is certainly also inconsistent with the testator\u2019s intention of establishing his own proper heir, though I am free to admit that if there was a plain expression of intention, we ought to disregard altogether the legal consequences which may flow from the nature and qualities of the estate, when such estate is once collected from the words of the will itself[25], and construe the will without reference to the possible contingency of carrying that intention into effect. But again, if Peter should not bar the entail, and he had lawful male offspring, and his brother Duncan had the same, and the first great grandson was Duncan\u2019s offspring, the offspring of Peter would take, as heir of entail, to the exclusion of the testator\u2019s \u201cproper heir,\u201d the devise to whom, by way of executory devise, being equally void for remoteness. All this would be entirely inconsistent with the testator\u2019s declared intent. Again, I think the will should not be alter- ed and mutilated so as to justify a construction which would give an estate tail to Peter, because the intentions of the testator would by no means be thereby accomplished, for never, except, so far as I can discover, in the event of one most remote and most uncertain contingency, could the estate ever come to the \u201cproper heir,\u201d and that is, if Peter had children and only one great grand-child, and John had no great grand-child older than Peter\u2019s, and the estate had not been barred in the meantime\u2014then the estate would certainly vest in the eldest great grand-child of the two sons, but then, as tenant in tail, and not as the proper heir of the testator, in which right it was the testator\u2019s evident wish and intention he should take, and not necessarily when he should come of age. These considerations convince me that the testator never contemplated the creation of an estate from which such consequences would flow; and if the creating an estate will not necessarily effect the object the testator sought to accomplish, the construction that creates such an estate cannot, I think, be the right one.\nThere was, no doubt, an intention to disinherit the heir-at-law, but it was not, in my opinion, by giving an estate tail to Peter, the younger son, which would be anything but equal justice to the brothers, even with the curious views of equal justice entertained by the testator, but the intention was to exclude the heir-at-law only for the purpose of substituting another in his place, and this the testator attempted to do by providing in substitution of the heir-at-law the first great grandson of his, the testator\u2019s, two sons as \u201cthe proper heir,\u201d and as he failed to substitute one whom the law would allow to take, we should, if we adopted a construction that will give to Peter an estate tail, to use the words of Lord Cranworth in Hall v. Warren[26]: Be acting in contravention of the well-known rule that the heir-at-law is not to be disinherited, except when the property of his ancestors has been clearly and unambiguously given away from him. We cannot make a new will for the testator simply because the rules against perpetuity prevent his will from being carried out.\nAnd as was aptly remarked by the Vice Chancellor in Mannery v. Bevoy[27],\nThe rules of construction cannot be strained to bring a devise or bequest within the rules of Law.\nThe fact that the testator did not foresee all the consequences of his disposition is no reason for varying it. I do not think this or any other court has a right to re-cast the will and give effect to it by creating an estate the testator, I think, never intended should exist; because, by so doing, the intentions of the testator may, on the one hand, by possibility, be approximately realized, while, on the other hand, the estate may, with much more probability, go in a direction wholly at variance with the intentions of the testator, and this, too, to the disinheriting of the heir-at-law, who is not to be disinherited without an express devise or necessary implication. We are not to make a will for the testator, but simply to expound the will he has made, and this will, so made, must be construed according to the plain meaning and intention of the testator, notwithstanding that the result of so construing it may be to defeat the object which he had in view. This was exemplified in the case of Cunliffe v. Brancker[28], in which case, Jessel, M.R., says:\u2014\nAll I have to do is to construe the instrument fairly, find out what it means, and then to apply the established rules of law to the instrument, and see what the effect will be. I am sorry to say\u2014for it disappoints in this case the intention of the testator\u2014that I cannot bring myself to doubt what the meaning of this will is. The only point in contest, is whether the legal fee in an undivided moiety of freehold land is, or is not, vested in certain trustees. Now, apart from the rule of law about the failure of contingent remainders, I think I may venture to say that no human being who understood anything about real property law would entertain a doubt about the meaning of this will. How far judges may be, or ought to be, able to defeat a rule of law of which they disapprove, I cannot say. I think it is the duty of a judge not to allow himself to be so influenced, but to construe the instrument in a proper way, to arrive at its meaning independently of the results, and then apply the law. This has been laid down over and over again with regard to another rule of law\u2014the rule against remoteness or perpetuity\u2014but I do not see that, because, in the opinion of the judge, the one rule of law is reasonable and the other unreasonable, the rules of construction are to be altered.\nOn appeal, James, L.J., speaking of contingent remainders, says:\u2014\nThat is the Rule of Law, and we cannot help it. We cannot alter the construction of the instrument to avoid or evade that rule. We must construe the words just as if there were no such rule of law, and then, having thus ascertained the construction, apply the rules of law to the instrument so construed.\nIn Gordon v. Gordon[29], The Lord Chancellor (Lord Hatherley) said:\u2014\nI am aware that if there be a doubtful construction of a will the circumstances of the case may be used to guide our choice; but we must not (as has been done in another class of cases with reference to the vesting of portions) first make the construction, which is clear in itself, doubtful, in order to make what we think a more reasonable will for the testator. It is not enough that a will may admit a forced construction. Of course, if it would not, no circumstances could alter the words; but the first course of construction is to read the will in its natural grammatical sense, and then only, if that fail to produce a clear meaning, to look out for some other possible sense. Where a meaning is plain and clear, grammatically, no other should be sought for.\nLord Chelmsford:\u2014\nI admit, of course, the canon of construction that you are in the first place to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words employed; and to this you must adhere, unless other parts of the will, or the general scope and object of it, plainly manifest that the testator meant them in a different sense. Lord Cairns, page 284:\nI take the law on this subject to have been expressed with much accuracy and felicity by Lord Cranworth, than whom no judge more consistently adhered to sound and strict principles of construction in the interpretation of wills. In the case of Abbott v. Middleton[30], before this House, Lord Cranworth speaks thus:\u2014\n\u201cWhere, by acting on one interpretation of the words used, we are driven to the conclusion that the person using them is acting capriciously, without any intelligible motive, contrary to the ordinary mode in which men in general act in similar cases, then, if the language admits of two constructions, we may reasonably and properly adopt that which avoids these anomalies, even though the construction adopted is not the most obvious or the most grammatically accurate. But if the words used are unambiguous, they cannot be departed from merely because they lead to consequences which we consider capricious or even harsh and unreasonable.\u201d\nThe Lord Chancellor in Dungannon v. Smith[31]:\nIf we were to adopt this construction for the purpose of getting out of the difficulty arising out of the law of perpetuities, we should be, in fact, as I consider, making a perfectly new will for the testator; we should be, in the first instance, translating the actual will into a new form, and we should be putting upon that will a construction which, I admit, if the will had been in that form, would have been the true and just construction. I never can lend myself to a measure of this kind, to the process of altering the frame of a will and the phraseology of a will for the purpose of framing, as it were, a new will, in order to put a construction upon it to obviate the difficulties arising out of the law against perpetuities.\nBrett, J.:\u2014\nThe primary rule of construction is to give effect, if possible, to the whole will. If there is a construction which will so operate without doing violence to any part of the will that construction ought to be adopted.\nI agree with Montague Smith, J., in Gravenor v. Watkins[32]:\nThat the will must be read as a whole, and that effect is to be given to all the words as far as it is possible to do so. The intention of the testator can only be arrived at by considering all the language he has employed. And endeavoring (as he did in that case) to reach the mind of the testator through the words which he has used, I have come to the conclusion, when a testator makes such an absurd will as this that no reasonable or legitimate construction can be put on it, which will even indirectly or remotely effect what a fair reading of the language used leads to the conclusion the testator desired to do, and the rule of law, independent of, and paramount to, the testator\u2019s intentions, defeats the devise, if the testator\u2019s selected \u201cproper heir\u201d cannot get the property, I can discern nothing in the will to justify the conclusion that the testator intended the property to go to Peter and his children; but the exact opposite.\nI adopt the language and ruling of the learned Chancellor, Lord Campbell, in Hall v. Warren[33], and say that:\u2014\nWhere there is uncertainty whether the property has been devised or bequeathed away from the heir-at-law or next of kin, the wise course has been to let the property go as the law directs in cases of intestacy.\nThe judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench was, I think, correct, and should be confirmed, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed, and this appeal allowed with costs.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the proper construction of this will is that which has been placed upon it by the Court of Appeal, namely: That Peter Ferguson took an estate tail, subject to an executory devise over in favour of the first great grandson of the testator in the line of either of his sons. The principal object of the testator was manifestly to give the estate in question to his first great grandson. The other provisions of the will, relating to the disposition of the land until the estate should vest in a great grandson, are subsidiary to that leading intention.\nIt is a cardinal rule of construction \u201cthat all the parts of a will are to be construed in relation to each other and so as, if possible, to form one consistent whole.\u201d\nThe estate limited to the great grandson is an executory devise, and not a remainder, since it is limited to take effect in abridgment or defeasance of the prior estate or interest given to the testator\u2019s son, Peter Ferguson.\nThen, the only possible way in which effect can be given to the testator\u2019s intention of giving the property to his great grandson is by holding the preceding estate to Peter Ferguson an estate tail. An estate cannot be limited by way of executory devise to a person not in esse at the testator\u2019s death, unless it must, of necessity, vest within a life or lives in being and twenty\u2011one years afterwards.\nThis is now the established rule against perpetuities, as finally settled by the House of Lords in the case of Cadell v. Palmer[34]. The only exception to that rule is when an estate, which would otherwise be too remote, is limited to take effect immediately on the determination of an estate tail, \u201cbecause the power which resides in the owner of the estate tail to destroy all posterior limitations, executory as well as vested, by means of a disentailing conveyance, takes the case out of the mischief of, and consequently out of the rule against, perpetuities.\u201d The devise to the great grandson must, therefore, be held void for remoteness, unless the provision of the will directing the occupation by Peter Ferguson, the testator\u2019s son, can be held to give him an estate tail. That provision is in these words:\u2014\nTo Peter Ferguson, my son, I bequeath my implements belonging to my farm, and to occupy the farm and answer State dues and public burdens himself, and the lawful male offspring of his body until the proper heir comes of age to take possession, but Peter himself and all are restricted and prohibited from giving any wood or timber of whatsoever kind away off the land, or bringing any other family on to it but his own.\nI think these words confer an estate tail on Peter Ferguson. A gift of the beneficial occupation of land is, of course, sufficient to confer an estate in the land on the devisee[35]; and when such a beneficial occupation is devised to a man and the heirs of his body, the estate so conferred must be an estate tail. Then a devise to A and his offspring is synonymous with a devise to A and his issue[36]; and in the latter form of devise, \u201cissue\u201d is to be construed as a word of limitation and as equivalent to heirs of the body[37]. I read the will as though the testator had said: \u201cI devise the occupation and enjoyment of the farm to my son, Peter Ferguson, and the heirs of his body, until my first great grandson comes of age,\u201d which would have been a clear gift of an estate tail.\nThen, what would have been the effect, if superadded to such a devise as I have just propounded, there had been added the provisions regarding personal occupation and restricting the devisee in the use of the timber. Clearly they would have been rejected as repugnant, and so, equally, in the present case are they, in my judgment, to be rejected for the same reason.\nI can think of no other construction to put on the word \u201coffspring,\u201d used in this connection, than to treat it as a word of limitation equivalent to \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d If we are to give effect to the words introducing the gift over to Peter McVicar, no doubt clearly implying a personal occupation by Peter Ferguson, as indicating that the word \u201coffspring\u201d is not to be read as a word of limitation, and so requiring that the interest of Peter Ferguson shall be cut down to an estate for life, we should be departing from the prim\u00e2 facie construction of the testator\u2019s language for the purpose of defeating the whole scheme of the will. In other words, we should be resorting to the secondary meaning of words with the result of defeating the whole will, whilst the prim\u00e2 facie construction of these same words would give effect to the will to the sacrifice only of some of the minor and subsidiary provisions. Then, referring to Mr. Jarman\u2019s book, I think this is a case eminently proper for the application of two of his rules:\nThe rules of construction cannot be so strained as to bring a devise within the rules of law, but when the will admits of two constructions that is to be preferred which will render it valid[38].\nAnd again:\nLimitations may be rejected when unwarranted by the general scheme of the will[39].\nHere Peter Ferguson either takes an estate tail, which the words are amply sufficient to give, and the will stands subject to the rejection of the provision requiring personal occupation and restricting his dealing with timber, or, he takes a life estate, and the will wholly fails; between these two constructions we have to choose, and I am of opinion that both principle and authority require that that construction should be preferred which gives effect to the primary meaning of the words and renders the will valid, rather than that which reads words in a secondary sense and destroys the will, and makes the testator in effect die intestate.\nI am of opinion, that the order of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed and this appeal be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU and FOURNIER, J.J., concurred with RITCHIE, J. HENRY, J.:\nBoth parties to this controversy claim under the title of one Peter Ferguson\u2014the Respondent as heir of entail, as devisee in tail male, under his last will and testament, and the Appellant as his heir-at-law. It is admitted that the testator died seized in 1849\u2014also, by the Respondent, that the Appellant is the heir-at-law of the testator.\nThe Respondent claims as the son of Peter Ferguson, who, it is alleged, took under the will an estate in tail male. The sole question then is, did Peter, the father of the Plaintiff, take such an estate.\nAfter the devise of a burying ground and a quarter of an acre of land for a church, the testator in his will says:\u2014\nSecondly, it pleased the Lord to give me two sons equally dear to my heart; to give them equal justice, I leave all my land to the first great grandson, descending from them by lawful ordinary generation in the masculine line, to him I bequeath it, and to him I will that it pass free from any encumbrance, except the burying ground and the quarter of an acre for a place of worship.\nThen, after a devise of a bible and five shillings to his other son, Duncan, he bequeathed to Peter the farm implements,\nAnd to occupy the farm, and answer state dues and public burdens himself, and the lawful male offspring of his body, until the proper heir are come of age to take possession.\nThen follow a restriction and prohibition against Peter or any one giving any wood off the land, or bringing any other family on it but his own; and, with this condition, that if Peter ceased to occupy the land, he appointed Peter McVicar, his grandson,\nTo take charge of the whole place\u2014farm and all that pertains to it, and occupy the same for his own benefit and advantage according to the forementioned restrictions and conditions until the heir be of lawful age as, aforesaid. The first, and, as I think, the only devise in the will of the lands in question is to a great grandson, not in being, or who might never exist. There is, therefore, no one to take or hold the title, and, if there were nothing further contained in the will, the title would on the death of the testator devolve on the heir-at-law. He could only be divested by a good devise to operate in favor of some other capable of holding. Was there, then, such a devise to Peter and his heirs? The will does not contain such, as I read it. The testator, no doubt, intended and so ordered, that on certain conditions and with certain restrictions Peter was to occupy, but not for his life, but only so long as he resided upon the property. With that condition annexed to his right, not to own, but merely to occupy, it surely could not be construed as placing him in a position to sell and give a good title immediately on the death of the testator. If he were a tenant in tail he could do so. If he could, where then would be the restrictions and prohibitions of the will against the continuance of his occupancy. The right of occupancy of Peter McVicar was based on the failure of Peter to reside on the property, and it was to be on exactly the same terms. Suppose Peter, the son, died without male offspring before the testator, and that McVicar took his, Peter\u2019s, position as occupant of the property, could he for a moment withstand the right of the heir-at-law? No one will contend that he could. He was to occupy (if he lived so long) \u201cuntil the proper heir be of lawful age, as aforesaid.\u201d He could not, for a moment, be said to have an estate in fee tail, and still his occupancy was to endure as long as that of Peter and his male offspring. Peter had no life estate under the will, for the devise, if any at all, determined his occupancy and all claim upon the happening of an event mentioned in the devise, during his lifetime. The testator limited, as he had power to do, the oc- cupancy of Peter, and when the event happened (as it did in this case) which was to determine it, we cannot say the testator should have ordered and willed differently. If the will gave him clearly an estate for life with a valid remainder over, we need not enquire as to the validity of the devise to the great grandson. The latter is void, amongst other reasons, because there is no legal provision for the holding of the title from the death of the testator. The intention of the testator is clear and plain, but he cannot do what the law forbids, keep the title of his property in abeyance for an indefinite period after his death. To give effect to the will in one respect would be completely to frustrate its object in every other. I cannot perceive what benefit it would be for the Respondent were we to transpose the clauses of the will as suggested, for unless provisions and words are also added, I fail to see how the transposition would alter the construction favorably for the Respondent. If the will first gave the occupancy merely under conditions and prohibitions to Peter and his heirs, until the proper heir was of age, and, pointing out the heir, made a devise to him, as is done by the will, it would not, I think, better the position. The defect is substantially in the reference to Peter and the lands. It cannot be construed into a devise of a fee of any kind, for the words to make it such are not in the will; and because the devise to the great grandson is inoperative, we cannot, for that reason alone, create by our judgment an estate in Peter\u2019s heir which the will does not create. One controlling reason is, that our doing so would not only not be in accordance with, but diametrically opposed to, the clear intentions of the testator. I am, therefore, of opinion the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and the appeal allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellant: Mowat, Maclennan & Downey.\nSolicitors for Respondent: O\u2019Gara, Lapierre & Remon.\n[1] 39 U.C.Q.B. 232.\n[2] 1 App. R.

J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nDistress, exemption from\u2014Replevin.\nW. let an unfurnished house to one Mrs. M. to be used as a boarding-house. Mrs. M. applied to F. & Son for furniture, which they refused to supply unless W. would guarantee that it would not be distrained for rent. W. thereupon signed the following mem. which was delivered to F. & Son by Mrs. M.: \"The bearer, Mrs. M., being about to purchase some furniture from Wm. F. & Son, and my rent being guaranteed, I hereby agree not to take the furniture so to be furnished by Wm. F. & Son for any rent that may become due.\" F. & Son then delivered the furniture to Mrs. M., the said furniture to be paid for by monthly payments, and \"to remain the property of F. & Son till paid for in full.\" W. levied upon the furniture, F. & Son replevied and obtained a verdict which the Court below refused to set aside.\nHeld,\u2014That the mem. signed by W. constituted a binding contract or arrangement with F. & Son not to distrain, and that the judgment of the Court below should be affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, discharging a rule nisi to set aside a verdict in favor of the Respondents.\nThis was an action of replevin, brought by the Respondents against the Appellant, to recover certain household furniture, set out and described in the pleadings and belonging to the Respondents, and which had been seized by the Appellant for rent alleged to be due to him, in respect of the house occupied by one Mrs. C. Maurice, in whose possession, in said house, the said furniture was at the time of the seizure.\nThe declaration is in the ordinary form in cases of replevin under the Nova Scotia law and system of pleading, and the pleas are five in number.\nThe Defendant pleaded:\u2014\n\"First, that he never detained the goods mentioned in the Plaintiffs writ.\nSecond, that the said goods were not the goods of the Plaintiffs, but were the goods of one Emily Maurice.\nThirdly, that the said goods were not the goods of the Plaintiffs, but were the goods of one Creighton, as Assignee of the said Emily Maurice.\nFourthly, that the said goods were not the goods of the Plaintiffs.\nFifthly, that one Emily Maurice occupied a part of a building or house as tenant to the said Defendant, at a yearly rent of $500, payable quarterly\u2014that previously to the time of the alleged detention of the said goods there was due and owing to the Defendant, from the said Emily Maurice, $203, being a balance due on two quarters rent, which fell due respectively on the first day of November and February, then last past, in respect of the said building or house so occupied and leased by the said Emily Maurice from the said Defendant\u2014that the said goods were in that part of said dwelling house so occupied by the said Emily Maurice, and the said rent being so due and in arrear, the said Defendant distrained among other goods the said goods, being then in the said dwelling house, for the said rent, as he had a right to do, and the Defendant was justly detaining them as and for such distress for the said rent so due and in arrear at the time of the issuing of said writ, which rent was at the time of the issuing of said writ still due and unpaid, which is the detention complained of in said writ.\" The Respondents joined issue on the first four pleas, and replied to the fifth plea on equitable grounds, that the Appellant, by fraud and misrepresentation, by a certain paper writing directed to the Respondents, induced the Respondents to furnish the said furniture to the said Mrs. Maurice, who was then a tenant of the Appellant, agreeing in said paper writing, that he, the said Appellant, would not distrain upon any furniture that the Respondents might so supply to the said Mrs. Maurice, in consequence, as stated in said paper writing, of his, the said Appellant's, rent for said house and premises having been secured to him, but that in violation of his said agreement and representation, he, the said Appellant, had seized and levied upon the furniture supplied to the said Mrs. Maurice by the Respondent, in consequence of said agreement, which was the seizure relied upon in the Appellant's fifth plea.\nThe evidence showed that Mrs. Maurice, desiring to purchase some furniture, applied to the Respondents, who were furniture dealers in the City of Halifax, for that purpose. The Respondents refused to supply the furniture without a guarantee or agreement by the Appellant, that the furniture, if supplied to Mrs. Maurice, would not be seized or taken for the rent of the premises occupied, or to be occupied, by the said Mrs. Maurice. Thereupon the following paper was signed by the Appellant, and delivered to Respondents:\n\"The bearer, Mrs. Maurice, being about to purchase some furniture from William Fraser & Son, and my rent being guaranteed, I hereby agree not to take the furniture so to be furnished by William Fraser & Son for any rent that may become due.\n\"T. J. Wallace.\"\n23rd June, 1874.\"\nThe articles were then given to Mrs. Maurice upon the terms mentioned in the following paper, signed by her:\u2014\n\"Halifax, N. S., June 23rd, 1874.\nReceived from W. Fraser & Son the following articles of furniture, for which I am to pay $220.25, or more, in monthly payments of twenty dollars each month from date; the said furniture to remain the property of W. Fraser & Son till paid for in full, and in the event of non-payment monthly, the said W. Fraser & Son can take the furniture back.\n(Sgd.) \"Emily Maurice.\"\nThe goods were specified.\nThe evidence further showed that Mrs. Maurice made some payments, but that a large sum was still due at the time Appellant seized the furniture for his rent.\nThe Appellant offered no evidence, but moved for a non suit, which was refused.\nThe jury found a verdict for the Respondents, and to set aside this verdict a rule nisi was obtained by the Appellant, which, after argument, was discharged. The grounds of the Appellant's motion for the rule were:\u2014\nFirst, because the said verdict was against law. Secondly, because it was against evidence. Thirdly, because the Jury were misdirected by the Judge who tried the cause, the pleading not having been brought to their notice, nor the fact that the replication admitted the Defendant's plea of justification or avowry. Also, in their not being told that there was not evidence to sustain the replication, or that there was no consideration for the agreement signed, or no sale of goods to Mrs. Maurice, as contemplated by the agreement, and also for other causes of misdirection. Fourthly, for the improper reception of testimony on the part of the Plaintiffs. Fifthly, because there was no evidence to support the replication of the Plaintiffs. Sixthly, because the issue was not a correct issue, but contained a replication pleaded improperly and without authority. Seventhly, \"because the Judge accepted an issue and went into the trial, which issue did not agree with the record, and although protested against and objected to by the Defendant. Eighthly, because the issue contained a replication, pleaded after the lapse of more than thirty days from the filing and serving of the pleas without the consent of the Court; or a judge, or of the Defendant.\nA judgment was pronounced by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on the 6th March, A.D., 1877, discharging the rule for a new trial. Against the latter judgment the Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Wallace, Appellant, in person:\u2014\nThe Plaintiffs did not perform their part of the agreement, which was an agreement contemplating an unconditional sale of furniture to Mrs. Maurice. The agreement between Fraser & Son and Mrs. Maurice is indefinite as to price\u2014it says $220.25, or more.\nThe agreement signed by Appellant was in the nature of a guarantee and should be construed strictly. A notice of acceptance of the agreement was necessary, and notice of the terms upon which goods were furnished should have been given. If Respondents sold goods as was contemplated by paper signed by Appellant, their remedy, if any, would be in the nature of an action on the case and not in replevin, as they would, in the event of a sale, have in right of property or of possession. And if they did not sell absolutely, they did not do what they were obliged to do to obtain any rights under that paper, and could not sustain any action. Benjamin on sales[1]; Parsons on contracts[2]; Addison on contracts[3]. There was misdirection on the part of the learned judge, who, in his charge, gave a positive direction to find a verdict against Appellant. Hilliard on new trials[4]. The replication being pleaded after 30 days should have been pleaded by leave of the Court or a Judge. Rev. Stats. Nova Scotia, ch. 94, sec. 142.\nMr. Ferguson, for Respondents:\u2014\nPlaintiffs were in a position to bring replevin. This is shown by the mem. of sale. It is proved that it was on the faith of the representation given by Mr. Wallace that the goods were sold; and that the sale was not an absolute one makes no difference. The facts constitute an estoppel in pais. Addison on contracts, last American ed[5]; Packard v. Sears[6]; McCance v. L. & N. W. Ry. Co.[7]; Freeman v. Cooke[8]; Walker v. Hyman[9]; Erie Ry. Co. v. Delaware Ry. Co.[10]; Trowbridge v. Matthews[11]; Gregg v. Wells[12]; Regnell v. Lewis[13].\nIt is not necessary to plead an estoppel in pais. Evidence of it may be given under the general issue: Taylor on evidence, 4th Eng. ed.[14]; Bullen & Leake's Precedents of Pleadings under title of \"Estoppel.\" There is nothing to show that any exceptions were taken to judge's charge: Gibbs v. Pike[15]; Green v. Bateman[16]; Cotterell v. Hindle[17]. As to waiving right to distance Horsford v. Webster[18].\nMr. Wallace, in reply. RITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nThis was an action of replevin. The circumstances were very simple indeed. The Defendant owned property in the City of Halifax, and he was about to lease it to a Mrs. Maurice, she intending to keep a boarding house and restaurant, and it became necessary, of course, in the occupation of a house under any circumstances, but more particularly one of that character, to have furniture, and a quantity more than would be otherwise necessary. She had not that furniture', and was about making an arrangement with Fraser & Son, the Plaintiffs in the present action; and Fraser & Son, fearing that if they gave her the furniture it might be distrained for rent, as it was not to be paid for immediately, insisted that the property should remain in them, and required before delivery that they should have a guarantee from the Defendant, the landlord, that the property should not be liable to be distrained for rent. Mrs. Maurice procured from Mr. Wallace, the landlord, and delivered to the Plaintiffs, the following written undertaking:\u2014\nThe bearer, Mrs. Maurice, being about to purchase some furniture from William Fraser & Son, and my rent being guaranteed, I hereby agree not to take the furniture so to be furnished by William Fraser & Son for any rent that may become due.\nT.

WALLACE.\n23rd June, 1874.\nBefore acting on this guarantee, Mr. James Fraser, on behalf of the Plaintiffs, called upon Mr. Wallace with the order or authority signed by him and he recognized it as his own, and stated that it was in his handwriting, and in no way repudiated, either its existence as an instrument from him, or its binding effect as indicated upon its face. The Plaintiffs, after getting the paper, delivered the furniture on the faith of it to Mrs.\n______________________\n* The Chief Justice was absent when judgment was delivered. Maurice, and it was put into the house leased by the Defendant, their agreement with Mrs. Maurice being in these words:\u2014\nReceived from W. Fraser & Son the following articles of furniture, for which I am to pay $220.25, or more, in monthly payments of twenty dollars each month from date; the said furniture to remain the property of W. Fraser & Son till paid for in full, and in the event of non-payment monthly, the said W. Fraser & Son can take the furniture back.\nEmily Maurice.\nThe goods were specified and the receipt was dated Halifax, N.S., June 23, 1874.\nThe rent being in arrear, the Defendant subsequently distrained, and the goods not having been paid for, Plaintiffs replevied them as their property, and as having been distrained in defiance of Defendant's undertaking to the contrary.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sustained the Respondents' contention in this case, and the Defendant has now appealed to this Court, and desires that this Court should hold that that furniture was distrainable while on the premises. I think there is not the slightest pretence for any such contention. It is clear that the landlord had a substantial interest in getting Plaintiffs to furnish his tenant with furniture to enable her beneficially to occupy the premises and carry on her business as a restaurant and boarding house keeper, for which a certain amount of furniture was indispensable, and so enable her to pay her rent; and having taken the precaution to get his rent guaranteed, he appears to have been willing to rely on this guarantee, and to waive his right of distress so far as Plaintiffs' goods were concerned. If that guarantee has proved valueless, surely that can be no reason why his undertaking not to distrain should be likewise of no avail to protect the furniture of Plaintiffs from seizure. This instrument given by Defendant is not a contract between Mrs. Maurice and Mr. Wallace, but evidently a contract or arrangement entered into between Mr. Wallace and Messrs. Fraser & Son, because he does not say: \"I agree with Mrs. Maurice that this property shall be free from distress;\" and so make a contract between Mrs. Maurice and himself, but he says: \"The bearer, Mrs. Maurice, being about to purchase furniture, &c.,\" showing he gave it to her only as a carrier or bearer. To whom then did he intend it to be delivered, and with whom did he intend to stipulate? Evidently, the Respondents, because he goes on to mention their names, and agrees not to take the furniture so to be supplied by them. This Defendant sends by Mrs. Maurice to Fraser & Son, and thus agrees with them, that, if they put their furniture on the leased premises, it shall not be distrainable for rent.\nA number of points were raised. One chiefly relied on was, that this guarantee only protected furniture which was to be sold, and in which the property passed from Messrs. Fraser & Son to Mrs. Maurice; but the whole scope of the arrangement is, in my opinion, inconsistent with that contention; for, if the property was to pass out of William Fraser & Son and into Mrs. Maurice, and so W. Fraser & Son were to be denuded of all interest in the property, what possible benefit could it be to Plaintiffs that it should not be distrained, because it would be Mrs. Maurice's and no longer their property. Then, it is contended, that this is not a sale at all\u2014not such a sale as was contemplated. I think it is just what was contemplated, by which the tenant was to obtain furniture on certain terms, but the property was to remain subject to the vendor's right to resume possession of it on certain conditions, and the form they adopted amounted to this: \"I retain the property in these goods solely as a security for the payment of the money.\" I think that Mr. Wallace, having stated that his rent was guaranteed, and having agreed, if the Respondents' supplied this property, that he would not distrain, and they, the Respondents, having, on the faith of that, supplied the furniture, Wallace had no right to interfere with the property; his allegation that the guarantee for his rent became worthless, is neither a justification nor excuse for distraining in direct opposition to his agreement, and affords no reason why the guarantee he gave Messrs. Fraser & Son should not be valid and binding. I think, if Mr. Wallace could be allowed to get property under such circumstances on his premises, and then subsequently to distrain on it, it would, as Mr. Baron Gurney said in the case of Horsford v. Webster[19], \"just be a trap in which to catch the man's property.\" There are many authorities in reference to this matter.\nIn William's notes to Saunders[20], Poole v. Longueville and others, we find:\u2014\nIt was held, that cattle going to London, and put into a close with the consent of the landlord, and leave of the tenant to graze for a night, might be distrained for rent; Fowkes v. Joyce, 2 Vent. 50, but the owner of the cattle was afterwards relieved in equity on the ground of fraud in the landlord, who had consented to the cattle being put into the close, and afterwards distrained them for rent, and he was decreed to pay all the costs both of law and equity. And it should seem that at this day a Court of law would be of opinion, that cattle belonging to a drover being put into a ground with the consent of the occupier to graze only one night, on their way to a fair or market, were not liable to the distress of the landlord for rent.\nIn re Giles v. Spencer[21], Willes, J., delivering the judgment of the Court, says:\u2014\nIn Horsford v. Webster[22], no difficulty was suggested on the Bench or at the bar as to the specific effect of an agreement by a landlord not to distrain the goods of a stranger upon the land.\nBullen on Distress[23], says:\u2014 The right of distress for rent, of whatever kind, may be taken away or suspended by an express or implied agreement not to distrain. Thus, where certain eatage, amongst other things, belonging to the tenant of a farm, was about to be sold by a creditor under a bill of sale, but before the sale took place the landlord put in a distress for rent; whereupon it was agreed that the sale by the creditor should proceed, and the landlord be paid his arrears out of the proceeds of the eatage and other things; the Court held that a contract by the landlord might be inferred not to distrain the cattle of a purchaser put on the land to consume the eatage. Horsford v. Webster, 1 C. M. & R. 699.\nSo in the case of Cairncross v. Lorimer[24], The Lord Chancellor says:\u2014\nThe doctrine will apply which is to be found, I believe, in the laws of all civilized nations, that if a man, either by words or by conduct, has intimated that he consents to an act which has been done, and that he will offer no opposition to it, although it could not have been lawfully done without his consent, and he thereby induces others to do that from which they might otherwise have abstained, he cannot question the legality of the act he had so sanctioned, to the prejudice of those who have so given faith to his words, or to the fair inference to be drawn from his conduct.\nI had not any doubt, individually, upon the case when it was argued, and I have had no doubt since upon it. I am satisfied that that instrument was given to the Respondents for the purpose of inducing them to put that property on the premises under the assurance and undertaking of Mr. Wallace that his rent was guaranteed to him, and he would not distrain upon it. I do not propose to refer to all the cases in point, because they are familiar to all of us. Law and justice are both so unquestionably with the Respondents, that I am astonished the case should ever have been brought here.\nI have, therefore, no hesitation in expressing the opinion that the judgment ought to be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs. STRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe only point on which I had any doubt was as to the sufficiency of the defence set up by the equitable plea and whether the Plaintiff's remedy was not a cross action. It occurred to me that, the property in question being chattels, a Court of Equity might have refused to take jurisdiction. I think, however, on consideration, that it is clear there was jurisdiction in the present case. Equity will not interfere to restrain a sale of chattels, unless they are of peculiar value, or some fiduciary relationship exists between the parties. In the present case, however, the last reason applies, for by the agreement between the Plaintiffs and Mrs. Maurice, a trust was constituted of these chattels, and the Defendant was a party bound by that trust. That a Court of Equity will always interfere to protect fiduciary ownership of chattels of any kind, is a proposition for which many authorities may be cited. I need only refer to two: Wood v. Rowecliffe[25]; Pooley v. Budd[26].\nLord Cottenham says, in Wood v. Rowecliffe:\u2014\nWhen a fiduciary relationship subsists between the parties, whether it be the case of an agent, or trustee, or a broker, or whether the subject matter be stocks, or cargoes, or chattels of whatever description, the Court will interfere to prevent a sale, either by the party interested in the goods, or by a person claiming under him through an alleged abuse of power.\nThese authorities are conclusive, and it is most satisfactory to me to be able to concur in the judgment of the Court dismissing this appeal with costs.\nTASCHEREAU and FOURNIER, J. J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nI concur in the judgment. I think the reason given by the Defendant for avoiding the effect of the document he signed\u2014that, the sale was a semi-conditional one\u2014cannot be maintained, because his document was a general one. It had an object\u2014to keep property sold by Fraser on conditions to that woman free from his right to distrain under any circumstances. I consider with my brother Ritchie, that this bargain was virtually made with Fraser & Son. Their names are mentioned in the body of it as the persons who were to see it, and be governed by it, and I think it is just the same as if directed to them at the top or bottom of the letter. The substance is exactly the same. He agrees\u2014and it appears to me it must be with Fraser he agrees. Therefore, I think the party, by what he did, induced Fraser & Son to sell this furniture and place it in possession of this woman in the house of the Defendant, and, therefore, having induced them to place it in that position, and having agreed that he would not interfere with it when so placed, I think he is estopped from doing that which he himself undertook he would not do. I think, in regard to all the points that were raised on the part of the Plaintiffs and of the Defendant, the judgment should be in behalf of the Plaintiffs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: Thomas J.

St. of N. S.\u2014Attachment\u2014Demurrer\u2014Conversion by Sheriff\u2014Corporation, sale by\u2014Justification under Order of Court\u2014Seal.\nOne H. instituted proceedings against the L. C. M. Company, the officers of which resided in the United States, but which did business in Nova Scotia, and, on the 25th May, 1872, caused a Writ of Attachment to be issued out of the Supreme Court at Amherst, under the absent and absconding debtors Act of Nova Scotia,[1] directed to the Appellant, the High Sheriff of the County of Cumberland. Under this Writ, the Appellant seized certain chattels, as being the chattels of the said Company. On the 12th November, 1872, an order was issued out of the said. Court, directing the Appellant to sell, and the Appellant did sell said chattels as being of a perishable nature. On the 11th December, 1874, a discontinuance was filed in the said cause by H. On the 30th May, 1876, the Respondent commenced an action against the Appellant for the conversion of the chattels in question, contending that the Company, having failed in its operations and being desirous of winding up its affairs, and being indebted to him, had sold and conveyed to him the said chattels by a certain memorandum of sale, dated July 5th, 1867, \"signed on behalf of the Company,\" by one \"Hawley, agent.\" To this memorandum a seal was affixed which did not purport to be the seal of the Company. The Appellant pleaded to the Declaration, that he did not convert; goods not Plaintiff's; not possessed; and also a special plea of justification, setting forth the proceedings by H., and that he had seized and sold the goods as the goods of the Company, in obedience to the attachment and order issued in said proceedings. The Respondent replied, setting up the discontinuance. The Appellant rejoined that the proceedings were not discontinued, and that the discontinuance was not filed till after the sale. He also demurred, on the ground that being bound to obey the order of the Court, he could not be affected by the discontinuance., At the trial a verdict of $500 damages was rendered for Respondent. The Appellant obtained a rule nisi to set aside verdict, and the rule and demurrer were argued together. The. Court below refused to set aside the verdict and gave judgment for Plaintiff on the demurrer.\nHeld,\u2014That the appeal should be allowed; that the plea of justification showed a sufficient answer to the declaration; that the replication was bad, and that the verdict must be set aside and judgment be for the Defendant on the demurrer.\nRitchie, J., dissented, on the ground that the seizing under the attachment, and not the sale, constituted the conversion; that there was sufficient evidence to show that the chattels in question had been transferred by the Company to Respondent, and that under Sec. 15, ch. 53 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, the sale of the chattels did not require to be under the corporate seal of the Company.\nPer Strong, J.: The sale, and not the seizure, was the conversion complained of, and to this the order of the Court was a sufficient answer. Semble, a mere taking of the goods of a third person under a mesne attachment against a Defendant to keep them in medio until the termination of the action is not a conversion.\nPer Henry, J.: The order for sale would not have been a justification for the original levy on the goods, as well as for the sale, if they had been the property of the Respondent, but the evidence failed to show a sale by the Company to the Respondent. Such a sale would require to be under the corporate seal of the Company, and did not come within the meaning of Sec. 15, ch. 53 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia.\nThis was an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, giving judgment on demurrer in favour of the Plaintiff (Respondent), and discharging a rule nisi, granted to the Defendant (Appellant), to set aside the verdict for the Plaintiff.\nThe Lawrence Coal Mining Company, a body corporate, incorporated out of Nova Scotia, in the State of Massachusetts, in the United States of America, under the Joint Stock Companies Act of Nova Scotia, commenced coal mining operations in 1862 on a colliery property at or near river Hebert, in the County of Cumberland, in the Province of Nova Scotia, purchased from one George Hibbard, and continued to work the same until 1865, when the Company became hopelessly, insolvent. Hibbard, the former owner, who resided on the spot, continued from the outset to be a Director, and was the only resident Director in Nova Scotia, and was Managing Director from 1862 up to the spring of 1867, excepting only one season in 1864, and as such had charge of all the property of the Company. He also attended all the annual meetings of the Company held at Boston.\nTo enable the Company to carry on its operations, the Company, through Hibbard as Managing Director, obtained from Bradley a loan of $10,000, for which Hibbard, as Managing Director, gave a note or notes and a warrant to confess to Bradley, the Respondent, on which judgment was entered up by Bradley for $10,022.75, for principal and interest, on the 11th September, 1865. In 1866 the real and personal property was advertized for sale under Respondent's judgment, and the' real estate was sold to him for $3,975, leaving $6,025 still due; the personal property was not sold, and remained on the premises until July, 1867, when Hawley, as agent of the Company, transferred it to Respondent, who, in consideration of the transfer, gave up notes and claims for about $1,500. Hawley, at the same time, gave the following memorandum of sale (filed in the case as exhibit A):\u2014\n\"River Hebert, Cumberland County,\n\"Nova Scotia, July 5th, 1867.\n\"Know all men by these presents, that Benjamin Bradley, of Boston, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America, has this day purchased through T. R. Hawley, authorized to sell the same, the following described property, with the exception of two horses previously sold by his representative, Ezra C. Dillingham.\n\"Signed on behalf of the Company by\n\"T. R. Hawley, Agent, (Seal).\n\"Signed in behalf of Benjamin Bradley, the purchaser, by\n\"Ezra C. Dillingham, (Seal).\"\nGeorge Moffat, (Seal).\nWitness: Nathan J. Hoey, (Seal).,\nHis\nJesse E. Hoey, X (Seal).\nMark.\nThere was no seal to this document purporting to be the seal of the Company, nor had any resolution been passed by the shareholders authorizing a sale by Hawley, but at an adjourned meeting of the Company, held on the 26th February, 1866, it had been, on motion, voted that Messrs. Hawley, W. G. Howe and Alden, should be and were thereby authorized to sell all the real and personal estate, and also the leasehold of the Company for such sum or sums, and on such terms as in their judgment would be for the best interest of the Company, and pay the proceeds of such sale into the hands of the Treasurer for the benefit of the creditors of said Company, and if the amount of such sale exceeded the debts the balance to be paid pro rata among the stockholders.\nFrom the date of the sale, Bradley, and others claiming under him as proprietors, employed an agent to take care of the property, and paid all taxes and expenses connected with it. The mem. of sale was delivered by Hawley to Alden, who acted as Secretary of the Company. No meetings of the Company were held subsequent to that of the 26th February, 1866, until December 30 and 31, 1874, when the Company, being still largely indebted to Respondent on his judgment, by a resolution unanimously adopted by the shareholders present, further resolved that all the interest of the Company in the mining lease of the Company be transferred to Respondent.\nOn the 25th May, 1872, Hibbard, who claimed $1,760 from the Company, brought an action against the Company, and caused a writ of attachment to be issued out of the Supreme Court at Amherst, under the absent or absconding debtors Act of Nova Scotia[2], directed to the Appellant, as High Sheriff of the County of Cumberland, requiring him to seize, and in obedience to the writ the Appellant did seize, certain chattels as being the chattels of the said Company.\nOn the 12th November, 1872, an order was issued out of the said Court, directing the Sheriff to sell the said chattels, as being of a perishable nature within the meaning of sec. 6, of the last mentioned Act; and they were sold by the Sheriff.\nOn the 11th December, 1874, a discontinuance of the cause \"and all proceedings thereunder,\" was entered in the action brought by Hibbard against the Company.\nOn the 30th May, 1876, the Respondent, contending that the chattels in question were his property, commenced an action of trover against the Appellant, the Sheriff, for the conversion of the said chattels.\nThe Appellant pleaded to the declaration:\u20141st. That he did not convert. 2nd. That goods were not the property of the Plaintiff. 3rd. Not possessed. And 4th. A special plea of justification setting forth the proceedings by Hibbard, against the Lawrence Coal Mining Company, and that the Defendant, as Sheriff, under the said writ of attachment, and the said order made in such proceedings, seized and sold the chattels in question as and being the chattels of the Company.\nThe Plaintiff replied to the fourth plea, that after the proceedings aforesaid the said proceedings were discontinued.\nThe Defendant rejoined that the proceedings were not discontinued, and that the discontinuance was not filed till after the sale in the fourth plea mentioned.\nHe also demurred to the replication, on the ground that, being bound to act in obedience to the order of the Court, he could not be affected by a discontinuance of a suit under which property was sold.\nThe Plaintiff joined in demurrer.\nThe issues of fact were tried at Amherst on the 16th October, 1876, before the Chief Justice, Sir William Young, and a jury, when a verdict was rendered for the Respondent for five hundred dollars damages.\nThe Appellant obtained a rule nisi to set aside the verdict, and the said rule nisi and the demurrer were argued together.\nThe Court below, after argument, gave judgment refusing to set aside the verdict, and, on the 2nd April, 1877, a rule was made ordering that the rule nisi be discharged with costs, and that the Plaintiff have judgment of the demurrer with costs.\nThe Appellant, thereupon, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMr. Gormully, for Appellant:\u2014\nThe Respondent claims title to the chattels in question by a transfer or conveyance thereof from the Lawrence Coal Mining Company. If once admitted to be the property of the Company, they must so remain until divested. The principal question is whether there was an actual sale of the goods; whether exhibit A had the effect of transferring the chattels to Bradley; I contend it had not. That document must operate either as a contract or conveyance. If it operates as a contract, it must be regarded as a contract under seal, or as a simple contract. It is not binding on the Company, because it does not purport to bind them, and because the seal affixed is not the corporate seal of the Company, which was necessary, there having been evidence of the existence of one. Sec. 15, ch. 87, Rev. Stat., N. S., 3rd series, only establishes as a rule of statute law what was formally a rule of common law. It has been held that as to personalty a corporation could sell it, but whether they could do so, except under seal, is another question.\nThe Statute says: \"Acts within the scope of their charter.\" This sale, purporting to convey all the property, and showing an intention to abandon the object for which the Company was incorporated, should have been under seal.\nHawley never was duly authorized. There never was a meeting respecting the sale, and no evidence of that concerted action which was necessary.\nD'Arcy v. The Tamar, Kit Hill and Callington Railway Co.[3]; Ridley v. Plymo Grinding Co.[4]. There is no evidence that the Company delegated their power; and further, if they did delegate it, they had no right to do so. The last delegation of authority is to Hawley, Howe and Alden\u2014and this was a power which must have been exercised by all three, and was not a power which could be delegated. The Respondent was bound to know what was being done. Exparte Brown[5].\nThe transaction was a fraudulent one as against the statute of Elizabeth[6], there was no change of possession, and this was a document which should have been registered under the statute.\nThe learned counsel then proceeded to argue that the learned judge who tried the action had improperly admitted evidence and had misdirected the jury; and that as to the demurrer, the Appellants fourth plea was good in law, and replication bad because it admits and does not sufficiently avoid the plea:\nMr. Halliburton, Q. C., for Respondent:\u2014\nThe Company became indebted to Bradley for an advance of $10,000. In 1865, they find themselves insolvent. Hibbard, from whom the Company purchased their mine, was the only director resident in Nova Scotia, and was the only person up to this date who had any benefit from the Company. He attended all the meetings and was familiar with all that was done. In 1865, meetings were called, but nothing was done, and at last Bradley enters up judgment and issues execution. He unwisely allowed the matter to stand over to save Sheriffs' fees, and a conveyance became necessary from, the Company. Five days after the sale of the personal property, Hibbard renders an account, showing $25 due him. The Company set off against that the rent, and considered they had paid every body; they supposed all claims were paid both in Canada and the United States. The Company authorized Hawley to go to Nova Scotia to sell the property.\n[RITCHIE, J.:\u2014Will you show us from the evidence that he was authorized by the Company?]\nThere is no one at present claiming the property except Bradley. The Company did not claim it, nor any shareholder or director on behalf of the Company.\n[THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014A question has been raised which seems important. This property was sold by order of the Court as perishable property. How can the Sheriff be held responsible for selling this specific property under the order of the Court?]\nI am prepared to show that the Sheriff, under the circumstances, was not justified in selling.\nWhere there is a seal, the seal must be presumed to be the seal of the Company. Ontario Salt Co. v. Merchants Salt Co. (limited)[7].\n[RITCHIE, J.:\u2014Where is the evidence that Hawley had any right to use the seal of the Company?]\nIt is to be presumed he had the right.\n[RITCHIE, J.:\u2014What evidence raises this presumption?]\nThe Company took this man's money, which was the consideration for the sale.\n[RITCHIE, J.:\u2014If you can show that this party was professing to act for the Company and entered into this sale, and afterwards the Company had known of the facts and received the money, you will have good evidence that the sale was the sale of the Company.]\nIn 1874 a general meeting of the Company was called, and it is to be presumed the Company ratified the action of Mr. Hawley. When proceedings have been manifestly illegal between a Company and an individual, and the Company choose to continue these dealings, that is a ratification by the Company of such dealings.\n[HENRY, J.:\u2014The difficulty seems to me to be that there were no meetings, and no Company.]\nIt is to be presumed all necessary by-laws were passed to continue the Company, and the meeting of 1874 was a ratification of what was done before.\nThe transfer purporting to be signed and sealed by R. Hawley, as their agent, was given to the Secretary of the Company, and was never repudiated by them, and Bradley continued thenceforth to be in undisputed possession of the property and paid taxes on it, and employed an agent to take charge of it.\nEven though the Company could not contract directly except under seal, yet they could without the corporate seal appoint an agent, whose acts and contracts within the scope of his authority were binding on the Company. 3 P. Wms. 419. 1 Fonb., 305; Phil. Ed., n. o. Abbott's Dig. of Law of Corporations[8].\nThe sale was not ultra vires, but was a lawful means of making the most of the assets of the Company to discharge its liabilities. Featherstonehaugh v. Lee Moor Porcelain Clay Co.[9]; Burrell on assignments, 36.\nThe promises and engagements of a Company may as well be implied from its acts and the acts of its agent as if it were an individual. Abbott's Dig. of Law of Corporations[10].\nIn a case like the present the law presumes omnia rite acta and, unless the contrary appears, that all necessary by-laws and resolutions have been passed necessary for the validity or ratification of the acts performed by the Company's agent. Field on Corporations[11].\nThe Company, after notice to it of sale by Hawley, did, by their acquiescence for so many years in the possession of Respondent of the personal property sold to him, by their accepting therefor notes, &c., to the amount of $1,500, and by their unanimous vote in 1874 in further satisfaction of the balance due Respondent, that the lease of the mine should be transferred to him, ratify and confirm the sale of the personal property to Respondent by Hawley, as their agent; and it must be assumed that all necessary by-laws and resolutions had been passed and adopted to ratify and confirm the sale by Hawley, as agent of the Company. To enforce an executory contract against a corporation it may be necessary to show that it was by deed: but where the corporation has acted upon an executed contract, it is to be presumed against them that everything has been done that was necessary to make it a binding contract upon both parties, they having had all the advantage they would have had if the contract had been regularly made.

Till[20]; Angel & Ames on Corporations[21]; Bigelow on Estoppel[22].\nIf any question could be raised as to the power of the Company to sell, or the agency of Hawley, or as to the validity of the sale by him, or as to the ratification of such agency, or of such sale by the Company, it is settled by the provisions of the Nova Scotian Act respecting factors and agents. Rev. Stat. Nova Scotia, Fourth Series, App. 63, secs. 1\u201410.\nThe Respondent further contends that Appellant's plea of justification is bad in substance, for the following reasons:\u2014\nBecause it appears by it that the attachment under the Nova Scotian Act respecting absent or absconding debtors, was issued against \"a body corporate doing business in Nova Scotia,\" the said Act not extending to such a company, but only to companies \"incorporated out of the Province and doing business by an agent within the Province.\" Rev. Stat. Nova Scotia, Fourth Series, ch. 97.\nBecause, even if sec. 6 of the said Act refers to such foreign companies doing business in Nova Scotia, it does not appear that the goods in question were exhibited to the Sheriff as the goods of the Company, nor does it appear that they were valued by two sworn appraisers, or that the amount of appraisement was endorsed on writ of attachment, or that the Sheriff levied on such part of the goods as would be sufficient to refund the sum so sworn to, &c.\nBecause, if sec. 7 is also applicable to such foreign companies, it does not appear that notice of such assessment was given to the agent of the Company, or that the three days were allowed him to find security; nor does it appear that the prothonotary had any power to issue the order for sale in consequence of the absence of a judge. Rex. v. Croke[23].\nBecause the plea of justification does not show that the Sheriff has made a return of the writ of attachment, without which he cannot be allowed to justify in such a case. Rev. Stat. Third Series, ch. 40, s. 13. Rowland v. Veale[24]; Cheaseley v. Barnes[25]; Freeman v. Bluett[26]; Williams v. Babbitt[27]; also, American cases cited in 2 Greenleaf on Ev., 597.\nAnd Respondent further contends:\u2014That as it is only service of summons on the agent of a foreign company doing business in the Province by an agent, which the statute says \"gives jurisdiction to the Court,\" and as it appears that the summons was served on the agent of Respondent, and not of the company, the Court had no jurisdiction, and the writ of attachment and order for sale, and all proceedings thereunder, were null and void; that a Court of law has in itself no inherent power or right to order perishable goods seized under attachment to be sold, La Rochelle v. Piche et al[28]; and that sec. 6 and 7 of Absent or Absconding Debtors Act does not extend to foreign companies doing business in the Province by an agent, and the Court has no power to order a sale of their property under the said Act, and that all proceedings for a sale of such property are therefore null and void. \"When the Court has no jurisdiction of the cause, the whole proceeding is coram non judice, and actions will lie against the above mentioned parties without any regard to the precept or process, and in this case it is not necessary to obey one who is not judge of the cause.\" Broom, L. M. 90, Taylor v. Clemson[29]. Factum a judice, quod ad officium jure non pertinet, ratum non est. \"A plea of justification by a constable acting under the warrant of a justice will accordingly be bad, if it does not show that the justice had jurisdiction over the subject matter upon which it is granted.\" Taylor v. Clemson[30]; Broom's Prac.[31]; Broom, L. M.[32].\nAs to evidence necessary in support of defence, see Crocker on Sheriffs[33].\nMr. Gormully in reply:\u2014\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nThis was an action brought against the Sheriff of the County of Cumberland for converting to his own use Plaintiff's goods. Defendant, as such Sheriff, levied on these goods under an attachment. There is a provision in the Act under which these goods were seized, giving power to the Court to order perishable goods to be sold[34]. The Court did in this case order the goods to be sold, and they were sold, and after such sale all the proceedings under the attachment appears to have been discontinued. If the Sheriff had properly taken the goods in the first instance, and if they were legally in his hands, and he sold them under the order of the Court, I think that order would protect him; but, in this case, in my opinion, the conversion of the goods took place when the Sheriff levied on them. The evidence shows the goods originally belonged to the St. Lawrence Coal Mining Company, the officers of which were domiciled in New York. The Company appears to have failed in its operations, and all their property in Nova Scotia was disposed of, except that now in question, and all debts in that Province, except $28, appear to have been settled, leaving a large debt due to the Plaintiff, who had been connected with the Company, and for which he held the promissory notes of the Company. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held there was evidence of a sale of these goods; and there appears to me to have been ample evidence for the consideration of the jury of a bon\u00e2 fide sale, for a valuable consideration, by the officers of the Company to the Plaintiff, for the purpose of discharging the lawful indebtedness of the Company. I think this was within the legislative power given to incorporated companies under ch. 53, sec. 15, N. S. Acts, which makes acts performed within the scope of their charter, or acts creating them, valid, notwithstanding they may not be done under, or authenticated by, the seal of the Company, if such an authentication was needed, but which, I think, was, in this case, wholly unnecessary[35].\nThe Company having in the due course of its business become indebted to the Plaintiff, I can see no reason why it might not as well pay that liability by a sale and delivery of personal property to their creditor in discharge thereof, as by handing him the amount in money, or selling the property to third parties, and handing over the proceeds to the creditor.\nWith reference to the conversion, I think the very circumstance of Defendant's levying on the goods, and subsequently selling them, was a clear conversion. There was not, it is true, evidence that the goods were on the levy moved, but it is clear the Sheriff did levy on them, and it is equally clear that the Court ordered the goods, thus in his hands and under his control, to be sold, as being in his possession under the levy, and that they were so sold.\nThe definition of a conversion, as given by the editor of Bacon's abridgment \"Trover\" (B), is this:\u2014\nThe action being founded upon a conjunct right of property and possession, any act of the Defendant which negatives or is inconsistent with such right, amounts in law to a conversion. It is not necessary to a conversion that there should be a manual taking of the thing in question by the Defendant; it is not necessary that it should be shown that he has applied it to his own use. Does he exercise a dominion over it in exclusion or in defiance of Plaintiff's right? If he does, that is in law a conversion, be it for his own or another person's use.\"\nI think when a Sheriff levies on property he does take possession of it, as against the party, and does convert it. If he exercises control in defiance of the party who had the right, there is a conversion, and he may be sued for the conversion, and, as said by Alderson, B., in Fouldes v. Willoughby[36],\nFor this simple reason, that it is an act inconsistent with the general right of dominion which the owner of the chattel has in it, who is entitled to the use of it at all times and in all places. When, therefore, a man takes that chattel, either for the use of himself or another, it is a conversion. I think the Plaintiff's right of action did not commence at the time of the sale, but so soon as the Sheriff levied upon the goods, and so exercised a claim and dominion over them adverse to the Plaintiff and inconsistent with his general right of dominion.\nUnder these circumstances, I think the Plaintiff has made out his case, viz.: that the Company, by its officers, was competent to sell the goods in question, that there was evidence to establish the sale of the goods to the Plaintiff, and of a conversion by the Defendant. I state this with hesitancy, only because the views of my learned brethren are at variance with the conclusion at which I have arrived.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThe conversion complained of by the declaration was the sale, not the seizure or taking of the goods. The 4th plea justifies the sale under the order of the Court, and avers that to have been the act complained of in the declaration. The Plaintiff is therefore confined to the sale as the conversion for which he sues. If he wanted to insist on the taking as constituting a conversion he should have new assigned. I should doubt, however, if a mere taking of the goods of a third person under a mesne attachment against a Defendant, to keep them in medio until the termination of the action, is a conversion. A conversion is defined to be a taking of chattels with an intent to deprive the Plaintiff of his property in them, or with an intent to destroy them or change their nature. Taking under a mesne attachment does not, like taking under a writ of fieri facias with intent to sell, imply any such intention. But, be that as it may, the conversion here must, on the pleadings, be taken to be the sale. Now, this sale was under an order of the Court, and was the act of the Court, not the act of the Sheriff. It was not the case of a writ of execution or attachment being placed in the Sheriff's hands against the goods of A, and a seizure under it of the goods of B, which the exigency of the writ did not warrant; but these specific goods being already in the Sheriff's hands, having been seized under the attachment, the Court orders them to be sold. The Sheriff is, therefore, protected by the order for sale. The issue, it is true, on this line of pleading, is narrowed to this: Was the discontinuance after or before the sale? It appears that the sale took place on the 7th November, 1866, and that there was no discontinuance until December 11th, 1874. The issue on the rejoinder to the replication to the plea of justification ought, therefore, to have been found for the Defendant. But it was proper to consider, whether the plea did disclose a good justification, since there would be no use in granting a new trial if in point of law the Sheriff could not justify. As regards the other point argued, there can, in my judgment, be no doubt that the Company was one to which the Rev. Stats. p. 8, (4th Series), ch. 97, was applicable. I am, therefore, of opinion that the verdict ought to have been set aside with costs, and a new trial ordered.\nTASCHEREAU and FOURNIER, J. J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThe points to be decided in this case are in an action of trover, brought by the Respondent against the Appellant, who, as Sheriff of the County of Cumberland, sold certain chattel property claimed by the Respondent to belong to him to recover its value.\nTo the charge of conversion in the Respondent's writ the Appellant pleaded:\u2014\n1st. That he did not convert to his own use the Plaintiff's goods, as in the writ alleged. 2nd. That the goods were not the property of the Plaintiff.\n3rd. That the Plaintiff was not possessed, nor was he entitled to the possession of the said goods.\nAnd by a fourth plea, he justifies the taking of the goods, as and being the goods of the Lawrence Coal Mining Company, under a writ of attachment at the suit of one George Hibbard, against the said Lawrence Coal Mining Company, directed to him as Sheriff of the County of Cumberland; and the subsequent sale thereof under an order issued by the Supreme Court and signed by A. S. Blenkhorn, Esquire, Prothonotary of the said Court at Amherst in the said County of Cumberland, whereby he was ordered and required, amongst other things, as such Sheriff, as aforesaid, to put up and sell the said goods at public auction to respond the judgment which might be obtained. The Plaintiff replied to the latter plea:\u2014\nThat after the proceedings in the plea mentioned, taken by the said George Hibbard, the suit instituted by the said George Hibbard against the Lawrence Coal Mining Company was discontinued by him, and the attachment and all proceeding thereunder were thereby abandoned; which said discontinuance is on the fyles of this honorable court.\nTo that replication the Appellant rejoined, first, that the said cause was not discontinued, and second:\u2014\nThat the said discontinuance was not filed until after the goods in said writ mentioned were sold under the order in his said plea mentioned, and the proceeds applied as therein mentioned.\nOn the trial of the issues of fact, leave was given to the Appellant to demur to the replication of the Respondent, which he did, and therein says that the Plaintiff's replication is bad in substance, inasmuch as the Sheriff is justified by his writ of attachment and order for sale, and was bound to execute it:\u2014\nThat the act of the Plaintiff in the cause under which the attachment was made, in discontinuing the cause after the Sheriff had sold the property in question, cannot and does not affect his justification, as pleaded. Marginal note on the demurrer:\u2014\nMatter of law to be argued\u2014that the Sheriff, being bound to act in obedience to the order of the Court, cannot be affected by a discontinuance of a suit under which property was sold.\nJoinder in demurrer by Respondent. Under the charge of the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, before whom the cause was tried in October, 1876, the jury found a verdict for the Plaintiff for $500, and a rule nisi was granted to set it aside on the following grounds:\u2014\n1st. That the verdict was against law and evidence.\n2nd. That the learned Chief Justice misdirected the jury.\n3rd. That evidence was improperly received.\n4th. That evidence was improperly rejected, and\n5th. That there was no sufficient evidence of the conversion of the goods.\nThis rule and the demurrer were argued before the whole Court at Halifax, and by a majority of the Court the rule nisi was discharged with costs, and a judgment on the demurrer given in favor of the Respondent.\nIn the majority judgment, the fourth plea is pronounced bad, and a doubt expressed as to the sufficiency of the replication to it. Hence the judgment on the demurrer. The appeal to this Court is from that judgment on all the points, both as to the facts and the law.\nI will first deal with the demurrer. I would not question the correctness of the judgment if the fourth plea is defective, but I don't think it is.\nTo decide that point, we must first consider the nature of the position held by the Appellant when he received the order for the sale of the goods. He had previously levied on the goods under the attachment, but had not removed them. Section 6, ch. 97 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, entitled: \"Of suits against absent and absconding debtors,\" provides that:\u2014 Where the goods consist of stock, or are shown by affidavit to be of a perishable nature, and the agent shall not, within three days after notice of the appraisement, give security for their value, a judge, or a prothonotary of the county, in his absence, may, at his discretion, cause the same to be sold at public auction, and the proceeds thereof shall be retained by the Sheriff, or paid into Court, to respond the judgment.\nThe prothonotary of the county made an order under the provisions of that section, and directed to the Sheriff, to sell the said goods under the terms thereof.\nOn receipt of that order it was the Sheriff's duty to execute it. He could have been compelled by legal and summary means to do it, and would also be answerable to the Plaintiff in that suit for any resulting loss or damage to the goods, in case he eventually obtained judgment. So far, therefore, as the conversion by the sale, the order to sell the specific goods would be a complete justification and the plea to that extent is a sufficient answer.\nIf the plea admitted the goods were the property of the Plaintiff it would have been bad; but, on the contrary, it alleges them to have been, when levied upon, the goods of the Lawrence Coal Mining Company, and that, with the other allegations contained in it, forms a perfect answer to the writ; and, as a whole, is consequently a good plea The Respondent virtually says:\u2014 they were not the Plantiff's goods, but those of the Lawrence Coal Mining Company, and I, as Sheriff, levied upon them under the attachment, and subsequently sold them.\nA special plea of justification is only necessary where goods of one party are taken out of the possession of another, and is only necessary as a justification for interfering with the possession. If goods are not taken out of the possession of the Plaintiff the right is tried by a simple denial of ownership. The justification in this case would only be necessary in case the goods in question, were, when taken, in contemplation of law, in the possession of the Respondent.\nThe replication to the plea is bad, for the simple reason that the Respondent could not, by any possibility, be affected by any subsequent act of the Plaintiff in regard to the discontinuance of the suit. I think, therefore, the judgment on the demurrer must be in favor of the Appellant.\nUnder that ruling the judgment on the facts submitted to the jury should also be for him, if the order for sale would be a justification to the officer for the original levy on the goods, as well as for the sale, even had they been the property of the Respondent; but, as it is not, the result must be affected by the question as to the ownership of the goods when the levy was made. If, then, they were not the Respondent's, he cannot recover; but the whole case, as far as the rule nisi for a new trial goes, depends altogether on the settlement of that question. The property, as admitted by both parties, was that of the Lawrence Coal Mining Company up to the date of the transfer claimed by the Respondent. Did he, then, obtain the property in the goods by the document signed by \"J. W. Hawley, agent.\" If not, he had no property in them. In determining that point we must see if, in the first place, Hawley had sufficient authority to divest the Company of the ownership. The alleged transfer is signed by him on the 5th of July, 1867. He, the Respondent, and others were appointed Directors of the Company on the 18th of January, 1865, for one year from that date. No subsequent appointment of Directors was ever made, and there is no provision to be found anywhere, as far as the evidence goes, as is sometimes the case in respect of public officers, that the Directors should hold office till others were appointed in their place. There may have been such a provision in the by-laws of the Company, but evidence of it is wanting. On the 18th of January, 1866, the Directors ceased to be so; and, as such, could not collectively or individually bind the Company. Resolutions of the stockholders were passed in April and December, 1865, authorizing certain Directors named, to sell on certain conditions the real and personal property of the Company; but Hawley was not one of them. On the 26th of February, 1866, at a meeting of the stockholders, a resolution was passed authorizing Messrs. Hawley, W. G. Howe and Alden:\u2014\nTo sell all the real and personal estate, and also the leasehold of the Company for such sum or sums, and on such terms, as in their judgment will be for the best interest of the Company, and pay the proceeds of such sale into the hands of the Treasurer for the benefit of the creditors of the said Company, and if the amount of such sale exceeds the debts, the balance to be paid pro rata among the stockholders.\nNo one will pretend for a moment that Hawley alone had power to make the sale to the Respondent, which the document signed by him purports to have been made. The delegated power by the Company was to three, and the three were to exercise their judgment in regard to it; and besides, none of them, nor the three together, had power to give any portion of the property in payment of any particular debt. It was to be sold for cash, and that paid into the hands of the Treasurer. The Respondent was himself a Director; and was quite aware, no doubt, of the nature of the authority given to Hawley, Howe and Alden, and is concluded thereby. There is no evidence of any ratification of the sale by the Company. In fact, there was but one meeting of the Company after that of February, 1866, and that was in 1874, which appears to have been called for the purpose of authorizing a transfer of the lease of the mines to the Respondent, which was done; and that only. Some oral evidence was offered of the authority of Hawley to sell the personal property; but it was objected to and cannot be received for the obvious reason that no meeting had ever considered the subject. In the absence, then, of legitimate evidence, and when considering, too, that if any Directors existed at the time of the transfer, the Respondent was one, and could not become a purchaser through a sale by the Directors' he having with them a fiduciary authority to sell, if any such existed, I must say I can see no authority for the transfer to bind the Company, even if it had been made in the name of the Company and under its seal.\nThe instrument in question does not purport to be a transfer by the Company. It contains no words making a transfer. It only says baldly that the Respondent has purchased through T. R. Hawley, authorized to sell the same, the property mentioned in the schedule. A mere naked purchase, without evidence of any consideration given, or any delivery of the property, will not pass it. I cannot think the instrument of any more value than a letter to some person would have been, containing the same substance. It does not say who owned the property, or by whom he was authorized to sell it, and it is signed by \"T. R. Hawley, agent.\" Agent of whom? It discloses no consideration or terms for the purchase. No consideration is shown either by, or dehors, the instrument by any one present at the alleged purchase. I will not say a written transfer was absolutely necessary, but I am of opinion the document per se is insufficient to make it. There is no other evidence of it; for neither of the parties to the transfer, Hawley and Dillingham, or any of the witnesses to it, or any other person present, was examined; and there is, therefore, no legal evidence of it. Alden's hearsay evidence upon this point, objected to at the trial, cannot be received.\nThe Respondent, in his evidence, says:\u2014 Alden, Dillingham, Hawley and Wentworth, were all creditors of the Company, and were the four interested with me in the transfer of the personal property\u2014\nunder his honorary obligation. Thus, then, was Hawley undertaking to act as the agent of the Company to convey, with the assistance of Dillingham, the property of the Company to the Respondent for his, Hawley's, Dillingham's and Wentworth's benefit. Surely the Company, at any time, could repudiate such a transfer; and, if void, as against the Company, it must be so as against a creditor of the Company, as Hibbard appears to have been.\nAnd, now, in conclusion, as to the seal. I have carefully examined all the authorities, and have had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that, in the absence of statutory enactment, the contract in question could only be valid under the seal of the Company.\nBy the registry of the articles of association in evidence, this Company was incorporated, not as a trading company, but:\u2014\nFor the special purpose of opening and working mines and veins, or deposits of coal and oils in the River Hebert Settlement, * * * and the exporting and making sale thereof, and of constructing and operating railways, tramways, or plank roads, necessary for transporting the said coal, when mined, to tide water, and for the purpose of constructing piers, docks and buildings necessary for carrying on said business, and of doing all other business which may be lawfully undertaken and connected therewith.\nThis is not, then, a \"trading\" Company, and therefore rules as to buying and selling stocks in trade will not apply to it.\nThe \"selling\" contemplated by this Company was to be of coal and oil, not the houses, buildings, or plant. The intention was to keep the latter as means to enable the Company to carry out the intentions of the charter.\nThe intention is clear and obvious, and I cannot strain words declaring, as do those of section 15, chap. 53 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, that:\u2014 The acts of incorporated companies performed within the scope of their charters, or acts creating them, shall be valid, notwithstanding they may not be done under, or authenticated by the seal of such corporations,\nto mean that a company may, without seal, sell and dispose of their whole property, and thereby wind up the company. Such a power is certainly, to my mind, not given by the section just quoted; for that section clearly has reference, as to this Company, to acts done \"in the opening and working mines, &c.\" and the exporting and making sale of \"coal and oil, &c.\" It, in fact, only applies to a going Company, and cannot be applied to the expiring flicker, or final sale of the houses, plant, &c., of a bankrupt company. For the reasons given, I think, the rule for the discharge of the rule nisi herein should itself be discharged and the said rule nisi made absolute with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, and new trial ordered with costs in the Court below.\nSolicitor for Appellant: Charles T.

B., his principal creditor, on the 19th January, 1875, by notarial deed, duly registered, certain movable and immovable property, being the bulk of his estate, comprising the hotel and furniture, for $15,409.50. The immovable property, valued by official assessors at $22,000, was sold for $10,000. The sale was, also, made subject to a right of redemption by F. on reimbursing, within three years, the stipulated price of $15,409500, and interest at the rate of 8 p.c., with a provision that, in case of insolvency or default of payment, this right of rem\u00e9r\u00e9 should cease. No delivery took place, and ten months later F., who remained in possession of the property under a lease from A. B. of the same date as that of the sale, also became bankrupt. In the meantime A. B., with F.S consent, had leased the furniture to T. & J. in whose hands they were when Appellant, (F.'s Assignee) revendicated them as part of the insolvent estate. T. & J. did not plead, but A.

Farmer sued out a writ of saisie-revendication to attach from Messrs. Trihey 8c Johnson, lessees of Respondent, furniture and chattel property to the alleged value of $3,817.62, as belonging to the insolvent, and forming part of his estate. To this action the Defendants did not plead. The Respondent intervened, and alleged that the Defendants, to the knowledge of the Appellant and of the creditors of the insolvent, held the property seized as lessees of him; that he was owner of the property under a deed of sale from Farmer dated 19th January, 1875, and that, at the time of the attachment in insolvency, he was in possession of this property through Farmer who held it under a lease from him also dated 19th January, 1875.\nThe Appellant filed a contestation of this intervention alleging that Farmer was insolvent at the time of the deed of sale; that Bell knew of his insolvency; that this deed and likewise the deed of lease from Bell to Farmer were both executed in fraud and to the detriment of Farmer's creditors, and were passed in contemplation of insolvency, for the purpose of giving Bell an unjust preference over the other creditors\nBy the evidence of record, the following facts were established: \u2014\nOn the 16th of December 1874 Bell wrote to 1armer the following letter:\u2014 Montreal, Dec. 16th, 1874.\n\"T. G. Farmer, Esq.,\nDear Sir,\u2014I asked Mr. Wurtele to what way I could be secured in your claim or amount, so he told me you would require to make out a list of all the furniture in the hotel, to attach to our agreement; do it yourself\u2014 make a list of each room; commence at No. 1, and so on. You need not let anyone know of it] this is the simplest way of securing the whole, and then all I will trouble you for will be an amount not exceeding 8 p. c. on the whole debt to run till March, 1878. Your running amount is $6,000, and then the $10,000; the whole sale will be for $16,000, and then you will pay me every three months 8 p. c. and have it in your power to redeem the whole in March 1878 by paying me $16,000, and by doing this everything is secure both for you and me, and then all I trouble you for is the rent at 8 p. c, so that you can pay others quite easily and not be troubled any. I will bring the papers down with me for you to sign now. By having everything secured for me, if you at any time require my assistance I shall only be too happy to oblige you. Of course this course is the only one as things stands at present. Neither you nor me can tell how long we live and things has been done rather loose, it is all very well as long as we are attending to things ourselves. Attend to make out the list or if you are too busy I will send my son to assist you, so that you and him can do it very quietly between yourselves.\nHoping you and your good lady are well.\nYours truly,\nADAM R. BELL;\"\nOn the 12th of January, 1875, Bell wrote another and most pressing letter, in which he tells Farmer that \"he cannot renew his notes for ever and lay out his interest without such security as he asked ;\" that \"under the prospects of things he has invested enough already;\" that \"he wants the security now on the time mentioned and. in the order of thing's mentioned.\"\nOn the 13th Bell again writes: \"Be careful in making the list to have a price to every article and mention every article of furniture, setting down price opposite; this you will find turn out good for yourself as well as me.\"\n\"Go quietly around and write down everything. It is no one's business to meddle with you in our settlements and when this is arranged you may require using me again which I hope I shall be in a position to serve you.\nUpon these letters, Farmer went to Montreal, and, on the 19th of January, 1875, sold to Respondent \"The British American Hotel,\" at three Rivers, and all the furniture it contained, together with a lot of land on the outskirts of the city and \u00a3700 stg. of fourth pre ferential bonds of the Grand Trunk Railway Company. This sale was made for $15,409.00, of which $6,000 were in payment of a bailleur-de-fonds claim, $4,000 in payment of a mortgage, and the balance of $5,409500 was declared to have been paid at the time of the signing of the deed. The sale was made subject to a droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 by farmer, on reimbursing, within three years, the stipulated price of $15409.50 and interest at the rate of 8 p.c, payable quarterly, with a provision that, in case of insolvency, or default of any payment within sixty days after it was due, this right of r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 should cease.\nThe list of articles which is annexed to the deed of sale does not altogether agree with the furniture in the hotel, but it is alleged by Bell, in his intervention, that, notwithstanding very considerable discrepancies, the intention was to sell all the furniture in the hotel at the time of the sale. The sale included: \u2014\n1st The hotel which at the time was as\nsessed by the Corporation of Three\nRivers on valuation made by the\nassessors under oath at \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026$22000 00\nAnd which on the the following year was\nassessed at $26000: \u2014\n2nd The furniture and chattel property,\nincluding 1500 bushels of potatoes,\nthe whole valued at \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.4109 50\n3rd The lot of land near the city \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..1000 00\n4rd The U-rand Trunk bonds \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.300 00\nTotal\u2026\u2026.. $27409 50\nSold for $15,409.50, a s mentioned in the deed. The hotel being put down for $10,000. A number of witnesses say that it was fully worth the value it was assessed at, and even something above, while others say it could not have been sold, at a forced sale, for more than $10,000. On the same day, Bell leased to Farmer, for three years, for $1,237 a year, payable quarterly, all the property he had purchased from him. The two deeds were passed before Jobin, notary, at Montreal, and the deed of sale was subsequently registered at Three Rivers, on the 1st day of February, but the lease was not registered. No delivery took place, and Farmer remained in possession of the whole, as before the transaction, until the 27th day of November, 1875, when a writ of compulsory liquidation issued against him, and the property was seized in his possession by an Interim Assignee. On the 3rd December, 1875, Trihey & John son took possession of the hotel and furniture, as lessees of Bell, apparently under some understanding between Bell and the Interim Assignee, the nature of which is not well explained in the cause.\nAfter a protracted enqu\u00e9te, the Superior Court declared the sale to have been made in fraud of the creditors of Farmer dismissed Bel'ls intervention, and declared the saisie revendication valid. This decision was reversed on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench\u2014the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Tessier dissenting.\nIn the Supreme Court the question argued was, whether the deeds of sale and of lease of the 19th January, 1875, could be declared void on the ground of fraud, or of unjust preference, in contemplation of insolvency.\nMr. H. T. Taschereau, Q. C. and Mr. Honan, for the Appellant.\nMr. McDougall, Q. C, for Respondent.\nThe arguments and authorities relied on sufficiently appear in the judgments.\nRitchie, J.:\u2014\nThis is a proceeding to set aside a deed by which one Farmer transferred to the Respondent a large amount of property. I understand that under the civil law an entirely different principle prevails from what prevails at common law, where a party may make a preference, if it be a bon\u00fa-fide transaction, even if made for the purpose of delaying or defeating a specific creditor, but that under the Civil Code, L. C, such preference would not be good.\nThe question in this case appears to be one of fact only, viz.:\u2014 Whether, under the circumstances of the case, the result of this transaction was the delaying or defeating of creditors ? The Court of original jurisdiction determined that the effect of this transfer was to delay and defeat creditors; that it was, in fact, a preference given to the Respondent, which, under the Code, he was not entitled to have, the principle of the Code being that a party cannot, when in insolvent circumstances, prefer one creditor to another; that all have an equal right to a distribution of a debtor's goods upon the same basis as that of a bankrupt's property.\nAfter carefully reading and considering the evidence, I am unable to dissent from the able judgment of Chief Justice Dorion, who goes into all the circumstances, and points out the particulars in which he thinks the effect of this transaction was to defeat and delay creditors, and to invalidate this deed. I cannot say perhaps because I have always been so strongly acting upon a different rule\u2014that I can go with the learned Chief Justice in all the reasons he gives, but, in many of them, I entirely agree with him, sufficiently so, at any rate, to come to the conclusion at which he has arrived that this deed cannot stand.\nIt is clear that Farmer was very largely indebted at the time of this transaction; that under this deed the whole of his property (with the exception of the wine cellar) was transferred to Respondent the value of which would seem to have been much greater than the Respondent was to pay for it. The effect of this transfer was to render Farmer insolvent, and not leave property for the discharge of his other liabilities. The transaction Was carried out with secrecy, and Bell, evidently, must have known that the effect of it was to delay and defeat all Farmer's other creditors. It is true an opportunity was given Farmer of redeeming the property if he could do so, but even this was put in such a way that Farmer\u2019s creditors could know nothing about it, and, coupled with the secrecy of the whole transaction and its obvious effect on Farmers position in reference to his other creditors, shows it to be a transaction entirely opposed to the principle of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, and, therefore, must be set aside.\nSTRONG, J., concurred. TASCHEREAU, J\nLes faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause sont a peu de chose pr\u00e9s, les suivants :\nThomes G. Farmer poss\u00e9dait une propriet\u00e9 immobiliaire situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res et connue sous le nom de British American Hotel, dans lequel ii exercait le m\u00e9tier d'h\u00d4telier; ii poss\u00e9dait dans cette maison un mobilier considerable qui \u00e9tait utilise pour les fins de son n\u00e9goce comme hotelier. Le 19 janvier 1875, Farmer vendit \u00e0 l'Intime cet h\u00f4te,l avec le mobilier, plus un lot de terre et quelques preferential bonds de la compagnie du Grand-Tronc, au montant apparent de \u00a3700 sterling, le tout pour le prix de $15,409533, dont $6,000 furent stipules \u00eatre en prime d'un montant \u00e0 lui du par privilege de bailleur defonds surl'h\u00f4tel, $4,000 pour une hypoth\u00e8que sur la m\u00eame propri\u00e9te, et le reste, savoir $5,109.50 comme argent pay\u00e9 au moment de la passation de l'acte en question. Cette venee fut faite avec droit de rem\u00e9r\u00e9 en faveur du vendeur sous trois ans, en payant les $15,409500 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat 8 pour cent, \u00e0 et avec la singuli\u00e8re stipulation on en cas d'nsolvabilit\u00e9 ou a d\u00e9faut de paiement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat a chaque trimestre ce droit de rem\u00e9r\u00e9 cesserait. Et chose aussi extraordinaire, Bell consent en faveur de Farmer le m\u00eame jour, un bail de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et du mobilier susdit, moyennant un loyer annuel de $1,237 payable par quartier. Il n'y eut pas de livraison actuelle, mais Farmer resta en possession jusqu'en d\u00e9cembre 1875, \u00e9poque a laquelle Farmer ayant Ct\u00e9 force de faire une cession de biens, 1 appelant Rickcaby fut appoint\u00e9 syndic a la banque route de Farmer, et en f\u00e9vrier 1876 ii r\u00e9clama, par saisie revendication, les meubles, comme partie des biens de la faillite de farmer, contre les nomm\u00e9s Tnihey et Johnson, \u00e0 qui Bell, avec le consentement d'un syndic ad interim, avaient consenti un bail de ces effets et de la propri\u00e9te. Trihey et Johnson firent d\u00e9faut de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 cette demande de Rickaby et Bell intervint pour r\u00e9clamer tout ce que Farmer lui avait vendu. Le jugement en premi\u0141re instance, prononc\u00e9 par M. le juge McCord, donna gain de cause a Rickaby, et annula la vente que Farmer avait consenti a l'intim\u00e9 Bell. Sur appel a la Cour du Bane de la Reine a Quebec, ce jugement fut renvers\u00e9 par trois sur cinq honorables juges composant ce tribunal, et c'est de ce jugement dont cette cour est actuellement saisie.\nDe l'exposition des faits de la cause telle que constat\u00e9e par le dossier, nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer si les actes du 19 janveir 1875 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s entre Farmer et l'Intim\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faits et ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s en fraude des cr\u00e9anciers de Farmer et si comme tels ils doivent \u00eatre annul\u00e9s.\nLa premiere question est celle de savoir, si a l'epoque de l'\u00e9x\u00e9cution des deux actes du 19 janvier 1875, Farmer lui-m\u00eame et Bell savaient que Farmer \u00e9tait incapable de rencontrer ses engagements. L'affirmative me semble prouv\u00e9e de la mani\u00e9re la plus positive par les nomm\u00e9s McGibbon, Dawes, Mountain et par Farmer lui-meme, par les lettres singuli\u00e8res de Bell \u00e0 farmer, du 14 d\u00e9cembre 1874 et 12 janvier 1875, qui indiquent clairement cbez l'un et l'autre la conviction de liinsolvabilit\u00e9 de farmer, surtout lorsque le tout est suivi de l'ex\u00e9cution des deux actes du 19 janvier 1875. Ces lettres et les deux actes du 19 janvier 1875 sont la preuve complete du pitoyable tat \u00e9tes finances de farmer, et de la grande pression que Bell voulait exercer sur son d\u00e9biteur dans le but de se prot\u00e9ger, et ce en se faisant transporter tout son actif a un prix comparativement vii comme le dossier le constate, et de fait a peine 50 p. 100, et ne laissant rien a esp\u00e9rer pour ses autres cr\u00e9anciers.\nSi lonprend en consideration que la venee de tout l'actif de Farmer, dont la valeur approximative \u00e9tait de $27,409, a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour $15,409, on ne pourra se d\u00e9fen-dre dun fort soupcon de la sinc\u00e9rite de l'acte de vente mais m\u0152me nous devons dire que cette vente n'\u00e9tait ainsi consentie que dans le but de prot\u00e9ger Bell \u00e0 l'exclusion des autres cr\u00e9anciers de Farmer en un mot de lui donner une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence indue. D'ailleurs, l'acte contient une declaration fausse du paiement de $15,409.50 lors de la passation de cet acte puisqu'en r\u00e9alite tel paiement n'a pas eu lieu, et que ce paiement pr\u00e9tendu n'etait que l'extinction d'une dette ant\u00e9rieure chiro. graphaire pour des avances d'argent et fournitures pour lesquelles Bell n'avaitaucun gage ni suret\u00e9 quelconque.\nLa preuve, je le r\u00e9pete, que l'on trouve au dossier me convaine que ces deux actes ne furent que l'ox\u00e9cution d'un projet bien arr\u00eat\u00e9 de la part de Bell et de Farmer de donner au premier une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence 1ndue, et ce au detriment des cr\u00e9anciers de Farmer et entre autres de Rickaby. J'avoue que la fraude, qui r\u00e9sulte de l'ex\u00e9cution de ces deux actes, n'est pas prouv\u00e9e avec l'exactitude que l'on pourrait attendee dans une transaction ordinaire de la vie mais d'un autre cote la loi, sans pr\u00e9sumer la fraude, n'en defend pas la preuve par tous les moyens possibles, par toutes les circonstances possibles. En effet la fraude serait le plus sou-vent insaisissable si la preuve des circonstances tendant a l'\u00e9tablir n'\u00e9tait pas permise.\nM. Chardon ([1]) dit;\nLes cr\u00e9anciers doivent prouver et le dommage qui leur est fait et l'intention qu'a eue leur d\u00e9biteur de leur. faire; mais comment \u00e9tablir cette intention ? Dans cette occurence, comme dans beaucoup d'autres, si la preuve directe n'est pas possible, ii en est diindirectes que fournissent les pr\u00e9somptions offertes par les circonstances\nEt Bedarride ([2]) dit: Dans tous les cas ou la preuve testimoniale est admissible, la preuve par pr\u00e9somption l'est \u00e9galement.\nOr, dans le cas present, les faits prouv\u00e9s prouvent abondamment l'intention de frauder, au moins dans le sens legal, car Bell n'iignorait pas, ne pouvait ignorer, liinsolvabilit\u00e9 de son d\u00e9biteur; et les autorit\u00e9s vont m\u0152me jusqu'au point d'\u00e9tablir que si le d6biteur an moment de sonl transport, ne laisse pas assez pour payer ses dettes il doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 insolvable, et que le cessionnaire doit en subir les consequences.\nL\u00e9l\u00e9ment de fraude que l'on trouye dans les transactions en question consiste lo. dans l'insolvabilit\u00e9 \u00e9videnee de Farmer, bien connue de Bell et qu'il ne pouvait ignorer, quoique le public en general ne pit que la soupfonner:\n2o. Dans le fait que, quant a la somme de $5,109.50, que Bell pretend avoir payee a Farmer comme partie du prix total de $15,109 50 Bell absorbait ainsi \u00e0 lui seul une somme de $5,109.50 repr\u00e9sentant des meubles et effets appartenant a farmer, qui \u00e9taient le gage commun de ses cr\u00e9anciers en general, et sur lesquels meubles Bell n'avait aucun privll\u00e9ge ni lien quelconque. C'etait done, au moins quant a cette somme, une perte de $5,109.50 :\n3o. Dans le fait que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mobiliere qui est entree dans l'estimation de Bell comme partie du pnix de vente des $15,109.50 n'y est estim\u00e9e qu'au montant de $10,000, tandis qu'a l'\u00e9poque de cette vente, l'h\u00f4tel \u00e9tait estim\u00e9 de $22 \u00e0 $26,000 par les estimateurs officiels de la corporation de la ville de Trois-Rividres :\n4o. Dans le fait de la venee a rem\u00e9re, qui indique que la vente n'etait pas s\u00e9rieuse mais fait dans le but seul de prot\u00e9ger le cr\u00e9ancier et le d\u00e9biteur, an prejudice des cr\u00e9anciers du d\u00e9biteur, en emp\u00eachant ces derniers de pouvoir exercer leur recours imm\u00e9diatement contre Farmer sans avoir au pr\u00e9alable fait annuler ces actes comme frauduleux.\nII me para\u00eet de toute \u00e9vidence que, commele dit M. le juge en chef Dorion en ses notes de jugement, l'iintim\u00e9 Bell se trouve dans ce dilemme bien evident savoir, Si la propriet\u00e9 valait $26,600 et qu'il l'avait achet\u00e9e pour $10009 Bell et son d\u00e9biteur commnettent une fraude palpable et punissaable comme fraude en violation de la loi de faillite, et si la propriet\u00e9 ne valait one $10000 Fuemer \u00e9tait alors insolvable sans espoir de se r\u00e9tablir, et cons\u00e9quemment ii \u00e9tait passible d'une punition, dont son cr\u00e9ancier qui s'y \u00e9tait associe partageait le risque savoir: de voir ces actes de vente annul\u00e9s par les tribunaux comme faits en fraude des cr\u00e9anciers de l'insolvable.\nLes articles 1033 1035 1040 993 du Code Civil et les provisions de l'acte de faillite de 1869 me semblent s'appliquer a. la pr\u00e9sente cause et militent avec force contre les pr\u00e9tentions de l'intim\u00e9.\nLes autorit\u00e9s que l'on trouve an factum del'appelant, savoir: Caprirna([3]), Bell's Commentaries([4]), Bedarride([5]), \u00e9tablissent une bien saine doctrine savoir: que si un d\u00e9biteur paie un cr\u00e9ancier en tout o\u00f9 en partie an prejudice des autres, il y a pr\u00e9somption o\u00f9 douee de fraude, et un cr\u00e9ancier sera r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir connu liinsolvabilit\u00e9 de son d\u00e9biteur, si a l'epoque d'une transaction il \u00e9tait en position de connaitre l'etat de ses affaires o\u00f9 si ses transactions indiquaient chez lui un fort doute de l'insol vabilit6 de son d\u00e9biteur, et qu'il n'est pas m\u0152me n\u00e9ces saire d'etablir que le d\u00e9biteur fut insolvable a l'\u00e9poone de la transaction; et il est suffisant de prouver qu'en faisant cette transaction il s'est r\u00e9duit a l\u0152etat d'insol-vabilit\u00e9. La clandestinit\u00e9 est aussi un indice de fraude, telle qu'une vente a rem\u00e9r\u00e9 sans tradition publique. Nos tribunaux de la province de Quebec ont maintenu la doctrine qne la clandestinit\u00e9 \u00e9tait un indice de fraude. Or nous voyons tous ces indices et tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de fraude dans les transactions du 19 janvier 1875 savoir: insolvabilit\u00e9 indubitable, clandestinit\u00e9, d\u00e9faut de tradition par Farmer \u00e0 Bell. Voila pour le droit commun. Maintenant la loi statutaire acte de faillite 1869 section 13 sous-sections 1 et 3 de l'acte de 1875 et sections 86 et 88 de l'acte 1869 frappe de nullit\u00e9 des actes faits sous les m\u00eames circonstances\nMais l iintim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que l'appelant ne pouvait demander la nullit\u00e9 de la vente des immeubles. Ii y a une double erreur dans cette pr\u00e9tention car 1o. la pro. pri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue a bas prix, savoir, $10,000 au lieu de $26,000 o\u00f9 environ qu'elle valait. En efffet Bell aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e9s l'acquisition la fit assurer, savoir: la construciion seule pour $16,000, ce qui avec le terrain la portait a une valeur de plus de $20,000; et 2o. il y aune seconde erreur dans cette pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 en ce que les actes, \u00e9tant attaqu\u00e9s comme frauduleux entre commercants et commercants, la fraude sur un point quelconque important \u00e9tant prouv\u00e9e elle affectuait toutes les transactions du 19 janvier 1875.\nSi liintim\u00e9 a une hypotb\u00e9que valable sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'h\u00f4tel son droit est sauvegard\u00e9 et compl\u00e9tement prot\u00e9g\u00e9 devant le syndic officiel, qui la fera vendre et paiera les hypotb\u00e9ques et dettes privilegi\u00e9es tout aussi bien que le ferait un sh\u00e9rif. Ainsi le jugement de cette cour en annulant ces actes du 19 janvier 1875 remettra les \"parties au m\u0152me \u00e9tat dans lequel elles se trouvaient a la date de ces actes frauduleux, et leurs droits et privil\u00e9ges et ceux de tous les autres cr\u00e9anciers que le syndic present appellant est par la loi oblige de prot\u00e9ger rena\u00eetront comme s'ils n'avaient jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 afiect\u00e9s.\nLe iugement de cette cour sera a l'effet de renverser le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, d'annuler comme frauduleux les deux actes de vente du 19 janvier 1875, avec frais et d\u00e9pens tant en cour d'appel que devant cette cour.\nFournier, J., concurred.\nHenry, J.:\u2014\nI do not think it necessary in this case to refer to the Civil Code of Lower Canada to sustain the judgment the Court has announced, so far, in regard to the case before us The Statute of 1869 the general Act of the Dominion Parliament authorized as it is by the Imperial Act to legislate on the subject of insolvency, if sufficient in itself could not be controlled by any Act previously existing in any of the provinces; and, therefore, if, on looking at that Act, the assignment is not legal we have no necessity to refer to the Civil Code. The 88th section of the Statute reads :\u2014\nAll contracts, or conveyances made and acts done by a debtor, respecting either real or personal estate with intent fraudulently to impede, obstruct or delay his creditors in their remedies against him, or with intent to defraud his creditors, or any of them, and so made, done or intended with the knowledge of the person contracting or acting with the debtor whether such person be his creditor or not and which shall have the effect of impeding, obstructing or delaying the creditors of their remedies, or of injuring them or any of them, are prohibited and are null and void, notwithstanding that such contracts, conveyances or acts be in consideration, or in contemplation of marriage.\nA similar enactment is in force in England and decisions have already been had upon it, which, I think, are in the spirit of the words of this clause. The interpretation given to these words and their equivalent in the English Courts, may be gathered from the following cases:\u2014See Ex parte Bailey ([6]); Lindon v. Sharp ([7]); and Oriental Bank v. Coleman ([8]). Under the Statute, we have, then, first to enquire as - to the knowledge of the party to whom the assignment is made. I think the evidence is abundant to show that he knew the party was indebted to others and insolvent and in fact by his conduct generally he shows he knew everything, and got the property for the purpose of shielding it from the other creditors. That is sufficient to satisfy the terms of this Act. The decisions of the courts in England make all these assignments fraudulent, not necessarily in the intention of the party who makes them, but by the operation of the Statute, and I conceive there is no difficulty in coming t6 the conclusion that if that is the construction to be given to the Statute, the assignee here knew everything that was required to be known to give effect to that section of the Act, and that this assignment was made by the insolvent while he was largely indebted to other people and, therefore, the assignment was made in a manner which is prohibited by the statute. Under all the circumstances, therefore, I think the case is plainly and fully made out so much so that no jury would hesitate in regard to it. I agree with the judgment already given, that the assignment is void in law; and that the judgment originally given should be carried out, with costs of the Court of Appeal below and of this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: M.

J., and Ritchie, Strong, Taschereau, Fournier and Henry, J. J.\nAPPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nDamages Nuisance\u2014Possession of wharf built on public property\u2014 Right of action for trespass.\nC. et al. built a wharf in the bed of the River St. Lawrence, which communicated with the shore by means of a gangway, and had enjoyed the possession of this wharf and its approaches for many years, when R., on the ground that the wharf was a public nuisance destroyed the means of communication which existed from the wharf to the shore. C. et al. sued R. in damages, and prayed that the works be restored. After issue joined, R. fyled a supplementary plea, alleging: that since the institution of the action one C. R., through whose property C. et al's bridge passed to reach the street on shore, had erected buildings which prevented the restoration of the bridge and wharf.\nHeld,\u2014That R., having allowed C. et al. to erect the gangway on public property and remain in possession of it for over a year, had debarred himself of the right of destroying what might have been originally a nuisance to him, and that, notwithstanding the subsequent abandonment of this wharf and gangway, C. et al. were entitled, to substantial damages.\nTHE judgment appealed from was rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) on the 3rd of February, 1876, confirming the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissing the action brought by the present Appellants. By their action brought in March, 1863, the Plaintiffs alleged: that they had been for upwards of eighteen years owners of certain lands, emplacements, in the village of Beauharnois, and had constructed stores, and that in 1846 they erected at great cost in lake St. Louis, opposite the village, a certain wharf connected with the shore by a bridge resting on the property of one Charles Rapin; that these erections had been made openly without any interference by the government, but with their consent, and that they had occupied such wharf and used it until the Defendant, the now Respondent, in 1862, erected certain stone buildings in the bed of the lake, in rear of Charles Rapin's property, and in doing so stopped and blocked up the bridge, destroying part of it, removing the materials and interrupting all communication between the wharf and the shore thereby preventing the Plaintiffs from using or leasing their wharf that the Defendant's erections also prevented the use of the beach and bed of the lake and were made without permission. The Plaintiffs pray that Defendant be condemned to remove the erections by him made preventing communication with the wharf, and to restore the same within a period to be determined by the Court and in case of a removal to pay a hundred pounds damages and in case of failure seven hundred pounds with interest and costs.\nThe Defendant's plea first denies that the wharf in question was ever constructed with the sanction of any public authority, and states that it was in a navigable part of the river and had become a public nuisance in the possession of the Plaintiffs; that in erecting the said buildings mentioned in the Plaintiffs' case, the Defendant had only exercised an unquestionable right of property, having erected them on his own land; that by a deed executed before Hainault, notary, dated 10th March, 1860, the Defendant and several others had be- come partners for the purpose of purchasing and main-tainting the wharf in question, and that it had been leased by the said company in the interest and for the benefit of its shareholders that Defendant had brought a barge there on the 28th September, 1862, and was prevented from using the wharf by the violence of Coll McFee, the agent of Plaintiffs, (le repr\u00e9sentant des dits d\u00e9mandeurs an regard du dit quai,) he having removed some of the madriers of the wharf, and thus prevented communication with the land, \" et que par tel fait,\" the wharf had become a public and private nuisance, \" une nuisance publique et priv\u00e9e que le defendeur et tous ceux que en souffraient avait le droit de d\u00e9molir,\" and that it encroached on the waters of the St. Lawrence and de-prvved Defendant of the right of making use of the river in front of his property.\nAnswer to plea: that the wharf was not built on Defendant's property, but on the beach of Lake St. Louis; that the emplacement of Defendant and that of Charles Rapin, behind which the wharf of Plaintiffs was built formed part of the same lot No. 7, and front-ed on St. Lawrence street, whence they had the same depth to the beach of the lake\u2014that is to say, 8 perches and 11 feet\u2014and the surplus is occupied by the erections made by Defendant on the beach (gr\u00e9ve) of the lake. That Coll McFee was not le repr\u00e9sentant of Plaintiffs, nor could his malicious or illegal acts he set up against Plaintiffs.\nOn the issues thus raised the parties went to proof and after twelve witnesses had been examined on behalf of Plaintiffs, the Defendant was allowed, on motion made by him, to that end, to fyle a supplementary plea of puis darrein continuance. This plea contains two allegations, namely: That since the institution of the action, and the fyling of the plea, Charles Rapin, upon whose land the bridge or gangway rested on the shore end, had made some erections, \" a fait des constructions et nouvelles auvres qui rendent le r\u00e9tablissement des lieux impossible;\" and second, that the wharf in question had been carried away or destroyed partly by water, \"par les eaux,\" and partly from decay, and that therefore the re-establishment of the wharf would only be a public nuisance without any utility.\nBy the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellants' action was dismissed with costs.\nThe Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, rested their judgment upon the fact that the Appellants had no right to build the bridge or gangway which by their action, they complain Respondent destroyed, but that the Appellants by their action prevented the Respondent from using the said bridge or gangway, and thereby the bridge or gangway became and was a nuisance and injurious to Respondent. The judgment also maintains that there was no portion of damages suffered by the Appellants.\nFrom the. evidence it appears, that the building of the wharf and gangway in question by Plaintiffs, was about and probably anterior to the year 1848, and that down to the end of September, 1862, they continued in possession by themselves or tenants, and that the wharf was resorted to by the pubic by means of the bridge in question.\nThat one Coll McFee, who was tenant of the wharf in question did on one occasion, in 1862, take up some of the planks of the gangway, but put them down again that day or the next. Respondent, on McFee's taking up the planks said he would continue to take them up, and gave orders to his men to take up the gangway, which was done. The Respondent then erected certain stone buildings in the bed of the river, and in doing so stopped and blocked up the bridge and destroyed part of it. That Appellants, after the institution of their action, allowed the wharf to go to ruin, and removed part of it to rebuild it at another part of the river and that at the time of the trespass Appellants derived an annual revenue of $200 to $800.\nMr. Robertson, QC., for Appellants:\u2014\nThis was an action complaining of Respondent's interference with Appellants' wharf. The complaint in effect, says: \" We were long in possession of a wharf built by us in Lake St. Louis, without objection by the public authority; you, in 1862, interfered illegally with the wharf and the approaches to it, and rendered it useless; and, therefore, we ask, that you put it in its first state, and pay us the damages we have suffered.\" The Respondent answers: \"Your lessee maliciously removed some planks of the gangway, and thereby the wharf became a public and private nuisance, which gave me the right to demolish, and after bringing your action, one Charles Rapin, through whose property your bridge passed, has lawfully erected buildings which prevents the restoration of the wharf and its approaches.\" Now the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the Respondent is based upon an implicit abandonment by my clients of their rights in the wharf, and that no damage occurred subsequent to the date of action. Now, the damage suffered was partly in removing and destroying the gangway, and partly the erection of a permanent hangard, in the position formerly occupied by the gangway, thereby rendering the old approach to the wharf impossible, and damaging the property. Now, the principle is laid down, and is applicable to this case, that a Plaintiff is at liberty to prove, and a Court or jury is bound to take into consideration, the direct and immediate consequences of the acts complained of, which are so closely with them as that they would not of themselves form a distinct cause of action. The Court of Appeals took another ground, and rested their judgment upon the fact that the Appellants, having built their gangway upon public property, and one of their lessee's having prevented the Respondent from using the gangway, it became a public nuisance.\nAppellants contend that the Respondent can raise no plea in his favor from there being no evidence of any permission or license from the Government in favor of Plaintiffs to build the wharf.\nIt is not in Defendant's mouth to urge the want of authority from the Government to build the wharf as an authority to him to pull it down in the manner proved.\nThere is no attempt to prove that the wharf or gangway was an obstruction to navigation: they are shewn to have been useful to it, and a convenience to the public as well as a means to Plaintiffs and their successors in their stores adjoining Richardson street to load their grain and receive their goods without paying other wharf owners the usual rates of wharfage.\nThe proprietor who builds a wharf, although he cannot invoke against Government any right of prescription, may well invoke as against third parties his possession of the wharf as giving him a right to contiuue it. If the possession is long enough to give him title by prescription, \" il sera prouv\u00e9 (by that very fact) qu'il ne peut nuire \u00e0 personne, et que le propri\u00e9taire qui l'a fait b\u00e2tir, aura acquis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du droit de la con- server; un syst\u00e9me contraire entrainerait les plus \u00e9tranges consequences. II n'y aurait pas de terme de l'exigence de la production dune permission ; un \u00e9tab-lissement qui aurait plusieurs si\u00e9cles d'existence pour-rait tre detruit.\" Garnier, des Eaux ([1]) ; Daviel des cours d'eaux ([2]) ; Toullier ([3]). Moreover Appellants' lessee was not \"leur repr\u00easentant,\" nor could his illegal or malicious acts be set up, or be of any effect against them, who had brought their action solely to be protected in their rights against the illegal acts of the Respondent.\nMr. L. Laflamme, for Respondent:\nAppellants have, since the institution of their action, allowed the wharf to go to ruin, and having rebuilt it in another part of the river and obtained a direct communication to it, they have impliedly renounced the rights which they had, or might have to obtain a judgment against the Respondent. Moreover, the gangway was on public property and was a nuisance and injurious to the Respondent.\nThe non-interference on the part of the Government would not validate the encroachment on the public domain by Appellants, and no possessory right could be obtained by the use of a servitude on private property even with the toleration of the proprietor. It is evident, therefore, that this gangway was either on the property of the Defendant, or it was on the public domain with respect to that portion connecting the wharf with Richardson street. If it was resting on private property it could not be considered in any other light than a servitude on Defendants property, and, therefore, the Plaintiff, having no title and being incapable of obtaining any possessory right, whatever use he would have made of the portion of private property, could in no manner constitute a right, even a possessory one, and the Defendant was entitled at any time to remove any obstruction so existing on his property or to cease tolerating such servitude. If it was below the water edge and the limit of Plaintiff's property, the Defendant, as riparian proprietor, was the only individual who could take advantage, according to law, of the use of the beach for the purpose of constructing' thereon, and. the only authority which could interfere with the exercise of his right was the public through the crown the Plaintiff having no claim whatever to prevent him so long as the crown did not interfere with the exercise of such privilege. Reference was made to the following authorities : C. C. L. C. ([4]) ; Proudhon ([5]) ; Enyot ([6]); Gamier ([7]); Code Nap. ([8]); Dubreuil Legislation sur les eaux ([9]) ; Proudhon ([10]).\nOne of the honorable judges dissenting in the Court of Queen's Bench, Chief Justice Dorion, stated, as one ground of his dissent, that the Defendant had failed to prove that the structures he had made were on his own property, but that the fact was that he carried a wharf from his property into the river and. erected upon it. The admission made by the honorable judge is enough to justify the conclusion of the Court. if it be established that the Defendant built from his property into the river, or extended his property into the river and. erected a store upon it, there can be no question that such construction cannot be interfered with except by public authority, and that he alone, according to the above authorities, was entitled as riparian proprietor to the use of the river opposite his property for such purposes to the exclusion of all others ; but Respondent respectfully submits that there is sufficient evidence in the record to prove conclusively that the buildings in question were erected on the Defendant's own property.\nNow, Respondent submits that the Court should take into consideration the fact that the Appellants, by their action, claimed \u00a3100 of damages, when not one cent of damage up to that time could be proved, and that the reconstruction of the bridge was simply a question of one day's work, and as they asked that Respondent be condemned to repair the bridge, they failed to prove any damage whatsoever up to the institution of the action.\nThis total absence of any proof of damages was the main ground for dismissing the appeal, hut was an additional reason tending to show that, even from the Plaintiff's standpoint, this appeal is reduced virtually to a question of costs. And as it has already been held that a Court of Appeal is not disposed to interfere with judgments of the Court below, when only a question of costs was involved, this is an additional ground for maintaining the judgment of the Court below.\nThe Respondent holds, moreover, that, even granting to the Appellants all they claim in this action, taking into consideration the authorities above cited, they could not bring their action before this Court, it being simply an offence, delictum, which was of the jurisdiction of a magistrate or of the Trinity House of Montreal\nSee 2nd. Vic. ch. 19, sec. 1, 3 and 7 Act of 1849, ch. 117.\nMr. Robertson, Q.C., in reply.\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\n1878: June 04\nThe Chief Justice was absent when judgment was delivered.\nDefendant's contention in this case, so far as I can appreciate it, seems to me practically neither more nor less than this: The Plaintiffs, having erections in a navigable river which are convenient, useful and valuable to him and the Defendant, being desirous of having a similar accommodation, claims the right to remove such erections, which he calls obstructions, and substitute structures equally objectionable, though convenient, useful and valuable to himself in lieu thereof.\nThis I think he cannot do ; and with this I understand the courts below agree.\nBut as Plaintiffs, after action brought, and pending litigation, by which they sought damages and a removal of Defendant's erections, and a restoration to his original position, removed a portion of what was left by Defendant and in the meantime sought and obtained other accommodation, it was considered they had estopped themselves from recovering any other redress than for the actual damage they had sustained, previous to the bringing of their action, and no actual pecuniary damage having been shewn, their action was dismissed.\nIt was certainly an infringement of Plaintiffs' rights to have their property destroyed and themselves inconvenienced, and every injury imports a damage ; and, if Defendant had no right to interfere with Plaintiffs for the wrongful invasion of their property, they would be entitled to some damages, though they might be of small amount or even nominal. I fail to see on what principle Defendant can claim immunity, merely because Plaintiffs do the best they can to remedy the inconvenience Defendant has imposed on them, till they can obtain a judgment compelling Defendant to remove his works and restore them to their original position. I think the damages suggested of $50 moderate in the extreme.\nSTRONG, J., delivered an oral judgment holding that the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU, J., (translated) :\nThe Appellants, by their action brought in March, 1863, claimed a sum of seven hundred pounds damages from the Respondent for having disturbed them in their lawful ownership and possession of certain lands on which they had constructed stores, hangards and buildings for their trade and commerce and of a wharf built at a great expense out to deep water, which was connected with the shore by a wooden bridge built in the bed of Lake St. Louis which comes down to the shore and rested there on the property of one Charles Rapin ; they also alleged that these constructions were erected for the benefit of their trade and had also been of use to the public.\nThey further averred that these erections had been made openly and with the knowledge of the Government, and that they had been in peaceful possession of the same for upwards of eighteen years by themselves or by their tenants.\nThe conclusions of the declaration were that the Respondent be condemned to remove the erections by him made and which prevented communication with the Appellants' wharf, and in case of removal to pay \u00a3100 damages; and to pay \u00a3700 damages in case of failure in removing the obstructions. The Defendant's plea was that the wharf was not built with public authority nor for the public good ; that it had become a nuisance to the public and to the Defendant, and that in destroying part of the bridge, Defendant had simply exercised a lawful right, and that Plaintiffs had suffered no damage.\nOn these issues the parties went to proof and after twelve witnesses had been examined the Defendant was allowed to fyle a supplementary plea, puis darrein continuance, alleging : 1st. That since the institution of the action Charles Rapin had made some new erections upon his land on which rested the gangway which rendered impossible the rebuilding of the erections \" a fait des constructions et nouvelles \u00e6uvres qui rendent le r\u00e9tablissement des lieux impossible.\" 2nd. That the wharf in question had been carried away or destroyed partly by water, and partly from decay, and that therefore the re-establishment of the wharf would only be a public nuisance without any utility.\nThe judge of the Superior Court at Beauharnois dis-missed the Plaintiffs' action on the 30th October 1864 on the ground that they had proved no damage, although he did not deny to them their right of action. His judgment, carried into appeal, was confirmed by three out of five members of that Court * the minority holding that the Appellants had a good right of action, and ought to have been adjudged damages. One of the honorable judges forming part of the majority states, that, in his opinion, the Appellants had a good right of action, but that they failed to prove any damage. He added:\u2014\nIt was then a matter of costs, and. this Court is not disposed to interfere with the decision of the Court below which dismissed the action with costs.\nThe first question which arises is, whether the Appellants had a right to bring this action against the Respondent.\nI am of opinion that, inasmuch as the Appellants had publicly and with the knowledge of the Respondent, and with the implied consent of public authority, built the said wharf in the bed of Lake St. Louis and had peaceably enjoyed the possession thereof during 16 to 18 years, they were entitled to the benefits of their peaceful and public possession of this wharf, and that the Respondent had no right whatever vi et armis to destroy the gangway or means of communication which existed from the wharf to the shore. The Appellants, being disturbed in their possession, had a right of action en complainte against the Respondent All authors agree on this principle, and specially Garnier, Daviel and Toullier. The Appellants, it is true, could not avail themselves of prescription against the rights of the crown on any part of the beach and. lands reclaimed from the river or of the lake in question, but they could acquire such a possession as would justify them in bringing this action as first occupants without any objection on the part of the Crown. This doctrine is clearly laid down in the following authorities: \u2014\nGarnier des eaux:\nIl n'appartient qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de se plaindre de la construction d'un \u00e9tablissement sans autorisation et si l'\u00e9tat ne se plaint pas, soit que dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 l'\u00e9tablissement est utile, soit pour tout autre motif pas de droit en faveur de l \u00e9tranger. Et quant a l'action en rein-t\u00e9grande a plus forte raison le possesseur peut l'intenter m\u00eame sans une possession annuelle ni celle d'animo domini.\nDaniel ([11]) says :\u2014\nC'est une maxime de politique fond\u00e9e sure le but essentiel de toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9, de permettre aux particuliers l'usage de choses Publiques en tout ce qui n'est pas contraire \u00e0 leur destination commune.\nI might add a great many French and English authorities in support of Appellants' contention, but it is not necessary, as all the judges, with one exception, of the Court of original jurisdiction, as well as of the Court of Appeal, has admitted this doctrine. The only judge who did not concur in this opinion qualified his dissent by stating that if this bridge prevented the Respondent from communication with the river it became a public nuisance, and that, therefore, the Respondent had the right to destroy it proprio motu, &c., &c.\nI fail to see in the record before us any evidence that this wharf was either a public or private nuisance; on the contrary, I can find proof that this wharf was of a public utility to the persons of that locality as well as to those of the surrounding localities, on account of the facility it gave the steamboats and other vessels to land and take away the products of agriculture and articles of commerce.\nAs I have already stated, the judge who tried the case admitted in principle the Appellants' right, but because they allowed the wharf to go to decay the honorable judge concluded two things :\u20141st. That the abandonment of the gangway was an implicit abandonment by the Plaintiffs of their rights in the wharf and of obliging the Respondent to demolish and take away his new works. 2nd. That the Appellants had suffered no damage. This is the second question raised by this appeal.\nI cannot admit for a moment the reasoning of the learned judge on this ground. In allowing their wharf to go to waste in 1864 and 1865 the Appellants were forced to submit to the natural and immediate consequences which followed the Respondent's trespass. They never waived their right to real and vindictive damages, which damages were continuing and in-creased from day to day after the institution of the action. Moreover, the evidence of Alexander Parker, William Henderson, Frederick Ward and James Linch clearlv establishes the fact that by means of this wharf the Appellants derived an annual revenue of $200 to $300. We have, therefore, a good base to estimate the damages which the Appellants must have suffered from the month of July 1862 until the institution of this action in March, 1863. This would give at least $75, on allowing Appellants $200 per annum, and if we add to this amount vindictive damages which a jury or a Court might have given under the circumstances I think there were ample means of estimating the damages. This was the opinion of the two judges of the Court of Queen's Bench who were in the minority.\nIt was also argued on the part of the Respondent that one Coll McFee, who was a tenant of the Appellants, had been guilty of a trespass (voie de fait), by taking away a certain number of deals from the gangway, which had the effect of cutting off the communication with the shore and that the wharf then became a public and private nuisance, and this would give the right to the Respondent to destroy it. Admitting for a moment the truth of this allegation, I am of opinion that there is no evidence in the record which would warrant us in coming to the conclusion that Coll McFee, although their tenant, was the Appellants' representative or authorized agent to commit such a trespass (voie de fait). Moreover, this act on the part of McFee seems somewhat justifiable from the fact that the Respondent at the time was obstructing the wharf and its approaches by taking considerable time in loading his carts on the wharf; even this light obstacle was removed the next day, as the deals were immediately replaced. The only right of action the Respondent could have was, in my opinion not against the Appellants, but against McFee.\nThe above facts being satisfactorily established to my mind by the printed case, I cannot arrive at any other conclusions than the following :\u2014\n1st. That the building of the wharf in question by the Appellants was not a public nuisance, but that on the contrary, the said wharf was of advantage to that locality in particular, and to the public in general.\n2nd. That by allowing the wharf and other erections appertaining to the same to go to waste the Appellants did not thereby waive their right to recover substantial damages against the Respondent.\n3rd. That the Appellants, under the circumstances had the right to bring their action and that the Respondent could not, without exposing himself to pay damages take upon himself to destroy the approaches to Appellants' wharf 4th. That Appellants have proved that they are entitled to $50 damages.\nI am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that the Respondent should be condemned to pay to the Appellants $50 damages with costs in all Courts.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.;\u2014\nI concur in the judgment that has just been read. The Respondent's pleas have not been proved. He pleads that it was a nuisance of a public and private character. He certainly has failed to prove that it was a nuisance of a public character, and he does not set out how it would become a private nuisance to him more than to anyone else. Therefore, there is no justification for his removing it, further than there would be on the part of any other in the country. I think the law justified the parties having a wharf outside in putting that gangway on to the wharf. This party says however that he abated the nuisance but it appears he only abated it by putting another in its place. If it was a nuisance the erection put in place of it by his orders was, as far as the public were concerned, as great a nuisance as the one complained of. I think the plea is not proved in any way. His other plea has only reference to the claim that the property should be restored to its original position, and not at all to the damages. Such a plea as that, after the damages were incurred and the action commenced, could not be an answer. It does not affect the judgment at all in my view. He is to make out, first that it was a public nuisance, and secondly, that he had a justification in abating it. But the evidence does not prove he did abate the nuisance, because, as far as the public and the navigable qualities of the bay are concerned he did not abate the nuisance. It would be a queer way on a public highway to abate a nuisance if a party tore a building away and left another in its place. There is no justification whatever shown here, either by the pleas themselves, even if true, or by the evidence by which they were attempted to be sustained. I entirely agree that the action was a good action when commenced, that the subsequent plea did not affect it, that there were damages and injuries sustained, and that Plaintiff is entitled to recover for those damages. I think $50 very reasonable, under all the circumstances, and my opinion is that the judgment of the Court below should be reversed, and judgment given for $50 and all the costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs in all the Courts and $50 damages.\nSolicitors for Appellants: A. & W.

J., and Wilson, J., and on the 4th February, 1878, the said Court, composed of the same judges, delivered judgment affirming the conviction of the Appellants for manslaughter.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench for Ontario, when full, is composed of a Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges.\nThe Appellants thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court under 38 Vic., ch. 11, sec. 49.\nHeld,\u2014That the conviction of the Court of Queen's Bench, although affirmed but by two judges, was unanimous, and, therefore, not appealable.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Ontario, affirming the conviction of the Court of Oyer and Terminer and Gaol delivery for the District of Algoma.\nAt a special Court of Oyer and Terminer and general Gaol delivery in and for the provisional judicial District of Algoma, held on the 2nd October A. D., George Archibald Amer and Laban Amer, were tried for the wilful murder of William Bryan, and George Archibald Amer was found guilty of manslaughter, and Laban Amer was found not guilty. They were also tried for the murder of Charles Bryan and both found guilty. At the trial the learned Judge reserved certain questions of law for the consideration of the Court of, Queen's Bench for Ontario, and thereupon the said questions of law were argued before the Court of Queen's Bench, Harrison, C. J., and Wilson, J., being the only judges then present. On the 4th February, 1878, the Court of Queen's Bench, the same judges being present, considered and adjudged that the conviction of the said George Archibald Amer and Laban Amer be and the same were thereby affirmed.\nThe said George Archibald Amer and Laban Amer appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada under sec. 49 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe following statement of facts was agreed by counsel to be taken on the argument as part of the case:\u2014\n\"The Court of Queen's Bench, when full, is composed of a Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges Prior to the 13th November, 1877, the members of the said Court were the Honorable Chief Justice Harrison and the Honorable Justices Morrison and Wilson. Previous to the 3rd December, 1877, being the day upon which this case was argued in the Court of Queen's Bench, Mr, Justice Morrison was appointed Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, by commission bearing date the 30th November, 1877, and had, previous to the said 3rd day of December, intimated his acceptance of the said office of Justice of the Court of Appeal, and had thereupon ceased to act as Judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. He did not, however, take the oath of office as Justice of the Court of Appeal until the 15th December, 1877. Mr. Justice Armour's commission as Judge, as aforesaid, also bears date the said 30th day of November, 1877, and previous to the said 3rd day of December, he had intimated his acceptance of the said office, but did not take the oath of office until the 4th day of December, 1877. His commission reached him on the 1st day of December, 1877.\n\"The judgment in this case in the Court of Queen's Bench was delivered on the 4th February, 1878. Mr. Justice Armour was in Court during the day upon which the said judgment was delivered, but not until subsequent to the delivery thereof. He took no part in such judgment.\"\nMr. M. C. Cameron, Q.C., for Appellant, and Mr. Boyd, Q.C., for Respondent.\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nThe Supreme and Exchequer Court Act provides that any person convicted of treason, felony, or misdemeanor before any Superior Court, whose conviction has been affirmed by any Court of last resort, or, in the Province of Quebec, by the Court of Queen's Bench, on its appeal side, may appeal to the Supreme Court against the affirmation of such conviction; provided that no such appeal shall be allowed where the Court affirming the convictions is unanimous. It is not denied in this case that the Court appealed from was duly constituted and had full jurisdiction to hear the appeal, and that the Judges sitting in the Court and hearing the appeal were unanimous, and did affirm the conviction, but it is contended that there being one other Judge of that Court who might have sat in the Court, but did not, the Court was not unanimous; that the unanimity required by the Statute was not the unanimity of the Judges who composed the Court at the time of hearing the appeal, and who decided the case; but that an appeal existed, unless all the Judges of the Court were unanimous.\nBut I think the Court of last resort and the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec, named in the Statute, does not mean the individual Judges who may be authorized to sit in those Courts, but the tribunals from which the appeals are to come, or the respective Courts themselves, without reference to the number of Judges, provided always the Court be duly constituted by the presence of a sufficient number of Judges to make a legal Court, whatever number that may be, and if the Court so legally constituted affirms the conviction, and the Judges forming that Court and hearing the appeal shall be of one mind, that is agree in opinion or determination, in respect to the affirmance of the conviction, in other words, if the Court, is unanimous in affirming the conviction, no appeal shall be allowed; but if, on the contrary, the Judges differ in opinion, the Court not being unanimous, then, and then only, may the person convicted appeal.\nThe Court, in this case having been unanimous, I think there is no appeal to this Court, and we are without jurisdiction.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI concur. It is impossible for us to come to the conclusion that there was a want of unanimity; and so long as there was no want of unanimity, this Court possesses no jurisdiction under the Statute. For the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Ritchie, the appeal should be quashed.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nThe question, though not devoid of interest, in so far as the prisoners are concerned, seems, to my mind, so clear that I hardly can believe it possible to find a precedent to justify the application for an appeal to this Court. It has been said that in a doubtful case leniency should apply, or rather that the benefit of the doubt should be given in favor of the prisoners, but this humane principle should not blind us so as to make us lose sight of another principle, which is that no Court should take cognizance of an appeal when its jurisdiction is so doubtful. If, to extend mercy to the prisoners, we are to assume a jurisdiction which we do not possess, we would commit an act of injustice towards the crown and the community. That we have no jurisdiction is, to my mind, very evident. The Statute says in very clear terms that the appeal shall only be granted when a dissentient opinion is given in favor of the prisoner. That dissentient opinion is not to be found in the present case. The two learned Judges who expressed their opinion in the Court below composed the Court, and were unanimous, and so the case should end there. It is true that the Court may be composed of three Judges, but two of them form a competent Court. One of those three can also sit alone, and as such he forms the Court, and, as such, his decision would be final in the present cause. As Mr. Justice Ritchie very happily observed yesterday at the argument\u2014this right of appeal may be looked upon as only granted when it happens that a dissent to the judgment appears.\nThe prisoners should have applied for the privilege of having the full Bench. No Judge would have refused such a request, I am sure; but, having elected to submit their case before two Judges, and these two Judges forming the Court then sitting, I think the prisoners are precluded from their right of appeal to the Supreme Court.\nFOURNIER, J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\nLooking at the Statute giving us jurisdiction, I found that we have no jurisdiction where a Court properly constituted was unanimous. I must say, however, that I think the organization itself is defective. It does appear rather anomalous that one Judge should have power to decide a case of this kind, for it might be that the second decision would be by the same Judge who tried the case. Whether an amendment might be made by a change in the constitution in Ontario, or by an amendment to this Act, it is not for me to say. Nevertheless, an inconvenience must result to the public interests when one Judge could sit on a case of this kind, representing the full Court, and thus prevent an appeal to this Court. Still, I can only decide on the law as it is, and, after full consideration, I am bound to agree with the decision of the of my learned brethern.\nAppeal quashed.\nSolicitors for Appellants: Cameron, McMichael & Hoskin.\n"

J., and Ritchie, Strong, Taschereau, Fournier and Henry, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nPromissory Notes\u2014Joint Liability\u2014Evidence, rejection of\u2014Misdirection as to Interest.\nPlaintiffs sued W. upon two promissory notes signed by one T. E. and W. The notes were dated at Halifax and made payable to Plaintiff's order in Boston, U.S. The notes were unstamped, but before action brought double stamps were affixed and no contract as to interest appeared on the face of them. W. pleaded, inter alia, that he had signed the notes upon an understanding and agreement that he should be liable thereon as surety only for T. E., and that Plaintiffs, without his knowledge or consent, agreed to give and gave time to T. E., and forbore to enforce payment when they might have been paid. At the trial W. sought to cross-examine one of the Plaintiffs on an affidavit made by the witness, and to which was annexed a letter to Plaintiffs from T. E. This evidence was rejected by the Judge, and a verdict was given for Plaintiffs with interest. A rule nisi to set aside verdict was discharged by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, but they referred the rate of interest to a Master of the Court.\nHeld,\u2014That there was an improper rejection of evidence, and that the Jury should have been directed as to interest.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia discharging a rule nisi for a new trial.\nThis was an action brought by Respondents against Appellant upon two joint and several promissory notes, dated, Halifax, the 15th Oct., 1873, made by one Thomas Evans and the Appellant, by which they promised to pay to the order of the Respondents, at their office, at Boston, U. S., the respective sums of $1,000 and $2,000 U. S. currency.\nThe pleadings and facts of the case sufficiently appear in the judgment of Mr. Justice Henry, hereinafter given.\nThe evidence rejected by the Judge at the trial was an affidavit made by Chs. H. Souther, to oppose an order for continuance, to which was annexed a letter signed by Thomas Evans, and about which the Appellant sought to cross-examine the said Chs. H. Souther, in support of the following plea:\u2014\n\"The Defendant for an added plea in this cause, added by leave of a Judge, says for a plea on equitable grounds that he the said Defendant made the notes declared on in this action at the request of and for the sole accommodation of one Thomas Evans, as the surety only of said Evans, to secure a debt due to the Plaintiffs solely from the said Evans, and, save as aforesaid, there was not any value or consideration for the Defendant making the said notes or either of them, and the said notes were delivered to the Plaintiffs and accepted by them from the Defendant upon an understanding and agreement that the Defendant should be liable thereon as surety only for the said Evans, and the Plaintiffs, at the time the said promissory notes were made, had notice and knowledge of the same having been made by the said Thomas J. Wallace as such surety, as aforesaid, and that the Plaintiffs, without the knowledge or consent of Defendant, agreed to give and gave time for payment to the said Evans of said notes, respectively, and forebore to enforce payment of the same for a long time, and the Plaintiffs might and could, had they not given time, long since obtained payment from the said Evans, and by means of the premises the Defendant has been greatly prejudiced and damaged, and has been and is wholly discharged from all liability to pay the amount due upon the said notes, and each of them.\"\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Wilkins at Halifax, and a verdict given for the Respondents for $2,670 with interest.\nA rule nisi was taken out under the Statute to set aside verdict, which was argued before the Court in Banc on the 8th January, 1877, and discharged on the 2nd May, 1877.\nThe Appellant in person:\u2014\nThe papers which were declared on as promissory notes were only agreements, They were promises to pay John Souther & Son, but the action was brought by John Souther & Co. The notes were drawn in Halifax and were not stamped with any revenue stamps.\nThe learned Judge who tried the cause, among other misdirections, directed the jury that the papers declared on were promissory notes, requiring no stamps, gave them no directions as to the law by which they were to be governed in finding interest, if any, and told them that time given by one Plaintiff or partner to the principal would not discharge the surety, but that time should be given by all to have this effect. That they were not to go beyond the notes, or enquire into the consideration, and failed to give them such directions as the case demanded. Nor did he leave any question to the jury in closing, but gave them positive instructions to find a verdict against the Appellant. He should have told the jury that the notes, not having been made to the Plaintiffs but to John Souther & Son, they could not recover upon them, but did not do so.\nHillard on New Trials[1]; Roscoe[2].\nI complain also of the improper rejection of testimony offered by the Defendant, the Judge having rejected an affidavit made in the cause by one of the Plaintiffs or Respondents with a letter of Thomas Evans attached, and also refused to admit an agreement made between John Souther & Co. and one Charles Murdoch, when offered by the Appellant, but afterwards admitted, when offered by Respondents, a paper, a duplicate of the rejected agreement, except a memorandum at the bottom of the first, not on the second offered agreement: Roscoe on Evidence[3]; Taylor on Evidence[4]; Boileau v. Rutlin[5]; Brickell v. Hulse[6].\nI also submit that the Appellant, being only surety for Thomas Evans on the notes and agreements, the rejection of the testimony offered by him prevented him from proving his discharge in consequence of the time given to Evans. If the evidence had been received the want of an allegation of consideration could have been supplied by amendment at the trial. Evans's offer to pay interest was a sufficient consideration. Byles on bills[7]. In fact, the evidence does not establish a case for the Respondents. Hilliard on New Trials[8].\nMr. Gormully, for Respondents:\u2014\nThe notes declared on were promissory notes and there is no sufficient evidence of suretyship between the Appellant and Thomas Evans. But, assuming the suretyship to be established, there is no evidence that time was given to the principal in such a manner as to discharge the surety.\nMere non-direction on the question of suretyship would be no ground for a new trial, unless the verdict were against the weight of evidence; but that point is not open to Appellant in this Court. Great W. R. Co. v. Braid[9]. Respondents are entitled to interest, and what was given here was the legal interest, and the rate of interest in Boston, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, must be taken to be the same as the rate in Halifax. See Byles on bills[10].\nNow, as to the evidence rejected, the only evidence withdrawn from the jury was the affidavit and letter shown on pages 15 and 16 of the printed case. Such evidence was properly rejected. If admissible at all, it was never formally tendered, nor were the grounds of its admissibility distinctly pointed out to the Judge at the trial, consequently such improper rejection of evidence is no ground for a new trial.\nGreene v. Bateman[11]; Bain v. Proprietors of the Whitehaven Railway Compay[12].\nMoreover, the evidence rejected, even if admitted, could have had no effect on the jury, and the verdict meets the justice of the case. A Court ought not to grant a new trial after a verdict for the Plaintiffs where the defence set up is unconscionable, and the verdict has been found according to the justice and honesty of the case. Chitty Pr.[13].\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nI think there must be a new trial in this case. There was evidence rejected at the trial that ought to have been received, and this rejection requires this Court to make absolute the rule for a new trial. The notes sued on were the joint and several notes of Thomas Evans and Defendant Wallace. One of the defences was, that Defendant Wallace signed these notes for the accommodation of, and as surety for, Evans; that they were delivered to and accepted by Plaintiffs, on the agreement that Wallace was to be liable thereon as surety only for Evans, and that Plaintiffs, without the knowledge or consent of Defendant Wallace, gave time for payment to Evans, whereby Defendant was discharged.\nThe evidence Mr. Justice Wilkins rejected was an affidavit by Charles H. Souther, one of the Plaintiffs, to oppose order for continuance, to which was annexed a letter from Thomas Evans, addressed to John Souther & Co., upon which Mr. Wallace sought to cross-examine the said Charles H. Souther, when he was on the stand supporting his own case, in order to get evidence in support of his plea that he was a surety, and that time had been given to Evans.\nOn the cross-examination, the Judge's notes say:\nThe witness, one of the Plaintiffs, looks at an affidavit. The signature to it is mine. Looks at letter annexed. This is signed by Thomas Evans. I read that letter myself. Mr. Wallace asks, did you not on this letter\u2014(Objected. I refuse to allow that question.)\nDefendant, having opened his case, made the same Plaintiff his witness, and the Judge's notes say:\nMr. Wallace proceeded to interrogate Souther on the point of time having been given to a party. Mr. Wallace offers in evidence the affidavit of the witness submitted to him on cross-examination, and respecting which he spoke on his examination. Mr. Wallace did not in any way refer to this in opening his case to the Jury. I say to him that I require him to point out to me in what respect the affidavit which he offers contains matters contradictory of any evidence given by the witness on his cross-examination. This he declines to do, and I, therefore, refuse to receive the affidavit. * * * Wallace offers, in evidence, the letter annexed to the witness's affidavit. I refuse to receive it. He asks did you act on that letter? I refuse to allow him to do so.\nNow, this was clearly all wrong. One finds it somewhat difficult to understand how, after a witness, a party in the cause, on cross-examination, looks at an affidavit, the signature to which he admits to be his own, and identifies a letter annexed thereto as signed by the co-contractor of Defendant, to whom it is pleaded time was given, and states that he had read that letter himself, the Defendant could be denied the privilege of asking the witness what he he did on this letter, it being testified by the witness, that the account referred to in the letter was in connection with the original transaction, and an examination of the affidavit shows that it was made and used by Plaintiffs in this very cause, and the contents of the letter treating exclusively of the subject matter of this suit, expressing inability to pay promptly, and craving further indulgence. It is still more extraordinary that the Defendant was stopped and his question rejected before it was even finished.\nBut strange as this is, it is more unaccountable that Defendant, being driven as it were by this rejection to make Plaintiff his own witness, the Judge should reject the same affidavit when offered as part of Defendant's case. Surely the Defendant had a right to give in evidence an affidavit made and used by Plaintiff in the cause, having reference to the subject matter in dispute, whether it contradicted a previous statement of the party or not. Surely anything a party says or does in reference to the matter in controversy, his opponent has a right to prove, without being limited to whether it contradicts a previous statement or not; and, as to the letter annexed to the affidavit, it, having been read and used by Plaintiff and annexed to his affidavit, was, in like manner, receivable, and Defendant had a right to ask witness whether he acted on that letter. Without doubt the acts of a party to a suit are, equally with his declarations, evidence his opponent is entitled to use; and in this case, where the giving of time was solicited by the principal, if principal he was, the surety had a right to know whether that application was made and acted on by the creditor, the witness. This is the more obvious when the Defendant proves that Plaintiff said he had a letter from Evans asking for time and he had given it.\nWhether the whole evidence would have made out the suretyship and the giving of time or not, is not now the question. Most material evidence was rejected, bearing on the very point in issue, the want of which may have most effectually embarrassed Defendant in his defence, and for ought we know prevented him from establishing his case.\nAs to stamps, I say nothing, as it does not appear where the notes were made, whether in Nova Scotia or the United States.\nAnother point was in reference to the interest. The jury found the full amount of these notes and interest. The Appellant took exception to that, and contended that they could not allow interest, because no evidence was given as to what the rate of interest in Boston was, and that it should have been found specifically by the Jury. The Court, finding the difficulty there was, said, \"Oh! we will refer it to the Master to compute the interest\" (assuming the Master had the right to compute it), but gave no directions as to how that was to be done. But where, as here, interest was not made payable by the note itself, any interest given would be in the nature of damages; I think it should be found by the Jury and not by the Master; and, I think, it was the duty of the learned Judge to direct the Jury by what rule that interest should be governed. Because cases are abundant that, where a note or agreement is payable in a particular place, the rate of interest is to be governed by the rate at the place where the note is payable. As in this case the notes were payable in Boston, and there was no evidence as to the rule by which the interest might be computed, nor any evidence of the legal rate of interest in Boston, neither the jury nor the master had any rule or rate for their guidance. This might have been avoided if the Plaintiff had given up the interest, but the other is a substantial objection, and I am of opinion, therefore, that the rule should be made absolute for a new trial.\nSTRONG, J., delivered an oral judgment in favour of allowing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU and FOURNIER, J. J., concurred.\nHENRY, J.:\u2014\nThis is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The Respondents seek to recover upon two promissory notes set out in their writ, as drawn by the Defendant, dated the 15th day of October, 1873, payable one for $1,000 in one month, the other for $2,000 in three months, \"to the Plaintiffs at their office, South Boston, U. S.\" The Plaintiffs allege that they were duly presented for payment at the said office of Plaintiffs. The pleas to the notes declared on are:\u2014\n1st. A denial of the making of them.\n2nd. No consideration.\n3rd. That they were not stamped as required by law.\n4th. Setting out that they were given as part payment of machinery, for a dredge that was insufficient to perform certain work which it was agreed to be capable of performing; that the same was not worth more than the sum which had been already paid for it; that the Defendant was not aware of the insufficiency when he made the notes; and that, therefore, the Plaintiffs ought not to recover the amount of the notes or any part thereof.\n5th. On equitable grounds, that Defendant signed only as surety for one Thomas Evans to secure a debt due by him, Evans; that there was no consideration for the Defendant making the notes; that they were received by Plaintiffs on the agreement that Defendant should be answerable only as such surety; and that time was given by the Plaintiffs without the knowledge or consent of the Defendant to said Evans, by which his liability was discharged.\n6th. That the notes were not duly presented. The case was tried in 1876 and a verdict given for the Plaintiffs \"for amount claimed $2,670 with interest.\"\nA rule nisi having been refused, one was taken out under the Statute, the grounds argued before the Court at Halifax, and the rule discharged with costs. From that judgment the Defendant has appealed to this Court, and we are to decide whether that judgment should be confirmed or set aside and a new trial granted. A rule for judgment was granted as follows: \"On argument of the rule nisi to set aside the verdict herein, it is hereby ordered that the said rule nisi be discharged with costs.\"\nA number of grounds (eighteen) were taken in the rule nisi, but, according to the practice in Nova Scotia, they are all covered by the objections taken generally.\n1st. That the verdict is against law and evidence.\n2nd. For the improper rejection of evidence.\n3rd. For the improper reception of evidence, and\n4th. For misdirection.\nThe other objections contained in the rule need not be specifically referred to, as the four I have stated comprise them all.\nThe first step on the trial of the issues was to prove the making of the notes declared on, which are alleged to be notes payable to the Plaintiffs. Those given in evidence were made payable to \"John Souther & Son,\" not to the Plaintiffs. They are not declared on as payable to the Plaintiffs, as co-partners by the name and firm of \"John Souther & Son,\" but under the name and firm of John Souther & Co., nor is it in any way alleged that any firm of such a name as the former existed. And I am at a loss to ascertain how they, under the declaration, could have been received in evidence as the notes declared on. On proof of the Defendant's signature, as appears by the Judge's notes of the trial, they were \"read,\" and then Defendant objected that they were not properly stamped. It does not appear that any objection on any ground was taken before the reading of the notes. The admission of them in evidence may therefore be considered regular; but the question still remains what do they prove? Certainly, not that the Defendant made two notes to the Plaintiffs, but to John Souther & Son. If, therefore, John Souther & Son are the payees, what right have Charles H. Souther and George A. Souther, by being members of the firm of \"John Souther & Co., to sue for or collect money when no promise is shown to have been made to them? No evidence is given to show who the \"son\" is; and he may possibly be another son of John Souther altogether. If, therefore, the Defendant has not concluded himself by a clear agreement on the trial not to raise the objection, or rather has agreed that \"John Souther & Son,\" means \"John, Charles H. and George A. Souther, I must unhesitatingly say that the Plaintiffs wholly failed to make out a case.\nEvidence was given that the consideration of the notes passed from the firm of John Souther & Co, as a balance for machinery furnished by them. They might, if the Defendant were the original contractor or debtor, have recovered on the common counts; but the claim in this action is limited by the particulars to the notes, and the Plaintiffs must show a contract by them (the notes) to pay the Plaintiffs the amount of them either as members of the firm or otherwise. If by them, the notes, there is no contract to pay the amount of them to the Plaintiffs, it matters not that the Defendant owed them an equal amount as a balance for goods sold and delivered or otherwise. The whole evidence upon this point by the Plaintiffs is, that the Defendant owed the Plaintiffs, and that for the debt he gave the notes payable to \"John Souther & Son.\" The claim is not for the balance previously due; and the case of the Plaintiffs stands on the promise contained in the notes. There is no evidence, in my opinion, to sustain the allegation that the notes were made payable to the Plaintiffs; and I do not see how they can recover on a promise not made to them. I have looked carefully through the notes of trial and the judgment given by the Court below, but I can see nothing by which the Defendant is concluded from raising the ground of want of the proof necessary to sustain the claim set out in the writ that the notes were made payable to the Plaintiffs. It is clear to me that the objection was taken and considered on the argument below of the objections in the rule nisi; and I am, therefore, to assume it was raised on the trial. The judgment refers to it as an objection \"that there was no proof of partnership of the Plaintiffs,\" which shows that the objection was taken and disposed of in reference to the question of the right of the firm to recover on the notes. Being, therefore, of the opinion that the objection was open to the Defendant on the argument before us, he is entitled to the benefit of his defence on the plea denying the making of the notes declared on, and consequently, in respect to that issue, to a judgment in his favor. The case in 4 Allen R. p. 234, cited in support of the judgment, does not, in my opinion, affect the case. There, the surnames of all the Plaintiffs were given as the payees of the notes, and after the commencement of the suit the Defendant acknowledged his liability, and promised he would intruct his Attorney to give a confession. The objection was that the Christian names of the payees were not mentioned in the note, but the Court overruled the objection, because the Defendant had been \"served with process at their suit,\" and said he had no defence. It is authoritatively laid down that in a bill or note the person to whom it is to be paid must be designated with certainty; and that uncertainty, in this particular, will destroy the validity of the instrument[14]. So far as the evidence in this case goes, there is every uncertainty as to the payees of the notes in question. We might assume a good deal, but we cannot supply legally deficient evidence.\nThe objection to the rejection of evidence is another point demanding attention, and in considering it we must keep in mind the several issues.\nUnder the equitable plea, that Defendant was only a surety for Evans in the notes, he was justified in tendering evidence to show that the original indebtedness was not his, and he could not show that better than by a document signed by the Plaintiffs. The rejection of the document was therefore improper. Oral evidence of Defendant having been the original debtor had been received, and the document in question, showing the agreement with another party, was legitimate evidence in contradiction of that evidence and in support of this plea. I don't think it should have been considered \"irrelevant\" or its reception declined. It was a document signed by the Plaintiffs referring to what had been alleged as the consideration of the notes, and, under any circumstances, legitimate evidence. The affidavit of the witness, Charles H. Souther, and the letter referred to therein and annexed thereto was, on the same and other grounds, legitimate evidence, and was also, I think, improperly rejected. I know of no rule which would have required the Defendant to have referred to the affidavit in opening his case to the jury. Nor do I think it a good reason for rejecting it, that the Defendant declined to point out wherein it contained \"matters contrary of any evidence given by the witness on his cross-examination.\" This affidavit, made by one of the parties to the suit, and adopting, as it did, a letter which was alleged as the beginning of a negotiation for further time by Evans, for whom Defendant alleged he was security, should have been received as a matter of right, and not of favor, or subject to the condition imposed. When that affidavit and letter were proved, the Defendant could not, of course, then tender them in evidence; but he had a perfect right to question the witness as to what he or the other Plaintiffs did on receipt of that letter. He was not allowed to do so. He may, therefore, have been thereby prevented from proving an important issue, that time had been given to Evans in a manner to have released the Defendant. We, of course, cannot say that would necessarily have been the result. It is enough, however, that legitimate evidence that might have affected the verdict was rejected. As it was, the evidence that a binding contract for time which alone would have discharged the Defendant under the plea in question, was deficient; but we cannot tell what the result might have been, had the evidence in question not been rejected. I think, therefore, the verdict should be set aside on that ground.\nThe notes were payable in Boston, and the legal rights and liabilities of the parties to them are governed by the lex loci contractus. An objection was taken that they were not properly stamped. If that was a requisite to their validity at the place of payment, the law requiring such should have been proved by the Defendant; and in the absence of that proof, the plea must, in that respect, fail. They are dated at Halifax, but that, in my view, is unimportant. They were not notes at all till delivered in Boston, and besides, if even delivered in Halifax, but payable in Boston, they become subject to the laws at the place of payment.\nIt is adopted by the common law, as a general rule, in the interpretation of contracts, that they are to be deemed contracts of the place where they are made, unless they are positively to be performed or paid elsewhere[15].\nThe place of payment, according to every legal authority, settles, therefore, the point in this case, that the notes in question are to be deemed contracts of the place of payment, even if they had been fully executed and delivered in Halifax; but, as I before said, the delivery of them in Boston totally does away with any objection that might otherwise be raised. The whole contract was made there, and the formalities, proofs or authentications which are required by the lex loci are indispensable to their validity everywhere else. If, by the laws of the state of Masschusetts, the notes would have been void if not stamped, they would be held void here even before stamps were required in this country. Not good there, they would not be good anywhere. If, then, the notes could be recovered by the lex loci contractus without stamps\u2014and we must so assume, in the absence of proof to the contrary\u2014is stamping necessary before they can be sued upon in this country? And if so, how and when must the stamps be affixed? By section 11 of 31 Vic., ch. 9, it is provided that:\u2014\nIf any one in Canada makes, draws, accepts, indorses, signs, becomes party to or pays any promissory note, draft or bill of exchange chargeable with duty under this Act, before the duty (or double duty, as the case may be), has been paid by affixing thereto the proper stamp or stamps, he shall incur a penalty of one hundred dollars, and save only in the case of the payment of double duty, as hereinafter mentioned, such instrument shall be invalid and of no effect in law, or in equity, and the acceptance, or payment, or protest thereof, shall be of no effect. The provisions of that section are confined to promissory notes, drafts or bills of exchange, \"chargeable with duty under this Act,\" and we are thereby referred to section 1 of the same Act, by which stamp duties are imposed. The latter provides that:\u2014\nUpon and in respect of every promissory note, draft or bill of exchange * * * made, drawn, or accepted in Canada * there shall be levied, collected and paid to her Majesty, the duties hereinafter mentioned, &c.\n\"Made,\" \"drawn\" and \"accepted,\" are construed in their technical sense. The first applies to promissory notes and the other two to drafts, or bills of exchange. \"Drawing,\" in reference to bills of exchange, has the same application as \"making\" to promissory notes, and includes, not only the writing and signing, but also the full execution by delivery. \"Drawing,\" however, in reference to a promissory note, means nothing more than the writing without execution of it. I am, therefore, of opinion that the mere drawing and signing a promissory note in this country, delivered and payable in another, does not bring such a note within the terms of section 11, and, therefore, I think the notes in question may be recovered on although not stamped.\nI need hardly refer to the objection of \"misdirection,\" as my decision on other points is in favor of setting the verdict aside. The report of the Judge's charge is very general. He reports that he expressed a very decided opinion that the notes in view of the Stamp Acts, and the \"proved facts in connection with them\" were due and recoverable in point of law, and that to the Plaintiff's right to recover a verdict for the amount due on them no defence was made out under any of the pleas. From what I have said it will be seen that, as regards the objection on the ground of the want of stamps, I entirely agree with him. But from what I have said it will be as plainly seen that, I think, under the evidence the Plaintiffs did not make out a case, and that the learned Judge should have so charged.\nOne other point will I refer to. The verdict includes interest, and the question is, can it be sustained when so including it? The notes contain no reference to interest, and there is, therefore, no contract to pay it. No evidence was given that by the laws of Massachusetts the Plaintiffs could recover interest in such a case, nor what the rate of interest, if any, there was. It is clear to me, therefore, it cannot be recovered in this action under the evidence in it. The learned Judge who delivered the judgment of the Court below assumed that the learned Judge on the trial instructed the jury properly on this point, and he could \"see no difficulty in a judgment being entered for the Plaintiffs for interest, within the scope of the claim in the declaration at the legal rate thereof at Boston at the time of the trial to be referred to a Master of the Supreme Court to ascertain.'.' I feel bound to dissent from that decision. There is neither law nor established practice to sustain such a reference. For mere matters of computation, reference may be made to a Master; but the Defendant here had the right to have the law, as applicable to such a case, expounded by a Judge, and the opinion of the jury upon the point. Interest may be allowed or not, when not of the essence of the contract, and a jury is not bound by the law in Nova Scotia to give interest; and the rate of it may affect the judgment of a jury as to allowing it. To give that power to a Master might, in some cases, virtually leave the right of a party to recover a judgment, or not, dependent on the report of a Master, for, in a case where several claims existed on both sides, allowing or refusing interest on notes similar to those in question, might decide the verdict; or rather, leave the final result not be settled wholly by the jury under the direction of a Judge as to law, but, possibly, the most important part of it left to the decision of a Master. Oases in Nova Scotia are, as in other places, supposed to be tried by law and established practice, and issues decided by Judges and jurors. I can find no authority for calling in the aid of a Master in such a case. Were the interest merely a matter of computation under our own law, and the jury added it generally, the amount, no doubt, could be ascertained by a Master; but there is no law that I can find by which one part of an issue shall be found by a jury, directed as to the law by a Judge, and the remainder by a Master. We are in this Court authorized and required to give the judgment we think should have been given by the Court below; and, if this were the only objection to the verdict, we might possibly be justified, under the evidence, in directing a judgment for the Plaintiffs for the amount of the notes without interest; but I do not consider it necessary to decide as to that, because, for the other reasons given, I am of opinion the verdict cannot stand. It, in my opinion, should be set aside, and a new trial granted, and the appeal allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: Wallace Graham.\nSolicitors for Respondents: Meagher & Chisholm.\n[1] Pp. 254 to 291, 386.\n[2] P. 138.\n[3] Pp. 196, 214, 129.\n[4] Pp. 691, 723, 743 & 821.\n[5] 7 A. & E. 454.\n[6] 2 Exch. 675.\n[7] P. 382, 11 Edition.\n[8] Pp. 461, 124, 125, 129, 145, 138.\n[9] 1 Moo.

J., and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau and Gwynne, J. J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nRev. Stats. N. S. (4h Series) Ch. 23, Sec. 30\u2014Trespass by Individual Corporators\u2014Plea\u2014Corporation may sue its Members.\nJ. O. and J. A. C., while Trustees of School Section No. 16, South District of Pictou County, and N. O. as their servant, entered upon the school plot belonging to their section, removed the school house from its foundation and destroyed a portion of the stone wall. Subsequently, the Trustees of said School Section brought an action of trespass quare clausum fregit and de bonis asportatis against the said J. C., J. A. O., and N. O. for injury done to the school house, the property of the section. The Defendants pleaded inter alia justification of the acts complained of, asserting that the acts were legally performed by them in their capacity of Trustees. Sub. sec. 4 of sec. 30, ch. 23, Rev. Stats., N. S., (4th series) declares that the sites for school houses shall be defined by the Trustees, subject to the sanction of three nearest Commissioners, residing out of the section. In this case the sanction of the three nearest Commissioners was not obtained.\nHeld,\u2014On appeal, that under ch. 23 Rev. St., N. S., (4 series), J. O., J. A. O., and N. C. were not authorized to remove the school house from its site in the manner mentioned. That Defendants having subsequently abused their right to enter upon the lands of the corporation by an overt act of spoliation, the Plaintiffs, who are a corporate body and are identical with the corporation which existed at the time of the trespass, can maintain trespass against the Defendants for the injury done to the corporate property. That when an action is brought in the name of a corporation without due authority, it is not sufficient for the Defendants to plead that the Plaintiffs did not legally constitute the corporation, but in such a case Defendants ought to apply to the summary jurisdiction of the Court to stay proceedings.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, making absolute a rule for a new trial.\nThis was an action brought by the Plaintiffs as Trustees of School Section No. 16, in the South District of Pictou, against the Defendants for breaking and entering their close as such trustees, and destroying the foundation walls of the school house of that section thereon erected, and removing and carrying away the same from its lawful site and converting the same to their own use.\nThe declaration was in the ordinary form in cases of trespass quare clausum fregit and de bonis asportatis under the Nova Scotia law and system of pleading, and the pleas are eight in number.\nThe Defendants, by their pleas, denied that they committed the trespass as alleged; the Plaintiff's property in the land and in the goods; and by their seventh plea asserted a title to the freehold of the said land, and a right of property in the said goods in the Defendants, James Cameron and John A. Cameron, as being the Trustees (with one Duncan Macdonald, who is not a party in the action) of School Section No. 16, South District of Pictou, duly elected and appointed under the Statute in that behalf, and the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron justified the acts complained of by asserting that the said acts were performed by them in their said capacity of Trustees, they having lawful power so to do, and the Defendant Nathan Cameron as the servant of the said other Defendants.\nBy the eighth plea, the Defendants denied the character of the Plaintiffs at the time the trespasses were committed or action brought and their property in the lands and goods, and that the said James Cameron, John A. Cameron and Duncan Macdonald were at the time, &c., Trustees of the said School Section No. 16, duly elected and appointed under the Statute, a body corporate for the purpose mentioned in the Statute, &c.\nThe evidence showed that the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron, together with the said Duncan Macdonald, had, at the annual school meeting for the said section, held in 1873, been appointed trustees for that section for the ensuing year; that they assumed the duties of that office; that a teacher was engaged by them, and an effort made to open the school. That in December, 1873, and during the currency of their term of office, the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron, at an informal meeting, and without the concurrence of Duncan Macdonald, determined to remove the school house of said section to another site. That a site for the school house of that section had been chosen according to law, and the school house built, and that while James Cameron and John A. Cameron were Trustees the school house was actually removed by them, and a portion of the stone wall was destroyed. That in June, 1874, the Commissioners of Schools for South Pictou dismissed the said Trustees, and appointed the Plaintiffs in their stead.\nThe mode of substituting Trustees and the powers and duties of the Trustees are prescribed by the following sections of chap. 23 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (4th series), secs. 20, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, which are referred to at length in the judgments of this Court.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Macdonald with a jury, at Halifax, on the 25th October, 1875.\nAt the trial, he recommended a non-suit, and Plaintiffs' counsel having refused to become non-suited, the learned Judge told the jury that it was their clear duty to find a verdict in favor of the Defendants. Notwithstanding the charge, a verdict was rendered for the Plaintiffs, with $150 damages, and the Defendant then moved to set aside the same, on the grounds set forth in the rule nisi, and the Court below made the rule absolute.\nMr. Cockburn, Q. C., for Appellants:\nThe Plaintiffs, being legally appointed, represent the section for which, as a corporate body, they act. Their possession is not an individual possession, but the possession of the people whom, in their corporate capacity, they represent; the possession of their predecessors was also only a representative and not an individual possession, and, therefore, in their corporate representative capacity, the Plaintiffs, after their appointment, can maintain trespass for any wrong done to the corporate property by any individual, whether at the time of the wrong done such individual happened to be a member of the corporation or not. Courvell v. Woodard[1]; Brice on Ultra Vires[2]; Waterman on Trespass[3].\nA corporation may sue its members. See Field on Corporations[4].\nThe act complained of was not done by the Defendants as a corporate act representing the section, but done by them as individuals.\nAs to the second point, that the Trustees at the time of action, were not the legally appointed trustees of the section, I submit this cannot be raised by the plea fyled in this case. The Board of Commissioners, being a court of competent jurisdiction, their acts, appointments or decrees cannot be impunged except by appeal to the Council of Public Instruction.\nMr. A. F. McIntyre for Respondents:\nThe first point to be determined is whether the acts complained of were done by the Respondents in their corporate capacity of Trustees, or as individuals.\nIt is a fact that the removal of the school house was decided by a majority of the trustees at a meeting held by them in December, 1873. Under the Revised Statutes Nova Scotia, 4th series, c. 1 last sub.-sec. of sec. 7, where a joint authority is given, a majority can act, and by c. 32, sec. 31, power is given to the Trustees to change the site of the school house when they deem it desirable. The approval of their decision by the three nearest Commissioners is only necessary when the site is first chosen. These were, no doubt, the sections the Trustees had in view when they arrived at their determination. There was no necessity for them to keep a record of their proceedings; in such cases it is sufficient to prove the resolution to have been passed by a majority of the Board. In re Bonnelli's Telegraph Co.[5]; Darcy v. Tamar Ry. Co.[6].\nThere is nothing in the Nova Scotia Act which requires that a notice in writing should be sent before a meeting is held, as in the Ontario Act.\nIn any case the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron, being members of a public corporation, incorporated for public purposes, and having public duties to perform, an action of this sort will not lie against them at the suit of the corporation for acts done in their corporate capacity without proof of mala fides: Harman v. Taffenden, et al[7].\nThe Respondent submits also that the present appeal should be dismissed, because at the time of the alleged trespasses, the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron, together with the said Duncan Macdonald, were the duly elected and acting Trustees of Section No 16, South District of Pictou County, and were, as such Trustees, by law vested with the freehold in the lands and the property, in the goods in the pleadings mentioned, and in possession of the same.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\nBy sec. 7, c. 32, Revised Statutes, N. S., 4th series, sec. 7, the Governor in Council is empowered to appoint Commissioners for each District, who shall form a Board of School Commissioners.\nBy sec. 22 each school section shall have a Board of three Trustees, and no section shall have more than one Board.\nBy section 28, the Trustees of any section shall be a body corporate for the prosecution and defence of all actions relating to the school or its affairs, and other necessary purposes, under the title of \"Trustees of School Section No. \u2014\u2014, in the District (or Districts) of \u2014\u2014,\" and they shall have power, when authorized by the school meeting, to borrow money for the purchase or improvement of grounds for school purposes, or for the purchase or building of school houses.\nBy sec. 29, Trustees are authorized to effect insurances on school houses, and sec. 30 declares the duties of the Trustees as follows. Inter alia sub-sec. 2:\nTo take possession of and hold as a corporation all the school property of the section, or which may be purchased for or given to it for the use or support of Common or Academic Schools.\nSub. sec. 4:\nTo determine the sites of school houses, subject to the sanction of the three nearest Commissioners residing out of the section, and in case the three nearest Commissioners do not agree as to the site of a school house, the matter shall be referred to the Board of Commissioners for the District or County in which the school is situate, and their decision shall be final.\nThe Trustees of School Section No. 16 were possessed of the property on which this school house stood under a deed from William Thompson to James Macdonald, Donald Macdonald and Peter Ross, Trustees of School Section No. 16, dated 29th Oct., 1866, whereby Thompson, in consideration of $16, bargained and sold to said Trustees and their successors in office the lot in question, to have and to hold the same as school property to said Trustees and their successors in office. At the time of the acts complained of, Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron, and one Duncan Macdonald, were the Trustees of School District Sec. 16. Macdonald says he had nothing to do with the removal of the school house; that James Cameron and John A. Cameron came to see him about it after night; said they were going to remove the school house, and asked if he had any objection; he said he had; that it could not be in a better place; that he saw the Commissioners remove the school house in Dec, 1873.\nPeter G. Campbell says:\nIt was removed the length of itself and 3 or 4 feet more from its old foundation. It was less or more damaged; the stone wall was torn down.\nDuncan Cameron says:\nI said to James Cameron (the morning they commenced to remove the building) surely you are not going to remove the building; he said yes. He said, they had consulted the Board before and they would not heed him. He said they did not consult the Board about removing it; then, I said, you should have consulted the section; he said, we are the section; he said they were about removing it to another site about a mile and a quarter off, and not approved of by the Board.\nJames Macdonald says:\nI saw James and John A. Cameron in the act of removing the house; Nathan Cameron was present with others. The stone foundation was torn down in removing it. It was removed towards the road. I think part of it was on the road. It was left temporarily on the runners. * * * Afterwards, I had a conversation with James Cameron. He said he did not consult the Commissioners as he did so previously without good result. * * * The house was thrown off the level so that one corner of the window was an inch open when the other was closed.\nWilliam Thomas says:\nWhen the school house was taken off the foundation the windows were twisted. The one end higher than the other. * * * The weather boards and a few shingles were hurt.\nNathan Cameron was the only Defendant examined. He was called for the defence. He says:\nThey asked me to go and assist them in removing the school house in Dec, 1873. I assisted them. We were to remove it a mile and a quarter away, or less. The Defendants told me that their object was to remove the school house to the church.\nThere is evidence as to the deposition of the Trustees and the appointment of others in their stead after the removal; but, in the view I take of this case, all such evidence is immaterial and ought not in any way to affect the disposition of this case.\nOn the trial, Mr. James moved for a non-suit on the ground that \"a corporation cannot sue itself; no title or possesion proved in the plantiffs; title and possession proved to have been in the Defendants, Trustees, at the time of the alleged injury.\" The learned Judge recommended a non-suit, and, on Plaintiffs' counsel refusing to become non-suited, the Judge instructed the jury that Defendants, having denied Plaintiffs' possession, it was incumbent on Plaintiffs to prove possession, actual or constructive; that evidence showed Defendants, James Cameron and John A. Cameron and Donald Macdonald, were Trustees at the time and were in the legal possession, the law vesting both the title and possession in them as such Trustees; * * * expressed great doubt as to the dismissal, in which case he said, by this strange action, two of them would be now Plaintiffs, as Trustees against themselves, as individuals, but that it was hot necessary to trouble the jury with that question, as their legal possession at the time of the alleged trespass was sufficient defence in this action for acts done, while in such legal possession, by them and Defendant who justified under them. That, if they were guilty of a breach of trust, as such Trustees, as he thought they were, the section had a remedy for such wrong, but certainly not in this form, or style of action. That as the case turned upon a question of law, the facts upon which the legal question depended being admitted on all sides, he had nothing to submit to them, and that it was their clear duty to find a verdict in favor of the Defendants.\nNotwithstanding this charge the jury found in favor of the Plaintiffs, and a rule was made absolute by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to set aside this verdict, and a new trial was granted. No question was raised as to this being a perverse verdict, and it was not set aside upon that ground, but the judgment appears to proceed on the ground that the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron were Trustees at the time of the removal, and were at the time in the lawful and exclusive possession as Trustees of School Section No. 16, which, the judgment states,\nstrikes at the very foundation of this suit, and is of itself a fatal objection to it, as it is clear that trespass cannot be maintained against the Defendants for the removal of the school house while they were in the lawful possession of it as Trustees.\nWhile admitting the Defendants may have acted indiscreetly, the judgment goes on to say:\nBut it must be borne in mind that they were public officers, and if they acted in good faith, though wrong, they cannot be treated as trespassers and held personally responsible for what they did.\nI venture humbly to submit that this is all wrong; that the Defendants in their pleadings, their counsel on the trial, as well as the learned Judge and full Court, have entirely misapprehended this case in dealing with it as if the title and possession of this school property was in the Trustees for the time being personally and as individuals, and not as in a corporate or quasi corporate body, and in treating this action as if brought by the Trustees, or those claiming to be Trustees, in their own name as individuals, as if the fee was in the individual Trustees, and as if the action was for a wrong done to the personal title or possession of the individual Trustees, instead of treating the title and possession as being in a corporate or quasi corporate body, and the action as brought by such corporation for a wrong done to the title and possession of the corporation.\nUnder the express terms of the Statute the Trustees of schools are to \"take possession of and hold as a corporation all the school property of the section,\" and the Trustees of any section are declared to be a body corporate under the title of \"Trustees of School Section No. \u2014\u2014 in the District (or Districts) of \u2014\u2014\" for the prosecution and defence of all actions relating to the school, or its affairs, and other necessary purposes.\nThe Trustees, therefore, are created a corporation or artificial body, by, virtue of which they hold the land like every other corporation.\nThe title being in the corporation, not in the members of the corporation, the Trustees may change, but the corporation continues, and the title and possession continues in the corporation.\nThe members, though constituent parts, are not in a legal sense the corporate body, but as it has been expressed, \"they are only the elements which form the one artificial body,\" but entirely distinct from the artificial body endowed with corporate powers; so that the rule that a person cannot be both Plaintiff and Defendant in the same suit, which seems to have embarrassed the counsel and the Court below, has no application to corporations. We have every day's experience of members suing corporations and of corporations suing members, and it is too well established to be now disputed that \"suits may be brought for all the variety of causes and in all the various forms, and in the same manner as though the parties thereto were natural persons.\"\nThe acts of the Trustees, no doubt, are the acts of the corporation, but only when within the scope of the authority conferred on them by the law establishing the corporation. Their acts are only the acts of the corporation, so far as they have such authority to act by virtue of the powers conferred on them.\nThe Legislature has only granted to School Trustees in Nova Scotia special and limited powers for limited purposes, and one limitation is that they shall not fix or determine, and, a fortiori, not change, the site of a school house without the sanction of the Commissioners. If the Trustees wrongfully deal with the property confided to their care in a manner, not only not sanctioned by law, but contrary to law, as distinguished from mere error, mistake and misapprehension, or simple negligence, they cease to act as Trustees. Their act in such a case is not a corporate act. They become wrongdoers, and cannot justify as Trustees, and, as such, are liable to be sued by the corporation as any other trespasser or wrong-doer having no legal justification for his acts.\nIf the acts of these Defendants, then, are clearly ultra vires, their liability for such acts must be determined by the ordinary principles of law. \"In all cases of tort,\" Mr. Brice says, \"as an actual wrong-doer is always liable to the injured party, a corporate official necessarily is under personal responsibility.\"\nI quite agree that, so far as the determination of this case is concerned, it matters not who the individual Trustees now are, or were at the commencement of this suit. If Trustees for the time being, having the right to manage the school affairs and to bring and defend suits in the corporate name, have any reason to complain that the corporate name is being improperly used in the bringing of an action, I can see no reason why the same course would not be open to them that a private individual would have, if his name was used without his consent, viz: by applying to the Court to stay and set aside the proceedings. Be this as it may, all we have now to do is, not to enquire what individual Trustees set the law in motion, but to treat the suit as properly brought in the name of the corporation, and adjudicate on the rights of the corporation; in other words, simply to enquire whether the close of the Plaintiffs has been illegally broken and entered, and the property of the corporation, the school house, has been unlawfully injured and removed, and, if so, to ascertain whether the Defendants were guilty of such unlawful acts. Reduced to this point, the result is self evident. These three Defendants, without authority of law, undertook to remove this school house from its site, and did so in a most wilful manner, for it cannot be pretended that they were in ignorance of the law, or the duties and powers of Trustees, but they did it, in fact, in direct defiance of the law. They knew no site could be fixed and determined on without the sanction of the Commissioners, and this they would not even seek to obtain, because, from a previous application, they had evidently discovered that the Commissioners would not sanction their proposed interference. Thus, these Defendants, without such sanction, without taking any action under sub. sec. 4, and without the acquiescence of the third Trustee, in fact, in opposition to him, proceed to remove the school house, drawing it from its foundation and otherwise injuring the foundations and buildings. These three Defendants, then, were violating the law and acting outside of and beyond any power or authority given to Trustees of Schools over school property, and so abused the authority given them by law and became trespassers, and so rendered themselves liable to be sued as such by the corporate body on whose property they so trespassed, which body corporate are the Plaintiffs of record in this suit. The Plaintiffs, then, having suffered wrong at the hands of the Defendants, and the Defendants having wholly failed by plea or proof to justify their conduct, I think the charge of the learned Judge was wrong, and the judgment of the Court below confirming that ruling equally wrong, and that this appeal should be allowed with costs in all the courts.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nThere seems to have been a strange misconception of both the facts and law as regards the first point which is dealt with in the judgment of the Court below, that relating to the Plaintiffs' title to sue. The Plaintiffs are a corporation aggregate incorporated under ch. 32 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (4th series), having necessarily perpetual succession, and not the individual corporators who, at the time the action was brought, happened to compose the corporation. The Plaintiffs sue by their corporate title as \"The Trustees of School Section No. 16, South District of Pictou County,\" and the names of the individual Trustees are not once mentioned in the record. It is, therefore, only calculated to confuse the case, and to introduce irrelevant matter into its decision to speak of the Trustees individually as the Plaintiffs, and to enter into an enquiry as to the legality of the dismissal of the former Trustees and the election of those who at present claim to fill the corporate offices.\nThe corporation which now sues for trespass to the corporate body is identical with the corporation which was seized of that property at the time the wrong complained of was done. The eighth plea does not contain allegations showing that the corporation has ceased to exist, in which case it might have constituted a good defence, but it merely sets up that the persons now claiming to constitute the corporation, in the plea itself miscalled the Plaintiffs, had not been duly elected or appointed to fill the offices of Trustees, and that the old Trustees are still in office.\nAs the action is brought by the corporation, this is manifestly no defence. If the action was brought without due authority in the name of the corporation, that is not a matter which could properly be raised as a defence on the record, though it might, under proper conditions, have constituted ground for an application to the summary jurisdiction of the Court to stay proceedings. The 8th plea, which raises this objection is, therefore, irrelevant and bad in substance, and tenders an immaterial issue. It follows that, as a new trial will never be granted for the purpose of re-trying an immaterial issue, one in respect of which a verdict for the Defendant might be followed by a repleader or judgment non obstante, there was clearly no ground for a new trial as regards the issue on the 8th plea.\nAs to the issues on the six original pleas, amounting respectively to pleas of not guilty, and a traverse of Plaintiffs' property and possession in the locus in quo, pleaded to each of the three counts of the summons, the evidence was entirely sufficient to warrant a verdict on all these for the Plaintiffs.\nThere remains the issue on the 7th plea, which is in substance a justification by the Defendants, James Cameron and John A. Cameron, as corporators at the time of the acts complained of, and by Nathan Cameron, the remaining Defendant, as their servant. The evidence shows that the Defendants entered upon the school plot and removed the school house from its foundation, and destroyed part of a stone wall which formed the foundation. This was an act clearly beyond their legal powers. The powers and duties of the Trustees are prescribed by chapter 32 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia (4th series), secs. 30 to 34, inclusive, and nothing can there be found authorizing them to remove the school house from its site in the manner mentioned by the witnesses for the Defendants themselves, as well as by those who gave evidence for the Plaintiffs.\nUpon the uncontradicted testimony it appears that the school house was actually removed from its foundation and a portion of the stone wall was destroyed, and although no question as to these facts was specifically left, by the learned Judge who tried the cause, to the jury, yet it would, of course, be idle to send the case back for a new trial in order that a jury might find upon these undisputed facts. Then, the legal consequence of the Defendants acts is that, although they were members of the corporation at the time of the wrongs complained of, and had, for all legal purposes and in the due execution of their duty, a right to enter upon the lands of the corporation, and although their entry, followed by no abuse of authority, must be presumed to be legal and for the purpose of performing their corporate duties, yet, when the entry was followed by a subsequent abuse of authority, they became trespassers ab initio, their wrongful act relating back so as to make the original entry unlawful. This is very old law, for in one of the resolutions of the Six Carpenters' case[8], it is laid down that when a party enters under authority of law and is guilty of subsequent abuse, he becomes a tresspasser ab initio, though it is otherwise where the entry is by authority of the party.\nThe entry of the Defendants upon the lands of the corporation, therefore, constituted the trespass for which the Plaintiffs are entitled to recover, and the pulling down the wall and the removal of the school house are the acts of abuse which made the original entry unlawful, and were, also, matters of aggravation to be considered in estimating the amount of damages.\nThe issue on the 7th plea, which justifies the acts of the Defendants as those which \"they had lawful power and authority to do,\" was, therefore, rightly found for the Plaintiffs, inasmuch as the Defendants showed no justification in law.\nThe whole case may be summed up in two propositions. The first is that upon which the case of the Appellants is rested in their factum, and which I adopt almost in the words in which it is there propounded. The Plaintiffs are a corporate body and are identical with the corporation which existed at the time of the trespass, and although the members of the corporation may have been changed, the possession is, and has always been, not that of the individual corporators, but the possession of the corporation. The Plaintiffs (the corporation) can, therefore, maintain trespass for any wrong done to the corporate property by any individual, whether at the time of the wrong done that individual happened to be a member of the corporation or not. The other proposition, that a wrong was committed by the Defendants at a time when they were members of the corporation, is established by the principle of law already adverted to, that an entry by an individual corporator followed by an overt act of spoliation, makes him a trespasser by relation.\nThe case of Harman v. Taffenden[9], cited by the Respondents, has no application here; it was not a case of trespass on the lands of the corporation. The rule of law which I apply does not in any way depend on proof of the intention of the party, either in entering or in committing the subsequent wrongful act. The principle is, that where a party, having an authority derived from the law to make an entry upon lands, commits an unlawful act upon the lands, there arises a presumption of law, one which cannot be rebutted, that he entered with unlawful intent, and that his entry was, therefore, a trespass.\nIn my judgment, the decision of the Court below must be reversed, and there must be substituted for the rule absolute, a rule discharging the rule nisi with costs, and the Appellants must have the costs of this appeal.\nFOURNIES, J.:\u2014\nL'action en cette cause est pour voie de fait commise par les D\u00e9fendeurs sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Appelante, en d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant la maison d'\u00e9cole de la section No. 16.\nLorsque ce d\u00e9placement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, deux des D\u00e9fendeurs faisaient eux-m\u00eames partie du corps des syndics et formaient, lorsque la pr\u00e9sente action a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e, la majorit\u00e9 de la Corporation qui les poursuit en cette cause.\nLes D\u00e9fendeurs ont r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette action par plusieurs moyens de d\u00e9fense qui peuvent en derni\u00e8re analyse se r\u00e9duire aux deux suivants: 1o. Ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la destitution des Intim\u00e9s comme syndics de la dite Corporation, et cons\u00e9quemment nullit\u00e9 de la nomination de leurs rempla\u00e7ants; 2o. justification des faits qui leur sont imput\u00e9s comme voie de faits.\nPar le ch. 32 des Statuts Refondus de la N. Ecosse, (4\u00e8me s\u00e9rie) r\u00e9glant l'instruction publique dans cette Province, les syndics de toute section scolaire sont \u00e9rig\u00e9s en Corporation sous le titre de \"Trustees of School Sec. No...... in the District of ....... (or Districts of).\nLa 30me sec. d\u00e9finit leur pouvoir ainsi qu'il suit:\n30. The duties of the Trustees shall be as follows:\n(1.). To meet as soon after the annual election or appointment of Trustees, or a Trustee, as practicable, and appoint one of themselves, or some other person, to be Secretary to the Board of Trustees, and to provide him with a suitable blank-book, and instruct him to keep therein and carefully preserve a correct record of all doings of the board.\n(2.) To take possession of and hold as a Corporation all the school property of the section, or which may be purchased for, or given to it for the use or support of common or academic schools....................\n(4.) To determine the sites of school houses subject to the sanction of the three nearest Commissioners residing out of the section; and in case the three nearest Commissioners, residing out of the section, do not agree as to the site of a school house, the matter should be referred to the Board of Commissioners for the District or County.\nPar leur premier moyen de d\u00e9fense, les Intim\u00e9s d\u00e9mis, ill\u00e9galement d'apr\u00e8s les faits \u00e9tablis sur preuve, veulent faire d\u00e9cider en cette cause la question de savoir qui d'eux, ou de leurs rempla\u00e7ants, sont les syndics l\u00e9galement en office. Cette question ne pouvait pas \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re indirecte comme on a essay\u00e9 de le faire. Elle devait faire le sujet d'une proc\u00e9dure sp\u00e9ciale. Pour prendre avantage de ce moyen de d\u00e9fense, les Intim\u00e9s auraient d\u00fb se borner \u00e0 se plaindre que les syndics qui pr\u00e9tendent agir en cette cause au nom de la Corporation ne sont pas l\u00e9galement rev\u00eatus de cette qualit\u00e9, en accompagnant cette all\u00e9gation d'une demande de surseoir aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 ce que, sur quo warranto, cette question e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e. Au lieu de cela, ils ont jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de plaider au m\u00e9rite. C'est une r\u00e8gle certaine en mati\u00e8re de plaidoyers, aussi applicable aux Corporations qu'aux individus, que le D\u00e9fendeur qui plaide au m\u00e9rite reconna\u00eet la capacit\u00e9 de poursuivre chez son adversaire. Les Intim\u00e9s doivent en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme ayant abandonn\u00e9 ce chef de leur d\u00e9fense et reconnu le droit d'action.\nC'est \u00e0 leur plaidoyer de justification qu'ils doivent maintenant s'entenir. Ils pr\u00e9tendent se justifier en all\u00e9guant que c'est en ex\u00e9cution d'une d\u00e9cision prise par eux comme syndics, de changer le site de la maison d'\u00e9cole en question, qu'ils ont agi.\nIl n'est pas douteux d'apr\u00e8s la preuve que les D\u00e9fendeurs ont quelque peu d\u00e9plac\u00e9 la maison d'\u00e9cole en question; et que dans cette op\u00e9ration le mur des fondations a \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9, ainsi que les fen\u00eatres et une partie de la couverture. Ces faits, \u00e0 moins que les Intim\u00e9s ne prouvent qu'ils \u00e9taient l\u00e9galement autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 agir comme ils l'ont fait, sont certainement suffisants pour constituer une voie de fait donnant lieu \u00e0 des dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats. Mais ils pr\u00e9tendent de plus \u00e9tablir leur justification en all\u00e9guant qu'ils \u00e9taient, en leur qualit\u00e9 de syndics, propri\u00e9taires et en possession l\u00e9gale de la maison d'\u00e9cole et du lot sur lequel elle est construite, et que par cons\u00e9quent l'action pour voie de fait ne peut exister contre eux.\nLes Intim\u00e9s, en \u00e9mettant cette pr\u00e9tention, se trompent sur l'\u00e9tendue et le caract\u00e8re du pouvoir que la loi leur attribue sur les maisons d'\u00e9cole. Ils n'en sont que les administrateurs et non pas les propri\u00e9taires. Ce ne sont pas les syndics en fonctions qui, aux yeux de la loi, sont les propri\u00e9taires et en possession de la maison d'\u00e9cole, mais la Corporation dont ils ne sont que les agents ou repr\u00e9sentants. Le parag. 2 de la sec. 31, est clair sur ce point, et indique, comme l'un des devoirs des syndics, la prise de possession comme corporation des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s scolaires appartenant \u00e0 la section. \"To take possession of, and hold as a Corporation, all the school property of the section.............\"\nAinsi, ils ne sont ni propri\u00e9taires ni en possession individuellement comme syndics, mais c'est la Corporation elle-m\u00eame qui en est propri\u00e9taire et en possessions sous le titre que la loi lui a donn\u00e9. Ils ne peuvent pas se confondre avec la Corporation qui est un \u00eatre tout \u00e0 fait distinct des personalit\u00e9s qui la composent. Pour se justifier il leur faudrait non-seulement \u00e9tablir qu'ils agissaient en vertu d'une autorisation de celle-ci, mais aussi faire voir que la loi leur donnait sur la maison d'\u00e9cole une autorit\u00e9 qu'elle leur avait d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e Pour cela, il aurait fallu prouver qu'une d\u00e9cision prise par les Intim\u00e9s, comme corporation, avait re\u00e7u, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 4 de la sec. 30, la sanction des Commissaires les plus proches. Cette preuve n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. En agissant contrairement \u00e0 la disposition de cette section, il est \u00e9vident que les Intim\u00e9s ont outrepass\u00e9 leurs pouvoirs et commis une voie de fait pour laquelle ils sont responsables.\nDe plus, il est visible par l'irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s et l'empressement manifest\u00e9 par les Intim\u00e9s, que ceux-ci prenaient un int\u00e9r\u00eat plus qu'ordinaire dans le changement du site de l'\u00e9cole de la section. C'est le soir, tard, sans convocation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re d'assembl\u00e9e, qu'ils font demander \u00e0 leur coll\u00e8gue, Duncan Mac Donald, s'il concourt dans leurs vues au sujet du transfert de la maison d'\u00e9cole. Sur sa r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative, les deux autres d\u00e9fendeurs persistent dans leur d\u00e9termination. Il n'en est fait aucune entr\u00e9e dans les r\u00e9gistres, ainsi que l'exige le parag. 1 de la sec. 30. Le lendemain, avec le concours d'un certain nombre d'int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, ils se mettent \u00e0 l'\u0153uvre pour transporter la maison. Cette pr\u00e9cipitation et ces irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s dans les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s font voir que les Intim\u00e9s agissaient comme individus et non comme autoris\u00e9s par la Corporation. Cette conduite d\u00e9montre aussi qu'ils avaient dans cette affaire, comme c'est assez souvent le cas dans ces questions, un int\u00e9r\u00eat qui les faisait agir plut\u00f4t comme partisans que comme syndics. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour pr\u00e9venir ces inconv\u00e9nients que le parag. 4 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans des affaires de cette nature les syndics ne pourront pas agir sans l'approbation des commissaires les plus proches. Sous ces circonstances, je ne puis faire autrement que d'en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que les Intim\u00e9s ont agi individuellement et non comme syndics, ni comme autoris\u00e9s par la Corporation; que d'ailleurs eussent-ils ainsi agi en vertu d'une d\u00e9cision prise r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement par eux comme Corporation, leur qualit\u00e9 de syndics n'aurait pu les prot\u00e9ger contre les cons\u00e9quences de leur action, puisque la Corporation dont ils sont membres ne pouvait pas leur communiquer un pouvoir, qu'elle n'a pas. Ce pouvoir, comme on l'a vu par le parag. 4 de la sec. 30 ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 sans l'approbation des trois Commissaires les plus proches, r\u00e9sidant en dehors de la section.\nPour ces raisons je concours dans le jugement qui va \u00eatre prononc\u00e9 par cette Cour. TASCHEREAU, J.:\nThis is an action of trespass quare clausum fregit et de bonis asportatis. The Plaintiffs declare against the Defendants for breaking and entering their close, destroying the foundation walls of a school house thereon erected belonging to them, and removing and carrying away the same from its site. There is some confusion in this case, or, at least, in some parts of it, arising from the fact that the Defendants seem to have forgotten who the Plaintiffs are. By one of their pleas, they deny that the school house in question was the property and in the possession of the Plaintiffs; but, by another plea, they allege that this school house was the property and in the possession of the Trustees of School Section No. 16, South District of Pictou. Now, who are the Plaintiffs? No one else than these Trustees in their corporate name and capacity. The Defendants, then, as distinctly as possible, have admitted the Plaintiffs' ownership and possession of this school house, and upon this fact we have consequently nothing to determine. They want us to consider as Plaintiffs certain individuals with whom they contest the position of Trustees. They say to them \"We are the Trustees, not you.\" This is an issue which cannot be determined in this cause, for the very simple reason that these individuals are not the Plaintiffs. The suit is brought by a corporation, and who are the members of that corporation we have nothing to do with here.\nThe only legal issue raised by the Defendants is, that they were the Trustees of the school when they removed this school house, and that, in doing so, they were acting as such Trustees; that, it is, in fact, the corporation itself which did the acts complained of, and that they are not personally responsible. The Defendants have, in my opinion, clearly proved that they were, at the time that the school house was removed, the Trustees of the school with one Duncan Macdonald, but they have entirely failed to prove that it was removed by the corporate body known as such Trustees, and not by them in their individual capacity. There is no evidence of any resolution authorizing this removal, no evidence even of a lawful meeting of the Trustees. One evening, about 10 o'clock, two of the Defendants went to Macdonald, their third colleague, and told him that they were going to remove the school house, asking him if he had any objections to it. Macdonald objected, but, next morning, they set to work. That is the only evidence adduced to prove that their act was the act of the corporation. Is that the way in which a corporate body can act? Can the individual members of a corporation, even though they form a majority thereof, without notice to any one, thus start and go and demolish a house, and bind the corporation by their acts? I do not think so. In a matter of contract, perhaps, a corporation aggregate, acting as such, may bind itself directly and without constituting an agent, but the only mode in which it can do a manual act is by an agent or servant[10]. It may by a vote authorize its servant or agent to do an act, and, if this act is a trespass, will bear the consequences thereof[11]. Certainly, that agent or servant may be taken amongst its members. But here, this is not the point raised. The Defendants do not pretend that they, individually, have been authorized by the corporation of the Trustees of School Section, number sixteen, South District of Pictou, to remove this school house, and that they cannot be sued by the said Trustees, because it is the said Trustees themselves who ordered this removal. But they say, \"we were ourselves the trustees, and it is as such. Trustees and as a corporate body that we did the acts complained of.\" Now, the law is that the members of a corporation aggregate cannot separately and individually give their consent in such a manner as to oblige themselves as a collective body, for in such a case, it is not the body that acts[12]. It is only at a lawful meeting of the corporate body that the corporation can act or do anything. Was it at a lawful meeting of the Trustees of School Section 16, that this school house was removed? Certainly not. If a corporate body could itself commit a trespass in the manner that the act complained of here was done, it might as well be said that it can commit an assault and battery. Yet I do not think that it can be pretended that a corporation can commit an assault otherwise than by its agent or servant[13].\nAgain, according to the Defendants' contention, if the corporation removed this house, not they, it would follow that if, whilst they were doing so, they had been arrested, the corporation, not they, would have been arrested. Yet, who ever heard of a corporation aggregate being put under arrest? A corporation is a legal person, but, as it has been said, a deaf and dumb person. I might add that it has no hands with which it can remove a house.\nUpon these principles, which rule all corporate bodies, I hold that the removal of the school house in question was the personal act of the Defendants; that, as individuals they never had the possession of it; that it is and was the property and in the possession of the Plaintiffs, and that their acts were a trespass on the Plaintiffs' property.\nIf the Defendants had pleaded and proved that they had been duly authorized by the corporation to do this act, and that, in doing it, they were the agents or servants of the corporation, I would be of opinion that the corporation, as the Plaintiffs here, would not have had the right to invoke its want of authority or power to order the act complained of. It could not say to the Defendants: \"We authorized you to remove this house, but we had no authority to do so; we ordered you to do it, but we sue you for having done it\" But, as I have said it before, that is not the issue raised.\nThe judgment complained of by the Plaintiffs is, in my opinion, erroneous, and the appeal therefore must be allowed. Rule to be discharged.\nGWYNNE, J.:\u2014\nBy sec. 28 of ch. 32 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, the Trustees of school sections are declared to be a body corporate for the prosecution and defence of all actions relating to the school, or its affairs, and other necessary purposes, under the title of \"Trustees of School Section No. \u2014\u2014 in the District of \u2014\u2014,\" and by sub-sec. 2 of sec. 30, they are empowered to take possession of, and to hold as a corporation, all the school property of the section which may be purchased for or given to it for the use or support of common or academic schools, and by sub-sec. 4 of sec. 30 they are empowered to determine the sites of school houses, subject to the sanction of the three nearest Commissioners residing out of the section, and in case these Commissioners should not agree as to the site of a school house, it was enacted that the matter should be referred to the Board of Commissioners for the District or County in which the school house is situate, whose decision should be final.\nThe above Plaintiffs, in their corporate name and character, have brought this action qu. cl. fr. against three persons, Defendants, and in their declaration complain that the Defendants broke and entered the Plaintiffs' close (describing it) known as the school house lot of Section No. 16, South District of Pictou County, and tore down and destroyed the foundation walls of the school house of the said section thereon erected, and removed, tore down and carried away the buildings, wood and logs of the Plaintiffs, and converted the same to their own use, and also that the Defendants removed and carried away the school house of the said section from its lawful site, and converted the same to their own use, and also broke and entered the close of the Plaintiffs (above described), and dug and cut up the soil thereof, and tore down the walls and building, and removed and injured the houses and buildings thereon, whereby the Plaintiffs were deprived of the use of the same, and were prevented from keeping a school therein, and the members of the said school were deprived of the advantage of having a school kept in the said section by reason of the said wrongful acts of the Defendants, and their children were thereby deprived of schooling for a long time.\nIt cannot be doubted that, if the Defendants, or any of them, committed, or caused to be committed, all or any of the acts complained of, without legal justification, they would be liable to the Plaintiffs in this action, suing as they do in their corporate capacity; and it would be quite immaterial who may have been, or be, the particular individuals comprising the corporation, who are the Plaintiffs, except in so far as the Defendants' plea of justification should occasion any enquiry upon that point. Now, to this declaration the Defendants have pleaded eight pleas, which may be reduced to three, namely: 1st. That the Defendants did not do any of the acts complained of; 2nd. That the close, soil, school house, foundation walls and buildings were not, nor was any of them the Plaintiffs' property, as alleged; and 3rd. (which is the Defendants plea of justification set out on the 7th plea), that at the time of the alleged trespass, and until and at the time of action brought, the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron, and Duncan Macdonald, were the Trustees of said School Section No. 16, duly elected and appointed under the Statute in that behalf, and the said land was the freehold of the said James Cameron, John A. Cameron and Duncan Macdonald, as such Trustees, and the said school house and walls, buildings, wood and logs were the property of the said James Cameron, John A. Cameron and Duncan Macdonald, as such Trustees, under the Statute in that behalf, and because it was deemed, desirable to change the site of the said school house, and to purchase and accept another site for the said school house, and the said James Cameron, John A. Cameron and Duncan Macdonald, deeming it advisable as aforesaid, and having purchased and accepted another site for said school house, and having lawful and proper authority in that behalf, proceeded to change the site of the said school house, and thereupon the said James Cameron and John A. Cameron, as such Trustees as aforesaid, in their own right, and the Defendant, Nathan Cameron, as their servant, and by their command, entered upon the said close, and, with teams necessary for that purpose, moved the said school house from the place it then occupied towards the site purchased and accepted as aforesaid, doing no more than was necessary for that purpose, and because the said school house was set fire to and burned by some person or persons unknown, accidentally or unlawfully, but without the knowledge of the Defendants, it was not removed to the said site so purchased and accepted as aforesaid, but the Defendants were thereby prevented from so doing, which are the alleged trespasses.\nThe 8th plea it is unnecessary to set out, for the issue thereby sought to be raised is wholly immaterial to the matters really in issue in this action. The Defendants by that plea, treating the Plaintiffs, who are a corporation suing in their corporate name, as if they were individual persons, deny that such individuals, there being none named as Plaintiffs upon the Record, were ever duly appointed Trustees of the school section, or were such trustees at the time of the alleged trespasses, but that the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron and one Duncan Macdonald were a body corporate for the purposes mentioned in the Statute, and entitled to sue under the title of Trustees of School Section No. 16, &c., &c., and that the said land was the freehold of them, the said James Cameron, John A. Cameron and Duncan Macdonald, as such Trustees.\nThis plea, as it appears to me, is framed upon a total misconception of the operation of the Statute and of the position, rights, and responsibilities of the particular individuals, who, for the time being, may fill the character of Trustees of the school section. By the Statute the school property is plainly vested, not in the persons who, for the time being, may be Trustees, as pleaded in this plea, but in the corporation. It is wholly erroneous to describe the property and to plead it as being the soil and freehold of the respective individuals for the time being filling the office of Trustees. Those persons have no estate whatever in the school property; it is vested in the corporation, whose agents the persons are. Now, that the agents of a corporation may commit a tort upon the corporate property, for which an action will lie at the suit of the corporation, there can be no doubt; a corporation known as the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of a city may sue persons filling respectively the offices of mayor and aldermen of the city for trespass, wrong and injury done to, or for the conversion of, the corporate property. Doubtless, these agents, having, for the time being, control of the corporation, may prevent an action being brought in the corporate name against themselves, but, that action being brought and the Defendants having pleaded to issue, all that we have to do is to determine the issues raised upon the Record before us in bar of the action, which issues must be determined irrespective of any question as to who may or may not have been competent to give instructions for the use of the corporate name for the maintenance of the action.\nNow the issues joined, in substance, are, as I have said: 1st. Upon the question whether or not the Defendants, or any of them, did any of the acts complained of? As to the allegation in the declaration \"that the Defendants removed and carried away the said school house from its lawful site, and converted the same to their own use,\" that might have been treated by the Defendants, and would have been treated, as matter of aggravation only, in view of the other matters charged, if the Defendants had not themselves, by their third plea, treated that charge as an independent substantive cause of action[14]. It is unnecessary to enquire whether the contention of the Defendants upon this issue is or not correct, namely, that in this connection the word \"site\" must be construed to mean the whole lot upon a part of which the school house was erected, and not merely that part of the lot within the four walls, which were of stone, built into the ground, and which constituted the foundation of the school house, for the other acts charged, if proved and not justified, are abundantly sufficient to support the verdict rendered in favor of the Plaintiffs. Now, upon the evidence, it is clear, beyond all question, that the Defendants took the school house down from its foundation and removed it for more than the length of itself from off that foundation, and that, in so doing, they broke and tore down the stone walls constituting such foundation, and that the windows were twisted out of place, and that the weather-board and some of the shingles upon the roof of the school house were damaged, and that the building was left in a condition unfit for occupation there as a school house. That these acts constitute an actionable wrong for which damages may be recovered in this action, unless they can be justified, admits of no question.\nThen, 2nd, the Defendants have pleaded in bar that the close, soil, school house, walls and buildings were not nor was any of them the property of the Plaintiffs. This plea seems to have been pleaded upon the misconception that some individuals behind the corporation putting it in motion were Plaintiffs, and not the corporation itself, for the Statute clearly vests the school property in the corporation, and that is, in effect, what the declaration alleges and the plea denies. This plea, therefore, must be found in favor of the Plaintiffs. The only question which remains is: Have the Defendants, by their 7th plea, established a justification? Now, the land is not the freehold of James Cameron, John A. Cameron and Duncan Macdonald, as in this plea pleaded, even though they may have then been the persons filling the office of Trustees, the freehold is in the corporation\u2014Plaintiffs. Moreover, assuming the last named individuals to have been the persons filling the office of Trustees, it appears by the evidence that it is not true, as alleged in the plea, that they had purchased another site for the school house, or that they had lawful power and authority to proceed to change the site of the school house, as they admit by their plea that they did proceed to change it; the plea, in short, confesses the commission of all the trespasses charged in the declaration, professing to avoid them as lawful acts done by them in the discharge of the powers attached to their office; but it is clear that they had no such justification as that set up, for the 4th sub-sec. of sec. 30 of the Act required the sanction of three of the nearest commissioners residing out of the section, or if they did not agree, then the sanction of the Board of Commissioners, whose decision should be final, before the acts which Defendants admit they committed could lawfully be done, and we find by the evidence that the Defendants James Cameron and John A. Cameron, knowing that the necessary authority had before been refused, despairing of obtaining it, did not again apply for it, but wrongfully, upon their own sole motion, did the acts complained of. It would be singular, as it appears to me, if upon a record raising these issues, all of which must be admitted to have been clearly established in favor of the corporation, a court of law should be disposed so far to countenance injustice as to render any assistance to the Defendants in their endeavor to defeat the corporation from recovering in this action for the wrong and injury done to their property, upon a suggestion that two of the Defendants and another person were, in truth, the only persons competent to set the corporation in motion by an action brought in its name.\nThe result is that the verdict recovered by the Plaintiffs must be allowed to stand, and that the appeal, which is against a rule which set it aside and granted a new trial, should be allowed with costs, and that the rule itself in the court below, granting the new trial, must be ordered to be discharged with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellants: S.

The Attorney General thereupon filed an information for penalties against S. On demurrer to the information the special matter for argument was that the Legislature of the Province of Ontario had no power to pass the statute under which the penalties were sought to be recovered, or to require brewers to take out any license whatever for selling fermented or malt liquors by wholesale, as stated in the information.\nHeld,\u2014On appeal, that the Act of the Provincial Legislature of Ontario, 37 Vic. ch. 32, is not within the legislative capacity of that Legislature.\n2. That the power to tax and regulate the trade of a brewer, being a restraint, and regulation of trade and commerce, falls within the class of subjects reserved by the 91st sec. of the British North America Act for the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada; and that the license imposed was a restraint and regulation of trade and commerce and not the exercise of a police power.\n3. That the right conferred on the Ontario Legislature by sub-sec. 9, sec. 92 of the said Act, to deal exclusively with shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and \"other licenses,\" does not extend to licenses on brewers or \"other licenses\" which are not of a local or municipal character.\nRegina vs. Taylor, 36 U. C. Q. B. 218, over-ruled.\n[Ritchie and Strong, JJ., dissenting.]\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Ontario, over-ruling the demurrer of the defendant, John Severn, to the criminal information filed against him by the Attorney General of the said Province on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, in the said Court, on the 23rd day of January 1877.\nThis appeal was brought directly to the Supreme Court, by consent of parties, under sec. 27 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act.\nThe information was for the contravention by the defendant of the provisions of the Act of the Legislature of Ontario, 37 Vict. ch. 32, respecting the sale of fermented or spirituous liquors, in that the defendant \"on the nineteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord aforesaid, at the Town of Yorkville, in the County of York aforesaid, after the passage of a certain Act of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, made and passed in the thirty-seventh year of the reign of our Sovereign Lady the present Queen, intituled 'An Act to amend and consolidate the law for the sale of fermented and spirituous liquors,' then being a brewer licensed by the Government of Canada for the manufacture of fermented, spirituous and other liquors, did manufacture a large quantity of fermented liquors, to wit., one thousand gallons of beer, and afterwards, to wit, on the twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven, at the Town of Yorkville aforesaid, in the County of York aforesaid, unlawfully and wilfully and in contravention of the said Act of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, did sell by wholesale a large quantity of the said fermented liquor so manufactured by the said John Severn as aforesaid, to wit., five hundred gallons of beer, for consumption within the Province of Ontario, to wit., at the Town of Yorkville aforesaid, in the County of York aforesaid, without first obtaining a license, as required by the said Act of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, to sell by wholesale, under the said Act, liquors so manufactured by him the said John Severn as aforesaid, for consumption within the said Province of Ontario, and without having obtained any shop license or any other license under the said Act, or under the Act passed by the said Legislature of Ontario, in the thirty-ninth year of the reign of our Sovereign Lady the present Queen, intituled 'An Act to amend the law respecting the sale of fermented or spirituous liquors,' to sell wholesale, as a brewer, liquor, in wilful contravention of the said Act of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, passed and made as aforesaid, and in contempt of our Sovereign Lady the Queen and her laws, and to the evil example of all others in the like case offending, and contrary to the form of the Statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and dignity.\"\nOn the 25th January. 1877, the said John Severn by his attorney F. Osier, having heard the information read, said: that the information and the matters therein contained are not sufficient in law, and that the defendant is not bound to answer the same.\nOne of the points to be argued was that the Legislature of the Province of Ontario had no power to pass the Statute under which the said penalties were sought to be recovered, or to require brewers to take out any license whatever for selling fermented or malt liquors by wholesale, as stated in the information.\nThe Attorney General joined in demurrer.\nIn a case of a similar information, The Queen v. James Taylor[1], the Court of Queen's Bench gave judgment for the defendant on the demurrer to the information. The Court of Error and Appeal for the Province of Ontario reversed the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench and overruled the demurrer of James Taylor.\nAn appeal was subsequently prosecuted by the said James Taylor to the Supreme Court of Canada, when, after argument, the Supreme Court decided[2] that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the said appeal, inasmuch as the judgment appealed against was prior to the organization of such Court:\nIn consequence of this decision, Harrison, C. J., delivered the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench as follows:\n\"We have read the decision of the Court of Appeal in Regina v. Taylor, 36 U. C. Q. B. 218, reversing the decision of this Court, reported at p. 183 of the same volume.\n\"If the Court of Appeal were a Court of final resort, we should, in the present case, follow the decision of the Court of Appeal without observation of any kind. But as the Court of Appeal is not a Court of final resort, and as we are informed that it is the intention of the defendant in this case, with the consent of the Crown under section twenty-seven of the Supreme Court Act, at once to carry this case to the Supreme Court; and so, if possible, have Regina v. Taylor, 36 U. O. Q. B. 218, reversed; we, in deference to the existing decisions of the Court of Appeal, and not from any actual conviction that it is correct, follow it, and give judgment for the Queen.\"\nThe Act in dispute under this appeal is the 37 Vic., chap 32, of the Ontario Legislature.\nThe clauses considered were the following:\n\"Section 24. No person shall sell by wholesale or retail, any spirituous, fermented or other manufactured liquors within the Province of Ontario, without having first obtained a license under this Act, authorizing him so to do. Provided that this section shall not apply to sales under legal process, or for distress, or sales by assignees in insolvency.\"\n\"25. No person shall keep or have in any house, building, shop, eating-house, saloon or house of public entertainment, or in any room or place whatsoever, any spirituous, fermented, or other manufactured liquors, for the purpose of selling, bartering or trading therein, unless duly licensed thereto, under the provisions of this Act.\"\nThe two preceding sections, by sect. 26, not to prevent a brewer or distiller duly licensed by the Dominion of Canada from keeping, having, or selling any liquor manufactured by him. Provided that such brewer, distiller, &c., is further required to first obtain a license to sell by wholesale under that Act the liquor so manufactured by him when sold for consumption within this Province, but not in quantities less than prescribed by section 4 of the Act.\nSection 22 enacts: \"There shall be paid * * * for each license by wholesale a duty of fifty dollars.\" All the duties under this section are for the purposes of Provincial revenue.\nSection 4. \"A license by wholesale\" shall be construed to mean a license for selling, bartering or trafficking, by wholesale only, in such liquors in warehouses, stores, shops, or places other than inns, wine, ale or beer houses, or other houses of public entertainment, in quantities not less than five gallons in each cask or vessel, at any one time; and in case where such selling by wholesale is in respect of bottled ale, porter, beer, wine or other fermented or spirituous liquor, \"each such sale shall be in quantities not less than one dozen bottles of at least three half pints each, or two dozen bottles of at least three-fourths of one pint each, at any one time.\"\nMr. J. Bethune, Q.C., for Appellant:\u2014\nThe Statute in question, 37 Vic., ch. 32, O., was passed to consolidate the license laws of the Province, but it not only consolidates but amends these laws.\nIn the consolidated Act there is no special amendment so far as brewers are concerned. Section 4 defines license by \"wholesale.\" The effect of which seems to compel brewers to take out a license at an expense of $50 before selling by wholesale. Now, the Dominion Government derives its income from customs and excise, which are regulated by 31 Vic., ch. 8 D. By the 2nd section of that Act the word \"brewer\" is defined, and by the 3rd it is stated that no other person than a licensed brewer can carry on business or trade, &c. The Dominion Government thereby assumed jurisdiction of this matter. The point of importance is, what are the relative rights and relative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and Provincial Legislatures over this subject-matter?\nThe only authority under which the Provincial Legislature claims the power of making laws in relation to matters relating to trade and commerce is under sec 92, sub-sec. 9, of B. N. A. Act. But the whole of that section must be governed by sec. 91, and under sub-sec. 2, sect. 91, the regulation of trade and commerce belongs exclusively to the Dominion Parliament. The fair construction of the words trade and commerce includes both internal and external trade.\nThe Dominion Government derives its income from customs and excise, which are regulated by 31 Vict., ch. 8, D. Under sec. 91, sub-secs. 2 and 3, the Dominion Parliament has the power to pass laws for \"the regulation of trade and commerce \"and\" the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation.\"\nNow, the right of the Ontario Legislature to pass and maintain the provisions of this Act must rest either upon its power to impose direct taxation within the Province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, or upon its power to legislate upon matters relating to licenses and municipal institutions. It cannot be denied that the whole British North America Act shews that it was intended to divide the jurisdiction between the two Legislative bodies, the jurisdiction of each being complete as to cases within its power. See upon this point the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Lower Canada in Ex parte Dansereau[3]; Dow v. Black[4]; L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle[5].\nThen, can this Act be sustained under sec. 92, sub-sec. 2 of the B. N. A. Act; in other words, is this charge or duty imposed upon brewers a direct or indirect tax? Appellant contends that it is an indirect tax, the effect of which is to raise the price and value of the beer by at least the amount of the tax. Imposing a tax upon the steamboat instead of the passengers which it carries, is an indirect tax: Gibbons v. Ogden[6]. The Imperial Parliament treat this as an indirect tax, because they would not have given the power by subsection 9 if it was direct. The judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal in Queen v. Taylor agree as to this. But it is contended that the Ontario Legislature possess the right of imposing this tax under sub-sec. 9 of sec. 92 of the B. N. A. Act Now, this sub-section must be looked upon as giving an exceptional right, limited in its character, to impose indirect taxation. You must either restrict this power of granting \"other licenses\" or give the Local Legislature a jurisdiction as complete and as full as that of the Dominion Legislature. Now, the trade of a brewer is one regulated exclusively by the laws of the Dominion of Canada, and the history of trade and distilling shows that brewing was always regarded as coming under the Excise Laws.\nReg. v. Justices of Surrey[7]; Burns's Justice of the Peace[8]; Con. Stats. of Canada, cap. 19; Con. Stats. of Lower Canada, cap. 6, sec. 1; cap. 24, sec. 26, sub-sec. 10; 27 and 28 Vic. cap. 3; 29 Vic. cap. 3; Revised Stats. of Nova Scotia, cap. 17 and 19; Revised Stats. of New Brunswick, vol. 1, cap. 18; Crabbe's History of English Law[9]; Temperance Act of 1864, of the Province of Canada; Quebec Resolutions, which constituted the foundation of the Imperial Act; Journals Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada[10]; Journals of same Assembly[11]; 29th Resolution sub-sect. 4; Lord Carnarvon's explanation, on the second reading of the Bill in the House of Lords, shows that these resolutions were the basis of the Statute[12].\nThe jurisdiction as to excise was intended to be in the Dominion Parliament, and would therefore be exclusive. One method of regulating excise is by taxation: Story on the Constitution[13]. The only head of concurrent jurisdiction is under section 95, and even then Provincial Legislatures must yield to Dominion when they conflict.\nEither the words \"other licenses\" must be construed to be of the same class as those mentioned in the preceding part of the sub-section: East London Water Works v. Mile End Old Town[14]; Reed v. Ingham[15]; Williams v. Golding[16]; this is also the view taken by Torrance, J., in the case of Angers v. The Queen Insurance Co., decided at Montreal, in April 1877[17];\u2014or must be held to mean such licenses as were before the passing of the Imperial Act under municipal or local control: Maxwell on Statutes[18].\nIf the term \"other licenses\" be not thus limited, the Legislature may require anything to be licensed, for instance, may require a license to be taken out by a captain of a vessel, or by a banker, or official assignee.\nThere are a large class of local licenses of minor importance than those enumerated in this sub-section, such as those enumerated in the Municipal Act of 1866.\nAs to the argument put forward on behalf of the Crown, in support of the judgment in this case, that the Act is not ultra vires; because it has reference to a subject-matter over which its powers are as full and complete as those of the Dominion Parliament as a matter of police, Appellant contends that power is a grant from the Dominion Government, a branch of criminal law over which the Dominion has entire control.\nWhat is known in the United States as police power in the States is founded upon the right which exists on the part of the State Legislatures to make laws for the good government of the State in all cases in which jurisdiction is not given to the Congress.\nThe jurisdiction to enact Criminal Laws, except for offences committed on the high seas and offences committed against the United States Government, exists on the part of the State Legislatures. The basis of the right to make laws of police is Criminal Law. License Cases[19].\nThe cases decided by the United States Courts as to laws on the nature of police do not apply with equal force to Canada, because the Provincial Legislatures have jurisdiction only in such matters as are expressly mentioned in section 92.\nThis is plain from section 91.\nThe Quebec resolutions numbered 29, 43 and 45 shew that this was what was intended.\nAs to the power of disallowance, that power belongs to only one branch of the Dominion Parliament and can be exercised in different ways. In the United States it is held that the moment Congress exercises its power over a subject-matter the State has no control, provided that Congress was first to exercise it.\nIt is further contended on the part of the respondent, that the power to sell in Ontario must come from the Ontario Government and that under the Act it can be called a shop license.\nThe answer to this will be found in Brown v. State of Maryland[20]. It is as much a part of the trade of the brewer to sell as to manufacture. It would be mockery to say: I will give you the right to manufacture, but the Provincial Legislature says you must get a shop license before you can sell. See also Kent's Commentaries[21].\nIf this sub-section 9 of section 92 gives power to require a license to be taken out by a brewer, the Legislature has power also to require the license to be obtained from the municipality or from the Provincial Government, or from both. This would very much embarrass this branch of trade, and might so fetter it as to destroy it.\nMr. Mowat, Q. C., Attorney General for Ontario, (Mr. Crooks, Q.C., with him) for the Respondent:\nI claim for the Provinces the largest power which they can be given: it is the spirit of the B. N. A. Act, and it is the spirit under which Confederation was agreed to. If there was one point which all parties agreed upon, it was that all local powers should be left to the Provinces and that all powers previously possessed by the Local Legislatures should be continued unless expressly repealed by the B. N. A. Act. The larger powers given to the Dominion were for the purposes of nationality, so that in construing the B. N. A. Act, the intention was not to take from Provincial authorities anymore than what was necessary. Take, for instance, the Administration of Justice; nothing in the Act says to whom belong the executive powers of the Administration of Justice, yet from the very beginning it was assumed that the local authorities have the same powers as before Confederation. We find that express power was given by ch. 128, 14 and 15 Vict., to the City of Montreal to tax brewers. The same power may surely be trusted to a Provincial Government. Another point of great importance is the provision in the Act (sect. 90) by which legislation of the Local Legislatures can be vetoed. The relations of the Provinces here is different from that which the States bear to the United States. There Courts alone have power to declare when the States have usurped the higher powers of Congress, whilst here ample power is given to the Dominion Parliament of protecting itself.\nThis Act has now been in operation for several years. It has been contended that it is only one branch of the Parliament that has the right of disallowing the Provincial Acts. I think it will be admitted by all parties here that the Governor General must take the advice of his council when vetoing local Acts.\nThis power of disallowance should be taken into consideration when the policy of the Act is urged against us.\nThe regulation of the sale of all liquor for consumption in the Province, whether manufactured in the Province or not, is of Provincial concern, and the immunity of the person manufacturing in the Province, as part of the Dominion, under the excise regulation of the Inland Revenue Department, no more makes him free of provincial regulations than the person importing liquor under the Customs regulations of another Department.\nSection 92 of the B. N. A. Act, 1867, confers upon the Legislature of each Province the jurisdiction of making laws so as to exclude the authority of the Parliament of Canada in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects enumerated in that section, and where the Legislature possesses jurisdiction the Court has no power to review the exercise of it.\nWhere there is jurisdiction the will of the Legislature is omnipotent according to British theory, and knows no superior law in the sense in which the American Courts are accustomed to adjudicate upon constitutional questions. See Blackstone[22]; Sedgwick Statutory and Constitutional Law[23]; De Tocqueville's Democracy in America, Cap. 6; Broom's Constitutional Law[24]; Pomeroy's Constitutional Law[25]; Story on the Constitution of the U. S.[26]; Cooley's Constitutional Limitations[27]; and cases commented on in these authorities.\nThe requirement of the license is neither obnoxious as being an indirect mode of taxation, nor as being repugnant to the jurisdiction of the Dominion in the regulation of trade and commerce.\nThe tax here is direct upon the person, and not upon the commodity, with the view of enhancing the selling price thereof to the extent of the tax imposed.\nSee as to nature of tax, Fawcett's Political Economy[28]; Baxter on Taxation[29]; Bowen's Political Economy (Mass.)[30].\nThe taxing power is also commensurate with, and essential to, the existence of the Government, and this mode of its exercise is not excluded from Provincial jurisdiction.\nSee Marshall, C. J., in Providence Bank and Billings,[31]; McCulloch and State of Maryland[32]; In re Slavin and The Corporation of Orillia[33]; Marshall, C. J., in Gibbons v. Ogden[34]; Story on the Constitution of the U. S.[35].\nNow, amongst the matters in which the Provincial Legislature has this exclusive jurisdiction under class 9 are included \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licenses in order to the raising of revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes.\" (a). The term \"shop\" may as well cover the license to a brewer when selling for consumption in Ontario as any other seller by wholesale or retail. The brewer, quoad hoc, is in the like position. The same policy, whether of police or revenue, would also equally apply.\n(b). The term \"licenses\" is most general, and would include as a subject-matter not only all dealers in any commodity, but trades, professions and occupations.\nSee Baxter on Taxation[36].\n(c). The Rule of ejusdem generis is inapplicable here\u2014first, in there being no controlling or particular classes to refer to in order to determine the like classes, to which the word \"other\" might be referred with any definiteness; and, secondly, because the latter words enlarge \"other Licenses\" into all such as the Legislative authority may consider necessary to the raising of a Provincial revenue.\nThe learned Counsel referred to the cases cited in the judgment of Draper, C. J., in the Court of Appeal, in the Queen v. Taylor[37]; in addition to which he cited: Fleury v. Moore et al.[38]; Regina v. Boardman[39]; Canada Central Railway v. Regina[40]; Regina v. Longee[41]; Sanson v. Bell[42]; Oswald v. Berwick-on-Tweed[43]; Reed v. Ingham[44]; Martin v. Hemming[45]; In re Mew[46]; License Case[47]; Ward v. Maryland[48]; The License Taxes Cases[49]; Cooley v. Board of Wardens[50]; Board of Excise v. Barrie[51]; Bode v. Maryland[52]; Nathan v. Louisiana[53]; Commonwealth v. Hoothooke[54]; Illinois v. Thurber[55]; Brown v. State of Maryland[56].\nSupposing, now, this Act is viewed as an Imperial Act the word \"other\" must be accepted in its broadest sense; 2 Burns's Justice of the Peace,[57]; Baxter on Taxation[58]; Peto on Taxation[59]; Broom's Maxims[60].\nThe practice of the United States also may be referred to. How was this word accepted there. See Hilliard on Taxation[61]; Strong on Constitutional Law, 1,053; Rev. Stats. U. S.[62].\nThe Provincial jurisdiction over licenses is not confined to shops and places where the sale is by retail, and the true construction to be given to sub-section 9 of sec. 92, is that the words \"and other licenses\" include the superior as well as the inferior grade of licenses.\nMr. Crooks, Q. C., followed on the part of the Respondent: \u2014\nBy the British North America Act we are given a constitution similar to the English constitution. In each Province a plenum imperium was constituted and not a subordinate authority, or one with only such powers as were specifically conferred. Once jurisdiction is given over a subject matter, the power is absolute. The case of L'Union St. Jacques de Montreal v. Belisle[63], seems to support this view.\nThe only question before the Court is whether the enacting body acted ultra vires.\nBy the British North America Act two sovereign bodies were created, viz: the Dominion Parliament, and the Local Legislatures. There is no question of the one being subordinate to the other. The Act has to be construed as an Imperial Act and the jurisdiction given to the Local Legislatures must be absolute and complete. Assuming this, Respondent contends that this Statute was enacted by the Ontario Legislature in the exercise of that sovereignty.\nThe Provincial Legislature possesses inherent constitutional power to enact all such laws as it thinks best for the welfare of the people of the Province, and to secure this end to prohibit the sale, traffic, or disposal of spirituous liquor or other commodities which the Legislature may deem injurious. With respect to such matters its powers are as full and complete as those of the Dominion and Imperial Parliaments in relation to matters Canadian and Imperial respectively.\nThe principle of the maxim salus populi suprema lex is strictly applicable, and sustains the Provincial jurisdiction.\nSee Lieber's Legal Hermeneutics[64]; Sedgwick on Stat, and Constit. Law[65].\nLord Selborne, in the case of L'Union St. Jacques v. Belisle[66], puts it thus:\u2014\n\"The scheme of the 91st and 92nd sections is this: By the 91st some matters\u2014and their Lordships may do well to assume, for the argument's sake, that they are all matters except those afterwards dealt with by the 92nd section; their Lordships do not decide it, but for the argument's sake they will assume it\u2014certain matters, being upon that assumption all those which are not mentioned in the 92nd section, are reserved for the exclusive legislation of the Parliament of Canada, called the Dominion; but, beyond controversy, there are certain other matters, not only not reserved for the Dominion Parliament, but assigned to the exclusive power and competency of the Provincial Legislature in each Province,\u2014among those the last is thus expressed: 'Generally all matters of a mere local or private nature in the Province.'\"\nThe aim of the Statute here was not to interfere with the general jurisdiction of the Dominion Government.\nIt is not an absolute prohibition for sale generally, but only a charge when sold for consumption within the Province of Ontario. It is only when the brewer ceases to be a manufacturer and becomes a trader. If the contention of the Appellant was correct, the consequence would be that the brewer could not sell by retail. See Cooley at p. 581, see also Pomeroy's Const. Law, 285 to 297, 332.\nThe expression \"license\" has not a limited application in our Statutes, and wholesale traders have been obliged to take out licenses for municipal revenue[67].\nThe argument of the Appellant to be consistent would have to exclude pedlers and hawkers:\u2014see In re Duncan[68].\nThis case came under the Dunkin Act, which is still in force. If municipalities have this power surely the Provincial Parliament cannot be denied it. Licenses of any description cannot be limited by any power held by the Dominion Government. There may be here, as in the United States, two powers that may tax the same subject. See also Broom's Maxims[69], Maxwell on Statutes[70]. Mr. Bethune, Q.C., in reply:\u2014\nAt the time of Confederation all wholesale licenses had been abolished. As to the power of disallowance by sec. 56, it has principally reference to the disallowance of valid laws for political reasons.\nThe Dunkin Act never touched the wholesale trade of brewers, but only prevents them from selling by the glass, and this Act could not be repealed by the Local Government.\nThe tax is imposed upon the brewer in Ontario, and is therefore a tax upon the sale of his goods and merchandise in Ontario, which can affect the trade of the other Provinces.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\nIn deciding important questions arising under the Act passed by the Imperial Parliament for federally uniting the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and forming the Dominion of Canada, we must consider the circumstances under which that Statute was passed, the condition of the different Provinces themselves, their relation to one another, to the Mother Country, and the state of things existing in the great country adjoining Canada, as well as the systems of government which prevailed in these Provinces and countries. The framers of the Statute knew the difficulties which had arisen in the great Federal Republic, and no doubt wished to avoid them in the new government which it was intended to create under that Statute. They knew that the question of State rights as opposed to the authority of the General Goverment under their constitution was frequently raised, aggravating, if not causing, the difficulties arising out of their system of government, and they evidently wished to avoid these evils, under the new state of things about to be created here by the Confederation of the Provinces.\nIn distributing the Legislative powers, the British North America Act declares the Parliament of Canada shall, or, as the 91st section reads,\nIt shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and. House of Commons, to make laws, for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nAnd then, for greater certainty, that section defines certain subjects to which the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament extends. Amongst other things are mentioned:\n2. The regulation of trade and commerce.\n3. The raising of money by any mode or system of taxation.\nCertain other subjects of a general and quasi-national character are then referred to and mentioned, as coming within the powers of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe causing a Brewer to take out a license and pay a certain sum of money therefor, as required by the Ontario Statutes, is a means of raising money, and it, of course, is a tax? And there can be no doubt it is an indirect tax; and it is equally beyond a doubt that it is a means which may be resorted to by the Dominion Parliament for the raising of money. When, then, it is mentioned in the Statute under consideration that the Dominion Parliament may raise money under any mode or system of taxation, and when, in the same Act, the taxing power of the Provincial Legislature is confined to direct taxation within the Province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, it seems to me beyond all doubt (except so far as the same may be qualified by No. 9 of section 92) that it was introduced not to allow the Provincial Legislature the right to impose indirect taxes for provincial or local purposes. The fact, that in most European Countries, as well as in the United States and in the North American Provinces, by far the larger portion of the ordinary revenue was raised by indirect taxes, seems to indicate that the framers of the British North America Act considered this so important a power that it was not intended to intrust it to the Local Legislatures. The power of taxation, being so essential to the maintenance of a Government, must necessarily be viewed as of the greatest importance to every Government, and it is mentioned as No. 3 of the powers of the Dominion Parliament, and No. 2 of the Provincial Legislatures.\nLooking, then, at these provisions as they stand thus far, it would be reasonable to hold, in the absence of any other provision, that the framers of the Statute did not intend that the Provincial Legislatures should have any but the power of direct taxation for raising a revenue for provincial purposes.\nIt is not necessary to say much as to the effect of raising money by direct and indirect taxation. When each inhabitant is compelled to pay a sum of money to a tax-gatherer he knows and understands what he pays, and will no doubt look sharply after the expenditure of money so extorted from him. But when the tax is indirectly imposed, and the payer recoups himself by an extra charge for the commodity he deals in, the purchaser may buy the article or not as he pleases: the money he pays is more like a voluntary payment for what may, perhaps, be considered a luxury, and when paid he does not look so sharply into the matter as he does in the payment of a direct tax. It is therefore obvious, that the Provincial Legislatures would be much more likely to exercise prudence in the character of the expenditure of money if they are compelled to raise it by direct taxation. Besides this, the taxation for purely local purposes before Confederation was mostly direct, whilst that for the general purposes of the Provincial Government was indirect, and generally from customs and excise. In most of the Provinces, a large portion of the indirect taxes, which might be considered as arising in the particular localities and were collected through the medium of licenses, was applied to local and not general or provincial purposes. We must assume this was known to the framers of the British North America Act, and that, whilst they were in effect prohibiting the Local Legislatures from levying indirect taxes, they did not wish to deprive these Provinces or localities of the revenue which the local or municipal authorities had been for many years receiving and applying to purely local purposes. In that view, then, when framing sec. 92 of the Statute, and by No. 8 providing for making laws for \"municipal institutions in the Provinces,\" attention would be naturally drawn to the powers conferred on those bodies in the several Provinces, and the means which they had of raising money, and they would find, that in most, if not all, of the Provinces, the amount to be paid for tavern licenses was fixed by the local or municipal authorities, and the larger portion of the money arising from that tax was applied to the municipal or local purposes in contra-distinction to provincial or general purposes. If that system was to be continued it would be necessary to make special provision therefor, inasmuch as the tax by license was an indirect mode of taxation, and the Dominion Parliament was intended alone to possess it. Giving power to the Local Legislature to legislate as to \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes,\" was certainly one mode of doing this. Suppose the word \"provincial\" had not been there, would not the fair meaning be that it was intended to be confined to licenses which were of a local character, and when it appears that part of the revenue derived from the tavern and shop licenses, as in Canada, had gone into the provincial chest, an obvious reason existed for adding provincial to the local or municipal purposes. In the Province where the most complete system of municipal institutions existed (and which is now the Province of Ontario), the shop and tavern licenses were issued on the certificates granted under the authority of by-laws passed by the municipalities, or in cities by the Police Commissioners, and the monies received therefor, except the amount payable to the Provincial Government by way of duty, belonged to the corporation of the municipality in which they were issued. The revenue from auctioneers licenses was applicable to local objects. There were issued under municipal authority a great number of other licenses, including auctioneer, which were specially named and referred to in the Municipal Institutions Act applicable to Upper Canada then in force, to name which minutely would have been pursuing a course not desirable or convenient to adopt in an Act of Parliament of the character of the one under consideration, but very proper in a Statute establishing municipal institutions and defining their powers.\nMr. Justice Wilson, in his very elaborate judgment in the Queen v. Taylor[71], refers to the class of licenses which seem to have\na proper connection with and affinity to those licenses which are commonly mentioned and found along with shop, saloon, tavern and auctioneer licenses,\nand then mentions licenses on billiard tables, victualling houses, ordinaries, houses where fruit, &c., are sold, hawkers, pedlers, transient traders, livery stables, intelligence offices, &c. In some of the Provinces a portion of the monies from shop, saloon and tavern licenses (and perhaps also auctioneers licenses) formed part of the Provincial revenue. The mentioning of these by name shews that the power to legislate as to them was intended to be given to the Local Legislatures, and thus to interfere with what would otherwise have been the exclusive right of the Dominion Parliament to legislate on the subject. These were matters in which the municipalities were peculiarly interested, and as to which the local authorities would be much more likely to work out the law in a satisfactory manner. In fact, as to the \"other licenses\" the Dominion Parliament would be meddling with parish business if they undertook to legislate about them. We can, therefore, see very good reasons why these licenses as to local and municipal matters should be under the control of the Local Legislatures, and equally good reasons why, as regards licenses for such matters as would be likely to affect trade and commerce and the revenue derivable from the excise and customs, these latter affecting great and paramount interests, no express power was given to the Local Legislatures.\nIt seems to me, in naming \"shop, saloon and auctioneer\" licenses the intention was to shew that, as these licenses might possibly be considered applying to objects from which the Dominion revenue was likely to be derived, though really matters of local concernment, it would be better to name them and leave the other unimportant licenses to be covered by the words \"and other licenses.\"\nIf it had been intended to allow the Local Legislatures to tax manufactures, and particularly the manufactures of malt and alcoholic liquors, from which so large a part of the public revenues had been, and was likely to be, raised, it would have been mentioned, and mentioned in other terms than \"and other licenses.\" The Province of Canada, before Confederation, being the largest territorially, having a greater population and raising a larger revenue than either of the other Provinces, and being formed by the union of two Provinces having different laws and to some extent different interests, would naturally attract attention as the portion of the country where some of the objects of Confederation had been practically worked out. The legislation which had prevailed there would naturally be referred to, and would probably have its effect in moulding the measure which was to effect the destinies of so important a member of the new Confederacy, and which was to be worked out there in common with the other Provinces. I think we may, without violating any of the rules for construing Statutes, look to the legislation which prevailed in any or all of the Provinces, in order to enable us to be put in the position of those who framed the Laws and give assistance in interpreting the words used and the object to which they were directed.\nNow, in considering the meaning to be attached to the words \"shop licenses\"\u2014(I am not aware that they were used as applicable to licenses in any other of the Provinces)\u2014we find in referring to the Municipal Institutions Act of Upper Canada then in force, 29 and 30 Vic., cap. 51, \"shop licenses\" are said to be licenses for the retail of spirituous, fermented or other manufactured liquors in quantities not less than one quart in shops, stores or places other than inns, ale houses or places of public entertainment. \"Tavern licenses\" is a term of more general use, and probably had substantially the same meaning throughout all the Provinces, and that class of license is referred to in the same Statute and section as licenses for the retail of the same description of liquors to be drunk in an inn, alehouse, beer-house, or any other house of public entertainment in which the same is sold. The anomaly of allowing the Local Legislatures to compel a manufacturer to take out a license from the Local Government to sell an article which has already paid a heavy excise duty to the Dominion Government, and after he has paid for and obtained a license from the Dominion Government to do the very same thing, is obvious to every one. It is not doubted that the Dominion Legislature had a right to lay on this excise tax and to grant this license, and the act of the Local Legislature forbids and punishes the brewer for doing that which the Dominion Statute permits and allows. Here surely is what seems a direct conflict and interference with the act of the Dominion Legislature, and such a conflict as the framers of the British North America Act never contemplated or intended.\nI should be very much surprised to learn that any gentleman concerned in preparing or revising the British North America Act ever supposed that under the term \"and other licenses\" it was intended to confer on the Local Legislatures the power of interfering with every Statute passed by the Dominion Parliament for regulating trade and commerce, or for raising money under customs and excise laws. If it be decided that the words used confer the power in the broad sense contended for, there can hardly be an occupation or a business carried on which may not need a license from the Local Legislature, and if they have the right to impose that kind of taxation why should they be restricted from doing so?\nI have already intimated that the largest portion of the revenues of Canada will probably be derived from duties raised under customs and excise laws, and that the power of direct taxation will seldom be resorted to; but that it was undoubtedly necessary, to guard against all possible contingencies as to a deficient revenue, to give to the Dominion Parliament the power of direct taxation. It may be urged that in this way a conflict may arise between the two authorities. When a tax is directly imposed the power imposing it authorises its own officers, to collect it, but when the conflict arises from a license the party who is required to take out the license may or may not do so as he pleases, and he may cease to carry on the business, and in that way deprive the Government of the revenue it would otherwise have received.\nI do not think it necessary for the elucidation of my views to reiterate the arguments contained in the very elaborate judgment of Mr. Justice Wilson, in the case of the Queen v. Taylor. That judgment was prepared when I was a member of that Court, after a most careful consideration and consultation with all the Judges of the Court.\nThe fact, that that judgment was reversed in the Court of Error and Appeal of Ontario, and that so many of my learned Brothers in this Court dissent from the views there expressed, of course, naturally creates in my mind some distrust as to the correctness of my own conclusions. It may be that I do not take a sufficiently technical view of the matter, that I look too much to the surrounding circumstances and the legislation which I consider applicable to the subject, and that my mind is too much influenced by those circumstances But I consider the question to be decided is of the very greatest importance to the well working of the system of Government under which we now live. I consider the power now claimed to interfere with the paramount authority of the Dominion Parliament in matters of trade and commerce and indirect taxation, so pregnant with evil, and so contrary to what appears to me to be the manifest intention of the framers of the British North America Act, that I cannot come to the conclusion that it is conferred by the language cited as giving that power. By the interpretation I give to the words, limiting them to the \"other licenses\" which are of a local and municipal character, and giving full force to the words \"shop, saloon, tavern and auctioneer licenses,\" I think I carry out the intention of the British North America Act, and make all the powers harmonise. Those of the Dominion Parliament to regulate trade and commerce and to exercise the power of indirect taxation, except the shop, tavern, saloon and auctioneer licenses, and those of a purely local and municipal character; and the Local Legislature has the powers so excepted out of the exclusive powers of the Dominion Parliament, together with the right of direct taxation.\nIt is suggested that, as under section 90 of the Statute the Governor General may disallow any Act of a Local Legislature likely to cause a conflict with Statutes of the Dominion Parliament, any apprehended difficulty or inconvenience might be avoided by the exercise of that power.\nUnder our system of Government, the disallowing of Statutes passed by a Local Legislature after due deliberation, asserting a right to exercise powers which they claim to possess under the British North America Act, will always be considered a harsh exercise of power, unless in cases of great and manifest necessity, or where the Act is so clearly beyond the powers of the Local Legislature that the propriety of interfering would at once be recognised.\nMy views may be briefly summed up thus:\u2014I consider, under the British North America Act, the power to regulate trade and commerce rests exclusively with the Dominion Parliament, as also the right to raise money by the mode of indirect taxation, except so far as the same may be expressly given to the Local Legislatures.\nMaking it necessary to take out and pay for a license to sell by wholesale or retail, spirituous, fermented or other manufactured liquors, is raising money by the indirect mode of taxation.\nI think all the authority given to the Local Legislatures to exercise the power of raising money by the indirect mode of taxation is contained in sec. 92 of the British North America Act, which gives power to legislate on the subject of\n8. Municipal institutions in the Province.\n9. Shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licenses in order to the raising a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes.\nLooking at the state of things existing in the Provinces at the time of passing the British North America Act, and the legislation then in force in the different Provinces on the subject, and the general scope and object of Confederation then about to take place, I think it was not intended by the words \"other licenses\" to enlarge the powers referred to beyond shop saloon and tavern licenses in the direction of licenses to affect the general purposes of trade and commerce and the levying of indirect taxes, but rather to limit them to the licenses which might be required for objects which were merely municipal or local in their character.\nIf the power can be properly exercised by the Local Legislatures to raise money by this indirect mode of taxation, I cannot doubt it will be largely exercised, and probably without reference to the effect it may have on the means which the Dominion Parliament may resort to for the purpose of raising a revenue. It is a significant fact that since the passing of the Act requiring manufacturers of spirituous, malt, or other manufactured liquors to take out a license to sell by wholesale, the Legislature of Ontario has increased the sum payable for such licenses from fifty dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars. I think the appeal should be allowed with costs, and judgment in the Court below entered for the Defendant on the demurrer to the information with costs.\nRITCHIE, J.:\u2014\nThe only question raised in this case is: Has the Legislature of Ontario authority to raise a revenue from brewers by requiring them to take out licenses to enable them to carry on their business and dispose of their beer within the Province of Ontario?\nThis I should feel no difficulty in answering in the negative, but for sub-section 9 of section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867.\nNo doubt this is an indirect tax, and Local Legislatures are, by the British North America Act, confined in their power of raising money to direct taxation within the Province, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, except so far as their power is extended by section 92, which authorizes the Legislature in each Province exclusively to make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next thereinafter enumerated, of which sub-section 9 specifies:\nShop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes.\nThis brings up the question on which, I humbly think, this case turns, viz., what licenses did the Legislature intend to cover by the words, \"and other licenses?\" Had the licenses specified in this section been ejusdem generis; had they been confined to those which, throughout the Dominion, previously to Confederation, had been granted only by municipal authorities; and had the revenue authorized to be raised been for municipal purposes alone, I should have thought there was much force in the contention that the words \"and other licenses\" should be read in a restricted sense. We are not, in my opinion, to look to the state of the law at the time of Confederation in the adjoining Republic, or the difficulties there experienced, as affording any guide to the construction of the British North America Act; nor, with all respect for the Province of Ontario, do I think the Act should be read by the light of an Ontario candle alone, that is, by the state of the law at the time of Confederation in that Province, without reference to what the law was in other parts of the Dominion. If the law at the time of Confederation is to be looked at as affording a key to the construction of the Statute, then the state of the law throughout the Dominion must, I think, be looked at, and not that of any individual Province; as I think it clear that the Statute was to have a uniform construction throughout the whole Dominion, and the powers of all the Local Legislatures were to be alike. But, as the case stands, I can see no reason why the golden rule, as it has been often called, by which Judges are to be guided in the construction of Acts of Parliament, should be departed from, viz., to read the words of an Act of Parliament in their natural, ordinary and grammatical sense, giving them a meaning to their full extent and capacity, there being nothing to be discovered on the face of the Statute to show that they were not intended to bear that construction, nor anything in the Act inconsistent with the declared intention of the Legislature.\nI cannot think it was intended to confine the powers of the Local Legislature, for the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes, to licenses of a purely municipal character granted, most frequently, rather with a view to police regulations than for purposes of revenue, and which, when granted for the latter object, could hardly be supposed to be more than adequate for local and municipal purposes. I think the power given under sub-section 9 should be construed as intended to furnish, the Local Legislature with the means of raising a substantial revenue for provincial purposes from all such licenses as at the time of Confederation were granted in the now Dominion, either by provincial or municipal authority.\nI have said before, the licenses named are not ejusdem generis, for certainly auctioneer licenses are not ejusdem generis with tavern licenses, nor always granted by the same authority; for in New Brunswick, while tavern licenses were granted by the municipal authority, auctioneer licenses were granted by the Lieutenant-Governor; and so with respect to distillers, an annual license had to be obtained from the Provincial Treasurer; so also formerly with respect to hawkers, pedlers and petty chapmen, a provincial duty was imposed, and they were required to take a license from the Treasurer of the Province[72]; and again, in New Brunswick, licenses, other than those of a police or municipal character, were granted by municipal authority as licenses for the sale of liquors by wholesale, no person being allowed to sell any liquor by wholesale without license, which liquors the Statute declared inter alia to be:\nAle, porter, strong beer, or any other fermented or intoxicating liquor.\nFrom this brewers were not exempt, there being no exception in their favor. And by the 6 Vic. ch. 35 it was enacted:\nSec. 3. That it shall and may be lawful for the mayor of the said city (St John), and he is hereby authorized to license persons being natural born British subjects, or such as shall become naturalized or be made denizens, to use any art, trade, mystery or occupation, or carry on any business in merchandize or otherwise, within the said city, on paying yearly, such sum not exceeding five pounds, nor less than five shillings, to be fixed and determined by an ordinance of the corporation, for the use of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the said city of St John, together with the fees of office, and be subject also to the payment of all other charges, taxes, rates, or assessments as any freeman or other inhabitant of the said city may, by law, be liable to or chargeable with.\nSec. 4. And that aliens, the subjects of any other country at peace with Great Britain, may be licensed, by the mayor of the said city, to use any art, trade, mystery or occupation, or to carry on any business in merchandise or otherwise, within the said city, on paying annually for the use of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the said city, a sum not exceeding twenty-five pounds, nor less than five pounds, together with fees of office to be regulated by an ordinance of the corporation, and be subject also to the payment of all other charges, taxes, rates or assessments as any freeman or any other inhabitant of the said city may, by law, be liable to or chargeable with.\nTherefore, I think the rule noscitur a sociis cannot apply in this case.\nIt is said this construction conflicts with the power of the Dominion Government to regulate trade and commerce, and the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation. All I can say in answer to that is, that so far, and so far only, as the raising of a revenue for provincial, municipal and local purposes is concerned, the British North America Act, in my opinion, gives to the Local Legislatures not an inconsistent but a concurrent power of taxation, and I fail to see any necessary conflict; certainly, no other or greater than would necessarily arise from the exercise of the power of direct taxation and the granting of shop and auctioneer licenses specially vested in the local legislatures. It cannot be doubted, I apprehend, that both the Local Legislatures and Dominion Parliament may raise a revenue by direct taxation, and, if so, why may not both raise a revenue by means of licenses? There need be no more conflict in the one case than in the other. The granting of shop and auctioneer licenses necessarily interferes with trade and commerce, the former with retail trade, the latter with both wholesale and retail trade; for, in large business centres, auctioneers' sales on a wholesale scale are of daily occurrence.\nShould at any time the burthen imposed by the Local Legislature, under this power, in fact conflict injuriously with the Dominion power to regulate trade and commerce, or with the Dominion power to raise money by any mode or system of taxation, the power vested in the Governor General of disallowing any such legislation, practically affords the means by which serious difficulty may be prevented. But 1 do not think we have any right to suppose for a moment that the Local Legislatures would legislate save for the legitimate purpose of raising a revenue, and not so as to interfere unnecessarily or injuriously with the legislation of the Dominion Parliament, still less, so as to destroy the very business from which the revenue is to be derived.\nI think the construction I have indicated of the words \"and other licenses\" is not only in accordance with the literal interpretation of the language, but is consistent with the policy and purview of the Statute, which, as I said before, in my opinion, was to give to the Local Legislatures the rights and power, in addition to direct taxation, to raise a substantial revenue, for provincial, as well as for municipal, purposes, by means of licenses such as were and might have been granted at the time of Confederation by the several Provincial Governments and municipal authorities, and is not confined to licenses which are of a purely municipal character, and from which I do not think a brewer is any more exempt than a shop-keeper or auctioneer. He could not sell by wholesale in New Brunswick at the time of Confederation without a license, and I do not think he can do so now in Ontario.\nIt may be right for me to say that it is only under the words \"and other licenses,\" and solely in order to the raising of a revenue for the purpose named in subsection 9, that, in my opinion, the Local Legislatures have the right of imposing this burthen or tax on brewers.\nSTRONG, J.:\u2014\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the Court below ought to be affirmed.\nAs this Court is now, for the first time, dealing with a question involving the construction of that provision of the British North America Act which prescribes the powers of the Provincial Legislatures, I do not consider it out of place to state a general principle, which, in my opinion, should be applied in determining questions relating to the constitutional validity of Provincial Statutes. It is, I consider, our duty to make every possible presumption in favor of such Legislative Acts, and to endeavor to discover a construction of the British North America Act which will enable us to attribute an impeached Statute to a due exercise of constitutional authority, before taking upon ourselves to declare that, in assuming to pass it, the Provincial Legislature usurped powers which did not legally belong to it; and in doing this, we are to bear in mind \"that it does not belong to Courts of Justice to interpolate constitutional restrictions; their duty being to apply the law, not to make it.\"\nIt must, therefore, before we can determine that the Legislature of the Province of Ontario have exceeded their powers in passing this Act, be conclusively shown that it cannot be classed under any of the subjects of legislation enumerated in section 92 of the British North America Act, which is to be read as an exception to the preceding section. The provision contained in the 26th section of the Ontario Act, 37 Vic., cap. 32, does not require all brewers to obtain licenses to enable them to sell the beer manufactured by them; but the restriction against selling without license is confined to the sale by wholesale of beer sold for consumption within the Province. I cannot well see with what object the distinction was made between beer to be consumed in, and that to be consumed without, the Province, unless it was either upon the assumption, that the right exclusively conferred upon the Parliament of the Dominion to regulate trade and commerce did not extend to the internal trade of the Provinces; or upon the supposition, that the law would be authorized by the right to legislate in exercise of what was designated in the argument of this case as the police power, which, it was contended, the Provinces possess. Neither of these grounds constituted valid reasons for making this discrimination.\nThat the regulation of trade and commerce in the Provinces, domestic and internal, as well, as foreign and external, is, by the British North America Act, exclusively conferred upon the Parliament of the Dominion, calls for no demonstration, for the language of the Act is explicit.\nWith reference to the police power, I am of opinion also, for a reason which I will state hereafter, that the distinction could have no legal effect.\nI regard the Act, therefore, as one, the validity of which is to be tested precisely in the same manner as if it had required all persons carrying on the trade of brewing in the Province of Ontario to qualify themselves by taking out licenses.\nIt was argued for the Crown, and particularly pressed by one of the learned counsel, Mr. Crooks, that the fee payable for this license was a direct tax, or in the nature of a direct tax, and so authorized by section 92, sub-section 9.\nI do not think this argument well founded. It might not be easy to specify a priori what is meant by a direct tax under that sub-section. One species of tax which would be a direct tax suggests itself at once,\u2014a capitation tax; but it is not material to pursue the enquiry, as it is evident that, accepting the meaning given to the term \"indirect tax\" by political economists, a tax on manufactures by means of a license is within the definition, since the payment of it ultimately falls upon the consumer. Licenses are always classed by economists with excise taxes. The authorities referred to in the judgment of the late Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in The Queen v. Taylor seem conclusive as to this.\nIt was also contended by counsel for the Respondent, that under the words \"Municipal Institutions in the Province,\" which constitute sub-section 9 of sec. 92, or under sub-section 16 of the same section, which gives legislative power in \"all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\" the Provincial Legislatures possess authority to legislate in exercise of what American authorities have conveniently termed the \"Police Power\"\u2014meaning a power to legislate respecting ferries, markets, fares to be charged for vehicles let for hire, the regulation of the retail sale of spirits and liquors, and on a number of other cognate but indefinite subjects, which, in all countries where the English municipal system, or anything resembling it, prevails, have been generally regarded and dealt with as subjects of municipal regulation[73].\nWithout expressing any opinion as to the soundness of this argument, I am of opinion, that, even if it was entitled to prevail, it could not warrant the imposition of a license tax upon the manufacture or wholesale sale of beer, any more than it would authorize a similar tax upon any other manufacture or commerce by wholesale.\nI think, however, that in ascribing the power of the Legislature to pass this Statute to sub-section 9 of section 92, the learned counsel for the Crown put their case upon the true ground. That provision is in the following words:\nShop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes.\nIn the Queen v. Taylor[74], the Court of Appeal of Ontario, adjudicating upon the question now before this Court, determined that the words \"other licenses,\" as used in this section, gave power to impose licenses upon persons carrying on the trade of brewers.\nThis conclusion was reached by the consideration that all powers conferred in section 92 were to be read and regarded as exceptions to those enumerated in section 91, and by that section given to Parliament. That section 92 was, therefore, to be construed as if it had been contained in an Act of the Imperial Parliament, separate and apart from section 91, and is, therefore, to be read independently of that section. The rule applied in the construction of Statutes, which restrains general words following specific words to subjects ejusdem generis with those specifically mentioned, was thought not to be applicable, inasmuch as the specific words were not ejusdem generis with each other, and it was, therefore, impossible to say with which class of the specific classes mentioned the general words should be associated; in short, it was held to be impossible to apply to this clause the well known maxim of interpretation noscitur a sociis. The words \"other licenses\" were therefore held to be susceptible of only one construction, that which attributed to them the same meaning as if the expression in the Act had been \"any licenses,\" or \"all licenses,\" standing alone, unconnected with any specific words.\nI was a party to the judgment in The Queen v. Taylor, and a careful consideration since has not only not led me to discover any error in it, but has brought to my notice authorities not quoted to the Court of Appeal, as well as some additional reasons for adhering to the decision.\nIn Regina vs. Payne[75] this principle of construction was applied. A recent text writer[76], gives a succint statement of this case and of the principle involved in it which I adopt, and which is contained in the following quotation:\nFurther, the principle in question applies only where the specific words are all of the same nature. When they are of a different nature, the meaning of the general word remains unaffected by its connection with them. Thus, where an Act made it penal to convey to a prisoner, in order to facilitate his escape, \"any mask, dress or disguise, or any letter, or any other article, or thing,\" it was held that the last terms were to be understood in their primary and wide meaning, and as including any article or thing whatsoever, which could in any manner facilitate the escape of a prisoner, such as a crowbar. Here, the several particular words \"disguise\" and \"letter,\" exhausted whole genera, and the last general words must be understood, therefore, as referred to other genera[77].\nIt is scarcely possible to suppose an authority more exactly in point than that just cited. The only difference in principle between the two cases being, that, in the instance quoted, this rule of construction was applied in a criminal case and against the prisoner; here, it was applied by the Court of Appeal in support of a presumption which the highest authorities, and which reason, if there, was no authority, tell us ought always to be made in favor of the constitutional validity of a Legislative Act.\nBut without any reference to authority, the impossibility of saying by which of the particular expressions \"shop, saloon, tavern or auctioneers,\" the general words were to be restrained ought, I venture to say, with deference to those who differ from me, to force the broad construction of the words \"other licenses\" upon a court called upon to construe this clause, as a necessary and unavoidable interpretation[78].\nThen, the attribution of this meaning to the clause under consideration does not lead to any harsh or unreasonable consequences. The result of it is, that the people of the Provinces have the power, through their representatives, to tax themselves for Provincial, local or municipal purposes, by means of licenses, to any extent they may choose; which may, perhaps, not be considered to be an extravagant power, when it is remembered that the license tax is the only source of Provincial Revenue other than the Public Lands, the subsidy from the general government, and money raised by direct taxation, which, however ample in this particular Province, and at the present time, may not, in other Provinces, or in this, at some future time, be productive of sufficient income to meet the expenditure required for carrying on the Provincial Government.\nThe imposition of licenses authorized by this subsection 9, is, it will be observed, confined to licenses for the purposes of revenue, and it is not to be assumed that the Provincial Legislatures will abuse the power, or exercise it in such a way as to destroy any trade or occupation. Should it appear explicitly on the face of any Legislative Act that a license tax was imposed with such an object, it would not be a tax authorized by this section, and it might be liable to be judicially pronounced extra vires. And however carefully the purpose or object of such an enactment might be veiled, the foresight of those who framed our constitutional Act led them to provide a remedy in the 90th section of the Act, by vesting the power of disallowance of Provincial Acts in the Executive Power of the Dominion, the Governor General in Council. There is, therefore, no room for the application of any argument ab inconvenienti sufficient to neutralize the rule of verbal construction already referred to.\nI have considered, with all the attention in my power, the reasoning which the Chief Justice has enunciated in his judgment to day, as well as in his former judgment in the case of Slavin v. Orillia[79]; but I am unable to accede to the doctrine that we are to attribute to the words \"other licenses\" the same meaning as though the expression had been \"such other licenses as were formerly imposed in the Province,\" or equivalent words.\nThe result of such a construction would be, that the same words would have a different meaning in different Provinces, and that the several Provincial Legislatures would have different powers of taxation, though the power is included in the same grant. This, it appears to me, would be in direct contravention of the principle which forbids a different interpretation being given to a general law in different localities, however much local laws or usages may favor such diverse interpretations[80]. However, apart from authority, I cannot think this was the intention of the Imperial Parliament. I think everything indicates that co-equal and co-ordinate legislative powers in every particular were conferred by the Acton the Provinces, and I know of no principle of interpretation which would authorize such a reading of the British North America Act as that proposed. Had such been the design of the framers of the Act, the meaning of which I can only discover from the words in which it is expressed, we should have found the case provided for.\nThe objection, that the wider construction which I have attributed to sub-section 9 brings that provision into collision with sub-section 2 of section 91, which confers the power of regulating trade and commerce on the Parliament of the Dominion, is, I think, fully answered by reading the subjects enumerated in section 92 as excepted from section 91: It is, I conceive, the duty of the Court so to construe the British North America Act as to make its several enactments harmonize with each other, and this may be effected, without doing any violence to the Act, by reading the enumerated powers in section 92 in the manner suggested, as exceptions from those given to the Dominion by section 91. Read in this way, sub-section 2 must be construed to mean the regulation of trade and commerce, save in so far as power to interfere with it is, by section 92, conferred upon the Provinces. Imposing licenses on auctioneers and shops is an undoubted interference with trade and commerce; and if the words \"other licenses\" have the wide primary meaning which, I think, is to be attributed to them, why should they be cut down and regarded as inconsistent with sub-section 2, any more than the words authorizing specific licenses? The reading of sub-section 2 of section 91, as subject to the exception of auctioneer and shop licenses, is absolutely necessary to reconcile the two clauses, and, if that be so, upon what principles can the classes of licenses, whatever they may be, which are covered by the words \"other licenses,\" be excluded from the exception? The words \"other licenses\" must either be silenced altogether, or else, whatever they may mean in conjunction with the preceding specific words, they must be read as an exception to sub-section 2 and every other enumeration of section 91, with which they would conflict if otherwise construed.\nThat Parliament has a general unrestrained power of taxation can make no difference. The same answer applies to this objection as that just suggested as regards sub-section 2; but, in addition, there is no repugnancy or inconsistency between this general power of taxation in the Dominion and the restricted right to tax in the Provinces.\nIt is true, that the same tax might be laid on by both Legislatures, but this constitutes no such absurd or unjust consequence as would necessitate a rejection of the obvious primary meaning of the words of the Act. If in section 91 unlimited power of taxing is given, and in section 92 power is given to tax brewers, and I read the act as if that had been expressed in so many words, there would not, so far as I can see, be any inconsistency.\nThe general Legislature can undoubtedly tax auctioneers, and by express words the Local Legislatures have authority to do the same. The Act, therefore, contains internal evidence that the double power of taxation was not considered inconvient or absurd. The protection of the people against oppressive taxation was left to their representatives in the Provincial Legislatures as well as in Parliament.\nSome arguments addressed to the Court seem to have been intended to elicit opinions as to the locality of the power of prohibiting legislation with reference to the trade in spirituous liquors, wine and beer. This, so far as retail trade is concerned, must depend on the proper answers to two questions: 1st, Do the Local Legislatures possess what is called the \"police power\"? 2nd, If they do, does it authorize them to legislate so as to prohibit, or only to regulate, the retail traffic in liqours? The decision of this case does not call for any answer to either of these questions, and I therefore forbear from expressing any opinion upon them, since such an opinion would, in my point of view, be extra judicial, and therefore improper.\nMy conclusion is, that it was within the competence of the Legislature of Ontario to pass the Statute in question, and that this appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014\nThe only question submitted for our decision is, whether the Legislature of Ontario had the power to pass the statute 37 Victoria, chapter 32, under which the Appellant was condemned, requiring Brewers to take out a license for selling fermented or malt liquor by wholesale.\nI must confess, that for some time I had strong doubts against the legality of the pretensions of the Defendant Severn, amounting very nearly to conviction; but after long and mature deliberation I came to the conclusion that the sections of that Act applicable to the Defendant were ultra vires.\nOn reference to section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, we find that the subjects of exclusive Provincial Legislation are determined in somewhat concise language; but, nevertheless, with sufficient explicitness to be well ascertained after a careful examination of the whole Act.\nOn reference to sub-section 2 of section 92, we find that direct taxation only is one of the privileges of Local Legislatures, in order to raise a revenue for Provincial purposes; and, under sub-section 9 of this same section 92, it is enunciated that their powers shall extend to make laws about\nShop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licenses, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes;\nbut it is evident, that in adjudicating on the extent of sub-section 9 of section 92, we must read it in connection with the remainder of the Act itself, and more particularly with sub-sections 2 and 29 of section 91, which indicate the powers of the Parliament of Canada.\nUnder sub-section 2 of section 91, the Parliament has the exclusive regulation of trade and commerce, and under sub-section 29 of section 91, it is declared that\nAny matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nFrom section 122 of the British North America Act we can safely infer that the Parliament of Canada has exclusive jurisdiction as to excise.\nComing to sub-section 2 of section 92 of the British North America Act, I say that it is out of the question for the Crown to rest its case on this sub-section; for, according to it, the only tax the Government of Ontario could raise would be a direct one, and not an indirect one, such as the one complained of. The authorities quoted at the Bar warrant this interpretation of the nature of the tax.\nA direct tax is one which is demanded from the very person who it is intended or desired should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense of another[81].\nNow, from what I have read and heard, I think there is no difficulty in assuming that the tax imposed on the Brewer selling by wholesale in the present case, is an indirect tax, so that this question should not be further pressed against the Defendant Severn.\nNow, can the Crown justify the Act in question in this cause under subsection 9 of section 92 of the British North America Act, which grants to Provincial Legislatures in the Dominion of Canada the right of making laws about shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses? I think not. This power would evidently clash with the Dominion power of regulating trade and commerce, and of imposing duties thereon, and exacting licenses. If this right existed, both Parliament and Provincial Legislatures would possess an equal right to impose a duty and exact licenses.\nBut what is the meaning of the words \"and other licenses,\" immediately following the words \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer?\"\u2014I answer, that taken in connection with all the surrounding circumstances, and with the various sections of the British North America Act, they certainly cannot mean anything which could be interpreted as granting such powers as those claimed by the Ontario Legislature. They must not be so interpreted as to clash with the general spirit of that last mentioned Act and its special enactments. In a word, they cannot be so interpreted as to give to the Ontario Legislature a right to affect the general control of the Dominion over trade, commerce and excise, and its sovereignty over the country, by diminishing some of its principal sources of revenue. If these words mean what is contended for by the prosecution, sub-section 29 of section 91 of the British North America Act is nonsensical and should be struck out of the statute. But these words may and must mean all matters and regulations of Police and the government of those saloons, taverns, auctioneers, &c., &c.; and if these words can not bear this last interpretation, the section has no meaning, or is ultra vires. I therefore say, that the Defendant Severn could not be legally convicted under the Act in question, as he has been by the judgment appealed from in the present case, and that that judgment should be reversed.\nFournier, J.:\u2014\n[TRANSLATED.]\nThe only question to be decided in this case arises on the constitutionality of a law of the Province of Ontario, imposing upon brewers and distillers the obligation of taking out a license of $50, in order that they may sell their products within the said Province.\nThe question we have therefore toconsider is, whether the law in question is, or is not, in direct conflict with the British North America Act, and, more particularly, 1st, with No. 2 of section 91, relating to the \"regulation of trade and commerce,\" and, 2ly, with section 122, which gives to the Parliament of Canada the control over the custom and excise laws, and, therefore, beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of the Ontario Legislature.\nThe principal provisions in the British North America Act, which have reference to the present question, are the following:\nSec. 91 gives power to the Parliament of Canada\nTo make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated:\nAmongst others\u2014\n2nd. The regulation of trade and commerce.\n3rd. The raising of money by any mode or system of taxation. * * * * *\nAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nSec. 92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated:\nAmongst others\u2014\n2. Direct taxation within the Province in order to the raising of a revenue for Provincial purposes.\n9. Shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes.\nSec. 95. In each Province the Legislature may make laws in relation to agriculture in the Province, and to immigration into the Province, and it is hereby declared that the Parliament of Canada may from time to time make laws in relation to agriculture in all or any of the Provinces, and to immigration into all or any of the Provinces; and any law of the Legislature of a Province relative to agriculture or immigration shall have effect in and for the Province as long and as far only as it is not repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nSec. 122. The custom and excise laws of each Province shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, continue in force until altered by the Parliament of Canada.\nBefore considering the two points above mentioned, I think it necessary to review briefly the argument of the learned counsel of Her Majesty, founded on their interpretation of the words \"and other licenses,\" in paragraph 9 of section 92. They contend, as it was contended by the Court of Appeal of Ontario, in the case of The Queen v. Taylor, where the same question arose, that the expression made use of is large enough to give jurisdiction to the Ontario Legislature to pass the law in question.\nNow, if these terms are not to have the broad signification which, at first sight, their general meaning seems to convey, what restrictions should be put on them? What subjects would be susceptible of taxation by the mode of licenses, and what subjects would be exempt from such taxation? The line of division is no doubt somewhat difficult to be drawn, in consequence of a vagueness and want of precision in drafting the paragraph in which these expressions are to be found; but the Dominion, no more than the Provinces, can increase its jurisdiction by its own legislation; and we must therefore, notwithstanding the delicacy of the task, have recourse to a judicial interpretation in order to know the limits of both powers.\nIs it true, as is contended by the learned counsel of Her Majesty, that, being unable to construe the words \"and other licenses\" in paragraph 9 according to the ordinary rule that general words following specific words must be taken to mean something of the same kind, ejusdem generis, the power to impose licenses is therefore absolute and unlimited?\nThey lay down their proposition as follows:\nThe rule of ejusdem generis is inapplicable here, first, in there being no controlling or particular classes to refer to in order to determine the like classes to which the word \"other\" might be referred with any definiteness; and 2ndly, because the latter words enlarge \"other licenses\" into all such as the legislative authority may consider necessary to the raising of a revenue.\nIt is true that \"auctioneer\" licenses were for a long time regulated by a different law from that which regulated the granting of licenses for shops, taverns, saloons, &c. But even before Confederation the Legislature of Canada had assimilated them, at least in the Province of Upper Canada, to these other licenses, and had subjected them, with the latter, to the control of the municipalities. They had, at least for that Province, become ejusdem generis. In Lower Canada the revenue derived from them had ceased to be appropriated for the general use of the Government, in order to form part of the seigniorial indemnity fund, for the purpose of paying off the dues of the censitaires which the Government had undertaken to pay.\nWithout attaching more importance than is necessary to the application of the rule of ejusdem generis, is it not more logical to suppose that the Imperial Legislature, finding already in some of the laws these licenses treated as of the same kind as other licenses, did likewise, and dealt with them as belonging to the one class; and, therefore, should we not apply in construing this 9th paragraph the rule of ejusdem generis? Otherwise, we must come to the conclusion that the insertion of the word \"auctioneer,\" which, no doubt, was put in to give the Local Government a further source of revenue, would have the effect of giving to the Local Legislature an unlimited power to tax by means of licenses. This cannot have been the intention of the Imperial Parliament. They cannot, by the insertion of that word, have made a provision which would have the effect of destroying the financial system of both the Dominion and the Provinces established by the Constitution. The intention was no doubt that they should have a limited signification in accordance with the distinct powers so carefully allotted to the Federal and Local Governments.\nMoreover, I am far from admitting that the word \"other,\" coming immediately after an enumeration, can always have that broad meaning; on the contrary, I am of opinion that it should nearly always be accepted in a restricted sense, and that the cases in which its signification is absolute and unlimited are exceptional.\nThis is the rule as laid down by Chief Justice Erle in the case of Williams v. Golding[82], when construing the words \"other person;\" and by Lord Campbell, Chief Justice, in the case of Reed v. Ingham[83], while interpreting the words \"other craft.\"\nSee also the case of The East London Waterworks Co. v. The Trustees of Mile End Old Town[84]; and the case of the King v. The Justices of Surrey[85].\nBesides, if these words \"and other licenses\" should not be construed (which I do not admit) according to the above ordinary rule, would it follow that there is not to be found in the Constitutional Act itself, taking a general view of it, as well as of certain of its provisions, a mode of solving this question conformably to the spirit of the Act, rather than according to the views of the learned Counsel of Her Majesty?\nFirst, was it not the clear intention of the Imperial Parliament, to establish two distinct Governments, with special and exclusive powers, in order to avoid all conflict between the different authorities?\nTo prove this it is not necessary to refer to the circumstances before the present state of affairs. The dear and precise terms of the Constitutional Act itself are sufficient to show this. It may be as well, however, to remark, that the British North America Act contains in substance hardly anything more than the Quebec resolutions, their object at that time being, most certainly, to constitute two distinct Governments with different and exclusive powers. This is also, in effect, what the new Constitution provides for, especially by sections 91 and 92, which distribute the legislative power to the Dominion and Provincial Legislatures. The 91st section gives to the Federal Parliament the general power of taxation, a sovereignty over all subjects, except those specifically mentioned in section 92, as being subjects exclusively belonging to the Local Legislatures. We find, among the exclusive powers given to the Federal Parliament, the power of regulating trade and commerce.\nThis power, being full and complete, cannot be restricted; unless by some specific provision to be found in the British North America Act.\nFor this reason, the relative position of the Provinces towards the Federal Parliament is far different from that of the States towards the United States Congress. Here the power to regulate trade and commerce, without any distinction as to interior and exterior commerce, belongs exclusively to the Dominion Parliament, whilst, in the United States, Congress has power only to deal with exterior or foreign commerce, commerce between the different States and that with the Indian tribes. The States, not having delegated to Congress the power of regulating interior commerce, still have power to legislate on it as they please. We should not, therefore, look to the numerous decisions rendered on the laws relating to the interior commerce as precedents applicable to the present case, but rather to the decisions given on laws passed by the State Legislatures which happened to come in conflict with the power of Congress to deal with exterior commerce.\nThere is a decision, rendered as early as 1827, which has always been looked upon as being the true construction of that article of the Constitution of the United States which gives Congress power to regulate exterior commerce, and which is very applicable to the present case. It is that rendered in the case of Brown v. State of Maryland[86]. In order to raise revenue to meet the expenses of the State, the Legislature of Maryland passed a law, by which, amongst other things, importers of foreign merchandise enumerated in the law, or such other persons as should sell by wholesale such merchandize, were directed to take out a license, for which they were to pay $50, before selling any of the imported goods, subjecting them, in case of neglect or refusal, to forfeit the amount due for the license and to a penalty of $100.\nBrown, who was an importer residing in the city of Baltimore, refused to pay this tax, and an information was, in consequence, laid against him before the State Court, which declared the law to be valid and condemned him to pay the penalty prescribed.\nThis judgment was appealed by means of a writ of error to the Supreme Court, which Court, for the reasons so ably propounded by the learned Chief Justice Marshall, declared the law void as coming in conflict with the power of Congress to regulate exterior commerce.\nThe question here naturally arises, what was the extent of that power? This question was considered at great length in the case of Gibbons v. Ogden[87], by Chief Justice Marshall, who answered it as follows:\nIt is the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed. This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed by the Constitution.\nSince this is the law in the United States, there is an additional reason why it should be so declared here, where our Constitution does not acknowledge, as in the United States, a division of power as to commerce.\nThe law declared void in the case of Brown v. The State of Maryland was of the same kind as the one enacted by the Province of Ontario. The only difference was that that law reached the importer, whilst the law under consideration here is directed against the manufacturer.\nBut is there not a perfect analogy between the two parties? Have not both the importer and the manufacturer the one object, viz.: to sell their goods? Both, the first by purchasing in a foreign market, the latter, by his industry, have filled their stores with goods which they cannot put into commercial circulation until they have paid the duties imposed upon them.\nThe importation of foreign goods, no doubt, is subject to the regulations of trade and commerce, but not more so than manufactured articles which are subject to the excise laws. If the Local Government have the right to tax the latter, they have the same right to tax the importer, by prohibiting him, as it is contended they have the right to prohibit the manufacturer, from selling his merchandise if he has not previously taken out a license allowing him to sell.\nIf this contention is well founded, the payment of the custom and excise duties would not be all that the importer and the brewer would have to calculate upon before offering their goods for sale, for they would also have to pay another duty in the shape of a license fee.\nIt is also contended, that in this case the Federal Government having regulated only the manufacture of the beer, it was in the power of the Local Government to regulate its sale.\nThe following answer could be made to this argument, viz.: that if the Federal Government, in the exercise of its power, has not deemed it necessary to restrict the sale of beer, it was because its intention was to leave it free. The regulations need not consist only of restrictions. By imposing those mentioned in 31 Vic. ch. 8, was it not in effect enacting that there would be no others? To leave or to declare free a commerce, is it not exercising the power of regulating such commerce just as much as to impose upon it certain restrictions? To impose upon beer consumed in the Province of Ontario a tax which is not imposed upon beer consumed in the other Provinces, is to decree that there shall be a difference of price in favor of consumers of beer in the other Provinces against consumers in Ontario. It is regulating that commerce in such a way as to give to the first named an unjust preference which the Federal Government itself could not give without violating the principles upon which assessments are made. It would be strange, indeed, if the Legislature of Ontario, by assuming this jurisdiction under the pretence of its being a license, could have over this matter more power than has the Federal Government.\nThe power to tax is no doubt necessary to the existence of the Local Governments, but it is limited and proportioned to the extent of their jurisdiction. Fulfilling only certain duties of a Government within certain limits, the power to tax was in consequence divided between the Federal and Local Governments. To the first, whose jurisdiction is larger, belongs the power of raising money by all modes of taxation, whilst Local Governments can only do so by direct taxation[88] and by the issuing of licenses. Moreover, the tax imposed in the shape of a license by the law of Ontario on the sale of beer which has not yet been taken away from the stores of the brewer, is an indirect tax which must be borne by the consumer[89]. This new tax, no doubt, would have, as had the previous ones, to be added to the original cost of the beer, in order that it may be paid by the purchaser. With such means at their disposal, the Local Governments might control and regulate commerce and impose indirect taxes with as great security as if the power to do so was given to them instead of being specially taken away: Such a law comes certainly in conflict with the power of the Federal Government to regulate trade and commerce; and to impose indirect taxes.\nIf it should be admitted that the different Governments have concurrent power to impose taxes on the commodities subject to excise, who could draw the line where each Government would have to stop? If this power belongs to the Local Government, the exercise of that power must be complete, and be made use of according to the best of their judgment whenever the raising of money would be necessary. Now, in exercising such a power, might it not happen that the taxes imposed would be so high as, practically, to considerably diminish, if not exhaust, this source of revenue? What would then be the position of the Federal Government; how could it meet its obligations? Were not the duties of customs and excise left to the Federal Government, from which source it collects the largest part of its revenue, in consequence of having to bear the public debt of the Provinces and the expenses of a General Government? Could we, without violating the Constitutional Act, alter this position? To declare that both Governments have an equal right to legislate on these sources of revenue would place the Federal Government in the impossibility of meeting its obligations towards its creditors. By appropriating this revenue to other purposes, it would in fact be diminishing the security on which these creditors, when the Constitution was adopted, had the right to count for the recoupment of their advances. Legislation which would transfer to the Provincial Legislatures the control over these sources of, revenue would not fail to considerably embarrass the Federal Government, and at the same time effectively affect its credit.\nIt must also be remembered, that under our actual political system the Dominion, having taken upon itself the burden of the provincial debts, the Provinces, when Confederation was established, found themselves with a blank sheet on the debit side of their account, whilst there remained to their credit the Crown lands, the Federal subsidy, the power of direct taxation, and lastly, the limited power, in my opinion, to raise a revenue by means of licenses. A construction which would, moreover, give them the almost unlimited power of indirect taxation concurrently, under the pretext of its being a license, would, no doubt, be the means of promptly and surely creating disorder and finally break up the Constitution. As soon as there would be confusion with regard to these sources of revenue, there would remain no more reason for a division of the legislative powers between the Federal and Local Governments. The confusion of the revenues would inevitably result in a fusion of the Governments. It would be the downfall of the present structure built with such care.\nFortunately, however, such a calamity is not to be feared, for the Constitution, in my opinion, contains no provision which can have the effect of bringing about such dangerous consequences. The prudence of the legislature, in giving to each Government special legislative powers, has averted such a danger. Each Government has legislative authority over certain subjects, and it is only over these subjects that each can exercise its powers. With the exception of agriculture and immigration, there is no subject-matter over which there can exist concurrent powers of legislation[90]; and even then, should there be conflict, the authority of the Parliament of Canada is supreme.\nBy the remarks which I have just made on the consequences of the adoption of the construction contended for by the Respondent, I do not mean to argue that the exercise, nor even the possibility of abusing this power to tax by license, is a reason why it should not exist; for we can abuse all things. The proper way, no doubt, of solving this question is by referring to the express terms used in the Constitutional Act. But the clauses already cited show clearly to whom belongs this power assumed by the Ontario Legislature. The only reason for making these observations was to show that the interpretation adopted by the Respondent, would create a state of things quite different from that which the Imperial Parliament intended for us when they passed the British North America Act.\nNevertheless, I will add in support of my mode of reasoning, a passage of Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in the case of Brown v. The State of Maryland[91], and I also contend that in this case we should apply this ordinary rule of construction, that when a law is doubtful or ambiguous, it should be interpreted in such a way as to fulfil the intentions of the legislator, and attain the object for which it was passed. Marshall, C. J., says:\nWe admit this power to be sacred [the State power to tax its\" own citizens, on their property within its own territory]; but cannot admit that it may be used so as to obstruct the free course of a power given to Congress. We cannot admit that it may be used so as to obstruct or defeat the power to regulate commerce. It has been observed, that the powers remaining with the States may be so exercised as to come in conflict with those vested in Congress. When this happens that which is not supreme must yield to that which is supreme. This great and universal truth is inseparable from the nature of things, and the constitution has applied it to the often interfering powers of the General and State Governments as a vital principle of perpetual operation. It results necessarily from this principle, that the taxing power of the State must have some limits. It cannot reach and restrain the action of the National Government within its proper sphere. It cannot reach the administration of justice in the Courts of the Union, or the collection of the taxes of the United States or restrain the operation of any law which Congress may constitutionally pass. It cannot interfere with any regulation of commerce. If the States may tax all persons and property found on their territory, what shall restrain them from taxing in their transit through the State from one port to another for the purpose of re-exportation? The laws of trade authorize this operation, and general convenience requires it. Or what should restrain a State from taxing any article passing from the State itself to another State, for commercial purposes? These are all within the sovereign power of taxation, but would obviously derange the measures of Congress to regulate commerce, and effect materially the purpose for which that power was given. We deem it unnecessary to press the argument further, or to give additional illustrations of it, because the subject was taken up, and considered with great attention in McCulloch v. The State of Maryland[92], the decision in which case is, we think, entirely applicable to this.\nThe reasoning of the Supreme Court in that case, under a system of Government which left to the States the regulation of the interior commerce, is not only applicable to the present question, but should have more weight from the fact that under our system the Federal Government has the exclusive power over commerce.\nBut, secondly, this Statute of the Province of Ontario not only comes in conflict with paragraph 2 of section 91, relating to the regulation of trade and commerce, but also with sec. 122 of the B. N. A. Act, giving to the Federal Government the power to regulate all matters of excise. The trade of brewing, here as well as in England, has always been regulated by the excise laws. Before Confederation the same state of things existed in all the Provinces of the Dominion. Under the new r\u00e9gime this trade is still regulated by the excise laws, which, as we have seen by section 122 already cited, are subject to Federal legislation. It is true this section does not, as do sections 91 and 92, positively declare that it is an exclusive power, but, as it is given without any restriction, it can only be possessed by the Federal Government. The very fact of this power not being comprised in the enumeration of exclusive powers given to the Local Governments, takes away from them all jurisdiction over this matter. It is for this reason, no doubt, that on the 21st December, 1867, the Parliament of Canada, exercising the power which it had by sec. 122, abolished all the excise laws of Canada, as well as those of the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and regulated, at the same time, by a very complete law this important trade in its most minute details.\nSection 3 of 31 Vic. ch. 8 declares:\nFrom and after the passing of this Act, no person, except such as shall have been licensed as herein provided, shall carry on the business or trade of a distiller, or brewer, or maltster, or of a manufacturer of tobacco, or use any utensil, machinery or apparatus suitable for carrying on any such trade or business subject to excise.\nSection 26 imposes on the brewer the obligation of taking out a license, the price of which is fixed at $50, in order that he may carry on his trade. He is also subject to a tax of one cent per pound of malt used in the brewery. In addition to this, he is subjected to a severe superintendence in all his operations, of which he is bound, under pain of heavy penalties, to render a minute account to the Inland Revenue Department.\nThis is certainly a trade, a commerce, over which the Federal Government has fully exercised its exclusive power of regulation. Can it be said after this, that because this Statute only regulates the manufacture of the beer, the Provinces are still at liberty to prevent its, sale until a license fee of $50 is paid as directed by the 23rd section of the Ontario Act? Should a brewer, after having paid to the Federal Government the duties above mentioned, and after being obliged to submit to numerous and inconvenient restrictions, still find himself in the strange position of not being allowed to take his products out of his stores? The agent of the Local Government would have the right to appear and say to him: The Federal Government can very well allow you to manufacture, but my Government will not allow you to sell unless you purchase from us, by paying a $50 license fee, the right of selling. Would not such a prohibition be clearly contrary to the Act of the Federal Parliament authorizing the brewer to manufacture? Can you give him the right to carry on his trade in virtue of the license fee paid to the Federal Government without, at the same time, giving him the right to sell the products of his trade? Do manufacturers manufacture for the sole pleasure of accumulating their products in their stores? Is not the manufacturer's sole aim to sell his manufactured articles; and does not the right to manufacture necessarily imply the right to sell? Here, again, the reasoning of Chief Justice Marshall, on the right to import, in the case already cited[93], is applicable:\nWe think, then, that if the power to authorize a sale exists in Congress, the conclusion is that the right to sell is connected with the law permitting importation, as an inseparable incident. * * * The distinction between a tax on the thing imported, and on the person of the importer, can have no influence on that part of the subject. It is too obvious for controversy that they interfere equally with the power to regulate commerce. The power to authorize the manufacture of an article must necessarily imply, as does the right to import, the right to sell. I am therefore of opinion, that the law of Ontario in prohibiting the sale of beer, unless the party complies with its exactions, comes in conflict with the 122nd section giving to the Federal Government the power over excise.\nNow, the tax imposed by the Act in question, it is true, is only $50, but it might as well have been $500. If the Legislature have the right to impose this tax, the power must be plenary, and would be exercised according to their judgment and whenever the necessity of increasing the revenue arose. Already, since assuming this jurisdiction, the Legislature has increased the tax from $50 to $150, and if the power exists nothing could prevent them from fixing the amount so high as to virtually render impossible the collection of the excise duties on this article.\nMoreover, if this law relating to brewers and distillers is legal and constitutional, there can be no doubt that a law could be passed reaching the manufacturer of tobacco, of coal oil, of vinegar, in fact of all articles subject to excise. The Local Government could even go further, and under the shape of a license reach the importer in the same manner as the brewer.\nIf there was concurrent jurisdiction, what would happen when the collector on the part of the Federal Government would come to seize for arrears of taxes? Let us suppose that the collector of the Local Government has anticipated him, and for duties which were owing to his Government had seized and closed the brewery. He is the first on the spot, and, if he exercises a legitimate power belonging to his Government, he has the right to forbid the Federal Officer to come within the brewery. This latter officer, however, in virtue of the Dominion Statute has the most plenary powers; at all times he has access to the brewery. A conflict, of authorities would necessarily take place; which authority should yield? For my part, not believing in the legal possibility of such a conflict, I need not seek for the means of avoiding it.\nBut the learned Counsel of Her Majesty, whose argument, should it prevail, would inevitably bring about this conflict, believe, that with the aid of the right of veto which belongs to the Federal Government, all interests might be conciliated, and the above inconvenient results avoided. The difficulty, they say, would be easily settled. The constitution, by giving the right of vetoing Provincial Legislation, has prudently given the means, if not to prevent, at least to put a stop to such conflicts of authorities. Such a law would be directly opposed to the interests of the Federal Government, and they would be justified in disallowing it by exercising their right of veto.\nNo doubt this extraordinary prerogative exists, and could even be applied to a law over which the Provincial Legislature had complete jurisdiction. But it is precisely on account of its extraordinary and exceptional character that the exercise of this prerogative will always be a delicate matter. It will always be very difficult for the Federal Government to substitute its opinion instead of that of the Legislative Assemblies in regard to matters within their province, without exposing themselves to be reproached with threatening the independence of the Provinces.\nWhat would be the result if the Province chose to re-enact a law which had been disallowed? The cure might be worse than the disease, and probably grave complications would follow. It cannot, therefore, be argued, that because this right exists we must adopt an interpretation which would lead to the necessity of having recourse to it.\nBefore concluding my remarks, I wish to add a few words with regard to three of the principal points of argument relied on by the learned counsel for Her Majesty in support of the validity of this law. They contend they can justify the law, 1st, by the inherent constitutional power which the Local Legislatures, they say, possess to make laws for the general welfare of the people of the Province; and that, to give effect to their purport, they have the power to prohibit the sale of spirituous liquors and of such other articles as might be considered injurious; that is to say, that in order to exercise this power, they have jurisdiction over this matter; 2nd, by paragraph 13, section 92, relating to property and civil rights in the Province; 3rd, by paragraph 16 of the same section, giving them jurisdiction generally over all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province.\nIn my above observations on the division of the legislative powers, I believe I have answered the argument of that plenary power, plenum imperium, which the learned counsel contend the Local Governments possess. I will only add, that while there can be no question of their exercising the police powers, the license imposed by this law is evidently exacted for the purpose of raising a revenue. In support of the view I take with regard to the nature of this license, I will cite Cooley on Constitutional Limitations[94]:\nLicense laws are of two kinds: those which require the payment of a license fee by way of raising a revenue, and are, therefore, the exercise of the power of taxation; and those which are mere police regulations, and which require the payment only of such license fee as will cover the expenses of the license and of enforcing the regulation. Nor can the fact that the Local Government has the power over property and civil rights be relied on. The passage I have quoted above from Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in reference to the State power over property and civil rights is such a complete answer to this point that I need but refer to it.\nAs to the third point, that it affects a matter purely local and private in the Province, I think I have also proved that this argument cannot apply in this case. The license imposed by this law is of a nature to affect all the Provinces, and it amounts in reality to an exercise of the power of regulating commerce.\nFor these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the law under consideration is ultra vires. These reasons can be summed up as follows:\u2014\n1st. The law in question is void because it comes in conflict with the power of the Federal Parliament to regulate trade and commerce under paragraph 2, sec 91.\n2nd. Because the terms \"and other licenses,\" in paragraph 9, sec. 92, are limited by the interpretation to be given to paragraph 2 of sec. 91. In order to conciliate these two provisions, the words \"other licenses\" must be read as if they were followed by these words: \"not incompatible with the power of regulating trade and commerce.\"\n3rd. Because the tax imposed by this Act is an indirect tax which the Local Government has no right to impose.\n4th. Because it comes in direct conflict with the 31st Vic. chap. 8 relating to excise.\nHENRY, J.\nThe information in this case charges the Appellant with a breach of the Act of Ontario, 37th Vic., chap. 32, for having sold by wholesale a large quantity of fermented, liquors which he had manufactured, he (the Appellant) then being a brewer licensed by the Government of Canada for the manufacture of fermented, spirituous and other liquors. To this information the Appellant demurred, and assigned as one of the grounds of demurrer that the Legislature of Ontario had no power to restrict by an Act the sale of such liquors; or to impose a penalty for a breach of the restrictive provisions of the Act by a brewer duly licensed by the Government of Canada. This ground of demurrer was fully argued before us, and we, having fully considered it in all its bearings and consequences, have now to give judgment upon it.\nThe constitutionality of the Act of Canada, 31st Vic. chap. 8, under which the Appellant was licensed, is admitted, and it is therefore necessary only to consider whether, in view of that Act, the Legislature of Ontario had power to pass an Act requiring a brewer, holding a license under the first mentioned Act, to take out another license, and pay an additional fee, or, in the event of his not doing so, to subject him to penalties, to such an extent even as might effectually render practically useless his license from the Dominion Government. The Ontario Act in question, sec. 24, provides:\nNo person shall sell by wholesale or retail any spirituous, fermented or other manufactured liquors within the Province of Ontario, without having first obtained a license under this Act authorizing him to do so, &c.\nSec. 25:\nNo person shall keep or have in any house, building, shop, eating-house, saloon, or house of public entertainment, or in any room or place whatsoever, any spirituous, fermented or other manufactured liquors for the purpose of selling, bartering or trading therein, unless duly licensed thereto under the provisions of this Act.\nSec. 26 recognizes the validity of the licenses granted by the Government of Canada, and provides that sections 24 and 25 shall not prevent any brewer, distiller or other person so licensed\nFrom keeping, having, or selling, any liquor manufactured by him, in any building wherein such manufacture is carried on, &c. * * * Provided that any such brewer, distiller, or other person, is further required to first obtain a license to sell by wholesale under this Act the liquor so manufactured by him when sold for consumption within this Province, &c.\nSec. 22 fixes the wholesale license fee at fifty dollars for Provincial purposes.\nBy sec. 4, \"wholesale\" is defined to be over five gallons, or 1 dozen bottles of three half pints, or two dozen of three-fourths of a pint each.\nThis Act came into operation on the 24th of March, 1874.\nUnder the Dominion Act, 31 Vic. chap. 8, before mentioned, the licenses expired on the thirtieth of June in each year, and those granted after the thirtieth of June, 1873, were current when the Ontario Act came into operation. Up to the passing of the latter Act a brewer had, by the effect of his license from the Dominion Government, the right, not only to keep and have for sale, but to sell fermented liquors by wholesale. By the latter Act he is not only prohibited from selling but from keeping or having. Does not that Act, therefore, virtually repeal, if effect be given to it, the Dominion Act in both respects, unless, indeed, the brewer should comply with its exactions? What, in the case of his refusal to accept further conditions to his compact with the Dominion Government, would become of his manufactured stock on hand? The selling and keeping, or having on hand for sale, or for consumption, in Ontario, was prohibited, and his keeping or having it legally, after the passing of the Act, is made contingent on his taking out a license under it. He had legally accumulated a large stock which, by the Ontario Act, he is forbidden either to keep or sell in pursuance of his rights under the license from the Dominion Government. It may be said the extra tax was a light one. No matter how light, it was in contravention of the rights he had acquired; and if the power to change the existing relations be at all admitted, the extent of the change cannot be questioned; for that is a question of expediency and parliamentary discretion, which no Court could control or interfere with; and the same power which levied a contribution to the extent of fifty dollars might raise it so high as to break up the manufacture altogether, and thus indirectly render nugatory the Dominion Act and deprive the Government of the revenue it would otherwise receive; and, consequently, as I take it, restrict the effect of the Imperial Act, section 91, sub-sections 2 and 3, which give to the Dominion Parliament the exclusive right of legislation in regard to \"the regulation of trade and commerce\" and \"the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation.\"\nIf, indeed, it were contended that the Dominion Act was ultra vires, and that the right to provide for the licenses in question was one wholly with the Local Legislature, I could appreciate the contention to some extent; but when the constitutionality of that Act is admitted, I must have better reasons than I have yet heard to induce me to conclude that the Imperial Parliament intended that both Legislatures should have power to deal with the same subject. Under the two sub-sections just quoted, and the Dominion Act, the power of the Dominion Government to grant the licenses in question must be admitted, and even if the right of the Local Legislature should have strong reasons to sustain it (which, however, I cannot see), but which, nevertheless, leave it a matter of doubt and speculation, I feel that it is incumbent on us, for many good reasons, to resolve that doubt against that claim of right. Suppose every Local Legislature in the Dominion were thus to interfere with the proper results to be expected from Dominion legislation in regard to this subject (and if one can do so, why not all?), who can measure or estimate the extent to which \"trade and commerce\" might be affected and the revenues of the Dominion diminished; its power to raise \"money by any mode or system of taxation\" seriously curtailed, and the customs and excise laws of the Dominion, passed as provided by sec. 122 of the Imperial Act, interfered with and rendered nugatory. If the right to legislate as to licensee for brewing be admitted, why not as to licenses to manufacture tobacco and everything else?\nThe contention on the part of the Respondent is, that both Legislatures have power under the Imperial Act to legislate in regard to the matter before us. While all admit the legislative right of the Dominion Parliament, the power of the Local Legislature is denied. The claim for it has been urged on several grounds, one of which is, that direct taxation for Provincial purposes is given exclusively to the Local Legislatures, and that the license duty sought to be levied by the Act of Ontario is a direct tax. I must dissent from that proposition for reasons too well understood to require me to define what a direct tax is, or to show that the imposition in this case is clearly an indirect one.\nThe legislative power given to the Dominion Parliament is unlimited\nTo make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces,\nand we need not necessarily consider the provisions of sub-sections 2 and 3 of section 91. Everything in the shape of legislation for the peace, order and good government of Canada is embraced, except as before mentioned. But sub-section twenty-nine goes further and provides for exceptions and reservations in regard to matters otherwise included in the power of legislation given to the Local Legislatures, and also provides that:\nAny matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\n\"The regulation of trade and commerce\" and \"the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation\" is, however, specially mentioned, and both include the right to make and have carried out all the provisions in the Dominion Act. This position has not been, and cannot be, successfully assailed. The subjects in all their details of which trade and commerce are composed, and the regulation of them, and the raising of revenue by indirect taxation, must, therefore, be matters referred to and included in the latter clause of sub-section 29, before mentioned, and if so,\nShall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nEvery constituent, therefore, of trade and commerce, and the subject of indirect taxation, is thus, as I submit, withdrawn from the consideration of the Local Legislatures, even if it should otherwise be apparently included. The Imperial Act fences in those twenty-eight subjects wholesale and in detail, and the Local Legislatures were intended to be, and are, kept out of the inclosure, and when authorized to deal with the subject of \"direct taxation within the Province,\" as in sub-section 2 of section 92, and \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licenses,\" they are commanded, by the concluding clause of sub-section 29, sec. 91, not to interfere by measures for what they may call \"direct taxation,\" or in regard at least to \"other licenses,\" or in reference to \"municipal institutions,\" with the prerogatives of the Dominion Parliament as to the \"regulation of trade and commerce,\" including \"Customs and Excise laws\" and \"the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation.\" I have already shown, that the exercise of the power contended for by the Legislature of Ontario is incompatible with the full exercise of that of the Dominion Parliament, and might be used to its total destruction. The object of the Imperial Act was clearly to give plenary powers of legislation to the Dominion Parliament with the exceptions before stated, and just as clearly to restrict local legislation so as to prevent any conflict with that of the former in regard to the subjects with which it was given power to deal.\nThe \"excise laws\" of the Dominion must be affected by an additional license fee being exacted by the Local Government. The \"excise\" revenues belong solely to the Dominion Government. The Dominion Parliament having imposed a license fee of $50 on a brewer of fermented liquors, might, at an early future, desire to impose, for revenue, a higher fee. It has the acknowledged right to do so; but, in the meantime, the Local Legislature has fully weighted the enterprise of brewing; and the result becomes, therefore, a transfer from the sources of Dominion revenue to the coffers of the Local Government. Who can say, then, that there is not an attempt to collect Provincial revenue from a source clearly appertaining to the Dominion?\nBut we are asked to hold that, under sub-section 9, \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses\" will include licenses to brewers, in the position occupied by the Appellant, to sell by wholesale. Such an application can only be made by virtue of the concluding words: \"and other licenses.\" The extent and limit to be given to those words have not been stated or referred to; but some must exist to their application. If applicable to brewers' and distillers' licenses, which, at the date of the Imperial Act, were completely out of reach of any municipal control, why not extend them to other traders? If uncontrolled, a Local Legislature might organize a system of licenses, and indirectly, not only tax, but regulate and restrict certain industries, trades and callings, or might, indeed, virtually prohibit and destroy them. We must reasonably conclude the Legislature meant to restrict the power at some point, and we must determine where that restriction should be imposed, not only from the words of the sub-section in question, but from the tenor and bearing of the whole Act, the state of the law at the time, the peculiar position of the United Provinces and the object of their union, with the means for working out the Constitution provided.\nTaking the words themselves, what is the law as to the construction of them? From a review of all the cases cited, and others, I am forced to conclude that the words \"and other licenses\" must be restricted. We find them preceded by the words \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer,\" and I cannot decide that brewers or distillers are ejusdem generis with them or any of them. That they should be, to include the right of legislation claimed, taking the whole of the Imperial Act together, is a position too clearly established to be doubted. In Reed v. Ingham[95] the law is clearly stated by Lord Campbell, C.J.; and also in East London Water Works Co. v. Trustees for Mile End Old Town[96]. In the latter case the word \"tenements\" had to receive a construction. Referring to it, Lord Campbell said \"tenements\" must be understood according to the antecedent enumeration and as comprising only matters ejusdem generis. That rule of construction was followed in Rex v. The Manchester and Salford Waterworks Company[97], which is admitted to have been well decided. Coleridge, Justice, in the same case says:\nIf the Appellants are liable it is because they occupy a tenement which is ratable. It is admitted that the word cannot have its full meaning in either place where it occurs in the section 30. In the first, it clearly means something inhabited or belonging to a dwelling. In the second, where it is admitted that some restraint must be put upon the construction of the word, the rule attaches, that a general word following specific ones must be taken to mean something of the same kind.\nA similar construction was put upon general words in Sandeman v. Breach[98]. The 29 Car. 2, chap. 7, provided that\nNo tradesman, artificer, workman, labourer, or other person or persons should work at their ordinary calling on the Lord's day.\nPer Lord Tenterden:\nIt was contended that under the words \"other person or persons\" the drivers of stage coaches are included. But where general words follow particular ones the rule is to construe them as applicable to persons ejusdem generis.\nWe think the words \"other person or persons\" cannot have been used in a sense large enough to include the owner and driver of a stage-coach.\nI feel bound, therefore, on principle, and as the result of all the cases, to construe the words in question as controlled by the other portions of the Act, and, therefore, not to include power to the Legislature of Ontario to legislate for licenses to brewers or distillers to sell by wholesale. I will not, however, say, that where the terms used are exhaustive of the particular class or subject named, we are bound to apply the principle of construction just stated; and it may possibly be argued that such is here the case in respect of the words preceding \"and other licenses.\" In such a case, where there are no controling conditions, the words might be sufficient to give the right claimed for the Local Legislature; but when considering the objects and purview of the whole Act and the mode provided for effecting them, I can come to no other conclusion than one founded upon the duty I feel incumbent upon me, of reading the whole Act together, and therein and thereby, and not from the technical reading of a few words in a sub-section, however otherwise important, seek for the intention and meaning of the Legislature. By this mode the Act is made to harmonize in all its parts, and the feasibility of working it out is established. By the other construction, and not in my view the proper one, the evident intention of the Legislature is frustrated, and the legislation itself made absurd and inconsistent, and the working out of the details made most difficult, and, it may be found, totally impossible. I am of opinion, for these reasons, that the Act of Ontario in question was ultra vires, and that the appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment entered for the Appellant.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellant: Bethune, Osier & Moss.\nSolicitors for Respondents: Mowat, Maclennan & Downey.\n[1] 36 U.
